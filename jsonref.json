It\u0027s a dream come true to continue Winnie\u0027s legacy. \u0027It\u0027s funny, because Minnie Winnie was cloned, the pups are closer to being Winnie\u0027s sons than her grandsons.

Rivers have dried up, people have lost their lives searching for water and thousands of animals have perished  In a desperate bid to provide their families and animals with water, the Turkana tribe are digging dangerous 12-feet holes. Thirsty camels and goats take it in turns to be supplied with water by their owners who depend on the animals for everything, including food and help transporting their manyatta huts          A young girl, wearing traditional  neck beads and showing signs of malnutrition, carries a plastic yellow water carton above her head as she walks across the parched land           Siblings use their donkeys and a handwoven basket to carry their water bottles across the barren landscape to a deep water hole dug by the village\u0027s women in Labei, located around 50 miles southeast of a flowing river in the town of LodwarAmber Rudd: \u0027Anything could happen\u0027 if Commons vote Brexit deal downSchumacher on his titles and rivals in newly released interviewPiers Morgan sparks terror in the GMB studio with Mary the spiderMeghan Markle cooks with Grenfell survivors at Community Hub KitchenDele Alli and Ross Barkley allegedly complain over \u002714 grand bill\u0027Bag owner is stopped by police after thief was shot deadJohn Barrowman takes a e as he attempts a bush-tucker trialSpain may vote down Brexit deal if Gibraltar plans don\u0027t changeJacob Rees-Mogg at European Research Group press conferenceWoman drops a baby on its head while running from policeHere women, including those that are pregnant, walk around 12 miles each day in an unimaginable quest to find water in one of the driest places on earth. If successful, they carry 20-litre cartons atop of their heads back to their children, husbands and animals. A family has an average of 10 children.In the village of Labei, we encountered young women, adorned with beautiful colourful neck beads and their trademark mohawk-style haircut, carry out the exhausting work of lifting water up to the surface from a 12-foot hole they had dug with their hands and a small spade.They estimated the newly formed waterhole, named Sasak Echoke, contained enough brown liquid to last them just a few days.At the top of the hole, men and children poured buckets of the pungent water into makeshift troughs for the camels, goats and donkeys to drink from. These animals are the nomadic tribe\u0027s livelihood. In their polygamous society, camels are used as dowry when a man wants to make a woman his wife. Men take as many wives as they can afford and girls are believed to be ready for marriage as soon as they hit puberty, despite Kenyan law stating both men and women must be 18 before they can wed.  A mother-of-eight named Nakunyuko Lomaritoi told how she had recently lost her daughter (right) for two days while she was out searching for water. Thankfully she was found alive            A woman was recently killed when one of the pits collapsed on her and her body remains buried at the site          The woman scooped brown dirty water from the hole which locals estimated would last them just a few more days. Conflicts have broken out between different villages fighting for water            The Turkana tribe, which is the second largest pastoralist community in Kenya after the Maasais, live in one of the harshest and most inhospitable places on EarthMeanwhile, goats - and their blood - are a main food source for the tribe. The animals can also be sold for weapons, which are now much needed to protect the tribe from livestock raids by other groups. Men in the village, which is more than 50 miles southeast of a flowing river in the town of Lodwar,  are having to trek as far as the Ugandan border to graze their animals and conflicts have occurred.We spoke to a mother-of-eight named Nakunyuko Lomaritoi, with the help of the local government chief Simon Moya acting as a translator, who told us how she had recently lost her daughter for two days while she was out searching for water.\u0027I have 46 donkeys and drive them for three miles to get water,\u0027 she explained. Remarkably in this arid landscape, the child was found alive and the pair were reunited.Another family\u0027s story had no such happy ending. One father told us how his son died when they were out grazing their goats away from home and ran out of water.          Turkana women all wear similar hairstyles and only shave their head completely when their husband dies. They adorn themselves with colourful beads  made from glass, seeds, cowry shells or iron and don\u0027t remove their necklaces unless they are ill or mourning a relative. Married women will also wear a plain metal ring around the neck, acting as a wedding ring          Camels are one of only three types of animals that have survived the drought. All the tribe\u0027s sheep have died. Boys and men are in charge of herding the livestock and taking them to graze, a job that in this climate can take days to complete            Children in the community are involved in collecting water which means they don’t get any schooling          Young boys involved in caring for animals are seen holding canes as they take their livestock to graze and find water           The village dug their water hole in the area after noticing this thriving tree, which indicated to them that there was water underground          Donkey parents and their babies catch some shade away from the midday sun. Temperatures in this part of Turkana in November often reach 36 degrees           Turkana people are polygamous, meaning men often have more than one wife. Camels are used  as a dowry, with some brides being \u0027sold\u0027 for as many as 200 of the animals           Hardy goats survive despite the desolate landscape. Locals cook them, drink their blood and sell them for weapons          Women in Labei described the extreme difficulties they are facing as they try to find water for their children. They are forced to leave them alone from sunrise to sunset as they go out searching. The children appeared malnourished and lethargic           Mothers carry 20 litre cartons of water atop of their heads and children have invented ways to help out by kicking and rolling bottles           While driving through bone-rattling desert, we found a group of men starting to dig a new hole with a small spade. Turkana men carry small seats carved out of wood which double up as pillows when they sleepIncidents of male suicides have also been reported, along with thousands of animal deaths. Many of the tribe are unaware of the concept of climate change and still believe that there is a curse and a sacrifice is needed to cure the drought.During MailOnline\u0027s meeting with this community, we saw the striking effect dehydration was having on the tribe\u0027s children. They appeared listless and laid under the tree in the shade, too lethargic to even swat away flies.\u0027Children have cooked blood from camels and goats for their daily meal,\u0027 Chief Simon said. \u0027Morning to sunset people are fighting for water,\u0027 he added.The current average life expectancy in the region is around 50 years old.In stark contrast to the desperate scenes in Labei, the following day we visited a project that has offered hope to some Turkana people as the rains show no sign of returning.British charity the Society for the Protection of Animals Abroad (SPANA), which helps working animals around the world and the communities that rely on them, have stepped in to help by providing a £45,000 solar-powered borehole.Located a bone-rattling two and a half hour drive from the small town of Lodwar, the community fortunate enough to receive the lifeline are rarely visited by aid groups because of their extremely remote location.          Overjoyed tribeswomen greeted us with dancing and singing as we arrived at a new solar-powered borehole paid for by British charity the Society for the Protection of Animals Abroad (SPANA) and implemented by their local partner Practical ActionAmber Rudd: \u0027Anything could happen\u0027 if Commons vote Brexit deal downSchumacher on his titles and rivals in newly released interviewPiers Morgan sparks terror in the GMB studio with Mary the spiderMeghan Markle cooks with Grenfell survivors at Community Hub KitchenDele Alli and Ross Barkley allegedly complain over \u002714 grand bill\u0027Bag owner is stopped by police after thief was shot deadJohn Barrowman takes a e as he attempts a bush-tucker trialSpain may vote down Brexit deal if Gibraltar plans don\u0027t changeJacob Rees-Mogg at European Research Group press conferenceWoman drops a baby on its head while running from police    These women now live close to their borehole and no longer have to spend all day going to find water. \u0027We are so happy with the donors who thought of our suffering. Thank you, thank you,\u0027 one mother said           The tribe live in small dwellings called manyattas made from palm leaves, wood, and animal skins. Mothers and their children live in a separate hut to the husband, who sleeps in his own one which is suitable for conjugal visits          A married woman rests inside her manyatta with a small relative, surrounded by tradition animal skin water carriers            A young girl carries a baby and a tub of water away from the borehole as goats and camels take their turn to drink The 110-metre borehole is deep enough to reach the water table and is providing fresh, clean water for 4,200 people and 9,000 animals. This is thousands more than first estimated.As we pulled up to the borehole, women surrounded our cars dancing, singing and ululating in a loud and colourful welcome. Inquisitive children stared, pointed at our cameras and giggled as we showed them their photos. Even the men, holding their traditional canes and the small wooden stools they use as seats and pillows, broke out into a performance of thanks.\u0027This water has improved their lives,\u0027 said Chief Simon. \u0027The kids used to stay here alone along the dry river until the evening when their mothers came back with water - now they can stay together,\u0027 he explained.The women dressed in colourful robes, including married ladies marked out by the silver rings around their necks, described how they can now wash again and take pride in their appearance.The tribe sleep in huts, called manyattas, made from leaves and adorned with animal hides. Women reside in a hut with their children, while a husband has his own hut for women to visit him.          Camels formed an orderly line to drink from their new trough. Water is pumped from the solar-powered borehole into troughs for animals - big and small - after just two hours of bright sunshine. \u0027The effect of this project is quite clear, it’s absolutely amazing,\u0027 said SPANA Chief Executive Geoffrey Dennis          Children living in the village by the borehole were brimming with energy.  Some of them may now be able to attend school and there are hopes to build a medical centre nearby          Community chief Simon Moya (pictured, rear) said: \u0027This water has improved their lives. The kids used to stay here alone along the dry river until the evening when their mothers came back with water - now they can stay together\u0027  The £45,000 solar-powered borehole was sponsored by SPANA and built with the help of Practical Action. Pictured left: Practical Action regional director Farida Bulhan-Aliwa and SPANA chief executive Geoffrey Dennis check out the taps that are now providing clean drinking water for 4,200 people. Pictured right: Turkana woman Awesit Naukay who is on the water committee           Women arrive with their  containers to gather clean water from the new borehole. The solar-powered technology provides water from 110 metres underground One mother sparked laughter among the whole group as she told us: \u0027Men used to be tired when they came home without water but now the family unit is happier… husbands used to disappear but now they come home.\u0027A water committee, made up of five local men and four women, has been formed to manage the borehole and they have agreed to a yearly fee of 500 Kenyan shillings (£3.80) per household to maintain it. The solar-powered technology is not just environmentally sustainable but also low maintenance.One woman on the committee, Awesit Naukay, said: \u0027Now we share water with our neighbours when we used to fight with them, they used to raid our livestock and take them away.\u0027Young boys and girls are now healthy and none have died since we got water. We are so happy with the donors who thought of our suffering. Thank you, thank you.\u0027\u0027We are going to bring a school and health facility here because of this water,\u0027 added Chief Simon.Not only are the people healthier but the tribe\u0027s animals are also thriving and wild fruits have begun to grow once more. One village elder said he hopes to start rearing sheep again after they all died in the drought.Because the tribe\u0027s basic need for water has now been met thanks to the borehole, the women are starting to think of business ideas and options for sending their children to school.          Mother-of-six Atir Acheme summed up the mood of the village as she told us: \u0027I\u0027m happy because no one is thirsty here, even our livestock. Our children are lively and playing. We have no problems like before\u0027          Atir Acheme is part of a  water committee formed by the tribe to manage the running of the borehole. They have agreed to a yearly fee of 500 Kenyan shillings (£3.80) per household to maintain it          Smiling children listened in as their parents described how the borehole has changed their lives and given them hope for the future Chief Executive of SPANA, Geoffrey Dennis, who travelled with MailOnline to visit the project, said: \u0027We need to think about the long-term because clearly, this  is so successful that you\u0027re actually getting different villages coming into this area for water. \u0027In time we may need to think about other similar projects in surrounding areas because it\u0027s going to attract many people. There have been conflicts in the past and we need to be aware that this could happen in the future.\u0027SPANA receives no government funding but Mr Dennis believes the UK government \u0027should do more\u0027.\u0027If this area continues with very few rains for the next few years, which it probably will, there will be a lot of people who start drifting towards Nairobi and people will think let\u0027s move to Europe or wherever, so I very strongly encourage people to support people in the communities and keep them there.\u0027\u0027I hope we can have more projects similar to this, the people are amazing they are really friendly people, I have high hopes that we will develop happy communities that actually have a good livelihood and that\u0027s exactly what we saw here,\u0027 he added.One striking mother-of-six, named Atir Acheme, summed up the mood of the village as she told us: \u0027I\u0027m happy because no one is thirsty here, even our livestock.\u0027Our children are lively and playing. We have no problems like before.\u0027Pointing to her beautiful patterned blue dress, she added: \u0027I used to not dress like this, look at me now.\u0027  The villages are located around 50 miles southeast of Lodwar.

A lower score showed they were not in danger.The nine questions were: In the past 12 months:How often have you found yourself thinking about gambling or planning to gamble? (2.3 per cent in the survey said they had)How often have you gambled to help you escape from problems or when you were feeling bad? (2.1 per cent)Have you felt bad or fed up when trying to cut down on gambling? (1.8 per cent)Have you needed to gamble with more and more money to get the amount of excitement you want? (2 per cent)Have you ever spent much more than you planned to spend on gambling? (1.2 per cent)Have you ever taken money without permission to spend on gambling? (3.9 per cent)Has your gambling ever led to arguments with family or friends, or you missing school? (2.7 per cent)Have you ever told lies because of gambling? (2.4 per cent)After losing money by gambling, have you returned another day to try to win back the money you lost? (1.9 per cent)                         The report was based on an Ipsos Mori study of 2,865 11 to 16-year-olds between February and July 2018. They were assessed as either a ‘problem’ or an ‘at risk’ gambler on the basis of questions about their behaviour.These included how often they thought about gambling, if they had stolen to fund stakes or if betting had ever led them to lie to their parents.It found the most common route into gambling were fruit machines in pubs or arcades and cash bets with friends.Some children admitted using betting shops or online gambling sites, both of which are illegal for under-18s.The study revealed that one in seven boys followed betting brands on social media sites including Facebook and Instagram. It concluded there were 55,000 problem child gamblers – 1.7 per cent of children aged 11 to 16. This was 42,000 more than in 2016.The 70,000 at risk of addiction represent 2.2 per cent of the age group.Last week three families, whose sons killed themselves after becoming addicted to gambling, said their children had started aged 17 or under on Fixed Odds Betting Terminals or fruit machines.Liz Ritchie’s son Jack took his own life aged 24 after gambling with his school dinner money. She said: ‘We need tougher enforcement to restrict children’s access to gambling, a ban on advertising that has normalised gambling in children’s minds and a clear public health warning that includes the high suicide risk of gambling.’Clive Hawkswood, chief executive of the Remote Gambling Association, which represents some of the major betting firms, said: ‘There are still far too many children gambling. We’ve all got to do more to push that number down.‘We would say that the number who are problem gamblers is unacceptable, but a lot of it is outside of our control.‘On the advertising, the link between children gambling and advertising isn’t clear-cut but we are mindful that there are genuine concerns.‘Hopefully the review process we’re in at the moment will resolve that.’The association, which includes Bet365, Ladbrokes, Paddy Power and William Hill, reportedly met yesterday to discuss a complete ban on pre-watershed advertising.Last week ministers made a U-turn over their decision to delay the implementation of a £2 maximum stake on FOBTs after a campaign by the Daily Mail.Loot boxes in computer games are used to redeem bonuses such as weapons and costumes – and it is feared the element of chance mirrors gambling.  We must ALL act to protect kids By Tim Miller, Executive Director of the Gambling CommissionThere\u0027s no doubt that today’s figures on children and gambling should make people sit up and listen.But while discussions about children gambling might conjure up images of kids sneaking into bookies or sitting alone on their iPads gambling on an online casino, our latest research paints a more complex picture.The most common activities that children gamble on are not licensed casinos, bingo providers or bookies. Instead we found children preferred to gamble in informal environments, out of sight of regulation – private bets between friends or playing cards with their mates for money.We also found them gambling in places where parents might be expected to be present – scratch cards in supermarkets or fruit machines in pubs. Just in the last week we found that nearly 90 per cent of pubs tested failed to prevent children from gambling on fruit machines. These may not be gambling businesses but nevertheless have a duty to protect young people because we know that no form of gambling is risk free.Of course, none of this will ert us from our core duty to protect children from the types of gambling offered by companies we regulate. We continue to take action when children are not properly protected by gambling companies and keep raising the standards of protections in place.Earlier this year we set proposals to strengthen age verification for online gambling sites, including putting free-to-play games behind an age check.In October we introduced new rules which mean we can directly take action, including imposing fines, against gambling businesses that break advertising rules (such as advertising that appeals to children or glamourises gambling).But our actions alone won’t stop children being exposed to gambling-style activities in video games or in the app store. They won’t protect the child who has been given access by a parent to their online gambling account. They won’t prevent the playground or the bedroom from becoming a poker den.Protecting children from harm requires a joined-up approach: a strong, effective regulator, parents and teachers who understand and talk about the risks that can come from gambling, businesses, both in the gambling industry and outside, that act responsibly.It is by working hand in hand that we can help to keep our kids safe."},{"url":null,"title":"Help pet hedgehog hooked chicken nuggets","story":"    Freddie the African Pygmy hedgehog (pictured) refuses to eat anything but chicken nuggets    Ellie acquired Freddie when a friend who owned him moved abroad, and says she and boyfriend Will Saunders fell in love with him instantly As Ellie, who works in retail, says: ‘Everything revolves around Freddie.’King Freddie is one of the ‘stars’ of a Channel 4 series called Embarrassing Pets, which serves up an astonishing array of problem animals — and (whisper it!) their equally challenged owners.Britain may be a pet-loving nation, but this show suggests we’ve let the creatures take over. The amount we spend on pampered pets is rising, up to £7 billion a year.‘Pet owners are increasingly treating their cats, dogs and even small mammals like members of their family,’ says a spokesman for market research firm Euromonitor.He puts it down to single people becoming increasingly lonely and couples delaying marriage and children so that pets are often the choice for their love and affection.The scale of this TV series — which involves a team of vets and animal behaviour experts to advise on issues — highlights how loopy we all are about our pets. It runs over four weeks, with episodes airing on a daily basis — starring 60 problem pets.Not surprisingly, dogs feature heavily. There are dogs with halitosis, dogs who like to rip up carpets, dogs who steal underwear, and a particularly poignant tale of a dog with an obsessive licking habit.          King Freddie is one of the ‘stars’ of a Channel 4 series called Embarrassing Pets, which serves up an astonishing array of problem animalsTitch is a Jack Russell and Yorkie cross who leaves every surface covered in drool. When they bring in the experts, however, a poignant story emerges. His owner recently died and his obsessive behaviour is put down to extreme grief. Sob.It’s the more unusual animals that leave viewers scratching their heads, though.So we meet a tortoise called Dandelion with a habit of attacking people’s feet (it can move astonishingly quickly, for a tortoise), a sheep called Shaun who seems a tad psychotic, and an army of birds who have turned their homes into no-go zones.The series features not one but two hedgehogs. The owner of the first is concerned because he has been pulling out his own spines. Can a hedgehog self-harm? Possibly, but the vet believes it’s more likely caused by tiny mites.\u0027One in a million\u0027 photograph captures 60,000 swooping...The SECRET desert Tommies: Unseen images reveal for the...Share this articleEllie took Freddie along because she was at ‘the end of my tether’ with his eating.‘One of his big treats used to be those little Dreamies cat biscuits, with the soft insides, but the more he wanted the chicken nuggets, the more he rejected even these. We were worried that there was actually something wrong with him, physically, that he couldn’t manage hard food.’The problem — and this is a recurring theme with this jaw-dropping series — was more that Freddie had started to believe he was a human.Who can blame him, when it turns out Freddie also gets to watch TV and is spoiled with Christmas presents?Ellie acquired Freddie when a friend who owned him moved abroad, and says she and Will fell in love with him instantly.          Bird company: Angelica Hambis and her screeching cockatiel Rosie, who \u0027has an attitude problem\u0027‘He’s our baby,’ she says solemnly. ‘He knows I’m his mum and Will is his dad.’Freddie rules the household. ‘He’s a bit of a a,’ confirms Ellie. His cage sits in the living room, and every night (he’s nocturnal, so tends to get up about 10.30pm) he is allowed out to scurry around the sofa.‘He likes to hide behind the cushions,’ says Ellie.One is his cushion, to be fair. ‘It was his Christmas present. It’s got his face on it.’In his two-level cage, he has his own duvet and a hamster wheel on a mezzanine level. Needless to say, the experts have their work cut out with Freddie — and Ellie and Will. First stop is convincing them hedgehogs don’t necessarily see McDonald’s as a treat.‘It’s a common problem,’ says one of the show’s behavioural experts, Caroline Clark. ‘I’ve never come across a hedgehog liking chicken nuggets before, but owners can get into habits that aren’t necessarily in their pet’s long-term interest.‘The key is getting them to understand how the animal would behave in the wild.’Juliette Stevens, 50, attended the Embarrassing Pets clinic with her alpaca, Gus. Juliette has a herd at her Derbyshire farm, but Gus isn’t like the others.‘He thinks he’s human, always has,’ she confides. ‘It turns out his mother wasn’t able to feed him at birth and he was hand-reared. This means he actually thinks he’s a human. When I put him in the field with my other alpacas, he ignored them.’While Juliette is tempted to treat Gus as a human herself (‘he’s such an affectionate soul, when he’s in a good mood, that I can imagine letting him share my bedroom’), she’s also become concerned because of his bad behaviour.          Bannister vandalising parrot Rocco, who can open a beer can with his beak and eat food with a fork‘If he isn’t getting enough attention, he will attack,’ she says. ‘He will have a go at people — hissing and spitting at them. And alpaca spit isn’t just spit. They regurgitate the contents of their stomach and hurl it at people. It’s quite disgusting.’Gus does this to the neighbours. He’s also attacked other alpacas. ‘If he was a human, he’d be a human with an Asbo,’ Juliette says, quite cheerily, in the circumstances.In Winsford, Cheshire, we meet Charlie, who is billed — no pun intended — as the ultimate Diva Duck. Charlie came into the life of his besotted owner, Charlotte Collett, 13, when he was just an egg.‘Charlotte was at a sleepover on a farm, and the egg started to hatch — and there was Charlie peeking out at her,’ explains her mum, Carli, 43.‘She came home and said: “Mum, I’ve got a duckling. Can we keep it?” I said we could —for a few weeks — but as he got bigger, he was adorable, and so he stayed for good. He followed Charlotte around. He wouldn’t leave her side. He thought she was his mummy.’This is a recognised phenomenon, says Caroline Clark. ‘It’s called imprinting.’          In Winsford, Cheshire, we meet Charlie, who is billed — no pun intended — as the ultimate Diva Duck Carli admits: ‘We call him the most pampered duck in Cheshire. We built him his own pond. He doesn’t really get to come into the house — ducks have no bowel control, we learned that the hard way.’Alas, ducks have instincts, and Caroline quickly assesses that Charlie is frustrated. While his instincts are telling him to forage for food, and mate when he pleases, his environment isn’t allowing that. Solution number one is to throw away his food bowl.‘In the wild they expend a lot of energy looking for their own food,’ explains Caroline. ‘The first step was to try to establish a version of that.’ Cue his family having fun ‘throwing lettuce and spinach around’, as Carli puts it.What about Charlie’s aggressive behaviour? He had taken to attacking visitors and — mortifyingly — getting amorous with his teddy. The family are gently advised that by providing him with his toy when he was badly behaved, they were rewarding his behaviour, and compounding the problem.‘Aggression is usually a symptom of another problem, and quite often it’s about an animal being frustrated,’ says Caroline. She likens her job to ‘putting a jigsaw together’. Some puzzles are more difficult to fathom than others. Everyone is baffled by the case of lovable collie Mac. Until recently he was a dream dog for owner Claire Curran, 38 — one who loved his walks. Then one day, something happened.          Charlie came into the life of his besotted owner, Charlotte Collett, 13, when he was just an egg (pictured: Charlotte and mother Carli Short)‘We still don’t know what. Maybe we will never know. He disappeared one day and was missing for about an hour. Someone found him and rang my number, as it was on his collar. When we got him back he was a nervous wreck,’ says Claire.Overnight, Mac had gone from being a confident dog to a collie with the collywobbles.‘He wouldn’t stop shaking. We couldn’t get him into the car, and when we did, we couldn’t get him out again. He’d slink behind me. He didn’t even want to go out in the garden. It was as if he’d been spooked by something.’They never did find out what happened to Mac — and rebuilding his confidence is painstaking.So is treating Rosie the cockatiel, whose owner, Angelica Hambis, 19, is in despair. Trainee jockey Angelica, who lives in Enfield, is a natural with animals. But Rosie is a law unto herself. ‘She has an attitude problem. It’s a girl thing. She doesn’t want to do what she doesn’t want to do.’Rosie’s issues — ear-splitting shrieking, and a refusal to be handled — seem to stem from trauma, though. Angelica got Rosie via an advert on the Preloved website when she was one, and was horrified to see the conditions she lived in. ‘It was in the middle of winter. It was so cold and she didn’t even have a blanket over her cage.’She installed Rosie in her own living room, near the TV and by a fish tank, so she had plenty to look at. Rosie has trust issues, though.‘She has some sort of phobia of my hands,’ Angelica reveals. ‘Every time I put them near her, she bites, hisses at me and runs away to the back of her cage.’ Another bird behaving badly is Rocco the parrot, who lives in Urmston, Manchester, with owner Mike Long, 54, but clearly still thinks he’s in the rainforest.Rocco, five, is Mike’s constant companion, and even accompanies him to the pub. ‘He walks up and down the bar. He loves all the attention,’ says Mike.Rocco, who has his own Twitter account, can open a beer can with his beak and eat food with a fork. He also has quite a vocabulary, even if his language can be as colourful as his plumage (‘he watches a lot of football,’ says Mike). But his screeching and biting has driven the family mad.So far, Rocco’s main victim has been the bannisters in the family home, which have fallen foul of his talons. But as Caroline explains: ‘In the wild, parrots would strip the bark off trees. The nearest equivalent is, unfortunately, the bannisters.’A lot of Rocco’s bad behaviour, however, is put down to a more human trait — attention seeking. ‘We were told that by responding to his hysterics, we were encouraging him to screech more,’ says Mike. The solution? ‘When he plays up, we ignore him. It’s already starting to work.’As the owners in this series are fast discovering — it’s often their behaviour under the spotlight.The Embarrassing Pets series is available on ALL 4 on Channel 4."},{"url":null,"title":"Private schools diverse state schools","story":"     Leading headteachers have said that many private schools are more erse than their top state counterparts because they admit more poor pupilsWealthy parents are prepared to pay extra for properties next to top schools and, if necessary, pay for tuition to help their children pass entrance exams. Sue Hincks, the GSA’s president-elect for 2019 and head of Bolton School Girls’ Division, said: ‘In a school like ours which offers one in five bursaries, of which the majority are going to children on free school meals, we know we have a very socially erse population in front of us.‘Those children are selected on ability, but they also come because we are offering them a funded place, including a free school meal.Fake teacher who forged documents to hide his criminal...Parents are the biggest school cheats: As these mothers...Share this article‘That is a percentage that compares very favourably with what would be happening in local state grammar schools, where many of the children are there because they are able but they are also in the catchment area.‘And the catchment area has house prices which are such that you would have to have a relatively good income in order to be able to go to the school.’          Sally-Anne Huang, head of James Allen’s Girls’ School in South London, said 16 per cent of her pupils were on bursariesThe GSA said the same pattern was seen in a number of its schools.Sally-Anne Huang, head of James Allen’s Girls’ School in South London, said 16 per cent of her pupils were on bursaries. She added: ‘Fee-paying parents, who can easily afford our fees, will tell me that they’ve chosen us over other independent day schools in London because of that.‘They think it indicates the moral compass of the school and also they prefer for their daughters to be educated in a socially erse community.’ The heads were talking at the annual conference of the GSA in Marble Arch, central London, yesterday.The charitable status of private schools, which gives them generous tax breaks, is in the spotlight. The Government wants them to prove their worth as charitable institutions to keep the privilege.The GSA said its schools were already helping disadvantaged children, including partnering with state schools to share teachers and facilities.Figures from 192.com show that school catchment houses cost up to £70,000 more.Some parents even rent or buy a second property near their chosen school to ensure their child gets a place. "},{"url":null,"title":"More UK asylum seekers sent South East England","story":"    Sajid Javid took action after councils in the North threatened to pull out of the dispersal programme due to ‘mounting chaos’Only 120 authorities have stepped forward to rehome refugees, while 180 have taken none.The Government acted after Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, threatened earlier this month to refuse to take in any more asylum seekers. He said there was ‘mounting chaos’ in the Government’s dispersal system which was facing ‘catastrophic failure’.Michael Barrymore should only get ONE POUND damages rather...Father, 48, of dead baby girl found on a Gold Coast beach...Share this articleHe claimed it was unfair that, under the current system, the North West hosts 25 per cent of the national population of asylum applicants who require housing and support, with Greater Manchester housing 70 per cent of that number.  But in a letter to Mr Burnham, Mr Javid said he wanted to see more areas stepping up to the plate. He promised a ‘reduction in the proportion of dispersal’ to authorities that take large numbers, and a ‘commensurate increase’ for those that take lower numbers or none at all.

Sweden Democrats members celebrate with drinks and balloons after an improved vote share in the general election in SeptemberOne clear example of the rise in far-right populism in Europe is Sweden, for decades a bastion of social-democracy where the Sweden Democrats (SD) won 17.6 per cent of the vote in September\u0027s general election.The increased voter-share of the Sweden Democrats has brought political instability to the Scandinavian nation, which has been governed by coalitions since 2006.Two months after the elections, neither the right not the left have been able to form a coalition, as  all other seven parties try their best to keep the far-right out of government.The Sweden Democrats was formed in 1988 by a motley crew of ex-members of national-socialist and \u0027keep Sweden Swedish\u0027-organisations, and has been forced to expel several senior representatives caught up in racist scandals in recent years.But despite Nazi roots and evidence of deep-rooted racism, misogyny and anti-semitism in the party today, they have been on the ascent for over a decade.In the autumn of 2008, SD were polled at around four per cent, and in the 2010 general election they won their first seats in parliament with 5.7 per cent of the vote.The 2014 election result was a cold shower for the seven mainstream parties, as SD got nearly 13 per cent of the votes, equal to 49 MPs.Polls before the 2018 elections even suggested that SD would become the second biggest party with more than 20 per cent of votes, but even 17.6 per cent is a noticeable increase.Revealed: one in four Europeans vote populist | World news | The Guardian"},{"url":null,"title":"Fattest dog Britain Bopper Whopper bigger Hattie Fattie Plymouth dogs home","story":"Collie Bopper the Whopper (pictured left) has taken the title of Britain\u0027s fattest dog from Hattie the Fattie (pictured right before weight loss).

We think that a local school is covering the subject.” Broadhursts sold the book for 99p.The book, added Ball, was “originally stocked by Marie, our full-time children’s bookseller at the time”. Marie, now 84, still works at Broadhursts part-time.“We always had faith it would sell, as we do with all our books. We choose every book we stock inidually, rather than having random batches of stock sent to us,” said Ball. “Often books unsold within nine to 12 months are returned to the publisher, but some we keep for longer, either because they (or the subject) are personal favourites of ours, or because there are not many other titles on the subject available. We know that one day, someone will want that exact title, however long the wait.”Other British booksellers shared similar stories. Tamsin Rosewell of Kenilworth Books said that her shop had kept a copy of The Larger Moths of Warwickshire in stock for 10 years. “I was quite sad when someone bought it,” she said. Huddersfield children’s bookshop Lindley Books said that “we do a little dance when we sell a book like that”. And elsewhere, a staff member at San Francisco culinary bookshop Onmivore Books said that “whenever that happens here, I tell my customer that their book has been waiting for them a very long time”.Not all books find such happy endings: one bookseller recounted a less positive experience involving a copy of Piers Morgan’s autobiography that wouldn’t shift. “I worked there two different times in four years, and we never sold it, even when it was reduced to 1p! It’s probably still there,” wrote Twitter user @captainrobs. “It became shorthand for an impossible task ‘You’re more likely to sell that Piers Morgan book than…’”Joanne Ball said the overwhelming response to her tweet was a sign of the affection that people still have for bookshops, and books. “It isn’t often you see book-related stories going viral, which has been a great surprise – lots of book-lovers out there wanting to support it, too. We have had some great reactions from our local and regular customers, but the fact that people in the US and Australia now know about us, and have been talking about us, is just unbelievable,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a1f473e0fb6869cb4d4f2d96d2d94bf3992e82d/0_169_1080_648/master/1080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=03aef1738878f651b44d867ecc5a6bf2","title":"tips links and suggestions what are you reading this week","story":"Your space to discuss the books you are reading and what you think of themWelcome to this week’s blogpost. Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week:First up: ancient history. Thucydides’ History of the Peloponnesian War continues to delight paulburns:First read it at age 17. I’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve reread it after that. Its one of my favourite books. Just to mention a few magnificent highlights of great historical writing - The sea battle between the Corcyreans and Corinthians, 433 the plague in Athens, 430 the fighting at Megara, 424 the character sketch of the Spartan commander, Brasidias the rise and fall of Cleon the destruction of the Athenian Expedition in Sicily, 413 the oligarchic Coup and its overthrow in Athens.I can’t do a post on Thucydides and not mention his use of speeches. He gives recollections of speeches he has heard himself or pieces together a speech from accounts of those who were there at the time. Apart from the Melian dialogue, where he more or less expounds on his philosophy of history, he begins a tradition in classical historiography which is eventually much abused by speeches just being made up by some later writers. If you haven’t yet read Thucydides, put aside some time to do so. Its a reading experience you won’t forget.Another “non-fiction delight”, Babel (Around the World In 20 Languages) by Gaston Dorren, has occupied storm46:What an enjoyable read for a Languages nerd! The story of 20 Lingua Francas, sometimes their particular linguistic quirks (to other language speakers - not to the native speakers concerned of course), their social conventions, their rise to power and the reasons why they may have become a lingua franca, and just oodles of fascinating facts. The chapters, depending on the language under discussion, cover linguistics, history, politics, and the writing style is effortlessly readable and very funny.I particularly appreciated this quote from the sardonic chapter on Français, written in 1671: “Of all languages, French has the most natural and sleekest pronunciation. The Chinese and well-nigh all Asian peoples sing the Germans grumble the Spaniards holler the Italians sigh the English whistle. Only the French can properly be said to speak.”BerlinBirdie wants to “rave” about The Buddha in the Attic by Julie Otsuka:About Japanese brides travelling to the US in the 1920s to marry Japanese emigrants there, who’d mostly lied about their financial and social status, and sent photos of younger, better-looking men to tempt their brides. Rather like a dating app in fact. The book details the women’s experiences in a precise, moving way, not by following inidual stories but by depicting their varied but collective experiences - written in a first-person plural voice (“We were... Some of us found...”) and taking their lives stage by stage - the voyage, the arrival, the first night, babies, children, etc etc. A lot of their experience was hard as you might expect, yet the tone is never accusing or miserable. It’s clear, calm, delicate - almost poetic in fact. Brilliant.Completely brilliant, every last story. Every last word. There were stories from all across the spectrum, pre-war Colorado, antebellum slavery, Mexico in the days of Pancho Villa, hardscrabble Texas... They all seemed to rotate a common center of gravity, the struggle against unrealized potential for pre-Suffragge women. It still seems relevant in an age when women’s health choices are often dictated to them by the ovary-free.Me Talk Pretty One Day by David Sedaris has been the “right book at the right time” for LiteraryWanderings:This was my first foray into the world of David Sedaris and it won’t be my last. I found that the essays became stronger after the first third, but how much this was the writing or me becoming attuned to Sedaris I’m not sure. Laugh out loud funny in parts, this has been a perfect reading companion of late.Finally, EstelleMoon took a “nosee into nostalgia” and read Night Watch by Terry Pratchett:I really liked it! It’s one of the City Watch series within Discworld which focusses on Sam Vimes and the police force of Ankh-Morpork. It made me laugh out loud more than once, and is at the same time a pretty pointed and successful satire on revolutionary idealism.It’s a great book.

The huge pay package, which equates to nearly £726,000 a day, dwarfs the previous UK record set by Coates when she collected £217m a year earlier.Her pay is more than 9,500 times the average UK salary, 1,700 times that collected by the prime minister and more than double that paid to the entire Stoke City football team, which Bet365 owns and which was relegated from the Premier League last season. Coates’s pay is also 27 times that earned by Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple, the world’s most valuable company.Vince Cable, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, said Coates’ “eye-watering pay package” was “irresponsible and excessive”.“In any circumstance it is hard to justify, but more so given the money comes from people struggling with compulsive gambling,” Cable said. “This is an industry body needing tighter regulation. We have started high-stake gaming machines. We now need to move into online gambling, and curbing the advertising around it.”Luke Hildyard, a director of the High Pay Centre, said: “Why does someone who is already a billionaire need to take such an obscene amount of money out of their company? It is difficult to find a reason beyond pure greed.“A payment of this size would be impossible to justify for someone whose business was in unquestionably life-enhancing products or services. It is doubly offensive when awarded to a betting company CEO at a time when problem gambling is spiralling out of control.”Even before the bumper pay day, Coates and her family were listed as the 21st richest in Britain with a £5.8bn fortune – more than Sir Richard Branson with £4.5bn or easyJet’s Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou with £3bn.The total pay to Bet365’s directors and “key management personnel” was £449m, up from £322m a year earlier. Salaries are high across the board at Bet 365, with its 4,030 employees sharing £648,000, which works out at £161,000 each if shared equally.After graduating with a first-class degree in econometrics – the application of statistical methods to economic data – from Sheffield University, Coates expanded the family’s Provincial Racing shops chain to nearly 50 betting shops. As the millennium approached, she decided the future of betting lay online and bought the Bet365 domain on eBay for $25,000 (£19,000), a move that catapulted her and her family up the UK wealth league.She was awarded a CBE in 2012 for services to the community and business, and has become known as the “patron of the Potteries” for her decision to continue to base Bet365 in Stoke, where it is the largest private-sector employer. “We mortgaged the betting shops and put it all into online,” she said at the time. “We knew the industry required big startup costs but we gambled everything on it.”Bet365’s customers wagered almost £52.3bn last year – £5.5bn more than the year earlier. The company’s TV ads are fronted by the actor Ray Winstone and broadcast during high-profile sporting events.The revelation of Coates’ huge pay comes as an official report says the number of problem gambling children has quadrupled in two years. An audit by the Gambling Commission found there were 55,000 problem gamblers aged 11-16, and a further 70,000 young people at risk.The report, published on Wednesday, found that 450,000 children – one in seven of the total – bet regularly on fruit machines, online, in betting shops or at bingo. All gambling is illegal for under-18s.bet365 made a £75m donation to the Denise Coates Foundation, which mostly funds medical and education charities.

City economists had forecast a deficit of about £1.5bn. Official figures show that car exports to non-EU countries jumped by £1bn, while imports fell by £1.7bn, in the three months to September. Despite the weakness of the pound, which should help to boost demand for British goods, there are mounting worries for the future of UK trade as the world economy slows and Trump imposes trade barriers on China and the EU.After the IFS thinktank accused Philip Hammond of taking a “gamble” on the future strength of the public finances in last month’s autumn budget, the latest figures showed a bigger than expected budget deficit in October. Public-sector net borrowing, excluding the nationalised banks, grew more than City economists’ forecast by £1.6n to £8.8bn compared with October a year ago, marking the worst October for the public finances for three years. Analysts said the latest figures suggest the chancellor may now miss his tax and spending targets set by the Office for Budget Responsibility for the current financial year, while warning that a no-deal Brexit could further damage the public finances.The UK’s housing market fell to the weakest level since September 2012 last month, with prices flat or falling across half of Britain according to the latest snapshot from the country’s official surveyors’ body. The latest snapshot from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said its headline house price balance fell to -10, from -2 in the month before, below all forecasts in a Reuters poll. House prices were flat or falling in six of the 11 regions covered by the survey, up from three in June. Economists said that the reading was likely to reflect buyers’ caution before the Brexit vote and a reluctance among sellers to put their properties on the market. To add to the pressure, the prospect of higher interest rates from the Bank of England is also likely to make it more expensive for prospective home owners to buy a property.Figures released this month revealed that business investment has declined for three consecutive quarters, marking the worst run for the level of corporate spending in the economy since the global financial crisis a decade ago. Analysts laid the blame squarely on Brexit uncertainty, which has deterred companies from spending on new machinery, technology or building works. The CBI lobby group warned that investment is “flooding out” of Britain to other EU countries, although UK business investment in recent years has always lagged behind major economic rivals. Britain has, however, fallen further behind since the Brexit vote, according to Michael Saunders, a member of the Bank of England’s rate-setting monetary policy committee. While a Brexit deal could help boost business confidence to invest, he said: “I suspect quite a lot of that is a permanent loss.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7cbd7abdb6529888ea68c49c5cad0a475909c75a/0_160_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eaa2075c684ecc84dfcce9f932ffb056","title":"brexit dads army jacob rees mogg","story":"When a platoon of greying all-male duffers presented themselves before the media this week as Britain’s last line of defence against the encroaching European super-state and our quisling prime minister, it was impossible not to wonder which of these nobodies – sorry, which of this crack cadre of Brexit bulldogs – most resembled the proverbially weak-bladdered Private Godfrey.You remember Private Godfrey. He was the most feeble fighter in Dad’s Army, someone so doddery that he could barely lift a gun, still less pull its trigger, and who lived in a home for the bewildered with his sister Dolly and her vast collection of upside-down cakes. His catchphrase? “May I be excused, sir?” He couldn’t knock the skin off a rice pudding, though to be fair, he could break the world land speed record on the way to the gents’ if he was caught short.As I scanned the platform at the European Reform Group’s press conference, it was hard to decide. All of them fitted the bill so well.That said, when a reporter said that there was a “Dad’s Army” feel to how the ERG have struggled to submit enough letters of no confidence in the prime minister, the bumblers’ leader, Jacob Rees-Mogg, replied: “I’ve always quite admired Captain Mainwaring.”Admire, yes. But be confused for the Walmington-on-Sea platoon captain, or play him in a new movie? I think not. True, Rees-Mogg does have the glasses. But, confusingly, his double-breasted suit is just the thing that stupid boy Private Pike would wear in homage to his favourite Hollywood gangster, George Raft.Moreover, Captain Mainwaring was much more effective a leader than Rees-Mogg will ever be. When Mainwaring calls his platoon to attention, they snap to (with the exception of Corporal Jones) when Rees-Mogg urges Brexiteers to come up with 48 signatures to the 1922 Committee for a no-confidence motion in the prime minister, by contrast, they come up short. If Rees-Mogg is the go-to guy to organise a coup against Theresa May, then the ERG’s favoured hard Brexit is doomed. Doomed!No, Rees-Mogg is more like Sergeant Wilson, a dithering posho oozing droit de seigneur perhaps but commanding no authority. No platoon snaps to attention when Sergeant Wilson is in charge. “Would you all mind terribly falling in, please? Thank you so much.” Rees-Mogg has the same kind of leadership skills.But if Brexiteers are Dad’s Army, who is Private Pike, the mummy’s boy in the scarf she knitted for military manoeuvres? Dominic Raab, obviously. He is the former Brexit minister who voted against the settlement he himself was responsible for negotiating in Brussels. Stupid boy!Private Walker, the spiv with a jacket lining filled with watches and a breast pocket teeming with ladies’ nylons? That tasty geezer of Euroscepticism, David Davis. The old warhorse Corporal Jones? Tory peer and ex-cabinet minister Peter “They don’t like it up ’em” Lilley.The mardy, naysaying cassandra Private Frazer? Boris Johnson. This may seem counterintuitive, given that Johnson is an egocentric Etonian posho and Private Frazer a dour Scots undertaker, but think of it this way. Frazer was always sowing dissent in the ranks by calling Mainwaring an old fool, in the manner of Johnson in his  columns. “Stop rolling your eyes, Frazer,” Mainwaring would have to tell him on parade. Theresa May probably had the same problem with Johnson in cabinet meetings, and when she set out her Chequers proposal.The oleaginous Verger Yeatman? Tory MP Bernard Jenkin. The verger’s invertebrate boss, Reverend Farthing? Leader of the House Andrea Leadsom. Mrs Fox, with her unconvincingly self-deprecating catchphrase : “Yoo-hoo! It’s only little me!” Nigel Farage. Private Sponge, the character nobody can remember was actually in Dad’s Army? Tory MP Steve Baker. Mrs Mainwaring, unseen but heard galumphing upstairs as her husband’s platoon stand terrified, clutching teacups in the parlour below? She could be Esther McVey.So that’s all good. But we still haven’t got our Captain Mainwaring. Which Brexiteer could fill his boots? Here’s an idea. Remember how Warden Hodges incessantly compared the captain to Napoleon for being vainglorious, short and untrustworthy? Are you thinking what I’m thinking? Of course! Environment secretary Michael Gove.And finally there’s the ruthless Nazi U-boat captain who takes the names of the platoon so he can administer future punishment beatings (prompting the classic bumbling Mainwaring line: “Don’t tell him your name, Pike!”)? Who could play him? Michel Barnier or Jean-Claude Juncker. Either would be utterly convincing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1be08fb65a0be68d0f1106929688a983ca844f4e/0_115_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=77451ce0b65b5eaba2682284e13ad5c6","title":"britain deserves better brexit may peoples vote","story":"There is little to laugh about in the epic ongoing shambles that is Brexit, but there were at least a couple of moments of mild levity during my visit to Westminster this week. As I navigated the House of Commons between meetings I happened to find myself briefly at the door of a committee room and face to face with a gathering of Jacob Rees-Mogg’s European Research Group, as they were assembling for the latest chapter of their stuttering bid to depose the prime minister.I am not sure which of us was more surprised to see the other, and I declined to offer them any advice. As if that wasn’t enough, I almost literally bumped into Boris Johnson while on my way to meet the prime minister. I asked the former foreign secretary if he wanted me to pass on any message to Theresa May. He suggested telling the PM to “get it sorted”.It was perhaps an unconscious admission from Mr Johnson that the whole Brexit fiasco, which he helped set in train, is largely un-sortable, at least on the current trajectory. However, the fact that the Tory hardliners have, thus far, failed to mount any actual challenge to a prime minister whose authority is more weakened than that of any other occupant of No 10 in modern times betrays the weakness of the case for the hard Brexit they advocate, or for the disastrous no-deal outcome some of them crave.The truth is, as is now becoming steadily apparent, that there is almost certainly no Commons majority for May’s proposed deal – and there is most definitely no parliamentary backing for no-deal.With Amber Rudd, the newest member of Mrs May’s cabinet, now making clear that she expects parliament to exercise its authority to explicitly reject and prevent a no-deal outcome, it badly undermines the PM’s strategy, which has been to present things as a stark choice between her deal and the cliff edge of no-deal.That is an utterly false choice, and it is now, day by day, being exposed as such. We should not be presented with the option of frying pan or fire. What is needed is a workable, better alternative to the prime minister’s deal. And it is incumbent on all of us who oppose it to come up with something that can command majority support. And while there is not yet a finalised alternative to the prime minister’s plan, there is now an emerging cross-party consensus that can lead to a much better outcome, with broad agreement between the SNP, Labour, the Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru, the Greens – and, indeed, some Conservatives – that parliament must reject both the current proposal and a no-deal outcome.Continued, permanent membership of both the single market and customs union is one such alternative proposal that could well command majority support in the Commons. That outcome is one that the Scottish government has been consistently proposing for two years now. And it is one that is likely to find favour in Brussels. EU leaders may say that they are not open to renegotiation – they can say little else ahead of Sunday’s special summit, assuming it happens – but remaining in the single market and customs union does not involve the same renegotiation from the status quo as the UK government’s approach has done.My first preference, of course, along with that of my government and party, is for us to remain in the European Union, which is what the people of Scotland voted for overwhelmingly. That could still be achieved by a so-called people’s vote, which I have made clear the SNP would support if it came to be voted on in parliament – and any referendum would have to have a remain option for it to offer a meaningful choice. That may yet be the alternative that proves capable of commanding a majority in parliament, and the SNP would be part of it. And if it takes a general election to break the impasse and ensure a less damaging outcome to the one that we currently face, then that is something the SNP would be very ready to fight. We would go into any such campaign, unlike most other parties, as having had a completely coherent and consistent position on Brexit.From a Scottish perspective, one thing above all else is clear amid the Brexit chaos – that is, the cost to Scotland of not being independent. Independent Ireland has had nothing but support from its EU counterparts Scotland has been treated with nothing but contempt by the UK government. The Tory party, or at least those of them who even care, may not yet appreciate the long-term cost to the union of such behaviour, but it will become apparent when the people of Scotland come to vote again on their future.• Nicola Sturgeon is the leader of the Scottish National party"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7780d521e0d64d61c01674bff24702ee90705402/0_0_2548_1529/master/2548.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=576a4534a35074ed2cc7086146f55797","title":"the guardian view on the populist moment difficult times","story":"Across Europe, moderate politicians are anxious about the vitality of their democracies, the sturdiness of their institutions, the civility and harmony of their societies. The threat they see is a deepening political polarisation, documented in a series in the , which began this week. Once the choice offered to an electorate was simply between the centre-right and centre-left. Now they are being offered choices on the right and left too. This represents a shift, especially for western democracies, which got used to centrist politics. In the last few decades the axis of politics has shifted rightwards, so that the centre is now situated where once the right had been. Hence the arrival of “populism” as a political force grounded in the notion of the centre versus these opposite extremes.This is a global phenomenon. When Jair Bolsonaro is inaugurated as Brazil’s president in January, five of the world’s seven largest democracies will have populists at the helm. They include India, the Philippines, Mexico and the US, which elected – in Donald Trump – a president some believe to be the first populist president since Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who died in 1945. Populism, clearly, is not new, and the current spike should not be overstated. In much of the western world, the established political order remains more or less intact. But clearly a dramatic realignment is under way. In the coming months the  will be exploring what the political theorist Chantal Mouffe has labelled “the populist moment”. In Europe, populism is often conflated with nativism and far-right politics, but is rarely used to describe parties or leaders on the left. The reverse is true in Latin America, where populism has historically been associated with the politics of the left.The UK’s first-past-the-post electoral system acts as a defence against populist insurgencies, but it did nothing to prevent the country’s vote to leave the EU – a decision encouraged, in part, by intensely populist rhetoric about out-of-touch technocratic elites in Brussels. Many of our continental neighbours see Brexit as a dangerous political experiment, and part of a sinister ideological continuum stretching from Nigel Farage to Trump to Vladimir Putin. Europe watches in alarm as Steve Bannon, a Trump ally, attempts to mobilise a hard right network in next year’s European parliamentary elections. His campaign is faltering but there is no doubting the threat Mr Bannon poses.There is a fundamental challenge in how to confront nativist populism without further alienating the voters who are attracted by its proponents. Trumpeting the economic benefits of migration, for example, does little to shift opinion among people who do not believe those benefits accrue to them. Fact-checking doesn’t reach those who reject the authority of the fact-checkers. There is an idiom of anti-populist rebuttal that comes across as a sneer, treating voters as dupes, unhelpfully bundling deep-rooted cultural disorientation with far-right aggression. But to tiptoe around real racism, indulging xenophobia as an expression of “legitimate” grievance, is also no remedy. Where mainstream parties have adopted anti-immigrant rhetoric, they have simply emboldened extremists – giving permission to ever more overt racism.The roots of populism are deep and primarily economic, despite the objectionable way they often find expression. Telling voters the problem they raise has no easy solution sounds like an excuse for inaction. Or it leads to technocratic tinkering. That was a feature of the centre-ground politics that now looks directionless. There is a demand for big answers and radical political ambition. The appeal to pragmatism too often sounds like code for defeatism or denial of the scale of public discontent. The appetite for drastic upheaval must be met with optimism and imagination. Credible responses to social and economic distress do not have to be modest. Appeals to a collective national interest and rhetoric of collective solidarity can be made without scapegoats. A platform needs compelling political expression to have a chance of being delivered. No one says being radical and realistic is easy, but too much is at stake to surrender and say it is too hard."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd6fc812a5433b52cd949ff3a390587d75e23cd5/0_0_941_573/master/941.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=5f8367ad68674aa1bdb9c1ceaf9cbe6a 1400w","title":"noel edmonds jungle debut to coincide with lloyds legal action","story":"TV star to appear on I’m a Celebrity as he begins legal action against bank over high-profile fraudLloyds Banking Group will be keeping tabs on ITV’s I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out Of Here as Noel Edmonds brings his battle against the lender to the jungle camp.The TV presenter’s appearance on the reality show is expected to coincide with his lawyer delivering a letter that will kickstart Edmonds’ much-trailed lawsuit against Lloyds.

Edmonds is expected to drop in for the final minutes of Wednesday night’s show before making a full debut on Thursday.Lloyds press team contacted the  before Edmonds’ appearance, in light of speculation that he will use airtime to escalate his complaints against the lender. The former DJ has been running a high-profile campaign against the bank, which has included setting up a website and an online radio station with messages detailing his case. He also turned up at the bank’s annual shareholder meeting and attempted to get Lloyds’ black horse TV ads banned.The bank declined to comment on his inclusion on I’m A Celebrity.Edmonds is planning to take the bank to court over claims that his firm, Unique Group, was pushed into failure amid a high-profile fraud at the Reading branch of HBOS, the banking group which Lloyds acquired at the height of the financial crisis.HBOS Reading bankers have since been jailed over the £245m loans scam, with victims’ cash spent on sex workers and luxury holidays.Edmonds told the  last week that his legal team was readying a pre-case letter that would be given to Lloyds on Wednesday, but his lawyer, Jonathan Coad, explained that preparations for I’m a Celebrity had resulted in a slight delay.Coad said he would deliver the letter to Lloyds lawyers by hand on Thursday morning. The formal claim is scheduled to be filed after 21 December, assuming no settlement is reached in the meantime.“We are still waiting for Mr Edmonds to file his legal claim.

These views and information from opinion polling will then form the basis of Attenborough’s speech to leaders.“We all know climate change is a global problem – and for that it requires a global solution,” said Attenborough. “This is an opportunity for people from across the globe, regardless of their nationality or circumstances, to be part of the most important discussion of this century the unprecedented action needed to reach the Paris agreement targets.”“I encourage everyone to take their seats and to add their voice so that the ‘people’s address’ truly represents a mix of voices from across the world,” he said.The world’s governments are meeting in Poland to negotiate how to implement the Paris agreement on climate change, secured in 2015.

The primary answer is simple: a lack of safe infrastructure.If cyclists are expected to share the roads with a tonne or so of speeding metal then, global experience shows, you won’t get more than a certain, small percentage of the population doing it, predominantly the young and gung ho.But the reasons behind this are more nuanced than they might seem. Yes, actual danger is a significant issue. But in the UK, cycling is both less safe than it could be and also significantly more safe than most people believe, with an average of a million miles ridden per serious injury or death.The problem is it feels unsafe. A pioneering 2015 study found frightening incidents, even if they did not actually cause harm, were a routine experience for UK riders. This is a particular issue for novice cyclists, many of whom are swiftly put off their new mode of transport.Although safe cycling infrastructure can prevent the great majority of such experiences, it’s also worth stressing that near-misses are not necessarily intrinsic to the current road system. Many happen because of poor choices, carelessness and reckless actions by other road users, overwhelmingly drivers and to a lesser extent riders of motorbikes and mopeds.I decided to try and create some sort taxonomy of these behaviours by borrowing a cycle camera, riding my usual route to and from work in London, and recording what happened. The highlights, if you can call them that, can be seen in the video above.The vast majority of the clips come from the last few weeks, though a couple were from earlier. Some of the dates shown in the bottom of the screen are incorrect as it took me a while before I remembered to set it properly.The borrowed camera was a Fly12, an excellent combined front camera and light made by Australian company Cycliq. I also briefly used their rear-view model, called the Fly6, which you see in a couple of the clips.Before I list the behaviours, one final point is worth noting: this video is almost certainly an understatement of the extent of frightening behaviour on most UK roads.One of the most scary, and regular, experiences is excess driver speed. All my clips come from central London, where congestion keeps average speeds low. Ride in a less built-up area and you will routinely be overtaken by cars doing 40mph or much more, even in 30mph limits. This is no fun.Also, almost all the riding took place on my carefully-plotted route into work, which mainly comprises side roads. It’s no surprise that several of the worst incidents I chronicled come from a single spot – the perennially feral roundabout on the south side of Lambeth Bridge.After all that, here is my list of 10 driver behaviours that routinely intimidate and frighten cyclists. Watch the video for my examples, and then tell us which ones annoy or worry you the most.No fun in a car, terrifying if you’re on a bike. It’s amazing how often some drivers think it’s OK to drive an inch behind your rear wheel. The example in the video was a particularly bad one – the driver concerned seemed to think I should have been in the bus lane, even though it was occupied further down, and tried to more or less shove me off the road.A hugely common experience, generally carried out by drivers who feel compelled to overtake no matter what the risks. Obviously, fast close passes are the most scary, but they are always a shock, as shown by the startled yelp I generally give in the examples above.Another routine occurrence, often requiring you to slam on the brakes. The example above features a motorbike rider, who tailgated me down a narrow 20mph street where it was clearly unsafe to overtake, beeping the horn, before pulling across me to turn, seemingly as much for punishment as convenience. Don’t turn up the volume too loud at work, as I’m afraid I swore.This is ubiquitous, and as mentioned above, is much more of a problem on quieter roads. Even in London at less congested times, for example during the night, speeding is the norm. The example above shows that even when it’s a moped, an over-fast overtake can be startling.It is amazing how many drivers think cycle lanes are some form of emergency parking. The video snippet above features a sight I see several times a week – a 24-hour bike lane near where I live blocked by someone who has decided to pop into the adjoining shop, forcing riders to pull out into the centre of a busy road while going up a hill.This seems linked to some drivers’ belief that cyclists should be squeezed into the gutter, and that if they’re not it’s fine to edge into the rider’s lane to try and nudge them over. In the example above, I was deliberately in the centre of the lane on the roundabout in question, as I was turning right immediately afterwards.Every cyclist knows this one: as the road narrows, usually for a pedestrian traffic island, someone in a vehicle tries to overtake at the last minute, obliging the cyclist to brake heavily to avoid being forced into the kerb, or worse.Used in many cities, these painted boxes at the front of traffic lights are designed to allow cyclists to set off from a green light in full view of others, not trapped among a stream of vehicles. Sadly, quite a few drivers ignore this, forcing cyclists either to wait behind or edge even further ahead.There is much popular fuss about this habit among some cyclists. But watch most junctions carefully and you’ll see just as many drivers ignoring the red. This is often done at speed – many accelerate across as the lights change – and causes many more deaths and injuries. As ever, it’s all about the physics.It’s common as a cyclist to have vehicles occupying space which isn’t strictly theirs. The example in the video shows one of the many ways the residential street shown is unpleasant to ride on – right-turning drivers cutting the corner, veering heavily into the opposite lane.

Yet the film is nothing like that generically. In fact, it is another of the intricate and nuanced family dramas in the classical Japanese style, of which Kore-eda has made himself a modern master. Its significant plot shifts happen unobtrusively, almost invisibly, except for those big, heart-wrenching revelations in its final 10 minutes. I admired Shoplifters very much the first time I saw it at the Cannes film festival earlier this year (it was the winner of the Palme d’Or), while also feeling that his masterpiece was still his 2011 film I Wish, which has a pellucid, almost transcendental simplicity that Shoplifters didn’t quite have.I Wish is still my favourite Kore-eda film, but, on a second viewing of Shoplifters for its UK release, I can see how the comparison was ungenerous. This is a brilliant and audacious film, based on a news story, one of his very best, a study of family trauma and fear of poverty, reviving themes from earlier films such as Nobody Knows (2004) and Like Father Like Son (2013). For all its calm gentleness, the film is devastatingly clear-sighted about modern Japan, its dysfunctions and hypocrisies. Watching this, I found myself thinking of the Pink Floyd lyric: “Quiet desperation is the English way …” It’s the Japanese way as well.Lily Franky (from Like Father Like Son) plays Osamu, a man with a shifty, wheedling grin. He is effectively the Fagin-like head of an extended family of roguish people all nursing secrets and lies. This household appears to be a middle-aged husband and wife, a teen daughter (or perhaps younger sister to the wife?), a young son and a grandma – all living together in a cramped apartment rented from an dodgy landlord who has to keep changing the names on his properties’ title deeds as part of his tax dodge of “flipping” notional ownership.Theoretically a casual labourer on construction sites, Osamu actually makes his money selling the things he steals on daily shoplifting expeditions with his boy, Shota (Kairi Jyo). His wife Noboyu (Sakura Andô) works in a hotel laundry and she, too, steals things left in clothes’ pockets all the time. The younger woman is Aki (Mayu Matsuoka) who brings in her share to the family finances by taking part in a soft-porn peep show in town. Hatsue is the grandma, who supports this family with her pension and who also guilt-trips the grownup children of her late husband’s second wife into giving her money, which she mostly pours into the pachinko slot machines. Hatsue is wonderfully played by veteran Japanese character actress Kirin Kiki. It was her last performance she died in September this year.One day, coming home on a freezing night after a hard day stealing from supermarkets, Osamu and Shota come across a little girl of perhaps six or seven shivering in the cold. Impulsively, Osamu decides to take the poor homeless little waif in for a few days. She appears to have marks on her body consistent with abuse and she wets the bed: another classic sign. Osamu’s wicked old heart is evidently melted, and he says that they will keep this little girl, Juri (Miyu Sasaki), and train her up in the ways of shoplifting, which include making odd little hand gestures to your thief-partner to indicate when and what you intend to steal. And this despite the TV news broadcasts about this little girl having gone missing.But it is not just a question of Osamu finding redemption in doing good, nor is it a simple irony in Osamu’s crook-family fulfilling the function of the social services and the caring state – the state that would disapprove of and indeed prosecute Osamu if it knew what he was up to. The point is that Osamu has, in his amoral way, stolen Juri in just the same way as he steals everything else. And it isn’t the first time he’s done it. His ambiguously benevolent abduction of Juri is part of a larger pattern of concealment that the whole family unit are involved in. Nothing is what it seems.It is a movie made up of delicate brushstrokes: details, moments, looks and smiles. Shoplifters is the story of a group of frightened, damaged people who have made common cause with each other, banded together under the convenience flag of family, under the radar of the law, making the best of things from day to day, until they realise they have been making the worst of things. A rich, satisfying and deeply intelligent film."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd07876c940928965f4bfdedc50325b628ca9719/0_342_7952_4771/master/7952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=12cb8bc613bacb49bb7ed1f0c1391e5d","title":"the christmas chronicles review kurt russells santa cant save netflix turkey","story":"The streaming giant is releasing a string of festive movies this year but their glossiest option is a shoddy sign of things to comeOver the past 10 years, Hollywood has been hesitant to put much effort behind Christmas movies. There have even been years without a major studio release bearing any holiday themes or connections. The absence of the Christmas movie is often credited to the constraints of release windows and limited marketing opportunities: these titles only have relevancy in NovemberDecember and waiting a year between theatrical and home video is no longer an option.But Netflix is ready to fill the void by releasing a series of original films operating somewhere between the Hallmark channel and the multiplex in terms of production values. This year brings The Holiday Calendar, The Princess Switch, A Christmas Prince: The Royal Wedding and, positioned as their tree topper, The Christmas Chronicles. It’s being given a sizable marketing push with the star power of Kurt Russell and the production clout of Chris Columbus (“from the film-makers that brought you Home Alone …”) but sadly, no number of mobile push notifications could turn this into a movie worth watching.It opens with a polished year-by-year montage of home movies chronicling Christmas morning excitement that is so Hollywoodised it’s unlikely to draw comparisons to any viewers’ real experiences. It’s also so oppressively cheery that you just know it will culminate in the absence of a family member by the time we reach present day. Sure enough, dear old Dad (Oliver Hudson) died tragically on the job, heroically saving families from a burning house. This leaves Mom (Kimberly Williams-Paisley) juggling her demanding job at the local hospital with single parenting her teenage son Teddy (Judah Lewis) and 10-year-old daughter Kate (Darby Camp).Kate clings to Dad’s favorite camcorder (a hilariously outdated model even when the diaries begin in 2006) and is introduced recording a video message to Santa. Meanwhile, Teddy is quickly devolving into juvenile delinquency from underage drinking to stealing cars – an action that is portrayed with shockingly little repercussion in a film aimed at families. After a painfully long prologue, we arrive at Christmas Eve and Mom has been called in at the last minute to cover an overnight shift. Teddy and Kate let their sibling dysfunction ease slightly and work together to set up a hidden camera in hopes of catching a glimpse of Santa. Seriously, there is so much camcorder action you’d think this was a Paranormal Activity spin-off. Something abnormal does happen – although not of the ghostly persuasion – as Santa does in fact arrive.Santa is played by Russell who instantly brings a level of energy and professionalism sorely lacking from the film. His comic timing, twinkly eyes and impressively styled beard are almost enough to inspire hope that the movie will turn around. But just as quickly as Santa arrives, we’re treated to the worst green-screen filming in recent memory and all hope is lost. Through a series of madcap occurrences, Santa, Teddy and Kate end up stranded in Chicago, working together to fix Santa’s sleigh, find his magic hat and track down his flying reindeer. If they don’t do it in time, a large percentage of children won’t get their Christmas presents and that would be bad for everyone (“Ever heard of the Dark Ages?” Santa offers as a warning).Hijinks and (attempted) heartwarming ensue and before we know it, we find Santa locked up in the slammer offering his own take on jailhouse rock. While Russell does his killer Elvis impression and Little Steven and the Disciples of Soul cameo as his backup band, you might ask yourself, if this still for kids? The answer is, for a minute or two it’s something more, glimmers of an inspired take on the Christmas movie with enough to appeal to an audience beyond desperate parents and bored elementary school students. But really, the sequence is nothing more than a trifling ersion born out of Russell’s talents (and probably, a big factor in why he did the movie).Between the atrocious green-screen work, the blatant stock footage helicopter shots of city skylines and painfully obvious Toronto-for-America locations, you would be forgiven for thinking this movie was made in 1992. If it weren’t for punchlines about Uber and fake news, Netflix could have sold this as an unearthed relic a la The Other Side of the Wind and we’d believe them.Fortunately, Christmas comes just once a year and Netflix’s Christmas movies will fade from your log-in screen soon enough. That’s not to say Netflix shouldn’t keep trying. The world needs Christmas movies. They can offer a sense of unity or a normalization of family dysfunction. And Christmas trees look great on film. The Christmas Chronicles is no Christmas chestnut, but Netflix has more freedom than a traditional studio to make one. Here’s hoping for yuletide merriment in 2019."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/06029855417cb289a3adec64d5c13e5d3122c63a/555_499_5295_3177/master/5295.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c4dee48eb84ac5874df3a2e31fd16c29","title":"waste bread gails is making the most of yesterdays bake","story":"While it doesn’t have the most appetising name, the bakery’s sustainable new loaf more than makes up for it in tasteSustainable products don’t have a rich history of charismatic names and “waste bread” – the latest innovation from the bouji bakery Gail’s – is no exception. I like Gail’s, but while it excels in all things cake, and makes some delicious fruit breads, I have never been convinced by its sourdough (which is also available at Waitrose and Ocado). I find it ages fast and, at £3.30 a loaf (taking its San Francisco variety as an example), you might expect more contrast between crust and crumb. In short, it is expensive toast.So, I was intrigued but not terribly hopeful when I heard about the so-called waste bread, which repurposes unsold bread from the previous day into a new, larger loaf. Roz Bado, head baker at Gail’s, has been developing the idea all year in an effort to offset the business’s contribution to food waste. While the amount of surplus bread across branches of Gail’s varies by the day, there is usually an unsold proportion, which Bado was determined to put to work.She devised a way to give spent bread a new lease of life, whizzing it up into breadcrumbs before making a stewy “porridge”, which is added to strong white flour, malt and a starter culture. Gail’s says the aim is to make the eventual waste loaf from one-third surplus bread the loaf is correspondingly larger – 750g compared with 500g in the case of the San Francisco. Strictly speaking, it is not replacing any ingredients with the surplus, but it is laudable that the surplus finds a new home on the shop shelf, not in a bin. I also like the fact that the waste bread changes from one day to the next. Gail’s does not limit its surplus element to old sourdough, but puts in whatever is left over from the day before, meaning it is a moveable feast.Given that eco credentials often play merely a tertiary role in our purchase decisions – taste and price are usually the clinchers – my future with waste bread lay in the eating. Reader, I loved it. Gail’s has unwittingly developed the kind of sourdough I wish it had always made, with a crisp, golden crust and moist, almost unctuous innards (it uses the word “tacky” for the crumb, which I think is unfortunate). This softer texture must be down to Bado’s porridge invention, and makes for slices of bread that invite nothing more than salted butter (toasting not necessary). It is 90p more expensive than a loaf of the San Francisco stuff, but, with a third more volume, I am not complaining.

At the stroke of a government pen the mood of cautious optimism mounting among female supporters had been dashed.In Farsi, Azadi means freedom or liberty but such concepts do not seem to apply to the half of the population excluded from attending games.This month around 500 women were permitted to join the 80,000 crowd attending the second leg of the Asia Champions League final in the capital between Persepolis and Japan’s Kashima Antlers.Considering that Iranian women have not been allowed access to live football for most of the 39 years since the Islamic revolution it appeared a watershed.“Women are champions of Azadi,” declared a headline in the reformist newspaper Etemad, while the similarly minded Sazandegi proclaimed: “Women’s victory in Asia final” and the Persepolis captain, Hossein Mahini, tweeted: “Hope one day half Azadi will be yours.” Meanwhile the watching Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, described it as a “historic day”.This breakthrough came in the wake of an apparently pivotal moment in October when around 100 women were permitted to watch Iran’s friendly win against Bolivia.Yet those who imagined that represented a historic turning point had perhaps underestimated the power of the country’s hardline clerics and their backers, the Revolutionary Guard.There had been a sense that president Hassan Rouhani and his fellow “modernisers” were susceptible to pressure from Fifa on the issue but, in the wake of the Bolivia game, Iran’s chief prosecutor, Mohammad Jafar Montazeri, issued a starkly contrasting message.The head of the country’s judiciary said women should be banned from stadiums as it was “sinful” for them to watch “half-naked men play soccer”. It seemed the hardliners were reminding the reformers who was really in charge.Tellingly a political commissar to the Revolutionary Guard, Abdullah Haji Sadeghi, also entered the fray. “Women’s presence in stadiums is dangerous,” he said. “We need to be wary of our social behaviour.”Even before the Bolivia friendly Montazeri was perturbed by the significance of events in June when women entered the Azadi for only the third time in almost four decades to watch Carlos Queiroz’s Iran play Spain in the World Cup in Russia via a big screen.It was the moment Open Stadiums, a pressure group lobbying for the rights of Iranian women to watch football live, had long awaited. “It’s been our dream for decades,” said a spokeswoman for the campaign group. “We’re excluded from public happiness and excitement.”In a week when Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, has been in Tehran appealing for the release of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the Iranian-British woman detained in the notorious Evin prison since 2016, Open Stadiums’ complaints may appear comparatively trivial.Yet the clamour for freedom to attend matches represents part of a much wider context embracing increasing appeals for “bodily autonomy” by Iranian women.Many object to being forced to cover their heads and, almost every day, protesters remove their hijabs and, typically, twirl them defiantly on sticks.Like the Open Stadiums supporters they have mothers, aunts and grandmothers who remember a very different life in Iran before 1979 and the late Ayatollah Khomeini’s Islamic revolution.Before the imposition of Khomeini’s ultra-strict interpretation of Islam, many women went bare-headed in public, often wearing the latest western fashions. Then female interest in football was relatively low but everything changed in 1998 when the achievement of Team Melli – Iran’s national team – in qualifying for the World Cup finals in France captured the entire country’s imagination.Accordingly a few women were allowed into the Azadi to greet the returning national side in the late 1990s but, bar the occasional foreign female spectator, they would not be back until a game against Bahrain in 2005.After security services had beaten several women attempting to enter the stadium, breaking the leg of one, they were finally persuaded to invite a handful through the turnstiles.Moreover, by now the internet was their friend, offering activists a communications forum and, crucially, a means of lobbying Fifa. The movement was gaining inexorable momentum and, suddenly concerned, Iran’s power brokers were presumably nudged into recent concessions after contemplating the national side possibly being banned from future tournaments.Earlier this year Infantino seemed confident of change after discussions with President Rouhani in Tehran, while Fatma Samoura, Fifa’s first female secretary general, has met women from Open Stadiums and seems fully signed up to the cause. “This is something very high on Fifa’s human rights agenda,” she said. “The dialogue continues.”By the time the 2022 World Cup kicks off in Qatar we should know whether this cry for help succeeded. Or if the events of 2018 were merely a case of one step forward, two steps back."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db7aaacd76cd202acfd9441a20bc6e5774614228/399_111_2808_1685/master/2808.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=38839999e207ad611fa93222d22188af","title":"pep guardiola avoids fa charge manchester derby referee","story":"Pep Guardiola has been warned by the Football Association for his comments about the referee, Anthony Taylor, before the Manchester derby.The FA has decided the Manchester City manager’s declaration there was “no problem” with Taylor, who is from Wythenshawe in south Manchester, officiating the 3-1 win over United this month did not cross the threshold of being worthy of a charge.Before the victory at the Etihad Stadium on 11 November Guardiola said: “Mr Taylor is from Manchester but do people know the team he supports?

Photographs by  Tom JenkinsThe men employed on building the 40,000-seat al-Rayyan football stadium were having their lunch, in the model accommodation camp of the “supreme committee” organising the 2022 World Cup, when I talked with them about their lives as migrant workers in the wealthiest country on earth. They had come from Ghana, where they said adverts about construction jobs in Qatar were broadcast on the radio, and about 300 of them had taken the opportunity. All four had paid agents, an exploitation that is officially outlawed but is endemic in the recruitment of millions of people from poorer countries to work all over the oil and gas-rich Gulf.“The agent said to me: ‘Qatar is the richest country in the world you can Google it,’” one man told me. “He said we would earn a ‘huge salary’. But when we came here, we found it was the opposite.”Al-Rayyan is one of seven dazzling stadiums being built around the Qatari capital, Doha, in addition to the reconfiguring of the sole pre-existing World Cup venue, Khalifa International, which was completed last year. The total cost is between $8bn and $10bn, according to the supreme committee’s general secretary, Hassan al-Thawadi. Representatives of the supreme committee and their contractors walked us on a tour of al-Rayyan, being built to Fifa’s highest specifications. In heat and glare, 10 men from India, Nepal and Bangladesh, the most common countries of origin for Qatar’s migrant workers, were neatly cementing square vents beneath every seat, in time for a tournament due to begin in exactly four years’ time – on 21 November 2022.At the camp, accommodating 4,500 men, they guided us around the improved facilities adopted widely to replace dire, overcrowded, unsanitary dumps that still plague the country. Official government standards still allow four workers to be accommodated in one room but bunk beds are outlawed. Food is cooked and supplied to good nutritional standards there is a medical centre on site, plus a gym, a football pitch and a computer room with free internet to help the men, all away from their families, communicate with home. There is also a free laundry service – “Just like a hotel,” one of our guides said.So when I finally sat down to talk to the workers, I was almost ready for them to say they could hardly be happier. Aged between 28 and 38, all married with at least one child, they acknowledged that the camp was decent they had Ghanaian friends in other camps which were dirty, and had no food or amenities. Then they started to talk about the pay.“It is hard to be away for so long,” one said. “Sometimes the family want to have you in their midst – and you may not have money to send them. We were supposed to earn something big – but we earn small.”Asked how much, one of them opened his eyes wide in exasperation, and said: “650 a month basic salary.”For building one of the prestige stadiums designed so Qatar can dazzle the world in 2022, eight hours a day, six days a week, this is £140: a little under £35 per week £5 per day.Like all the migrants working in Qatar, the money they send home is not extra it is primary income to support their families. The Ghanaians said they still have expenses in Qatar, although food and accommodation is taken care of, and the money is not enough.One man, 38, who said he had two sons, aged 10 and two, explained: “Our system in Ghana is the extended family. When anybody needs help, they come to you. They know we have travelled to Qatar and ask us for money, but we don’t have it. I do not have enough to feed my family. The money is not what we expected to get. We think about this all the time.”They said they did not believe that raising a grievance would change anything. A 29-year-old man said: “We don’t have help from anywhere, we have to support and encourage ourselves every day. Otherwise what will you do: kill yourself?”The supreme committee always argued that the scrutiny arising from the success, in 2010, of the bid for 2022 could be a catalyst for reform. This tournament is, inescapably, a World Cup of inequality, hosted by the per capita wealthiest country, built by men from the poorest.In October 2017, the government headed off an impending formal commission of inquiry into the conditions of its migrant workers by the UN agency the International Labour Organisation, by agreeing to work with the ILO on a programme of reforms. In a statement from Thamer al-Thani, Qatar’s media attache in the UK, the government said it was “committed to working with our international partners, including the ILO, to improve the rights and living conditions of our guest workers. Qatar welcomes all constructive feedback of our labour system and we have never shied away from the idea that further reform is required.”A major breakthrough was hailed in September with the abolition for most workers – although not domestic staff – of the loathed exit permit, which prevented people at the end of contracts returning home without their employers’ permission.Houtan Homayounpour, head of the ILO’s Qatar project office, describes that as a beneficial change, and he lists other results: settlement committees for workers’ disputes, legal protections for domestic workers, and a commitment to ending the notorious “kafala” system, which ties workers to a single, sponsoring employer.The supreme committee has itself implemented a system for reimbursing workers some of the recruitment fees they paid to agents. Mahmoud Qutub, executive director of workers’ welfare, told us they expect to pay 89m rials, £19m, to 39,000 workers over the next three years, an average of £487 each.“Actions speak louder than words real changes have been made,” Homayounpour said. “Is it perfect? No. The government admits that and there is much more to do. There is genuine progress but challenges remain, which we are working on.”The government has committed itself to introducing a minimum wage, and while research continues into a recommended level, a temporary figure has been agreed. But it is only 750 rials a month – £160, a little under £40 a week.The supreme committee said its contractors at al-Rayyan were instructed in September to pay the advisory minimum wage of 750 per month to all employees. They said they investigated the pay of the Ghanaian men and did find one of them being paid 650. “This has now been rectified,” a spokesman said.The senior figures we talked to seemed to struggle to see injustice in the painfully low pay, saying it was much more than people would earn in their home countries. The “remittance” of money by people working in wealthier countries to low- and middle-income countries is indeed a global phenomenon in 2017, the World Bank has reported, $466bn was remitted, with India the biggest recipient, of $69bn.One expert in Doha said that when trying to understand the resilience of so many migrant workers in tough conditions, it is important to remember the hardships from which they have escaped. “In their home countries, many of these people live in incredibly poor, subsistence conditions,” he said. “There are no jobs, no infrastructure, no roads or drinkable water in some areas, and labour exploitation. We are seeking to address important issues, but they see their ability to work in Qatar and send money home as a huge advance.”The government is keen to showcase the strides it has made to improve welfare, and it organised access to two camps that meet its standards. The first, up a desolate road at al-Khor to the north of Doha, past a sandy stretch pockmarked with twisted remains of metal sheds, accommodates 3,000 men working for the French-Qatari construction joint venture, QDVC. The company’s staff and government inspectors proudly showed us the bare rooms shared by four men, separate clean toilets and showers, large gym and internet room – and while we could appreciate the physical basics being provided, we found the place painfully bleak.The government’s policy to address the large problems with inadequate accommodation, often run by smaller companies, they said, has been to commission “Labour City”, a vast, purpose-built complex behind high walls and railings, opened in 2015 to accommodate 100,000. In total five camps are planned, to move up to 600,000 to the solid buildings and better facilities, which incorporate clean toilets and showers, catered food, communal green spaces, a large mosque and places of worship for other religions, medical and recreational facilities. Famously next door is Asian Town with its mall and restaurants for workers, and a 15,000-seat cricket stadium and an amphitheatre for outdoor events.In a corporate presentation my guides put on before the tour, Labour City was said to be born of “the wise vision of the state of Qatar”. The language was telling, though: the presentation said the camp was built to provide a “proper environment” for “this category of society”.In the internet room upstairs in one of the blocks, a lone man was watching YouTube clips from home, earphones on. He was 38, he said, from a village in Uttar Pradesh, India. He had been in Qatar for seven years. He was married with three children, aged 12, eight and five. “Before, I stayed in different camps, in wooden cabins. Now it is better, safer, to be in a concrete building. And it is good to be near the shops and supermarket, because some camps were far from town.”Asked how it felt to be so far from his family, he said: “I miss them. When I feel too much pain, I call them. But I am earning enough money to support my family and relatives. So I am feeling relaxed.”To meet workers outside the designated camps, a man with local knowledge took me to a street corner in the Msheireb area of downtown Doha. Round the corner from the Corniche strip of beach, and the Souq Waqif complex of shops and restaurants, the area turns suddenly into a rundown street transplanted from Bangladesh. My interpreter walked into the crowd and asked two young men how life was for them. He explained loudly that I was from a newspaper, that newspapers had reported the oppression of the exit permit, the government had read the coverage, and the exit permit had been abolished, so they should talk to me in the hope their lives might change.Within minutes, a huge crowd of men had gathered, all telling stories of despair. Their experiences made life in the camps seem secure, enviable by comparison.“People here are not working,” one man said. “Or they are working but not being paid. There is no work, or very low pay.”They had all paid agents for visas, one or two had purported sponsors that proved to be a mirage one man unfolded a scrap of paper with his sponsor’s name on it, a company he had never been able to find.“The agents said Qatar is a very rich country, with the 2022 World Cup there you can earn good money,” one Bangladeshi man, 28, told me. “But here when you work, the company does not pay you.”They had found bits of work on construction projects, they said, as electricians, plumbers, firefighters, from subcontractors, supply companies, who did not pay them or folded. One man just stood and shook his head, repeating “supply companies” over and over again. He was 38, he said, with a wife and 10-year-old daughter in Bangladesh, and was in agony because he could not send money home and did not have the fees to keep his daughter in school. His wife criticised him for going to Qatar, because rickshaw drivers in his village were making money to support their families.Another young man, 26, shouted that he did not have money even to eat: “No rice, no vegetables, no chicken,” he said. “Only chapati.”His eyes had a look of pleading. I asked how long he had gone without proper food.“Eight months,” he replied.We promised I would report these stories, and that the government and the supreme committee organising the 2022 World Cup would read the coverage. Within five minutes my interpreter and I were driving along the Corniche, past the formidable, floodlit Emiri Diwan, Qatar’s parliament building. Soon we were up in the West Bay, among the towers, hotels and restaurants where fans will enjoy exquisite service in 2022, amid the signs of the supreme committee, with their promise for the World Cup to “Deliver Amazing”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e094e2c3699e446b62689aebcd5ca775f5e25c9c/0_202_3928_2357/master/3928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7d794907923d481b96a0d2f9d8d35abd","title":"gordon taylor ruliest rulers pfa marina hyde","story":"Taylor has ruled the PFA for four decades but if upstart general Ben Purkiss has his way, the chief executive will fall short of surpassing Fidel Castro in the annals of absolute powerHow distressing to find this column’s old friend Gordon Taylor the subject of insurrectionary behaviour in his stronghold. The boss of the Professional Footballers’ Association is reputedly the highest-paid union official in the galaxy, taking home £2.29m last year, and has ruled for four decades (three years as chairman and 37 years as chief executive.) Yet those of us fervently hoping for him to surpass Fidel Castro (52 years) in the annals of absolute power may be disappointed if upstart general Ben Purkiss has his way.Last week, Purkiss – who is the PFA chairman – called for an independent review of how the union is run. “The PFA needs to evolve otherwise you get left behind,” he told the BBC. “We have discussed the need for evolution and the rapid pace the world is changing, and the pace at which football and footballers are changing. If you do not continue on that path, eventually other organisations will fill your space.”Did you ever hear the cheek? Certainly Gordon Taylor never heard the cheek, in 40 years. Under sustained pressure, however, he announced on Wednesday afternoon that he would permit a review, in a statement signed “Gordon Taylor OBE”.Although Gordon has always been best at being outraged on his own behalf, as opposed to anyone else’s, I can only sympathise. If this intervention ends up curtailing his rule, it risks leaving him just shy of the Ruliest Rulers top spot. Yes, he will be above the Equatorial Guinea president Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo in the rankings, who has only 39 years at the helm under his belt. And he will be well ahead of Ali Khamenei, over in Iran, on 37. But that 40-year sign-off would leave Gordon just behind the cuddly Cameroonian boss Paul Biya, who has notched up 43 years of relentless public service, and shows no signs of having to succumb to the indignities of an “independent review” of his performance.Back in 2003, Equatorial Guinea state radio explained to lucky listeners that Obiang was basically “the country’s God”. Or, more specifically, he was “in permanent contact with the almighty” and consequently was entitled to act “without anyone calling him to account and without going to hell”. Same for Taylor, surely.It is a sad fact that our highest achievers often suffer from the lack of peers, and perhaps this is the case with the misunderstood PFA chief. There are those who would bracket him with Premier League’s Richard Scudamore but, for me, the comparison feels off. Certainly both are shits but at least one of them’s competent.Still, you don’t get to have ruled for 40 years without a coup attempt without having a few ideas up your sleeve when one does finally present itself. Thus I am not entirely surprised to learn the so-called PFA chairman Purkiss may not be eligible to be PFA chairman after all.Please don’t assume this is simply the PFA equivalent of claiming the opposition candidate is a criminal and then imprisoning them or exiling them to Surrey to await the poisoned umbrella tip. Rules are rules, apparently. You have to be a contract player, and owing to his ongoing recovery from a neck injury, Purkiss is only a non-contract player for Walsall.Let no one wonder why it hasn’t found 200 QCs to explain that Taylor’s own tenure rather more dramatically contravenes the PFA’s regulations. The PFA handbook states that “the chief executive should hold office for five years unless she resigns or is removed”.Naturally, Taylor himself has called for the smelling salts at news of the row becoming public. “It is disappointing to see a confidential matter such as this has found its way into the national media,” he said between sniffs. “The PFA does not propose to deal with all the points raised in a public forum but will do so privately.”Absolutely. And it somehow means so much more that these comments should come from a man who has, on more than one occasion, dealt with the mental heath of his members in a public forum, and without their consent. Joey Barton was one such lucky member of Taylor’s flock. Then there was the time when, stung by some minor criticism about his handling of Paul Gascoigne, Taylor gave multiple detailed interviews about the latter’s mental health and past treatment, in which he ulged calls with Gascoigne, made armchair clinical diagnoses and actually posted – on the PFA’s official website! – the words: “If we’re not careful it’s going to be akin to George Best.”That such a man would wet his pants about a governance issue being remotely publicised feels entirely in keeping, and I can’t think of a more modern and transparent candidate for the era in which we live. As Grace Mugabe last year observed of her husband’s immutable suitability for the highest office: “If God decides to take him, then we would rather field him as a corpse.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae1bdebf8333ee9d49a5a9582fa268b36fd38561/0_39_3544_2127/master/3544.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=31f517a0adb9f52b32b189b98fb5c12c","title":"how are premier league players on loan faring part one arsenal to huddersfield","story":"From Reiss Nelson to Kevin Mirallas we check how the players are doing to see if they have a future at their parent clubsReiss Nelson, 18, Hoffenheim: A whirlwind start to Bundesliga life has seen Nelson flourish, keen to express himself and take responsibility. Often a supersub, the goals are flowing, as is his confidence, and he was named Rookie of the Month for October.Calum Chambers, 23, Fulham: A challenging place for any defender this season. Over the last 12 weeks Chambers has completed 90 minutes in the Premier League only twice.Takuma Asano, 24, Hannover: The forward has never played a minute of football for Arsenal since signing in 2016. On loan to his second Bundesliga club, his game time has reduced as the season wears on.Matt Macey, 24, Plymouth Argyle: It is a tough learning curve at the bottom of League One and Macey has conceded 34 goals in 18 league matches.David Ospina, 30, Napoli: After four seasons with Arsenal the Colombian headed to Italy to push for a starting place, but has done a fair bit of swapping from pitch to bench and back again, as Napoli have not settled on a regular first choice. Amy LawrenceBrad Smith, 24, Seattle Sounders: The former Liverpool defender made six appearances for the MLS club before a hamstring injury curtailed his season. As part of the agreement, he will spend half of the 2019 season in Washington.Connor Mahoney, 21, Birmingham: The old-school winger has been instrumental in Birmingham’s resurgence, scoring his first league goal against Sheffield Wednesday last month. Is highly-rated by coaching staff at Bournemouth.Emerson Hyndman, 22, Hibernian: Back in the Scottish Premiership after a successful stint at Rangers, the USA international has made 11 appearances for Neil Lennon’s side. Could extend stay beyond January.Matt Worthington, 20, Forest Green Rovers: The young midfielder, whose contract expires next summer, has struggled to nail down a starting berth in Mark Cooper’s side. Scored his first career goal against Cambridge United in League Two last month.Mikael Ndjoli, 19, Kilmarnock: Hit the ground running with a goal on his first start before striking on his league debut for Steve Clarke’s side. The forward, who scored 24 goals for the Under-21s last season, has struck up a partnership with Kris Boyd.Sam Surridge, 20, Oldham Athletic: The pacy forward scored nine goals in eight games before returning to his parent club for treatment on a hamstring injury. On his way back to full fitness. Ben FisherChristian Walton, 23, Wigan Athletic: Ever present in the Championship, Walton has carved out a reputation as one of the best English goalkeepers outside the top flight. He has kept five clean sheets in 16 matches.Dan Burn, 26, Wigan Athletic: The £4m summer arrival was loaned back to Paul Cook’s side until January but missed the start of the season with a foot injury. Will find it hard to dislodge Shane Duffy and Lewis Dunk on his return to Sussex.Oliver Norwood, 27, Sheffield United: An effortless passer of the ball, the Northern Ireland international was influential in helping Chris Wilder’s side establish themselves as the early pacesetters.Jordan Maguire-Drew, 21, Wrexham: The young striker has scored three goals in 15 appearances for Sam Ricketts’s side. “I want to get the club back in the Football League,” he said.Percy Tau, 24, Union Saint-Gilloise: Became Chris Hughton’s seventh summer signing before being sent out to the Belgian second tier to gain European experience. Has scored three goals.Richie Towell, 27, Rotherham United: Returned on a season-long loan after helping Paul Warne’s side to promotion last season. Has made nine appearance this term and scored his first goal against Stoke in September.Steven Alzate, 20, Swindon Town: That the forward signed a new contract with the Seagulls in November is a marker of his progress. Has scored two goals in his past three matches.Tomer Hemed, 31, QPR: The Israel striker has scored four goals in 13 appearances and been key to QPR’s turnaround in form. Hemed scored 17 goals as Brighton were promoted from the Championship in 2016-17. BFNahki Wells, 28, QPR: On a season-long loan at Loftus Road he has played in most league games so far and scored two goals, the most recent proving the winner in the 3-2 defeat of Brentford.Jimmy Dunne, 21, Hearts: The Irish central defender has played 11 games in Scotland and chipped in with two goals. Qualified for both the Republic and the Northern Ireland, he has yet to make up his mind after appearing for the Republic’s U21s.Conor Mitchell, 22, St Johnstone: The goalkeeper said he needed to move out of Burnley’s Academy set up to gain experience, though he has yet to start a game in Scotland.Aiden O’Neill, 20, Central Coast Mariners: A long way to go for a loan, perhaps, though O’Neill is Australian by birth and took the opportunity to play in the A-League. The midfielder has played four times to date. Paul WilsonOmar Bogle, 26, Birmingham City: The forward has struggled for game time back in the Championship. Bogle is yet to score this season, while first-choice strike duo Che Adams and Lukas Jutkiewicz have 17 league goals between them.Rhys Healey, 23, MK Dons: The young forward has been loaned out five times either side of a serious knee injury, but is finding form with the League Two leaders, scoring five goals in 12 league games as part of a dynamic front three.Stuart O’Keefe, 27, Plymouth: Out of contract next summer, the central midfielder has failed to make an impact in League One, moving in and out of the starting line-up.Mark Harris, 19, Newport: Swansea-born and developed at Cardiff, the teenage winger has stayed in Wales. Largely featuring as a centre-forward off the bench, Harris has scored twice in Newport’s unexpected promotion push. Niall McVeighNathan Baxter, 20, Yeovil Town: Baxter created history within weeks of arriving at the League Two club, going nine hours and 33 minutes without conceding a goal. Clean sheets have been rarer since September but he is firmly established as the club’s No 1.Eduardo, 36, Vitesse: The veteran has been ever-present for Vitesse, managed by Leonid Slutsky, and has been a considerable success between the posts – earning plaudits for a side on the fringes of the top four.Jamal Blackman, 25, Leeds United: Had played second fiddle to Bailey Peacock-Farrell at Leeds, only appearing in League Cup ties against Bolton and Preston, before breaking his tibia last week. Has returned to Chelsea.Bradley Collins, 21, Burton Albion: Injury problems initially hindered Collins, whose spell currently runs until January. He picked up a thigh complaint during his second outing in September, but regained his place in October and now holds the No 1 jersey once more.Baba Rahman, 24, Schalke: Has been out of the picture since two early-season starts. Spent more than a year on the sidelines after injuring his knee early in 2017 but there is little sign of a return to regular football during the remainder of this second loan in Gelsenkirchen, an 18-month stint that began in January.Jake Clarke-Salter, 21, Vitesse: Relegated from the Championship while on loan at Sunderland last season, Clarke-Salter had a tough start at Vitesse when he was sent off against Basel in August. But the England Under-21 international has come through that to be a fixture in their defence and looks to have a bright future.Michael Hector, 26, Sheffield Wednesday: The centre-back has played nine times, eight from the start, for a side that has struggled so far. He was their player of the month in October and then, after being surprisingly dropped for a 4-0 home defeat to Norwich, returned as they kept a clean sheet against rivals Sheffield United.Tomas Kalas, 25, Bristol City: A jaw injury laid Kalas low for a month from late September but, when fit, he has been Lee Johnson’s right-sided centre-back and performed well. Admitted to being disappointed when Fulham, where he spent the previous two seasons, did not sign him after their promotion but looks at home with his sixth loan club.Todd Kane, 25, Hull City: Hull is the versatile defendermidfielder’s eighth loan club and, while Nigel Adkins’ side has had a hard time of things, Kane has been one of their more consistent performers. His contract expires next year and there is already talk that he might make the KC Stadium a longer-term home.Matt Miazga, 23, Nantes: It is not quite going to plan for the US international in Ligue 1, where he has not been seen since a slapdash performance against Bordeaux a month ago. A string of yellow cards has not helped and there has been little succour playing in the back line of a leaky national team.Kurt Zouma, 24, Everton: The Toffees are starting to kick on under Marco Silva and so is Zouma, who has started eight Premier League games and forged such a convincing partnership with Michael Keane that Yerry Mina faces a battle for his place upon his long-awaited return from injury.Kenneth Omeruo, 25, Leganés: Now at his sixth loan club, Omeruo appears to have inspired some solidity since taking his place in the strugglers last month. A work permit hitch had held things up but they have lost only one of the six games in which the Nigerian international, an undoubted talent, has featured.Trevoh Chalobah, 19, Ipswich Town: It has been a steep learning curve for the defender-turned-midfielder, but Chalobah appears to have the trust of new manager Paul Lambert. There are some rough edges but overall he looks a fine talent, scoring important goals against Aston Villa and Swansea, and has broken into the England Under-20 squad.Dujon Sterling, 19, Coventry City: Sterling was a shining light in Chelsea’s academy sides last season and, although there have been ups and downs as he adapts to League One, the right-back has cemented a place in the play-off chasers’ side. Injury has stalled him slightly in the last fortnight but the signs are positive.Reece James, 19, Wigan Athletic: Championship football has come easily to James, another right-back who has been a revelation with the Latics. A brilliant free-kick against Leeds has been his headline moment but he has been consistently impressive despite not having played a senior game until this term. Paul Cook has held him up as an example to others of his age and the future looks very promising.Jay Dasilva, 20, Bristol City: The attack-minded England Under-21 left-back has become a familiar face at City, earning a starting place in recent weeks. He set up their dramatic winner at Brentford after coming on as a substitute and been compared to Ashley Cole by his fellow loanee Kalas.Ola Aina, 22, Torino: It has been a good start in Serie A for Aina, a versatile full-back who has played his way into a regular spot. He has featured 11 times in the league, starting eight of them, and there are suggestions the Italians will try to make his move permanent in January.Fikayo Tomori, 20, Derby County: The centre-back has started all bar two of Derby’s Championship games, using previous experience gained at Brighton and Hull to cement his place in an exciting young side. Along with Mason Mount he was allowed to face Chelsea in the League Cup fourth round at Stamford Bridge, only to score an own goal.Fankaty Dabo, 23, Sparta Rotterdam: The right wing-back has played six times for Dutch second-tier side Sparta, starting half of them, although injury has held him up in recent weeks. He has had a less high-profile time of things than last season, when he scored a much-replayed own goal against Groningen while at Vitesse.Lewis Baker, 23, Leeds: Things have not yet gone to plan for Baker, whose eight Championship appearances under Marcelo Bielsa – totalling 123 minutes – have come from the bench. He has not been in the frame since 6 October and is yet to have the success in England that he enjoyed in two seasons with Vitesse.Bekanty Victorien Angban, 22, Metz: The little-known Ivorian midfielder is making some progress with the Ligue 2 leaders, featuring regularly and impressing with a series of combative performances. He is also in his national team’s squad and hopes to feature in the Africa Cup of Nations next year.Kenedy, 22, Newcastle United: Kenedy’s second loan spell at Newcastle started awkwardly with a late penalty miss at Cardiff but he has shone in recent weeks, scoring a superb goal at Old Trafford and crossing brilliantly for Salomón Rondón to score against Bournemouth. At his best, he can be a good top-flight player.Nathan, 22, Atlético Mineiro: There was some excitement when the young Brazilian arrived in 2015 but this, his fourth loan, has been underwhelming so far. Only twice in seven appearances has he played for more than an hour, while his first goal and assist are still keenly awaited.Josimar Quintero, 21, Lleida Esportiu: A year with third-tier Lleida is a step up of sorts from Real Betis’s ‘B’ side, where the Ecuadorian midfielder was sent for the back end of last season, but he has only played twice so far and risks fading further into obscurity.Danilo Pantic, 22, Partizan Belgrade: Has been a mainstay both for Partizan and Serbia’s Under-21s, pushing on after initially rejoining them on loan last season. Joined Chelsea from Partizan in 2015 but a place at Stamford Bridge looks highly unlikely in the long run.Mario Pasalic, 23, Atalanta: The Croatian has been in and out of Atalanta’s starting XI but has largely responded well to being handed playmaker duties during what is his fifth loan overall and his second in Serie A. He spent 2016-17 with Milan now he is 40 miles away in Bergamo and scored on his debut against Frosinone.Ruben Sammut, 21, Falkirk: The Scotland Under-21 midfielder is yet to amass a long run of starts for the Scottish Championship’s bottom side, although he has been heavily involved in playing 10 times overall. This is a first loan spell for Sammut, who captained Chelsea’s Under-23s last season.Charlie Colkett, 22, Shrewsbury Town: Midfielder Colkett, whose loan at Vitesse was terminated early last season due to a lack of opportunities, returned to Shrewsbury’s side in the EFL Cup match at Crewe this month after two months on the fringes. Part of that was down to a foot injury. Jacob Maddox, 20, Cheltenham Town: Battling relegation from League Two, Maddox has been a consistent and impressive presence in their engine room. He scored twice against Arsenal’s Under-21s, the first goals of his senior career, in the EFL Cup last month and looks a promising, tenacious all-rounder.Kasey Palmer, 22, Blackburn Rovers: Palmer has started well for an impressive Blackburn side, playing on the right wing in a 4-2-3-1 and scoring three times – twice in the League Cup and the winner in a Championship match with Brentford. He was a bit-part player during last season’s loan at Derby but is thriving under Tony Mowbray.Kyle Scott, 20, Telstar: The tidy attacking midfielder’s first-ever loan, to Dutch second-tier team Telstar, has begun well and he says he is enjoying the chance to play a technical brand of football. He has been a regular in the mid-table side, scoring twice.Mason Mount, 19, Derby County: Mount always looked like a player who could thrive in the Championship but not even he could have expected a full England call-up two months into his spell. He did not play against Croatia or Spain but, with five goals already and a string of influential playmaking performances, his time will come.Tiemoué Bakayoko, 24, Milan: Often the fall guy during a difficult first season at Stamford Bridge, Bakayoko has duly looked short of confidence in his early months at San Siro although he has started regularly in recent weeks. Numbers crunched by La Gazzetta dello Sport suggest he has been the Rossoneri’s best midfielder in that time so perhaps his fortunes are on the up.Charly Musonda, 22, Vitesse: Once seen as a future superstar, Musonda has found himself among Chelsea’s Vitesse cohort this season after a disappointing loan at Celtic. His hopes of a breakthrough year are on hold, though, due to a shin injury he sustained during a practice game in September and he has been receiving treatment back at Cobham.Kylian Hazard, 23, Cercle Bruges: The third Hazard signed a new two-year deal in the summer but will spend this season in Belgium. After a slow start he scored his first goal early in November, lashing home an equaliser against Mouscron. He says he went there to start games and in recent weeks he has got his wish.Joao Rodríguez, 22, Tenerife: The Colombian is yet to get off the mark for the Segunda Division side, although only three of his seven appearances have come from the start. This is his ninth loan, most of them decidedly obscure, since joining Chelsea in 2013.Michy Batshuayi, 25, Valencia: So far Batshuayi has been unable to replicate the success of last season’s loan at Dortmund, scoring twice in 15 games and being dropped from Marcelino’s matchday squad last weekend. There have been suggestions of an early return to Chelsea but the logistics look difficult to work out.Ike Ugbo, 20, Scunthorpe United: Ugbo hopes to hit form at Glanford Park after underwhelming stints at Barnsley and MK Dons but has been in and out of Stuart McCall’s side. Scunthorpe will want to see a few repeats of the smartly-taken goal he scored in September at AFC Wimbledon.Izzy Brown, 21, Leeds United: Brown tore his ACL in January while on loan at Brighton but Leeds took him on for this season at the end of the transfer window. A debut still looks some way off but there are positive signs and he returned in the Under-23 side against Brighton on Friday.Tammy Abraham, 21, Aston Villa: Last year’s England call-up still looks some way off but the evidence is that Abraham is getting into his stride at Villa. Five goals in 11 games suggest he can again illuminate a ision he tore up with Bristol City two seasons ago. Nick AmesJaroslaw Jach, 24, Rizsepor: The Polish defender has had a limited impact in Turkey, starting three league games and spending seven on the bench. He did, however, earn a first international call-up this month, and played in Poland’s recent friendlies against Uruguay and Mexico.Ryan Inniss, 23, Dundee: After a run of loan moves Inniss finally made his Palace debut this season, but was soon off on another temporary deal. After a run of starts he was taken off halfway through Dundee’s thrashing by Celtic on the last day of October and has been on the bench for their last two games.Levi Lumeka, 20, Leyton Orient: Though nominally on loan for the season, Lumeka has seen just a single minute (plus stoppages) of first-team action, and has more often been found playing for Palace’s Under-23 side.Jason Lokilo, 20, Lorient: The Belgian winger has so far played 13 first-team minutes, and is currently out with a thigh injury.James Daly, 18, Kingstonian: “There’s a lot to do with James, technically,” says the Palace coach Richard Shaw. “He needs to retain possession better at times, but what he does give you is an unbelievable work ethic.” He has played 14 times this season, eight of those appearances coming off the bench, and scored three times.Tyler Brown, 20, Kingstonian: Brown has played 13 games this season, all of them from the start. Palace have closely monitored Brown and Daly’s progress, with Mark Bright watching the recent game against Lewes, and both have continued to train with the Under-23s. Simon BurntonAshley Williams, 34, Stoke: Williams has little future at Everton, but is a regular starter at Stoke and says he is “pleased with how it’s going”.Henry Onyekuru, 21, Galatasaray: The Nigerian striker signed a five-year contract in 2017 but does not have a work permit so must play abroad. He is a regular starter at Galatasaray, and has played in Nigeria’s last four games (though never for more than nine minutes).Nikola Vlasic, 21, CSKA Moscow: Still only 21, Vlasic has started every domestic and Champions League game for CSKA Moscow, won their player of the month award in September and his fourth senior cap against England last week. Marco Silva says he could still have a future at Everton: “We will follow him and take that decision.”Muhamed Besic, 26, Middlesbrough: The midfielder is in his second loan at Middlesbrough and, after an inconsistent start to the season, has become an important member of the team. “On his day he is as good as anything in this league,” says Tony Pulis.Antonee Robinson, 21, Wigan: The Milton Keynes-born American left-back is having a fine season at Wigan, though he injured an ankle on international duty last week and is likely to be out for a month.Callum Connolly, 21, Wigan: Connolly started 29 league games for Ipswich last season but is finding it harder to get game time at Wigan, where he has started five league games, and only two in the last two months.Luke Garbutt, 25, Oxford United: It is nearly three years since Garbutt’s last first-team appearance for Everton. Last season’s loan at Wigan was only moderately successful and he is not excelling this season either, having not made it further than Oxford’s bench in their last seven league games.Cuco Martina, 29, Stoke: Martina was a certain starter at right-back until injury intervened and gave 19-year-old Tom Edwards a chance to stake a claim for the spot. As a result of the youngster’s form, Martina has been on the bench for Stoke’s last two matches.Yannick Bolasie, 29, Aston Villa: Bolasie’s comeback from long-term knee injury has been slow: he has only recently returned to full training and has been limited to substitute appearances – none of his 10 league appearances has lasted more than 28 minutes. He has declared himself fully fit for Sunday’s Birmingham derby, with Dean Smith saying he is “getting better and better”.Shani Tarashaj, 23, Grasshoppers: Roberto Martínez predicted Tarashaj would “without a doubt have a great future” when he signed from Grasshoppers in 2016. He is now back there, where he has been sidelined by injury since August.Kevin Mirallas, 31, Fiorentina: Mirallas has starred in just three league games for Fiorentina. The most recent, at home to Roma, saw him replaced after 53 minutes and just 13 touches. His stated desire is to sign a permanent deal in Florence: “This is the perfect club for me – like the city, beautiful and welcoming.”Joe Williams, 21, Bolton: Williams has started all but Bolton’s first league match, and Phil Parkinson has described him as “a great all-round midfield player” who “is confident and good on the ball”. Silva has spoken of his admiration and a return to the first-team fold at Everton is not out of the question.Sandro Ramírez, 23, Real Sociedad: Ramírez has concluded that “my characteristics are not compatible with English football” but they don’t appear to be massively compatible with the Real Sociedad first team either: he has started one league game, has often been shunted to the right wing when he has appeared and is yet to make a significant impact. He celebrates the first anniversary of his last first-team goal on Friday.Matty Pennington, 24, Ipswich: The centre-back has been a resounding success at Ipswich, where he has stood out even when filling in at right-back, and was voted the club’s player of the month for September and October. SBRui Fonte, 28, Lille: José Fonte’s younger brother plays as a forward but has yet to find the net – or complete a full 90 minutes – in seven appearances.Magnus Norman, 21, Rochdale: The former England Under-18 goalkeeper has been an occasional starter for the team currently 18th in League One. Was sent off in the 0-0 draw with Bristol Rovers in October.Marek Rodak, 21, Rotherham: Back for a second loan spell, the 6ft 4in Slovakian has been an ever-present, starting all 17 league matches and keeping five clean sheets.Marcelo Djaló, 25, Extremadura: Has made 11 starts for a side enjoying their first season in Spain’s second tier. Might have played more games if he had not been picked up so many yellow cards.Atli Hrafn Andrason, 19, Víkingur Reykjavik: Back in his native Iceland, the midfielder has been on the bench as much as he has been in the team and is yet to find the net.Tayo Edun, 20, Ipswich: Has rarely featured, although he did score against Blackburn on the opening day. Did not do himself any favours by getting sent off against Aston Villa two weeks later.Jón Dagur Thorsteinsson, 19, Vendsyssel: Has started eight games in the Danish top flight but has been replaced in five of them. Has collected more yellow cards (three) than goals (two).Elijah Adebayo, 20, Swindon: The big striker, who can also play in defence, has featured in every one of Swindon’s matches this season, scoring four times and picking up four bookings.Stephen Humphrys, 21, Scunthorpe: Approaching the halfway stage of his third consecutive loan and has scored five goals in 18 appearances.Cauley Woodrow, 23, Barnsley: Has made only four appearances, but scored in his last two games. Set to return to Craven Cottage at the end of the year. Rich FlowerJoel Coleman, 23, Shrewsbury: The promising goalkeeper, restricted to cup action last season, signed a new contract at Huddersfield in the summer before leaving for a campaign on loan at Shrewsbury.

He scored on his debut and three more times since, performing well even if the Bantams are bottom.Regan Booty, 2o, Aldershot: A mainstay of Huddersfield youth teams since the age of nine, the midfielder was packed off in the summer to sample senior football. The 20-year-old has been a regular starter for the non-league club, including in the recent FA Cup draw with Bradford.Lewis O’Brien, 20, Bradford City: After twice being Academy player of the of the year and featuring in the senior squad for a FA Cup match last season, he was sent to gain senior experience this term, on the back of signing a new contract. The 20-year-old has played regularly for the Bantams.Rekeil Pyke, 21, Wrexham: The striker is regarded as a good prospect by Huddersfield even though he has yet to make a senior appearance. He was awarded a new contract earlier this month on the back of a fine start to his loan season. “He has pace and power and hopefully this will give him confidence,” said Wrexham manager Sam Ricketts.

What is this quest for perfection doing to our free time?If you spend much time mooching around the internet, you will probably have come across articles on sites such as Quartz and Forbes called things like “17 habits of highly successful people”. Life hacks of the rich and famous have become the capitalist equivalent of the tales of hardworking coal miners that were once impressed upon Soviet schoolchildren.Invariably, these people wake up at 4.30am Bob Iger, the CEO of Disney, does so at weekends, too, so as not to fall out of whack with his weekdays. Unfailingly, they make time for exercise: Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s CEO, goes for a hike every Saturday before spending his Sundays reflecting on long-term strategy. Presumably, it was from such contemplative heights that he hit upon his recent scheme to remove the “like” button.Even those of us occupying less happy positions at the late-capitalist coalface might emit a weary bleat of recognition at that. Weekdays are tough. But weekends? Exhausting! “Bullshit jobs” (“It’s as if someone were out there making up pointless jobs just for the sake of keeping us all working,” noted the anthropologist David Graeber in his book of that name this year) would appear to have a corollary in bullshit leisure. Increasingly, our leisure time is not leisure as our parents or grandparents might have enjoyed it: time away from the productive demands of work for pottering, ambling, collecting, socialising. It is leisure with an imperative, self‑imposed or otherwise, to maximise relaxation yield, compete over hobby production and co-opt every activity – exercising, meditating, making Halloween costumes for the kids – into a dynamic of human perfectibility.It is hard to say precisely when this shift took place. The “like” button had something to do with it. But for Alex Boyle, a TV editor and amateur triathlete from Bristol, it really ramped up when he discovered Strava, the social network where more than 30 million people share their training regimes.Alex had always liked taking part in sport, but after he slipped a disc making a treehouse for his children he began to take his fitness more seriously. “I began doing CrossFit to regain my core strength,” he says. “The thing about CrossFit is it’s kind of mechanical, but the CrossFit community is very focused on measuring their performance.” He liked this aspect of it – the demonstrable improvement the way it fed back into his overall fitness – and he soon realised that the principle applied equally well to the triathlon sports: swimming, cycling and running. He treated himself to a sports watch and joined Strava so he could post his times. “It allowed me to turn any section of my commute into a competition. I could choose a section of Gloucester Road and see if I could cycle down it faster than anyone else. Or, if I was swimming, I could focus on beating my own times over 100 metres. It becomes kind of obsessive.”One reason leisure has become more competitive is that it is increasingly quantifiable. Smartwatches keep track of your movements, from steps walked to kilometres skied platforms such as Strava allow you to compare times with peers. The principle works beyond exercise, too. Apps such as Sleepio help you measure how productive your sleep is Calm and Headspace gamify mindfulness and meditation, so it is no longer an antidote to work but a way of preparing yourself for more work.Yet these activity counters are basic compared with what the finest minds in Silicon Valley are trying to create. Bryan Johnson, a co-founder of PayPal, is now leading the neurotech company Kernel, the aim of which is to bring the brain “online” to track what users are thinking about. “Think of it as a step counter for the brain,” he said recently. I can’t see any potential dystopian downsides to that ...Aspects of all this measuring are perfectly innocent. A little competition makes things fun and there is nothing wrong with wanting to improve your triathlon time. However, Dr Thomas Curran, a clinical psychologist at the University of Bath, sees a correlation between the increased use of metrics and the rise in perfectionism in young people. In a recent study, he defined this as “an irrational desire to achieve, along with being overly critical of oneself and others”.“Perfectionism is a very problematic trait, especially for those who suffer with it at the clinical end,” he says. “It’s positively associated with depression, anxiety and even suicide. We are not suggesting that every young person is a clinical perfectionist, but we are suggesting that they’re moving further up the spectrum as time unfolds – and that’s concerning.”The way Curran sees it, the culture of metrics has migrated from the business world into our leisure time via education and public services. Schools have become more results-oriented. “In an attempt to make the important measurable, we have instead made the measurable important,” was how the  columnist Simon Jenkins recently summed it up. This has helped to create a generation who see learning as a numbers game, while Instagram, Snapchat and Facebook have done the same with popularity.This has changed the way we view our time off. In a recent essay, In Praise of Mediocrity, the author Tim Wu shared his hunch that we are now afraid of being bad at things: “We are intimidated by the expectation ... that we must actually be skilled at what we do in our free time. Our ‘hobbies’, if that’s even the word for them any more, have become too serious, too demanding, too much an occasion to become anxious about whether you are really the person you claim to be.”To be fair, this is partly a function of growing up. Small children sing, swim, climb, draw, play various sports, make various crafts and don’t much worry if they are any good at them. When you are 37, for example, it is embarrassing to be rubbish at drawing, so we tend to narrow our range of activities. But there is a generational shift here, too. My grandad was a keen photographer, coin collector, cyclist, watercolourist and tropical-fish keeper – and, bless him, he wasn’t much cop at any of them. I don’t think that was the point. His hobbies were ways of absorbing himself and meeting people. There wasn’t the same urge to share and compare and discover how rubbish your efforts were next to some tropical-fish fancier in Colorado with 373,000 followers likewise, my mother has never given much thought to how she might turn her sewing skills into a side hustle. She just likes doing it.Curran sees dark portents in the popularity of The Great British Bake Off and its ilk. “Something that used to be done for enjoyment has been turned into something people do competitively. All sorts of activities have shifted their meaning this way. Making birthday cakes for children in order to get ‘likes’ from people you don’t know? I’m only 30 years old and I can think of no frame of reference for this happening within my lifetime. It’s new.”We could turn to art and literature for some perspective – but these are subject to the same imperatives. Apps such as Joosr and Blinkist condense books into 20-minute versions Instagram is full of great works distilled to one inspiring quote. Even if you manage to read the latest Karl Ove Knausgaard, well, it would be a waste if you didn’t flaunt your erudition with a #shelfie. On Reddit’s podcast forum, a number of users report listening at 1.5x speed, so as to maximise consumption, and express regret that they can’t do the same for Netflix shows. “I do audiobooks at 1.6,” one user explains to me. “It feels like an appeal to intelligence – the natural pauses and implied rimshots are gone. It’s a fast stream of one-two punches that challenges my reaction time and makes me listen harder – and it’s less casual.” Less casual?What would John Maynard Keynes make of it all? In Economic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren (1930), the economist expressed hope that, by now, we would all be working three-hour days and spending the rest of our time enjoying our leisure in a more leisurely fashion. Karl Marx hoped that redistributing the gains of industrial production would enable workers to spend their days like 19th-century aristocrats: writing, fishing and hunting.In those days, it was the poor who worked all hours, while the upper classes flaunted their leisure as a status symbol – take those Parisian flâneurs who used to take their tortoises for walks.The members of the early labour movement battled hard to claw back their time and they were successful at it: we have them to thank for our largely work-free weekends. The postwar period was arguably a golden age for the hobbyists. Now, if anything, the 19th-century paradigm has been reversed: automation and associated forces mean those at the lower end of the labour market often don’t have enough work to do, while the rich are time-poor. Busyness is worn as a badge of honour idleness is condemned as a vice.For Rutger Bregman, the author of Utopia for Realists and a proponent of a shorter working week, something is seriously awry. “Right up until the 1970s, philosophers, sociologists and economists were predicting that the biggest challenge of the future would be boredom: what the hell would we do with our time?” he says. “Isaac Asimov predicted that the biggest profession would be psychiatrists, treating people for the symptoms of boredom.” There are plenty of psychiatrists around, but boredom doesn’t tend to be high on their priority list. “We’re almost suffering from the opposite,” Bregman says.From an economic point of view, the decline of leisure is not as illogical as it first appears. It was the US economist Gary Becker who first explored this, in A Theory of the Allocation of Time (1965). Time is money. The more money you earn, the more valuable your time is. The more valuable something is, the less inclined you are to waste it. That is why people in London walk faster than people in rural Cornwall. It is why a banker is more likely to ask you to sponsor their ultramarathon effort than, say, a fisherman.But Bregman feels there may be nonmaterial factors at play, too. “We live in a sort of inverse welfare state, where the most important jobs – the nurses, the teachers, the refuse collectors – are paid the least. It’s actually the least important jobs – the management consultants, the financiers the bullshit jobs, in other words – that pay the most. So, my hypothesis is that the elites have demanding jobs in terms of energy and effort, but they provide them with no meaning. Humans are meaning-seeking creatures. If you’re sitting in the office all day sending emails to people you don’t like, writing reports that no one will read, designing financial products that only destroy wealth, building algorithms that make people click on more ads … it’s a pretty depressing existence, isn’t it? So, the less meaning you find in your 70-hour-a-week job, the more extreme you will get as you pursue your leisure time.”As Bregman points out, busyness is not a society-wide phenomenon: “It’s more something you see among the elites in the big cities, applying the high standards of their working lives to their leisure time, too.” Quality leisure, like quality work, is unevenly distributed.There is a gender bias, too. In 2015 (the most recent available data set), British men took an average of 43 hours of leisure time a week women took about 38 hours. “There isn’t much evidence to suggest that we’re getting less leisure time overall,” says Chris Payne, a senior research officer at the Office for National Statistics. “But women are seeing a reduction since 2000. Women are entering the labour market in greater numbers. Meanwhile, they’re not being compensated for the amount of unpaid work they do. Men aren’t really picking up the pieces back at home.” This, he adds, is an international trend: men train for triathlons while their wives look after the children.When I surveyed my friends, I discovered that quite a few had hobbies that they keep quiet about – usually something cultivated as an antidote to screens, “likes”, metrics and doing. One takes photographs on film and puts them up on a Tumblr, the URL of which she never shares. One mother I know finds time for pottery, chess and DJing. Especially since I moved out of London last year, it has been a pleasant surprise to discover that plenty of actual adults still play in bands and go rock climbing and perform wholesome public works. I have found time to go swimming, too. I have no desire to compete with anyone. I do it mostly because I enjoy the feeling of being suspended in another element, the coolness, weightlessness and motion. I also like the discernible progress I have made over six months with the aid of the occasional YouTube instructional video and notes from other swimmers: I have gone from thrashing around and panting whenever I attempted front crawl to serenely gliding up and down.One reason I like it is that getting into the right rhythm leaves room for almost no other thoughts. Another is that there is a straightforward relationship between effort and reward. If you keep at it, you get better. In very few areas of 21st-century life is that true. But, naturally, when I managed to swim a mile, I shared it on Instagram."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29154973f074960f0af69cc6dd7f29cd56de0967/0_50_2016_1210/master/2016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=09e9e989b476cafc49db8d6d0e45625a","title":"guardian passes 1m mark in reader donations katharine viner","story":"Business model showing way for journalism to ‘regain its relevance’, says editor-in-chiefMore than a million people worldwide have contributed to the  in the last three years, with 500,000 paying to support the publication on an ongoing basis, according to  News and Media’s editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner.She said the business model was showing a new way for journalism to “regain its relevance, meaning and trusted place in society”.Viner told the Society of Editors’ annual conference in Salford that many contributors donated specifically because they wanted the  to stay free and outside a paywall, so “progressive journalism can have the widest possible impact”.“Many readers didn’t understand the challenging commercial reality facing all news organisations, but once we told them more, they expressed real interest in wanting to support the ,” she said. “This was helped by the fact that any money made by the  has to be spent on journalism, because of our ownership structure with no shareholders or owner.“This entirely new revenue stream of monthly and one-off contributions is now a crucial part of our plan to get the  to break even by next April.

It’s totally inspiring.”The international development and women and equalities secretary, Penny Mordaunt, said the day was a celebration, but also a reminder “that there was still so much to do”.“The message I would give to women considering a career in politics is despite everything you hear, working here is fantastic, and if you think you might want to do it, the chances are you’d be quite good at it,” she said.Helen Pankhurst of the Centenary Action Group said: “This is a huge year in the history of the women’s movement … I just hope we aren’t waiting another 100 years until we achieve true equality.”The prime minister arranged for two delegates to come from her Maidenhead constituency. One of them, Tameena Hussain, 30, said she was already something of a political animal having been active in her local Conservative party association since her early 20s. Asked if the event had encouraged her to stand for office, she was equivocal. “Never say never,” she said, adding: “But, you know, parliament isn’t as scary as it’s made out to be. If you want to help people, then you shouldn’t let anyone put you off.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45c55662e022e50a93d029138471f2b6762ef7c1/0_19_1486_892/master/1486.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0ae6d98a4109073c0c5da2a6a31bcd45","title":"brexit pmqs may corbyn rudd says mps wont allow no deal brexit contradicting may politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happen, including Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn at PMQsThat’s all from me for today.Thanks for the comments.Earlier today Amber Rudd, the new work and pensions secretary, said that parliament would stop a no deal Brexit going ahead. (See 9.18am.) A majority of MPs would oppose a no Brexit, she said. Labour is also making this argument forcefully, and other opposition parties too. But is it actually true?The bit about a majority of MPs being opposed to a no deal Brexit is almost certainly right. There are Brexiters who think the risks associated with a no deal Brexit would be not excessive, or at least manageable, but they are a minority in the House of Commons, and easily outnumbered by the majority (almost all opposition MPs, and a sizeable chunk of Tories) who think that the risks would be unacceptable.But it does not follow from that that this “majority” would stop Brexit, for two reasons in particular.First, the “majority” would have to coalesce around an alternative a majority against something, a blocking majority, would have to convert into an enabling majority, ready to vote through an agreed plan. That is by no means inevitable because there are big isions among these MPs, of which the most important is the split between those who want to stop Brexit and those who believe it must proceed.Second, MPs can pass or block laws and motions, but they can’t dictate to the executive. Ultimately decisions about Brexit are taken by the government. The EU negotiates with Theresa May, not with parliament. It was May’s decision to trigger article 50. She needed the authority of parliament, through the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal Act), but it was her to decision to press the button.The only failsafe way by which a majority of MPs could stop a no deal Brexit would to oust May and replace her with a PM willing to ask the EU to suspend article 50 until a Brexit deal has been agreed. But Tory efforts in the last few days to replace May have failed, and if she were to go, she would probably be replaced by someone advocating an even harder line on Brexit.Alternatively, MPs could pass a vote of no confidence in May and replace her with a prime minister running a new administration. In the past the loss of a no confidence vote would automatically trigger a general election. Under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, that is no longer the case, and, before an election took place, an alternative PM would have 14 days to win a confidence vote in the Commons. But the legislation does not specify who would get to try. (A new leader from the governing party, the opposition leader, someone else entirely?) It is hard to see the Tories losing a no confidence motion, and even harder to imagine the Queen inviting Jeremy Corbyn to form a minority government if it is inevitable that he will lose a confidence vote.Labour says its preferred option would be a general election. But the Fixed-term Parliaments Act also comes into play here, and if the no confidence route fails, then the only other way an election can be triggered would be through a two-thirds majority of MPs, meaning May would have to order her party to vote for one. It is not inconceivable that she might choose this route as a means of trying to resolve a Brexit impasse, but it does seem most improbable. The EU would probably agree to suspend article 50 pending the arrival of a new government, but an election could result in another hung parliament, with no majority for any alternative Brexit course of action.That leaves the legislative and resolution options. This morning John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said Labour could use “a war of attrition” to block the legislation due to be passed before 29 March to implement Brexit. (See 12pm.) But most of this legislation is about making Brexit practical. Unless MPs can repeal the EU Withdrawal Act, Brexit will happen. Perhaps, if MPs were to sabotage legislation and make a no deal Brexit even more chaotic than expected, the PM might blink, and suspend article 50, but, as a strategy, that’s a bit of a long shot.The other main options involve passing motions or amendments requiring May to go negotiate an alternative Brexit, or to make Brexit conditional on a referendum. But there are huge practical problems in organising a referendum at short notice (well explained in this Constitution Unit briefing paper - pdf) and in practice it would not happen without a government committed to passing the relevant legislation. The same problem applies to the plan to get MPs to vote for an alternative strategy. As David Natzler, clerk of the Commons, explained recently, May could just ignore this. So, to sum up, despite what opposition leaders are saying, it would be very hard for a majority of MPs to block a no deal Brexit if the prime minister were determined to go ahead with one. In practice, would May back down? Perhaps. But that would primarily be as a result of political pressure, not because of procedural powers available to MPs.It will take two years to have a fully operational customs system at the UK border if the UK crashes out of the European Union without a deal, MPs were told this afternoon. As the Press Association reports, the Commons Treasury committee was told that “functioning but clearly sub-optimal” arrangements could be in place on March 29 2019 when the UK leaves but there would be a risk of failing to collect tariffs owed on imports.Officials also said the prospect of traffic chaos at ports was a “known unknown” and could not be ruled out. Giving evidence to the committee, HM Revenue and Customs chief executive Jon Thompson said: The date for putting in an optimal customs system for the UK in the event of no deal was passed months ago.Asked about the prospect of queues at ports, he replied:It is plausible that there would be delays at the border. It’s very difficult to answer your question because we have a known unknown.If you are going to go from Dover to Calais, you cannot know exactly how the French authorities would react when your lorry arrives there and whether or not there would or would not be a queue.And senior HMRC official Jim Harra told the committee: We have in place plans that in the event of us leaving on March 29 with no deal, we will be able to operate a functioning customs border with the EU.We would start off with a functioning but clearly sub-optimal customs border. There would likely be some fiscal risk attached to that depending on what tariff decisions are ... I think we are looking at a minimum of two years from the no deal to get to a point where you can say we have a steady-state system where we are comfortable that we can manage all the fiscal risks in a way we would like and trade can flow in the way we would like.This is from my colleague Daniel Boffey.Theresa May has arrived at the European commission HQ for her meeting with Jean-Claude Juncker, the commission president.Downing Street has played down reports (see 2.53pm) that Sunday’s EU summit, where the Brexit deal is supposed to be signed off, could be cancelled. This is from PoliticsHome’s Kevin Schofield.But earlier today Valdis Dombrovskis, a European commission vice president said that for Sunday’s summit to go ahead, “we will need to have agreed beforehand the political declaration on the future relationship and we are not there yet”. He added: Sherpas are due to meet on Friday. They will need to see a final text before then, and the Commission stands ready to consider the text and take any action at any time.Well-wishers have been sending messages of support to second world war veteran and political activist Harry Leslie Smith, who is critically ill in hospital with suspected pneumonia following a fall. As the Press Association reports, the 95-year-old, who has also been a  contributor, was in a critical condition on Wednesday, according to his son John, whom Harry was visiting in Canada when the accident occurred. The PA story goes on:Tweeting from his father’s account, John wrote on Wednesday: “24 hours in and Harry is still in emerg waiting for an ICU bed thanks to the politics of austerity in Ontario.” He added that the Barnsley-born activist had been allowed to drink a cup of tea. Back in the UK, friends and supporters were sending their best wishes, led by opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn and other Labour MPs.Mr Corbyn wrote: “Very sorry to hear this. Please pass on my best to Harry. We need him to get well soon as the National Health Service, and our movement, needs him,” while deputy leader Tom Watson added: “You are in my thoughts Harry.” Smith, who was a pilot in the second world war, spoke passionately about the NHS at the Labour party conference in 2014. He has been a notable campaigner against austerity, gaining a big following on social media and even starting his own podcast. Stars from the world of entertainment also sent their best wishes. Chocolat author Joanne Harris wrote: “Thinking tonight of Harryslaststand, a firebrand and a hero,” while actor Adrian Lester described him as “an inspiration”. The hashtag #IStandWithHarry trended on Wednesday morning as people continued to send their support. John sent a string of updates on his father’s condition, describing his cough as “bone shattering” as he slept again on Wednesday afternoon. Harry initially went in to hospital on Tuesday, tweeting himself before his son took over: “Bugger of a day, had a fall and now I am in hospital. It’s nothing just low blood pressure, but signing off for the next few hours.” After the huge show of support for his father, John tweeted: “He sleeps and when he wakes for a moment I tell him about the love flowing out from Twitter. ‘tell them I love them all.”’This is from Stefan Rousseau, the Political Association’s chief political photographer.I missed this yesterday, but it is worth flagging it it’s from Vytenis Andriukaitis, Lithuania’s European commissioner, who has managed in one tweet to have a go at both the European Research Group (pictured at the top, from yesterday’s ERG press conference) and Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, who implicitly compared the EU to the Soviet Union in his Tory conference speech. Andriukaitis was an anti-communist activist before the Soviet Union disbanded.Carwyn Jones, the Welsh first minister, met Theresa May earlier today to discuss Brexit. Afterwards he posted this on Twitter.According to Bloomberg, the EU summit planned for Sunday to sign off the withdrawal agreement “may not go ahead if the final part of the Brexit deal isn’t completed by Thursday morning”.I agree with the people of Romford who are deeply unhappy by the proposed EU deal, which they believe does not represent the Brexit they voted for. Will she now, even at this late stage, please think again and instead lead our country in a new direction completely cutting away the tentacles of the EU over our cherished island nation once and for all?But Neil Parish, who backed remain in the referendum, also expressed concerns. He said the Irish backstop “threatens the integrity of the UK” and advised May to listen to concerns raised by MPs. May defended her plans.In the absence of agreed solutions, as set out in the previous paragraph, the United Kingdom will ensure that no new regulatory barriers develop between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom, unless, consistent with the 1998 Agreement, the Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly agree that distinct arrangements are appropriate for Northern Ireland.He asked why the same assurance was not in the withdrawal agreement. “Did she push the delete button?” May replied by saying that these were issues for the UK as a whole, and that the Northern Ireland assembly could not take these decisions because it was suspended. This is from BBC Northern Ireland’s Jayne McCormack.It has been brought to my attention that some football skills were displayed in the chamber yesterday evening after the House rose. I am informed that the doorkeepers on duty told the members concerned that the chamber was not the place for this activity, however, those doorkeepers were advised that permission had been given. Let me assure the House that that permission certainly did not come from me. I have received gracious, indeed fulsome, letters of apology from (Crouch, Peacock and Haigh) in relation to this incident. I think I can speak for us all when I say that our historic chamber should not be used for this type of activity and I gently remind colleagues if they are seeking to use the chamber outside of sitting hours beyond for the purpose of simply showing it to guests, frankly they should write to me asking for their request to be considered. I have said what I have said, there are no hard feelings and I consider the matter to be closed.Labour has just held a lobby briefing, and Jeremy Corbyn’s spokesman said that Conservatives were “no longer able to govern” in the light of the DUP decision to withhold support in the Commons. But there was no indication that Labour would call for a vote of no confidence soon.The spokesman said that Labour wanted to consider the deal that the government had negotiated, and then submit its “alternative Brexit plan” at the time of the meaningful vote. Under that party’s plan the UK would remain in “a comprehensive customs union” with the EU which would “make unnecessary largely any kind of backstop arrangement”.That remains in line with Labour’s conference policy to oppose May’s deal if it fails the party’s tests first and then, if it fails to pass the Commons, to push for a general election.The spokesman was also asked why Corbyn was not present in the Commons on Monday night, when in voting on amendments on the finance bill, the government came within five votes of defeat on a child poverty amendment after the DUP unexpectedly sided with the opposition. He said: We don’t comment on detailed whipping arrangements, Jeremy had permission to be absent from parliament, the decision of the DUP was taken at the last moment.When asked if Corbyn was absent because he was “too tired” by one reporter, the spokesman added: I’m not getting in the details. Jeremy has an extremely ambitious work schedule which he carries out with extraordinary energy.For those interested in the Theresa MayIan Blackford exchanges, there is a beefed-up account in an update at 1.21pm. You have have to refresh the page to get the update to appear.Speaking to journalists after PMQs, the prime minister’s spokesman doggedly insisted the confidence and supply arrangement that underpins her governing majority remains in place - despite the DUP apparently being on strike. “It’s published and I’m not aware of any change to its status,” he said.Pressed further, the spokesman simply added: “It’s our position that the confidence and supply arrangement is still in effect”.Asked about the £1bn-plus in extra resources the DUP was promised to seal the deal, he said:The money that has been agreed and is being paid down through the normal estimates process is for the people of Northern Ireland.This is from ITV’s Carl Dinnen.No 10 may be right when it says that it has not lost votes because of lack of support from the DUP. But that is only because on some votes it has accepted opposition amendments."},{"url":null,"title":"first ever plane with no moving parts takes flight","story":"Flight represents breakthrough that could lead eventually to carbon-neutral air travelThe first ever “solid state” plane, with no moving parts in its propulsion system, has successfully flown for a distance of 60 metres, proving that heavier-than-air flight is possible without jets or propellers.The flight represents a breakthrough in “ionic wind” technology, which uses a powerful electric field to generate charged nitrogen ions, which are then expelled from the back of the aircraft, generating thrust.Steven Barrett, an aeronautics professor at MIT and the lead author of the study published in the journal Nature, said the inspiration for the project came straight from the science fiction of his childhood. “I was a big fan of Star Trek, and at that point I thought that the future looked like it should be planes that fly silently, with no moving parts – and maybe have a blue glow. But certainly no propellers or turbines or anything like that. So I started looking into what physics might make flight with no moving parts possible, and came across a concept known as the ionic wind, with was first investigated in the 1920s.“This didn’t make much progress in that time. It was looked at again in the 1950s, and researchers concluded that it couldn’t work for aeroplanes. But I started looking into this and went through a period of about five years, working with a series of graduate students to improve fundamental understanding of how you could reduce ionic winds efficiently, and how that could be optimised.”In the prototype plane, wires at the leading edge of the wing have 600 watts of electrical power pumped through them at 40,000 volts. This is enough to induce “electron cascades”, ultimately charging air molecules near the wire. Those charged molecules then flow along the electrical field towards a second wire at the back of the wing, bumping into neutral air molecules on the way, and imparting energy to them. Those neutral air molecules then stream out of the back of the plane, providing thrust.The end result is a propulsion system that is entirely electrically powered, almost silent, and with a thrust-to-power ratio comparable to that achieved by conventional systems such as jet engines.Prof Guy Gratton, an aerospace engineer and visiting professor at Cranfield University, said: “It’s clearly very early days: but the team at MIT have done something we never previously knew was possible in using accelerated ionised gas to propel an aircraft. Aeronautical engineers around the world are already trying hard to find ways to use electric propulsion, and this technology will offer something else that in the future may allow manned and unmanned aircraft to be more efficient, and non-polluting. In particular, the fact that they have already got this out of the laboratory, and flown a battery driven model aircraft – albeit so far on a very small and controlled scale – is very exciting.”The successful flight of the plane – which has no name beyond the uninspiring “Version Two” – owes as much to the engineering prowess required to make it as thin and light as possible as it does to the propulsion method itself. The plane weighs just 2.45kg, but manages to fit in a five-metre wing, battery stack, and a high-voltage power converter.In the immediate future, the MIT team hope to increase the range and speed of the plane, primarily by scaling up the size of the overall machine. Potential applications in the short term include unmanned drones, where silent flight may be beneficial, and high-altitude solar-powered flight, where the lack of moving parts could allow such a plane to soar for years on end, acting as a pseudo-satellite.In the longer term, the ability to power flight purely through electricity opens up the possibility of carbon-neutral flight, which could lower the emissions of the aviation industry globally.Barrett also noted that solid state propulsion tends to miniaturise well, and suggested that smaller drones than those currently possible with rotor-based flight could take-off using an ionic wind drive in the future. “Solid state things lend themselves to scaling down quite well,” he said, “creating extremely small flight vehicles that serve uses we can’t imagine.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e12e5da30a17ae10f3fcad6660269a7f6897a334/0_0_3001_2001/master/3001.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=504bd15661b50e585203c36d2116d3d1 1760w","title":"the flexible workspaces with community and wellbeing in their fabric","story":"As working habits change, co-working spaces that put people at their heart are finding popularity with small businesses and entrepreneursIf there’s one thing most successful businesses have in common, it’s a strong professional network. From institutional networking organisations to local business community groups, opportunities to build mutually supportive relationships with like-minded professionals are the lifeblood of many a thriving enterprise.Jane Rutter set up Zeal, a digital and creative agency, eight years ago. She attributes “a significant proportion” of its growth to the networks she’s built as a direct result of utilising co-working spaces. The business currently has two offices one based in a Bruntwood building in Leeds and another in a similar collaborative co-working space in London. Bruntwood provides inspiring workspaces and office environments across 140 buildings in the north and Midlands.Basing the team in co-working spaces “really helped us grow as an agency because it generates so many new leads,” she says. “There are always useful networking events happening, and there’s a customer community portal we can use to communicate with other businesses based in the same building who we’d like to explore working with.”As well as creating easily accessible networking opportunities, Rutter says working alongside other businesses in shared spaces has created a ready-made sense of community for her and her team, enhancing both professional development and personal wellbeing.“There’s a whole schedule of wellbeing programmes on offer that boost staff morale and encourage personal development, from yoga classes and free ice-cream to knowledge-sharing sessions where you can pick up new skills,” she adds.Networks play another important role – offsetting the sense of isolation that many business owners feel. Burnout is common among entrepreneurs, but having people to bounce ideas off or sense-check a piece of work can be enormously reassuring.“Loneliness is one of the biggest problems for the self-employed – particularly freelancers – but being part of a collaborative workspace allows you to build relationships with others in your position who understand the pressures of being in business,” says Carl Reader, author of The Startup Coach and The Franchising Handbook.“While friends and family understand that self-employment is different, they don’t always fully appreciate the challenges that a business owner faces every day. There’s also a business benefit from the new relationships you build – when business associates get to know you and your business, they can become a great source of new work. Sometimes, that’s the perfect medicine for the stress of self-employment.”From a psychological perspective, being part of a business network has had a “massive” impact on Rutter, offsetting the sense that she carries the full weight of the business on her shoulders and that there’s nobody to turn to for advice or input.“As a direct result of the workspaces we’ve used, I’ve made lots of friends who run their own agencies, and they’re the people I turn to when I lose a client or have a big win to celebrate,” she says.“I can tell friends about the challenges I’m facing and they’ll offer support and buy me a drink, but my professional network will offer support, buy me a drink, and then talk me through the practicalities of what I should do or how they dealt with a similar situation.”Ultimately, of course, people are employed to deliver results for an employer, which is why investing in their wellbeing is simply good business practice.“Happy, healthy people are the biggest asset to any business. Human beings aren’t just units of production, and workspaces that treat them as such create a battery hen experience where wellbeing suffers, presenteeism reigns and productivity drops,” says Toby Sproll, director of retail, amenity and community at Bruntwood.He points out that the way in which people work is evolving, and working environments need to reflect that. “New trends and technologies are changing workplace habits, so modern businesses need flexible workspaces, and that means the design of office buildings and the spaces within them have to have people at their heart.”Sproll says: “Work takes up so much of our daily lives – wouldn’t it be better if you could have some fun, learn something new, and potentially make a difference to your local community while you’re there?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dcf4a5bdc6b5d02afe3fd6f82bd26b58c841f95e/0_380_7952_4771/master/7952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1744e794acc4430ea14dbf00e0277055","title":"its important to feel connected companies share their co working experiences","story":"Achieving a true work-life balance is notoriously difficult, whether you’re a working parent, first-time entrepreneur or a senior business leader.

We all have young families – I’ve got a six-month-old baby – and work-life balance to us means spending as much time as possible with them. We just don’t believe in working loads of hours for the sake of it. If you can’t do your work in 40 hours, then your business is not efficient. Eventually we’d love to implement a four-day week.We try to trust that our people will do their work. I think breakfast is very important, so we make sure everyone has everything they want, from potato cakes to cinnamon and raisin bagels. We also go for “family meals” once a month. You spend a lot of time with people at work, especially in a small team, so it’s important to feel connected.As long as you have the internet and a computer or your phone you don’t need much else.

But in terms of how we run our office, we employ professionals and we’re paying them to do their job – not to sit in the same place for a set number of hours. Our staff work from home when they need to and our office computer system tells us if projects are on track. The days of finishing a meeting at 3.30pm and wasting time travelling into the office are over and we have to accept this.My problem is that my work is also my hobby, so if I am sitting thinking I could watch television, I’d rather be sorting out work instead. But I am genuinely happiest when I am not switched off. We had a staff meeting yesterday and I asked everyone how we could be more efficient. One of our tips was to use spreadsheets instead of Word. Engineers sometimes want to write reams of technical jargon that nobody has time to read, that can be communicated more succinctly. I’m happy if staff go to the gym at 11am to avoid the lunchtime rush it’s more efficient on their time. I’m actually out and about so much that it’s refreshing being back in the office.

I basically never go to bed on the same day I wake up, but constant trips across the pond mean I don’t get jetlag.When we set up Notch we wanted to employ some of the brightest scientific minds out of university, and if you take me out of the Manchester office the average age is 23. We’re not a 9-5 business, so we have to allow people to have time out during the day.I, personally, rarely stop working, but I love getting up in the morning. Even if I don’t always have time to go to the gym, I find a way to complete 10,000 steps in a day. I walk to the station in the morning and back in the evening and I leave the office for about 40 minutes to walk around the city, to ponder. You have to be mindful of stress levels when you’re in an industry like ours, so we encourage our staff to do as much as they can.

You also get to scale up without changing buildings, meaning you can concentrate on the work at handScaling a startup into a bigger business is hugely exciting for founders and their teams, and getting to that next level can depend on having the right ecosystem of support, contacts, community, and the right working environment.Firms based in co-working spaces or shared offices, for example, benefit on several fronts. The fact that maintaining the space is someone else’s responsibility frees up time for entrepreneurs to focus on growing their business. They can also access breakout spaces if they need headspace to think through an idea.However, the two key benefits these types of working spaces offer SMEs looking to scale up are flexibility and the chance to make valuable contacts, says Carl Reader, business advisor and author of The Startup Coach.“As your business grows it’s easier to move to a bigger office space within the same building, without the logistical issues that arise when you change your physical address and phone number,” he says. “You could find your nextdoor neighbour is the ideal person to help with the recruitment of your next team member, while the people you meet at the coffee machines may well be your next suppliers, customers, or even joint-venture partners.”Eagle Labs, part of Barclays UK Ventures, are dedicated co-working office and event spaces where businesses can work, attend technical events and participate in industry-focused transformation programmes. The flexible working environment supports the scale-up process, and promotes collaborative innovation across the entire entrepreneurial ecosystem.Location has been crucial to the progress of Wattl, a video platform startup launched in 2016. A year ago the company joined Mi-Idea, a post-accelerator programme run jointly by Bruntwood and Cisco, which included two years of free office space in the Bright Building located on Manchester Science Park. The move is already paying idends for the company’s growth prospects, says its co-founder Emma Ryan.“We’re a tech startup and we are bootstrapping, so this is much more than office space, it is also a huge source of support,” she says. “We’ve had opportunities to do pitching practice, and attend pitching competitions. Until now, all our focus has been on developing the platform’s technology, but we are at the point of needing investors, and there are events organised where we get to meet them. This is the ideal environment and ecosystem for our stage of growth.”Opportunities to meet other tech startups, all running different types of business, but facing the same issues and challenges, have also proved invaluable. “There is a sense of having support from those around you, and that you’re not on your own doing something that is really hard,” adds Ryan.Established in 2013, cybersecurity business Altinet has also benefited from its location in Bruntwood’s Platform building in central Leeds. Co-founder Henry Doyle says: “We are quite a young workforce, 20-strong and growing. This building, with its central location and amazing amenities, is allowing us to attract talent from the city and beyond.”Altinet is housed in its own office on the fifth floor, but its staff enjoy close contact with those of the 50 or so other companies based in Platform, making use of the mezzanine floor, a communal space complete with sofas, pods and coffee machines. They also take part in the many events organised by Bruntwood, from sports to breakfast clubs.Doyle says: “There’s a real sense of community, comprising of almost every service provider you can think of law firms, accountants, web designers, marketing agencies, and finance companies, all under one roof. It’s good to know that we also have space to grow – our office has room for another 20 people – so we don’t have to think about relocating as we move through this next crucial phase of growth.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38d2767844a0161a30d928e3c0770f313b3b8997/0_47_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=589f96c3d8d949d0293699caadef06be","title":"tom scudamore fit on course ride thistlecrack betfair chase horse racing tips","story":"• Rider has been sidelined since Cheltenham fall at weekend• Thistlecrack available at 10-1 for Saturday’s Haydock prizeTom Scudamore has been passed fit to ride Thistlecrack in Saturday’s keenly anticipated Betfair Chase, despite fears he might have sustained significant injuries at Cheltenham last Saturday. The veteran jockey was taken to hospital that evening and has not ridden since but was cleared by the sport’s senior medical advisor, Dr Jerry Hill, after a series of tests at Oaksey House in Lambourn on Wednesday.“Obviously, I got a bit of a kicking from King’s Socks on Saturday,” Scudamore said. “They took me to hospital more as a precaution because I was a bit short of breath and they wanted to make sure I hadn’t punctured a lung or anything. That was all clear, I had some x-rays and I just needed a couple of days off.”Scudamore insists he never doubted that he would be fit to return to action at some point this week. Just the same, it is a relief to him that he will not be barred from continuing his association with Thistlecrack, on whom he won the King George VI Chase in 2016.No other jockey has sat on the horse in a race since he was fifth under Aidan Coleman in the Imperial Cup three and a half years ago. The following month, Scudamore and Thistlecrack won a Grade One at Aintree by a wide margin at 25-1.“I feel good,” the jockey added. “Been a lot better with each passing day. I was feeling a bit sorry for myself on Saturday night but I rode out yesterday and this morning. It was painful watching my brother’s horse win yesterday with someone else on it but other than that it’s been fine.”Thistlecrack has been hampered by injuries in the last 18 months and punters are mostly sceptical about his chance of returning to top-class form on Saturday, making him a 10-1 shot against Might Bite, Native River and Bristol De Mai. “He’s looking well,” Scudamore reports. “I’m very happy with him, Colin Tizzard is very happy with him, but he’s got to go and show it. It’s going to be a tremendous race and there’s no reason we can’t be very competitive. He feels in a good vein of form but obviously it’s a different thing from going and doing it for real.”A decision is expected on Thursday on whether Might Bite will be partnered by his regular jockey, Nico de Boinville, who is struggling with a thumb injury.

The world has seen a new superstar in tennis.”Becker, who hobbles on legs that have taken a pounding and looks older than his 50 years, has not always been inclined to laugh at himself, given his wrangles with wives, girlfriends and the tax man, and his star on the court roared, flickered and fizzed until he retired in 1999, the owner of six grand slams and a bucketload of other titles.As for Zverev, the 21-year-old treated spectators at the O2 Arena in London to a close-up, day-by-day insight into his character and potential as he smiled, grimaced, joked, cavilled and ultimately prevailed to have the best weekend of his life, lifting the trophy by beating a pair of legends with a mixture of power and fearlessness.Saturday was good and bad. He beat a fading Federer but incurred the wrath of the boorish wing of the Swiss’s faithful when, correctly, he halted play in mid-exchange because a ballboy had dropped a ball in his line of vision, behind Federer. And then he beat him, the greater crime.Zverev – a genial and intelligent young man whose self-belief can be misinterpreted as arrogance – was visibly upset, and was rescued in a memorable TV interview by the kind intervention of Annabel Croft, who chided the fans for their behaviour.Sunday, though, was the perfect ending to a week in which he had wobbled badly against the dominant Djokovic in the group stage. He got his revenge by listening to the best advice he will ever get – from his new and possibly long-term coach, Ivan Lendl: attack.It is the same advice Lendl gave Andy Murray to help win three majors. It is the same advice Becker gave Djokovic to help him win six of his 14 majors. As simple a mantra as it is, it works – and that should be Zverev’s biggest prize from the end-of-season tournament.Becker saw other qualities in Zverev but a willingness to listen was near the top of his list. “I can sense Lendl’s signature mentally in him as he is taking on these big matches,” Becker said. “You won’t win by waiting for an opponent to make a mistake. Djokovic and Federer are too big stars to do that. He needs to understand the only way forward is doing right thing, even though you don’t win every point, but come forward. It’s the right step to take.”There was something else, though. “It’s not only the fact he has beaten the world No 1 and Roger Federer, it’s the way he carries himself. He understands the responsibility that title has and he has done a great job with it.”If that quality stays with Zverev when his game inevitably dips, when the crowd are not always with him, when someone sorts out the weaknesses he is still working on – his cramped forehand, his occasional impetuosity – he has a great shot to emulate the deeds of his country’s best male player.And he would do well to avoid the mistakes Becker has made."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/72e1af51ad69ac9c464d56c0ae538d0fff883f6a/0_159_4055_2433/master/4055.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f08c5a3a951f9ff2ce80a56635a6970d","title":"magnus carlsen v fabiano caruana world chess championship game 9 live","story":"Caruana is asked about the looming specter of a tiebreak next Wednesday if the next three matches end in draws. The Norwegian, who in addition to his No 1 ranking is the world’s top rated rapid player and top rated blitz player (compared to Caruana’s respective ratings of No 8 and No 16), will be a heavy favorite if the match ends 6-all and goes to the tie-breaker, which consists of a series of matches under tighter time controls. Simply put, it’s been 13 years since Carlsen lost a tiebreak. “I’m really not thinking about the tiebreak now,” the American says. “If we get there then I’ll start to think about it, but there’s still a lot of chess to be played.”He adds: “And I really don’t agree with most people about my chances in the tie-break.”“I felt like I had a comfortable advantage and then I just blew it,” a clearly disappointed Carlsen says. “I was poor.”Carlsen is asked whether his eye injury had any effect on today’s game.“He was prepared quite deeply up until (17. Qd1),” Caruana says. “He knew what was going on and then I had to start groveling. I didn’t really want to go for this position with opposite-colored bishops but I didn’t see a choice. Other things were a bit unpleasant but my drawing chances were really high.”He adds: “I didn’t at any point feel like my position was much worse, I just felt it was slightly worse.”Eight more moves and no progress. This is a draw. The moves, for the record: 41. a6 Bd4 42. Kg2 Kf6 43. f4 Bb6 44. Kf3 h6 45. Ke4 Ba7 46. Bg4 Bg1 47. Kd5 Bb6 48. Kc6 Be3 49.

The players gain an additional 50 minutes on their clocks after their 40th moves (40. a5 Kg7). Another peaceful result forthcoming.A quick flurry of moves: 31. ... Bc5 32. Rg1 Rxg1+ 33. Kxg1 Bd6 34. Qa4 f4 35. Qxa7 fxe3 36. Qxe3. The position looks drawish but Caruana has less than 10 minutes to make his next four moves before the time control. Carlsen has taken more time on his last couple of moves and the rook exchange would seem to keep the draw closer: 27. Bf3 h4 28. Rxd8 Rxd8 29. gxh4. But the champion’s choice to keep the queens on the board indicates he still believes in a winning chance. A bit risky but we are here for it. The supercomputer has it dead even.A sound response by Caruana with 26. ... f5. The computer seems to confirm that Carlsen rushed it with 25. h5. The challenger is not out of the woods yet, but Carlsen appears to have let him off the hook. Says Peter Svidler: “He’s just not playing his best chess.”Caruana accepts the h-pawn (25. ... gxh5). Carlsen quickly answers with 26. Qc4. The time pressure continues to mount for the challenger, who is under a half hour. That gives him less than 30 minutes to make his next 15 moves. Says Nakamura: “If he doesn’t find the right moves here, he’s just going to lose.”Carlsen offers a pawn with 25. h5, drawing criticism from both the computers and the pundits. It wipes away nearly all of his advantage per Stockfish, while Nakamura calls it a “strange move” in the commentary booth. “It feels a little bit premature to me,” the American grandmaster says. “It’s a peculiar choice by Magnus.”Caruana spends another 10 minutes before playing 23. ... Qe7. Carlsen, with time to burn, takes six minutes before answering with 24. h4. Caruana immediately comes back with 24. ... g6.

White slightly better according to the engines and Polgar.Caruana responds with the drastic and potentially dubious 17. ... Bxf3. Maybe we should tack a !? on it. The evaluation engine spikes from 0.00 to +0.83 to Carlsen. It’s caused the grandmaster Anish Giri to nearly drop his cup of tea, while Susan Polgar admits: “This move does not smell good.” Says Russian grandmaster Peter Svidler: “It’s an incredible curious choice to take on f3 here, even if you think you will eventually hold this. In general you are giving Magnus exactly what he wants from this game. A stable advantage forever with no way to completely equalize.”The good news for Caruana is the Sesse supercomputer indicates that black has equalized. The bad news is he’s spent another 12 minutes (and counting) considering his response to 17. Qd1. He’s below 50 minutes and nearly an hour behind Carlsen on move 17. Caruana expends another eight minutes before taking Carlsen’s d-pawn and the champion immediately accepts the trade (14 ... exd4 15. cxd4). Caruana threatens white’s queen with his bishop (15. ... Be4) and Carlsen escapes while putting black in check (16. Qb3). Caruana intervenes with his bishop (16. ... Bd5) and Carlsen retreats (17. Qd1). The American is more than 40 minutes behind on time. Caruana has nearly four more minutes than what he started with due to the 30-second increment after each move.Caruana finally decides on 13. ... Bd5 after 21 minutes. Carlsen responds in 72 seconds with 14. Qc2. He’s moving quickly as Caruana finds himself more than a half hour behind on the clock already.Caruana is in the tank on move 13. He’s been weighing his response to Carlsen’s 13. d4 for more than 20 minutes now. Out of prep, it seems. Caruana spends nearly 10 minutes before coming back with 12. ... Bb6. Carlsen needs only seconds to attack the center with 13. d4 and the American is taking his time again. Carlsen’s wounded eye looking perfectly fine in the playing hall.It seems Carlsen is trying to take Caruana out of book with 9. Bg5. But the challenger answers quickly with 9. ... Nxc3. Caruana responding with pace over the next couple of moves (10. bxc3 f6 11. Bc1 Be6), but Carlsen’s 12. Bb2 prompts the first long think of the match. He’s been pondering the position for the last eight minutes (and counting).The geographically appropriate English Opening is on the board (1. c4)! This is the same opening as the fourth game and the parallel lines extend for Carlsen’s first eight moves (1. c4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. g3 d5 5. cxd5 Nxd5 6. Bg2 Bc5 7. O-O O-O 8. d3 Re8) until he deviates with 9. Bg5. This is a bit of a surprise because Carlsen had only played the English once in 37 previous classical games with Caruana enter Game 4 and he didn’t really get much from it in that contest.Carlsen had an eventful rest day. Sparring with Anthony Joshua? Not exactly. The champion’s doctor Dr Brede Kvisvik told Norwegian broadcaster NRK that Carlsen picked up a shiner and sustained a minor head injury in a collision while having a kickabout. “There’s no concussion, as we had feared,” Kvisvik said.Brede said Carlsen otherwise was fine, and the cut he also sustained “isn’t so big that we need to do anything with it.” No stitches were necessary and ice was applied to ward off swelling. “If he has any vision problems, then it can be difficult,” Brede added, but he claimed Carlsen’s brain was “functioning just as well” as always.The doctor thus didn’t think Carlsen would need to call in sick for the ninth game in a championship that remains even against challenger Fabiano Caruana. The two players have tied every single round they’ve played and currently stand at 4-4.“He (Carlsen) actually thought it was kind of funny that he got hit during football training,” Brede said. “It looked worse than it was,” with the doctor adding that Carlsen chose to keep playing football as a break from the chess board, and received his doctor’s permission.Caruana’s best winning chance of the match so far came in Monday’s eighth game. The challenger had the Carlsen down nearly an hour on the clock and facing a shaky position in the middlegame. His advantage per the Stockfish evaluation engine had ballooned to +2.45 after 22. ... dxc5 and was a still-formidable +1.95 after 23. ... Bd6. “For sure this was the moment that I was most worried,” Carlsen would later say.The reaction by the American grandmaster Hikaru Nakamura, a visitor in the Chess commentary booth, said it all.Hello and welcome to London for today’s ninth game of the world chess championship between Norway’s Magnus Carlsen and Fabiano Caruana of the United States. Play resumes today after with the best-of-12-games match deadlocked at 4-all following eight draws in as many games.Carlsen, 27, has been ranked No 1 for eight straight years and was considered the world’s best player even before he defeated Viswanathan Anand for the title in 2013. Caruana, 26, is ranked No 2, having earned his place at the table by winning the candidates tournament in March. No American-born player has won or even competed for the world title since Bobby Fischer in 1972.\u0026nbspIt marks the first title match between the world\u0027s top two players since 1990, when Garry Kasparov and Anatoly Karpov faced off for a fifth and final time.\u0026nbspThe match will consist of 12 classical games with each player awarded one point for a win and a half-point for a draw. Whoever reaches six and a half points first will be declared the champion.The time control for each game is 100 minutes for the first 40 moves, 50 minutes for the next 20 moves and then 15 minutes for the rest of the game plus an additional 30 seconds per move starting from move 1. Players cannot agree to a draw before Black\u0027s 30th move.\u0026nbspIf the match is tied after 12 games, tie-breaks will be played on the final day in the following order:\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp• Best of four rapid games with 25 minutes for each player with an increment of 10 seconds after each move.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp• If still tied, they will play up to five mini-matches of two blitz games (five minutes for each player with a three-second increment).\u0026nbsp• If all five mini-matches are drawn, one sudden-death \u0027Armegeddon\u0027 match will be played where White receives five minutes and Black receives four minutes. Both players will receive a three-second increment after the 60th move. In the case of a draw, Black will be declared the winner.Thu 8 Nov – Opening ceremony Fri 9 Nov – Game 1\u0026nbspSat 10 Nov – Game 2 Sun 11 Nov – Rest day Mon 12 Nov – Game 3 Tue 13 Nov – Game 4 Wed 14 Nov – Rest day Thu 15 Nov – Game 5 Fri 16 Nov – Game 6 Sat 17 Nov – Rest day Sun 18 Nov – Game 7 Mon 19 Nov –\u0026nbspGame 8 Tue 20 Nov –\u0026nbspRest day Wed 21 Nov – Game 9 Thu 22 Nov –\u0026nbspGame 10 Fri 23 Nov –\u0026nbspRest day Sat 24 Nov – Game 11 Sun 25 Nov – Rest day Mon 26 Nov – Game 12 Tue 27 Nov – Rest day Wed 28 Nov – Tie-break gamesAwards and closingThe games commence each day at 3pm in London.A brief refresher: Game 1 was a grueling seven-hour, 115-move staredown, where Carlsen nearly become the first defending champion to win the opening game of a world championship with the black pieces in 37 years. The next four contests – Game 2, Game 3, Game 4 and Game 5 – were mostly safer, straightforward affairs where Caruana was able to get his teeth in the match. The tension ramped up in Friday’s Game 6 when Carlsen was outplayed by Caruana in the middlegame and pushed to the limit before saving a draw with incredibly precise defending. They played to another draw in Sunday’s Game 7, a result that left the champion lamenting his gun-shy play as white. Then came Monday’s Game 8, where Carlsen found himself down nearly an hour on the clock facing a dangerous position as black, until one false step by the American let him off the hook and the pair settled for a yet another peaceful result after three hours and 43 minutes.Carlsen, 27, has been ranked No 1 for eight straight years and was considered the world’s best player even before he defeated Viswanathan Anand for the title in 2013. Caruana, 26, is ranked No 2, having earned his place at the table by winning the candidates tournament in March.

But the Norwegian, who in addition to his No 1 ranking is the world’s top rated rapid player and top rated blitz player, will be a warm favorite if the match ends 6-all and goes to the tie-breaker, which consists of a series of matches under tighter time controls. That looming prospect should compel Caruana to take risks in the closing games, particularly as white, that he might have eschewed in earlier games.Will today be the day first blood is finally drawn? We’ll soon find out with Game 9 kicking off at the top of the hour.Bryan will be here shortly. In the meantime here’s his report from Monday’s eighth game, where Carlsen admitted he was “happy to survive” after getting pushed to the limit by his dogged American challenger."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25d1d746261d23862bf732e3420b77b481afb4ac/0_136_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bde8f1d3da45cae56e409d763ad4280e","title":"facebook criticised for post promoting child bride auction","story":"Company failed to remove post that informed users of auction of 17-year-old girl for several daysFacebook has been criticised for failing to remove a viral post promoting an auction of a child bride in South Sudan, which eventually led to the payment of the largest dowry ever recorded in the civil war-torn country.The highest bidder was a man three times the age of the 17-year-old girl who was auctioned. At least four other men in Eastern Lakes state competed, including the region’s deputy governor, said Philips Anyang Ngong, a human rights lawyer who tried to stop the bidding last month. “She has been reduced to a mere commodity,” Ngong told the Associated Press, calling it “the biggest test of child abuse, trafficking and auctioning of a human being”. Everyone involved should be held accountable, he said.The girl, named as Nyalong by AP, became the man’s ninth wife. Photos posted on Facebook show her sitting beside the groom, wearing a lavish dress and staring at the floor.The groom, who did not respond to requests for comment, paid a final price of 500 cows, two luxury cars, $10,000, two bikes, a boat and some mobile phones.The bidding war caused local and international outrage.The auction was advertised but not carried out on the site, but it took several days for Facebook to remove the post that first promoted the auction. After it was taken down, other posts “glorifying” the auction remained, said George Otim, country director for Plan International South Sudan.“This barbaric use of technology is reminiscent of latter-day slave markets. That a girl could be sold for marriage on the world’s biggest social networking site in this day and age is beyond belief,” he said. Facebook did not reply to a request for comment.While South Sudan’s government condemns the practice of child marriage it says it can’t regulate communities’ cultural norms, especially in remote areas.“You can’t call it bidding as if it was an auction. It’s not bidding. If you see it with European eyes you’ll call it an auction,” government spokesman Ateny Wek Ateny told the AP. “You have to see it with an African eye, as it’s a tradition that goes back thousands of years. There’s no word for it in English.”Some local lawmakers and activists disagree. In a statement released this week, the national alliance for women lawyers in South Sudan called upon officials to comply with the government’s plan to end child marriage by 2030. Ending the practice includes putting a stop to the auctioning of girls.South Sudan’s anti-human trafficking chief called the case reminiscent of others he has seen across the country, in which girls are forced or tricked into marriage after being told they are going to live with relatives and go to school instead.“It is clear that some human-trafficking practices are hidden in our culture,” John Mading said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17c9047adcdc6c4d6c96dac2048e72e360ebba1e/0_56_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=143f0907b1e988c2820548d69bf6466d","title":"share your experiences of christmas festivities overseas you could win a 200 hotel voucher","story":"Tell us how you spent Christmas on a trip to anywhere in the worldYou may have been to an inspiring Christmas concert, eaten local fare, taken part in unusual festivities in a far-off land – or spent the day on a remote tropical beach.Wherever you were in the world, please share your tales of a Christmas spent overseas.Please be specific about locations, and include prices and websites where appropriate.Read the terms and conditions"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4749a373519a58d73e9c16f499786c3074c5dc95/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a36569d45a8bb3151bd206166685423a","title":"our new column from inside amazon they treat us as disposable","story":"In The Amazon Diaries, our anonymous insider takes us behind the scenes at an Amazon fulfillment center where workers are ‘an extension of the machine’ Welcome Amazonians. It is always Day 1. Are you ready to make a difference?It was my first day as a seasonal Amazon worker, hired just prior to peak season. Our site operations manager was like many Amazon managers: an ex-military white male, in his late 40s and wearing straight-fit jeans and a T-shirt with “Amazon Military” emblazoned on the front. He drew a line alongside an inverted pyramid, writing “least important” on the bottom and “most important” higher up, with the word “customer” scrawled along the very top.“Where do you think Jeff Bezos sees himself on this chart?”Silence. He points to the bottom of the pyramid.“Jeff sees himself as the least important person in the company. What this company cares about is the customer promise, and putting our customers first.“Where do you think our associates are?”“Here! Jeff sees you at the very top! You, the associates, are the closest to the customers. It is up to you, every day, to uphold our customer promise. As front line associates, you are the most important part of this company!”As I headed to our training session wearing my new orange associate work-vest and wearing my white badge designating me as a “seasonal” employee, I was approached by a co-worker in a fancy, blue and green-lined “Ambassador” vest and a blue badge that signified he has been “converted” to a non-seasonal Amazon worker.“Did they give you the pyramid crap?”“That’s a load of shit.” We laughed, but I wasn’t quite sure I understood.“Welcome to Amazon,” he said.The inverted pyramid has stuck with me as an Amazon fulfillment associate. In some ways it’s on point. It’s important to take a step back and realize what an Amazon fulfillment center really is. Prior to Amazon, the sale of stuff largely took place through physical stores. Enter a store and there can be dozens of employees, stocking shelves, managing the check-out counter, controlling inventory. The pace and rhythm of the day, at least compared to fulfillment centers, can be relatively relaxed.At Amazon, by contrast, we are not retail workers. We are factory workers.A single fulfillment center can contain 1,500-2,000 full-time workers, stowing, picking, packing, unloading, sorting, palletizing and delivering hundreds of thousands of items every day. Centers are filled with the whirl, grind, and moan of conveyor belts, the incessant drone of a forest of Kivabots moving shelves.We work hard, and diligently, to make Amazon run. While our collective efforts produce astounding results, we are supervised ever more intensively. Through the use of digital trackers and indicators, our workday is managed down to the second, with each task timed based on a “rate” set by managers who push us ever faster. Work is often organized to keep workers from talking or even taking breaks, with this time considered “off-task”. Like factory workers on the assembly line, we are essentially extensions of the machine.When you recognize that we are what keeps Amazon going, and the most important part of the business, putting us at the top of the pyramid is right. Workers – whether the engineers or the hundreds of thousands of warehouse employees – are the backbone of the business and the source of astounding wealth. Without us there is no Amazon Prime, no advertising revenue, no streaming video, no HQ2.However, the pyramid analogy is also fitting because at the time this place feels like a pyramid scheme. After a few months at the company, it becomes clear to most of us that management doesn’t regard us a crucial contributors to its success. In reality, they treat us like disposable parts.It doesn’t take long before you’ve see blown backs, boxes falling on people’s heads, carpal tunnel in your coworkers’ wrists, and balky knees that never get better. You’ve seen workers compensation claims repeatedly denied and efforts to address safety issues given low priority. You’ve seen sexism, racism, and ageism in a promotion culture tainted with favoritism. You’ve seen write-ups unfairly distributed and used to manipulate workers. You’ve seen an emotionally toxic culture, where the stress of meeting productivity targets leads managers to treat workers like things, to be pushed harder and faster without regard for the emotional or personal cost. You’ve arrived home exhausted, too worn out to spend time with your kids or friends. And you’ve noticed that the wealth we produce is being accumulated by our boss – the modern world’s richest man – while our wages barely keep us afloat. Amazon’s much-touted new minimum wage of $15 is not enough to propel hundreds of thousands of us into the middle class.Those of us as at the bottom of the pyramid put our bodies and lives on the line, but those at the top of the pyramid are hung out to dry.

She is in protective custody as part of a deal between the government and a hardline Islamic party, under which violent protests were called off while a review of the court ruling was undertaken.Bibi’s lawyer, relatives and supporters have appealed for the family to be given asylum in a European or north American country. Several countries have indicated their willingness to offer a home, but nothing concrete has emerged.John Pontifex, of Aid to the Church in Need UK (ACN), which has campaigned on Bibi’s behalf since she was convicted and sentenced to death in 2010, said he had been in almost daily contact with her family over the past three weeks and they were very frightened.“They have told me that mullahs had been reported in their neighbourhood going from house to house showing photos of family members on their phones, trying to hunt them down,” he told the .“The family have had to move from place to place to avoid detection. Sometimes they can only operate after sundown. They have had to cover their faces when they go out in public. They have had to remove the rosary that hangs from their car rear-view mirror for fear of attack.”Pontifex said the family’s faith was “sustaining them in this time of acute danger”. He added: “They say that if they are not allowed to find a future outside Pakistan, the fear is that sooner or later something terrible might happen to them.”Bibi’s lawyer, who fled Pakistan shortly after the court ruling saying his life was in danger, said this week that talks on asylum were under way with several European countries. “I hope the western world is trying to help her,” Saiful Malook told reporters in Frankfurt.Canada, Spain and France are thought to have offered asylum to Bibi. Germany and Italy have reportedly held talks with Pakistan on the issue.The UK government has declined to answer questions about whether it is considering an offer of asylum, saying it does not want to further endanger Bibi and her family.The former foreign secretary Boris Johnson and many other MPs and peers have called for the UK government to act. Some reports have suggested that the government fears a backlash among British Muslims of Pakistani heritage if it offers Bibi asylum.The Muslim Council of Britain said in a tweet: “There are unfounded media reports that Pakistani national Asia Bibi is being denied asylum into the UK because of concerns from British Muslims. We find such insinuations to be as nonsensical as they are isive. We see no reason why Asia Bibi should be denied asylum into the UK.”After Bibi’s acquittal, Islamic hardliners called for her and the judges in the case to be killed, and they mounted protests that brought cities to a standstill. Pakistan’s prime minister, Imran Khan, has been accused of capitulating to their demands.Bibi, a farm labourer, was accused by Muslim villagers of insulting the prophet Muhammad in a row over a cup of water. The supreme court judgment said there was no evidence to support the charge."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d7f205a2d6387e9939631846b5fe5df9558b64c/0_146_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0382e8f3cbbe12775a2775cfe518b021","title":"attlee child refugee recalls extraordinary love of family","story":"Paul Willer meets former leader’s grandchildren 79 years after he escaped Nazi GermanyThe former child refugee who was looked after by Clement Attlee in the months leading up to the second world war has spoken of the “extraordinary love” he felt from the family, during an emotional reunion with the late prime minister’s descendants.Paul Willer, 90, waited 79 years to renew his bond with a relative of Attlee, who helped his family escape Nazi Germany.On Wednesday, he embraced Jo Roundell Greene, Attlee’s granddaughter whose mother, Felicity, helped Willer settle into their home in Stanmore, north-west London.Sitting on a bench in the Houses of Parliament central lobby, Willer was asked for his lasting memory was of four months spent with Attlees. He paused, before saying: “I think the extraordinary love that was found from the whole family children and parents.” revealed on Tuesday that the then leader of the opposition sponsored Willer and his Jewish mother and brother, giving them the confidence and authorisation to leave Germany in 1939 and move to the UK.After their escape, Attlee invited Willer into their London home, testimony and letters show. The MP neither publicised nor sought to make political capital from his visitor.Roundell Greene said on Wednesday: “It has been quite an afternoon.“To take in a child – a lot of people took in refugees, I know – but when you are a prominent figure, to take in another child, it was a great thing to do,” she said. Willer held Roundell Greene’s hand and cried quietly as she spoke.“From a personal point of view, it is very humbling to think our grandparents took in another child. To meet Paul today has been the greatest story for me. I feel as if I have got a new bit of the family today. I think we are going to remain friends.”Earlier on Wednesday, Willer was accompanied by a  reporter as he walked with his daughter Jo to meet Attlee’s descendants in the peers’ entrance to the House of Lords.As Lord Attlee, the grandson of the former Labour leader,shook his hand, Willer said: “You look just like him.”Asked how he felt about the media attention – they have had requests for interviews from around the world – Willer said: “It has been a bit much.”He and his daughter had come to parliament to attend the 80th anniversary of the Kindertransport scheme, which saved thousands of mainly Jewish children from Nazi Germany.Willer and his younger brother were raised by their mother, Franziska, in the Bavarian town of Würzburg. Their father, Johannes, a Christian, left their mother in 1933, began a new relationship, and declared himself a Nazi sympathiser.After Kristallnacht in November 1938, Willer’s mother set her hopes on moving to England but with no money, she could only do so if she found others who would promise to look after her children. Two families were eventually found through the church one of them was the Attlees.After his arrival in April 1939, Willer found it difficult to communicate with the Attlees because he spoke no English and they understood no German. He said Felicity became the family’s translator because they had both learned basic Latin at school.Just before the declaration of war in September 1939, Willer was sent to a school in Northern Ireland. He eventually became a sales director at a textiles company, married, had three children and settled in Hertfordshire.Michael Newman, the chief executive of the Association of Jewish Refugees which organised Wednesday’s event, spoke of his happiness at the reunion.“The AJR was so pleased to facilitate this poignant reunion as part of the 80th anniversary of the Kindertransport,” he said. “We are so fortunate to have captured Paul’s experiences.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/344f2a0c76245c039c103dcc14cfc8e10ddee4f2/705_496_2092_1255/master/2092.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0849b902317292a1afb474a484bacc3b","title":"mattei salvini ready to confront eu after italys budget rejected again italy european commission","story":"Italy’s deputy prime minister Matteo Salvini has said he is prepared to confront EU leaders after the European commission rejected his country’s draft 2019 budget for a second time, while calling on them to “respect the Italian people”.Italy is facing sanctions after the commission said in a report that the government of the far-right League and anti-establishment Five Star Movement had seriously violated fiscal rules.Italy has about €2.3tn (£2tn) of public debt and the Bank of Italy warned this month that the cost of servicing the debt could rise to €5bn in 2019 and €9bn in 2020.Salvini, who leads the League, responded sarcastically to news of the commission’s report. “A letter from the EU? I’m also waiting for one from Father Christmas,” he told reporters.It is widely suspected that Salvini is exploiting the standoff to whip up anti-EU anger before May’s European parliamentary elections.The markets took the news in their stride. The yield gap, or effective interest rate, on 10-year Italian government bonds fell to 309 basis points above German debt within a few hours of the announcement.Wolfango Piccoli, the co-president of the research firm Teneo Intelligence,, said in a note that the Italian government was unlikely to adopt meaningful changes to the budget, which must be approved in parliament by the end of the year.But Piccoli warned that the wrangling could rumble on well into next year, saying: “Given the complexity of the overall procedure and the fact that political considerations might prevail ahead of the May 2019 European elections, Italy is not expected to face sanctions until late spring at the earliest, if they materialise at all.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21fc2fe494d627c4da55f1241633e8409df8b93b/177_0_1687_1012/master/1687.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c95d252edce5ec20b072198a936f33db","title":"steve bannons rightwing europe operation undermined by election laws","story":"Exclusive: ambitious plan to campaign in EU elections would fall foul of laws in nine of 13 targeted statesSteve Bannon’s political operation to help rightwing populists triumph in next year’s European parliamentary elections is in disarray after he conceded that his campaign efforts could be illegal in most of the countries in which he planned to intervene.The former chief strategist to Donald Trump has spent months trying to recruit European parties to his Brussels-based group, the Movement, which he promised would operate as kind of a political consultancy for like-minded parties campaigning in the bloc-wide vote in May 2019.But the  has established that Bannon would be barred or prevented from doing any meaningful work in nine of the 13 countries in which he is seeking to campaign, according to national electoral bodies and relevant ministries. Confronted with the findings, Bannon acknowledged he was taking legal advice on the matter.“I’m not totally disagreeing with you,” he told the  in Paris. “I think there is more flexibility in some areas. But there’s no chance we would ever break the law.”Further disclosures about Bannon’s operation to foment a Trump-style populist insurgency in Europe are revealed in a  documentary.Bannon’s intervention in European politics comes amid heightened sensitivity about foreign involvement in elections. Questions have been mounting over the scale of Russia’s influence over the 2016 US presidential campaign and the UK’s referendum to leave the EU.However, in an interview with the , Bannon rejected the comparison between his movement and meddling by foreign states. “It’s very different from Russia, or Chinese, or other people trying to have influence, because I’m a private citizen,” he said. “I’m not associated with the White House.”A former investment banker with a reported net worth of about $50m (£40m), Bannon is personally bankrolling his European operation. He has pledged to spend millions of dollars to provide nativist and ultra-conservative European parties free access to specialised polling data, analytics, social media advice and help with candidate selection.But officials working on electoral law and independent experts in multiple countries said this kind of assistance would be considered in-kind donations.Professional services that have a monetary value and are provided by foreign sources are banned in France, Spain, Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary and Finland. In Germany and Austria, in-kind services must be valued and are included in the limited sums parties may take from foreign donors.In October, Bannon told the  he had already spent $1m of his money on polling he planned to provide for free to parties in seven European countries. He described it as the most significant and most expensive political polling ever undertaken in Europe, and said it would be used by political consultants with experience in data analytics to help target voters in the European elections.By the time the elections conclude in May 2019, Bannon estimated, the project would have spent between $5m and $15m. There are no other known financial backers to his operation, although he has repeatedly referred to other unidentified donors who are “quite interested in what happens in Europe”. Asked recently if any of his donors were Russian, Bannon replied: “This will all be Europeans,” he said. “And me.”Bannon’s project was already in turmoil after parties he was courting in Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Austria, Poland, the Czech Republic and Germany indicated they will not join his project. He now faces the challenge of persuading prospective recruits that they will not risk sanctions for receiving help from a Brussels-based group bankrolled by an American.Bannon insisted his operation was not failing and that he had time to recruit more parties. “Some people may not ever admit they’re signed up until after the European elections,” he said. “I’m doing all the polling whether there’s a country officially in or not. I’m doing all the data analytics whether the country is in or not.”The scale of legal challenges facing Bannon’s operation emerged six weeks ago, when his partner, the Belgian far-right politician Mischaël Modrikamen, told the  his own party was forbidden under Belgium’s electoral law from receiving contributions from the Movement. “It is a bit frustrating for me,” he said. “I would have loved to have a godfather … a benefactor.”A former corporate lawyer, Modrikamen confessed he did not know what electoral laws permitted in Germany, Italy or France, saying he was focused on recruiting parties to their operation. “For me right now I’m focusing more on getting the members,” he said. “I’m a bit frustrated because I have no time.”In the weeks since, the  conducted a review of the domestic laws in the 13 European Union countries in which Bannon and Modrikamen had signalled they wanted to operate. It revealed that parties in France, Finland, Belgium, Spain, Hungary and Czech Republic would risk sanctions for breaches of electoral law if they agreed to accept the assistance of the former Trump strategist.Parties in Germany and Austria can only accept such small sums that his war chest would be useless. Bannon’s activities would be permitted in Denmark and Sweden, but the parties he wanted to recruit in both Scandinavian countries have declined his offers of help.The only EU countries where Bannon has both willing partners and sufficiently lax electoral laws to allow him to boost party campaigns are the Netherlands and Italy.Bannon has poured most of his efforts into Italy, which elected a populist coalition government this year. His efforts to recruit the anti-establishment Five Star Movement have so far been rebuffed, but he has succeeded in enlisting the interior minister, Matteo Salvini, the leader of the far-right League, and Giorgia Meloni of the smaller party Brothers of Italy.However, legislation being considered by the Italian parliament would prohibit foreign donations to parties in the country. Should it be passed into law as expected, Bannon’s grand European project would in effect be restricted to the Netherlands, where the anti-Islam MP Geert Wilders appears keen to cooperate.Informed about the findings of the ’s research, Modrikamen said: “There is certainly a problem, as you say, with contributions in-kind.” He added there may have been “some over-enthusiasm” in Bannon’s public declarations about turning the Movement into a nonprofit to help with campaigning in the European elections.When the findings were relayed to Bannon, during a meeting in Paris last week, he conceded that the polling, data analytics, and help with social media he had promised far-right parties in Europe may turn out to be unlawful. “We’ve got counsel looking at the same thing,” he said. “What we’re not going to do is anything that violates elections laws in those countries.”When it was suggested that Bannon’s European project may be restricted to providing campaign help to one Dutch MP, he replied: “It’s a start.”He added that if lawyers advised his operation was “close” to violating laws banning foreign interference “then there’s no chance we’ll do it”.Concerns about foreign influence on domestic elections have multiplied in recent months. In the US, the special counsel, Robert Mueller, is investigating the extent of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, including possible collusion with the Trump campaign. Mueller’s team has interviewed Bannon four times.In the UK, the National Crime Agency is investigating the former Ukip donor Arron Banks, after the Electoral Commission said there were reasonable grounds to suspect he was “not the true source” of £8m in funding to the Leave.EU Brexit campaign.Emails published by the Observer last weekend suggest Banks was keen to involve Bannon – a founder of Cambridge Analytica – in a scheme to raise US cash for his Brexit campaign as far back as 2015. Neither Bannon nor Banks has responded to the report.In his final interview before the Observer’s disclosure, Bannon, who spent much of October and early November campaigning for pro-Trump Republicans in the US midterms, insisted his intervention in Europe could not be described as foreign “interference”. “I think it is very different,” he said. “I’m not doing this as a White House guy. I’m not associated with the White House, I’m not associated with the Republican party.”Additional reporting by Kim Willsher in Paris, Josie Le Blond in Berlin, Sam Jones in Spain, Angela Giuffrida in Rome, Shaun Walker in Budapest, Christian Davies in Warsaw and Robert Tait in Prague."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f7899fb56a904b69ab67295c0e8d36cd2cd235f/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6684fac3b99182c046a8982c769a9623","title":"us south korea military exercise kim jong un","story":"Jim Mattis says Foal Eagle, a joint exercise scheduled for spring 2019, ‘reorganized … to be at a level not harmful to diplomacy’The United States and South Korea have scaled down a joint military exercise scheduled for the spring of 2019 to facilitate nuclear talks with North Korea, Jim Mattis, the US defense secretary, said Wednesday.“Foal Eagle is being reorganized a bit to keep it at a level that will not be harmful to diplomacy,” Mattis said, adding that it would be “reduced in scope.”US and South Korean forces have been training together for years, and routinely rehearse everything from beach landings to an invasion from the North and even “decapitation” strikes targeting the North Korean regime.But personal insults and threats of war between Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un were replaced last year by a rapid diplomatic rapprochement.The thaw culminated in a historic summit in Singapore in June, where the leaders signed a vaguely-worded document on denuclearization of the peninsula.The US and South Korea have since suspended most of their major joint exercises, including the Ulchi Freedom  in August and the Vigilant Ace air force training initially slated for next month.In September, the then nominee to head US and UN forces in South Korea said the pause in drills had been a “prudent risk” to help facilitate a detente on the peninsula.But there “was certainly a degradation in the readiness of the force, for the combined forces,” Gen Robert Abrams told the Senate armed services committee at his confirmation hearing.Abrams went on to say that the continued suspension of the drills risked a further erosion in “readiness and capability and interoperability of the combined forces,” though he noted officials were working to minimize issues by running smaller scale staff exercises."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"DUP\u0026rsquos Jim Shannon claims the endorsement of the deal by the Ulster Farmers\u0026rsquo Union had not been cleared at the highest levelFianna F\u0026aacuteil Senator took exception when Buttimer claimed she was \u0026lsquotrying to assert herself\u0026rsquoInformation on the prevalence of sexual violence not available until 2024Michelle O\u0026rsquoKeeffe also accused of failing to maintain accounting records over five year periodWarned of the political consequences of failing to address growing housing insecurity among the middle classClaire Foy among actors signing letter urging decriminalisation of abortion in NIMichael Kelly\u0026rsquos ring got caught as he climbed over fence to get to platform at Dundrum stationOireachtas committee hears city council not holding ceremony to avoid Luas disruptionPaudie Coffey says story in \u0026lsquoKilkenny People\u0026rsquo defamed him and led to loss of D\u0026aacuteil seatEntertainers bid farewell to man whose \u0026lsquolife was happiness, music and sing-along\u0026rsquoFive bursaries of up to \u0026euro20,000 will be awarded annually to women artistsChief medical officer says mesh devices associated with significant and severe complications in minority of womenKehoe \u0026lsquoScrooge of Government\u0026rsquo with lowest budget increase of any departments \u0026ndash FFBoy taken from woman in hospital by garda\u0026iacute and social workers over fears for his safetyGarda\u0026iacute believe cannabis was destined for the drugs market in CorkLee Murray \u0026lsquoshocked\u0026rsquo when shown footage of him assaulting early morning commuterR\u0026oacuteis\u0026iacuten McGarr raised concerns over authority\u0026rsquos decision to remove pro-repeal muralTallaght men accused of killing a cousin of one of them and dumping his bodyMan who has shared custody of his three children took case against Dublin City CouncilAudit reveals details of 71 alleged abusers \u0026lsquonone of which are still working in organisation\u0026rsquo"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3706033.1542826746!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"bradley says draft brexit deal offers safeguards around backstop","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tNorthern Secretary Karen Bradley at  the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee in  London. Photograph: PAPA WireNorthern Secretary Karen Bradley has defended the draft Brexit withdrawal agreement from claims that it undermines the North’s place in the UK. She told the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee that the agreement offered safeguards surrounding the backstop that should reassure unionists.“The safeguards put in place, the reassurances given, the way that the EU dislikes the backstop means as a legal construct, not as a person or country, there is no way that there will be a situation where we can be bound into the backstop indefinitely,” she said.“The right thing to do is to accept the deal and to get the future relationship, and make sure we never go into the backstop in any way.”Ms Bradley said if the backstop did come into operation it would put Northern Ireland businesses in “a remarkably beneficial position”. The backstop offered some advantages over extending the post-Brexit transition, including the fact that it did not require Britain to offer free movement to EU citizens.Northern Irish business and farming groups have welcomed the draft withdrawal agreement, but the DUP’s Jim Shannon claimed that the Ulster Farmers’ Union’s endorsement had not been cleared at the highest level and did not reflect the views of its members. He suggested that Ms Bradley was listening to too limited a range of views on the deal in Northern Ireland. “If you don’t cast your net wider and seek opinions of other people and stop seeking the... one blinkered opinion, which it is clear to me that some people are pursuing, then you are going to get a very rude awakening.” "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3701560.1542460706!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord mary lou mcdonald takes sitting td a little too far","story":"An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has accused Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald of hypocrisy after she attended a €400 a plate fundraiser in New York while other party leaders partook in Armistice Day commemorations. Video: Oireachtas TV \t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald said the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste should not be ‘harbingers of doom’. Photograph: Gareth Chaney CollinsThe real action in the chamber happened before the official proceedings began.And people were still talking about it long after Leaders’ Questions was finished and the Dáil had moved on to other things.Of course it involved Mary Lou McDonald, because the Sinn Féin leader was prominent in much of what went on in and around Leinster House on Tuesday. When she accused the Taoiseach of publicly promising tax cuts for workers while simultaneously doing away with minor tax relief for low-paid workers, Leo Varadkar responded by launching a stinging attack on her for missing the recent Armistice ceremonies and inauguration of President Higgins so she could quaff champagne and “hobnob with the super-rich” at a $400-a-plate party fundraiser in Manhattan.Mary Lou, on this occasion, decided not to take the bait and reiterated her line that Leo Varadkar is more interested in helping out the rich while “ordinary workers to fall to the bottom of the pile yet again”. Perhaps she had her imminent meeting with Máiría Cahill on her mind.Or perhaps she was still discommoded by what happened a while earlier, when she found a former cabinet minister sitting in her usual berth when she arrived for a group photograph with serving and former women TDs and senators to mark 100 years of women’s suffrage.After the event, the ex-minister – Fianna Fáil’s Mary Hanafin – said the Sinn Féin leader “bullied” her out of the seat.Later in the evening, Mary Lou met the former senator who claims she was raped by an IRA man and then had to endure Sinn Féin questioning her integrity and covering up what happened to her after she went public with her story.McDonald recently issued an apology to Cahill for the party’s poor handling of her complaints, citing its inadequate procedures around the mandatory reporting of abuse allegations.Cahill rejected that apology as “woefully inadequate”, claiming McDonald didn’t say the party believed her and didn’t address how her situation had been handled nor acknowledge that the Provisional IRA had investigated the abuse.The two women met in what Sinn Féin later called “a candid and lengthy meeting”.“I went in to the meeting with low or no expectations and I came out of it, if it’s possible, with even lower ones,” said the former Labour senator afterwards. In a subsequent tweet, she accused McDonald of “an abdication of responsibility, bluster and spin, or what I described to her as ‘bullshit’”.Earlier in the day, a much more pleasant event awaited Mary Lou, who was one of a large contingent of current and former Oireachtas members gathered in the Dáil chamber for a group photograph to commemorate the centenary of women being able to vote and stand for election to parliament for the first time.It was a happy occasion, with many blasts from the political past lining out for this special portrait of a unique band of Irish women. Seating was allocated in the front row for serving and former cabinet ministers, with the overflow joining ministers of state in the next two rows.Former president of Ireland and former senator Mary Robinson was also allocated a seat in the front, along with dedicated seating for members of the organising committee from the Irish Women’s Parliamentary Caucus.Just in the nick of time, with everyone in place and the photograph about to be taken, Mary Lou rushed into the chamber. She headed for the central stairs and her usual berth, the one she inhabits as party leader when the Dáil is in session and where Gerry Adams sat before her.Mary Lou is an accomplished woman with many achievements to her name, but having served as a government minister is not one of them.As the rest of the women watched with growing interest, she arrived at her seat to find Mary Hanafin, the first female government chief whip – who held a number of senior ministries including Social and Family Affairs and Education, sitting in her spot.“Who gave you permission to sit there?” asked Mary Lou, very put out, telling Mary H that this was her seat and she wanted to sit in it.Former tánaiste and Fianna Fáil minister Mary Coughlan was sitting to Hanafin’s left while Mary Robinson was to her right, across the aisle.Hanafin pointed out that she had been directed to her seat by the ushers, in accordance with the arrangements in place for the event. Former ministers were instructed to sit in the front row. She reminded the Sinn Féin leader it wasn’t a normal Dáil sitting and the usual seating plan was not in operation.Mary Lou replied she didn’t really care where anyone else was sitting but this was her seat and she wouldn’t be sitting for any photograph until she got it back.As the stand-off continued, Mary H declared she was where the ushers put her and perhaps Mary Lou should check with them. Which she did, marching over to the chief usher and informing him that an interloper was sitting in her place. (It didn’t seem to bother anyone else. Serving TDs just sat where they found a vacant spot.)An usher approached Hanafin and asked apologetically if, maybe, she might facilitate deputy McDonald who was refusing to sit anywhere else. So the former cabinet minister vacated her prime ministerial spot (front and centre) and looked for a seat elsewhere. She finally found a welcome off to the side next to former Fine Gael education minister Gemma Hussey.After the photograph was taken, the 90 or so women – including former senator and Supreme Court judge Catherine McGuinness, former tánaiste Joan Burton, and former ministers Nora Owen, Síle De Valera, Niamh Breathnach and Jan O’Sullivan – repaired to the Oireachtas restaurant for lunch.The HanafinMcDonald incident was the talk of the place.“I did the gracious thing and moved when the usher asked me. I didn’t want to make a scene or make the situation any more difficult for the staff,” said Hanafin afterwards, who described McDonald’s actions as “bullying, pure and simple”.She said some of the women told her she should have stayed put and were very surprised that she, of all women, moved at the behest of the Sinn Féin leader. And others told her she was right to move because it would have put the usher in an awkward position.One retired Dáil veteran said she was astonished by the scene. “Nobody has a permanent seat in the House. You are only sitting in there for as long as the voters decide to keep you there. It’s not yours for life. We all learn that in the end.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3704748.1542739998!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"china s rise gives families and consumers more options","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tCelebrating the Chinese New Year   in Yuyuan Garden: Many middle-class couples are opting to not take advantage of the relaxation of the restrictions on the number of children because it is simply too expensive. Photograph: GettyFor Shanghai residents Stella Zhu and Tony Wei, the biggest impact of the changes brought about by China’s economic rise over the past decades has been the fact that you have more choices than ever before.“In the past you didn’t have so many choices. Nowadays sometimes you have too many choices,” says Zhu, a 37-year-old lawyer.These options can be what food to eat, where to educate your children, even how many children to have. Zhu is about to have her second child, which until a couple of years ago would not have been an option for most urban residents in China.They do not know the gender of the child, because ultrasound scans are illegal, largely due to the preference for boys in rural areas which led to abortions of female foetuses. Zhu and Wei are happy to enjoy the surprise.“Initially it wasn’t allowed at all to have a second child, then because one of us is an only child, we were allowed to have a second, but now it’s all open,” says Zhu, who comes from Chongming Island near Shanghai. She is an only child, while Wei, who was born in Binyan in Guangxi province, has a younger sister.China’s economic rise in the past four decades has translated into a middle class that by the Chinese government’s reckoning is nearly 400 million strong. Consumer spending now accounts for more than 60 per cent of economic growth in China.Wei runs a media company. He left his home town when he was 18 and went to study in Changchun. “I’ve never been back to live in my hometown. The city life is very different,” he says.Both are well-travelled – Wei rode a motorcycle to Berlin from China last year – and prefer to use their English names for this article.Although they are well-off, financial concerns were a factor when deciding on how many children they would have. Many middle-class couples are opting to not take advantage of the relaxation of the restrictions on the number of children because it is simply too expensive.Both came of age during the period of reform.“Maybe there has been a revolution in the past 30 years, it’s a very big difference. Maybe if I was born in a small town in the earlier days, I would be working in a factory. There are more chances for me to change my life now,” says Wei.The social changes have also been felt in rural China.One young woman, who asked to be referred to by her family name Shu, was born in 1997, the year Hong Kong reverted to Chinese rule, in a village called Jinxiang, about three hours from Shenzhen, in Guangdong province.Shu has two boys, aged four and two, and she lives in a house with her husband’s parents.Shenzhen, just across the border from Hong Kong, has undergone several transformations over the years, from fishing village to manufacturing centre to high-tech hub, and the recent opening of the world’s biggest sea bridge is expected to boost the Pearl River Delta even further.Here, as everywhere else in China, education is incredibly important to Chinese parents. With a population of nearly 1.4 billion, the pressure to succeed is intense. There are more than half a million schools, with 265 million students in the largest public education sector in the world.“China’s economy is very good now and we don’t have the same kind of burdens as before. I hope my boys can go to the city, maybe not Shenzhen as it is very expensive, but at least study in the city near my village. Then the boys will have the opportunity of going to university and have a stable job if they stay in the city. If they come back here, they can start a business, so they can make more money,” she says.Both Stella Zhu and Tony Wei joke about wanting their son Owen to be a football star and go to Harvard, but Zhu worries about being a “Tiger Mom” and having too high expectations, putting their children under too much pressure.“I have no idea about what Owen will do. Some Chinese parents put crazy pressure on their children. But maybe in two or three years, I will also become like those crazy parents,” she says.Wei’s parents are still in Guangxi. When his parents come for Spring Festival they stay for a couple of weeks, but it’s a big adjustment for them. “They find Shanghai very different, they have different habits, they don’t like big cities,” he says.Zhu’s mother is 72 and lives with the family. “My mother’s generation is very different. In the old times, they didn’t have so much food or consumer items. At home she always wants to control how much we cook. She likes to put all the food in the refrigerator, sometimes for months. She puts it in there and she feels safe,” she said.“The older generation cares about money because in the past they were too poor. I tell my mother not to worry about money so much, it’s more important that we are happy, that we have good food and are healthy. But she always says we spend too much money and need to save more money,” she says.She believes people are much happier now than when she was a child.“Compared to my childhood, life is much better and much more relaxing,” she adds.She is open to what her children want to do in the future. “I think I will let them decide. They can do whatever they like as long as they don’t do something bad or become criminals. It doesn’t matter much how much money they make,” she says.Stella Zhu is also looking forward to the future with hope. “It’s not like when we were younger, because now we have chosen our way. For me, my future is to work hard, continue as a lawyer, do better in my career, and of course you can earn more money and make your family life better.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3706076.1542828619!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"very good progress in brussels as brexit talks go to the wire","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish prime minister Theresa May and European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker meet to discuss Brexit draft agreements  in Brussels on Wednesday. Photograph: Yves HermanReuters“Very good progress” was made at Wednesday night’s meeting in Brussels between UK prime minister Theresa May and European Commission president Jean Claude Juncker, the commission said in a statement, as the two sides tried to finalise a crucial draft joint political declaration on the EU-UK future relationship.Sources were hopeful that the two leaders had made progress on a document that is expected to be approved alongside the withdrawal agreement at an EU summit on Sunday. The commission said that work was continuing.Mrs May arrived at about 5.30pm local time and shook hands with Mr Juncker, refusing to answer shouted questions, and after the meeting disappeared without comment. Commission officials were saying next to nothing.All sides appeared to accept that the withdrawal agreement (WA) cannot be reopened and that Sunday’s summit will effectively just rubber-stamp it. Mrs May acknowledged as much in the Commons on Wednesday, while German chancellor Angela Merkel told the Bundestag there was no question of renegotiating the deal now.Mrs May’s focus on Wednesday night was on the final tweaking of the declaration, which she hopes to sell to her sceptics as providing the reassurances and safeguards they are looking for and believe are lacking in the WA.On Northern Ireland, the political declaration is now expected to include language on the Border that will reflect Mrs May’s promise to explore technological solutions as an alternative to the backstop. The withdrawal agreement, in both the draft produced in March and in its final form, allows for “alternative arrangements” to ensure that the Border remains open. London is playing up the formula.But she also gave a new version in the Commons on Wednesday of how the backstop could be creatively interpreted – the government, she said, could agree to keep the entire UK aligned with EU regulations rather than allowing Northern Ireland to erge from Great Britain.“If we were in the situation where the backstop had to be in place for a matter of months, for example, it would be right for the United Kingdom to give the commitment that we would not be looking to erge from regulations during that period and that we would ensure that we kept that free access for the goods from Northern Ireland coming into Great Britain, as we have committed in the withdrawal agreement . . . and as we had committed previously. That will of course be a decision for us here,” she said.Nature abhors a vacuum and so Brussels was swirling with rumours and talk of “serious” blockages on the road to agreement on the declaration. Diplomats were sceptical of how serious such threats are.Spain has threatened to veto the deal if its concerns on Gibraltar are not met. And there are still reported to be French and other objections to the omission in the declaration of commitments to access to UK fishing waters and what some see as a dilution of “level-playing field” guarantees in the trade section.One senior diplomat said of the Spanish problem that “It should be all right on the day. An issue like this will have to be sorted beforehand.”Berlin weighed in on Tuesday night, to give the deadlocked discussion a kick forward. Unless a deal on the declaration is finalised on Thursday, in time for capitals to consider it ahead of Sunday, the German ambassador told fellow ambassadors that Dr Merkel might not be willing to attend the summit.It was a clear message to Spain and others obstructing the deal that they should not be jeopardising the agreement and that there is limited sympathy for their stanceIt also appeared to be a message to London that any talk of negotiations on Sunday is out – the summit will be a formal approval of both documents and little more. Downing Street has been briefing unofficially that Mrs May hopes to engage in negotiations. Not if Dr Merkel has her way."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

There are a lot of things I do not agree with but won\u0027t get changed, so things like a name of a pub with a non-discriminatory name should be left alone.”Miss Stannard, 40, who hopes the site will become a licensed wedding venue next year,  defended her decision by saying the current name will not be popular with future brides.Matt Robinson,33, is the manager The Heworth Green located in York city centreAfter investing a lot of money into the pub -which was previously the venue of a teetotal methodist church- she is keen to attract new customers beyond the traditional regulars.She said: “As we are going to have a really keen focus on vegetarian and vegan cuisine, we think it is a tasteful, sympathetic and reasonable decision. We want to have an excellent vegetarian and vegan offering, so found the name slightly compromising of the idea.“We imagined that many brides may not want the invites for their big day to be at a place called the Shoulder of Mutton. We have taken into account the area\u0027s and the building\u0027s heritage and have consulted various conservation bodies in the area and received warm feedback and support for the new name.”Vegan and vegetarian groups have praised the pub for creating a wider range of food available to all of its customers that include non-meat alternativesVegan and vegetarian groups have praised the pub for creating a wider range of food available to all of its customers that include non-meat alternatives.Dominika Piasecka, of The Vegan Society, claimed the change of the name signalled a “positive direction, as eating animals is increasingly becoming an outdated practice”.She added: “The number of vegans in Britain has quadrupled in the last four years and many businesses are taking catering for them seriously, with plant-based food being inclusive not just of vegans but everyone else as well.”Please review our commenting policyBrexit latest news: Theresa May meets Jean-Claude Juncker in Brussels after telling MPs it\u0026#39s her agreement or no BrexitTransgender campaigners blamed by Conservative MP for \u0026#39atmosphere of menace\u0026#39 around gender issues I gave up drugs to get out \u2028of the ‘managed’ red light zone – it was too dangerous Esther Rantzen says BBC is \u0026#39setting generations against each other\u0026#39 over threat to free TV licences for over-75sComment: Amber Rudd is wrong to assume that Parliament would leap in to magically stop a No DealHow Brexit could make the flower industry wilt - even if there is a dealHow Bet365 founder Denise Coates\u0026#39 gamble paid off as she secures a £265 million salaryLost Charles Dickens portrait found in South Africa after 174 years\u0026#39No evidence\u0026#39 Brexit was influenced by Cambridge Analytica scandal, Facebook says Star Trek-style \u0026#39ionic wind\u0026#39 plane hailed as most significant advance in flight since the Wright brothers Scotland\u0026#39s farmers urge Nicola Sturgeon to back Theresa May\u0026#39s Brexit dealMigrants allege sexual abuse and extortion at hands of EU-funded security forces in MoroccoHas Theresa May abandoned the option of a no deal Brexit?UK pledges £5m to fight \u0026#39super gonorrhea\u0026#39Language tests for foreign nurses to be made easier, regulator proposesJuries should be done away with in rape trials to improve conviction rates, suggests Labour MPPoland bows to EU pressure on controversial judicial reformsComment: Does Jeremy Corbyn really believe in his fantasy version of Brexit?We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/11/21/TELEMMGLPICT000181474915_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqD3d2dmOlWYuQkR76XZjLQAgWqwm85JEWpGVhFb46TTg.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"russian candidate interpol presidency defeated intense lobbying","story":"Alexander Prokopchuk, left, was beaten to the post by Kim Jong-yang of South KoreaInterpol announced Wednesday that Kim Jong-yang of South Korea had been chosen as its new president, beating a Russian official whose candidacy had unnerved Western nations.The US-backed Kim, acting president of the global police body, was picked at a meeting of delegates from member nations in Dubai to replace Meng Hongwei, who went missing in his native China in September.Beijing later said Meng resigned after being charged with accepting bribes.There had been growing calls within Western nations for Interpol to reject Russian candidate Alexander Prokopchuk - a Russian interior ministry official and current Interpol vice president - over fears Moscow could abuse the role to target political opponents.On Tuesday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo threw his weight behind Kim, who will serve out Meng\u0027s term until 2020.We encourage all nations and organisations that are part of Interpol and that respect the rule of law to choose a leader with integrity. We believe Mr. Kim will be just that, Pompeo told reporters.Foreign Office minister Harriett Baldwin told Parliament on Tuesday that the Government would support Kim\u0027s bid.Critics have raised concerns over Russia\u0027s previous applications for Interpol Red Notices, or international arrest warrants, to target those who have fallen foul of the Kremlin.Interpol\u0027s president chairs its General Assembly while day-to-day operations are handled by the organisation\u0027s Secretary general Juergen Stock.In an open letter this week, a bipartisan group of US senators said choosing Prokopchuk would be like putting a fox in charge of a henhouse.Russia routinely abuses Interpol for the purpose of settling scores and harassing political opponents, dissidents and journalists, they wrote.The controversy also comes amid security concerns over the Salisbury nerve agent poisonings and Russia\u0027s subsequent attempt to hack the network of the global chemical weapons watchdog.Ukraine, deeply at odds with Moscow over its annexation of Crimea and support for separatists, threatened to pull out of Interpol if Prokopchuk prevailed. Lithuania also said it would consider withdrawing from the network.Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed the US senators\u0027 letter as a vivid example of an attempt to interfere in the vote.

It’s taken nine years of work to get here, and it’s a hundred years since the ionic wind was first discovered”.In the tests, the battery-powered unmanned aircraft, that weighs just five pounds, managed sustained flights of 197 ft in an MIT gym hall.Professor Barrett was inspired to launch the project after watching sci-fi series Star Trek as a child. He was especially impressed by the show\u0027s futuristic shuttle crafts that skimmed through space with just a blue glow and silently glide.The project was inspired by the shuttlecraft featued in sci-fi series Star TrekThis made me think, in the long-term future, planes shouldn\u0027t have propellers and turbines, he said. They should be more like the shuttles in Star Trek.Ionic wind, also known as electroaerodynamic thrust, was first identified in the 1920s and explored by scientists and engineers in the US and at Britain’s Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough in the 1960s, but they were only able to produce very low levels of thrust, insufficient for flight.To overcome this obstacle, the MIT test aircraft carries an array of thin wires strung beneath the front end of its wings. A high voltage current passed through the wires via a lightweight power converter strips negatively charged electrons from surrounding air molecules.This produces a cloud of positively charged ionised air molecules that are attracted to another set of negatively charged wires at the back of the plane, like a giant magnet attracting iron filingsAs they flow towards the negative charge, the ions collide millions of times with other air molecules, creating the thrust that pushes the aircraft forward.One of the biggest challenges faced by the MIT team was designing a power supply that would generate 40,000 volts from the plane\u0027s battery output, one of the biggest stumbling blocks in adapting the technology for large-scale commercial use.Prof Barrett told the  that while it will take “several decades” for the technology to be advanced enough to power passenger aircraft, unmanned aircraft with wing of up to 80 ft will be possible in the nearer term.The silent aircraft has obvious applications as a stealth drone, as it would not be detected by infrared scanners. Defence giant Lockheed Martin has reportedly already expressed interest in the project.Guy Gratton, an aerospace engineer and visiting professor at Cranfield University, said: “It\u0027s clearly very early days: but the team at MIT have done something we never previously knew was possible, in using accelerated ionised gas to propel an aircraft.  “Aeronautical engineers around the world are already trying hard to find ways to use electric propulsion, and this technology will offer something else that in the future may allow manned and unmanned aircraft to be more efficient, and non-polluting.”Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)Please review our commenting policyBrexit latest news: Theresa May meets Jean-Claude Juncker in Brussels after telling MPs it\u0026#39s her agreement or no BrexitTransgender campaigners blamed by Conservative MP for \u0026#39atmosphere of menace\u0026#39 around gender issues I gave up drugs to get out \u2028of the ‘managed’ red light zone – it was too dangerous Esther Rantzen says BBC is \u0026#39setting generations against eachother\u0026#39 over threat to free TV licences for over-75sComment: Amber Rudd is wrong to assume that Parliament would leap in to magically stop a No DealHow Brexit could make the flower industry wilt - even if there is a dealHow Bet365 founder Denise Coates\u0026#39 gamble paid off as she secures a £265 million salaryLost Charles Dickens portrait found in South Africa after 174 years\u0026#39No evidence\u0026#39 Brexit was influenced by Cambridge Analytica scandal, Facebook says Scotland\u0026#39s farmers urge Nicola Sturgeon to back Theresa May\u0026#39s Brexit dealMigrants allege sexual abuse and extortion at hands of EU-funded security forces in MoroccoHas Theresa May abandoned the option of a no deal Brexit?UK pledges £5m to fight \u0026#39super gonorrhea\u0026#39Language tests for foreign nurses to be made easier, regulator proposesJuries should be done away with in rape trials to improve conviction rates, suggests Labour MPPub changes its name from \u0026#39Shoulder of Mutton\u0026#39 in a bid to attract more vegans and vegetariansPoland bows to EU pressure on controversial judicial reformsComment: Does Jeremy Corbyn really believe in his fantasy version of Brexit?We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/11/05/12/Amazon.jpg","title":"amazon black friday 2018 data breach","story":"Created with Sketch.Subscribe  registerSubscribeJoin us Subscribe  registerJoin us SubscribeLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentForgotten your password?Try Independent Minds free for 14 daysSee the optionsAmazon is the \u0027white whale\u0027 when it comes to hackers targeting online retailersClick to followThe Independent TechAmazon has suffered a customer data leak less than two days before Black Friday.Amazon customer service contacted people to warn them that their names and email addresses had been compromised, though it is not yet clear how\u0026nbspmany customers were affected or how it happened.\u0026nbspAn Amazon spokesperson told\u0026nbspThe Independent:\u0026nbsp“We have fixed the issue and informed customers who may have been impacted.”The customer message stated: We\u0027re contacting you to let you know that our website inadvertently disclosed your name and email address due to a technical error.The issue has been fixed. This is not a result of anything you have done, and there is no need for you to change your password or take any other action.The fact that only names and email addresses were affected makes\u0026nbspthe information leaked less significant than some other\u0026nbspdata breaches where credit card details have been exposed.Cyber security experts warn that despite the limited nature of the data leak, customers should still be weary about how it can be used.Cyber criminals can do a lot of damage with a large database of names and emails. The greatest risk is of brute force attacks - where criminals use a leaked email address and common password combinations to try and break into other personal accounts, Richard Walters, chief technology officer of\u0026nbspCensorNet, wrote in an email to\u0026nbspThe Independent.\u0026nbspA large majority of people still use predictable passwords, and thanks to previous high-profile breaches many people\u0027s passwords are also readily available on the dark web. For cyber criminals, it then just becomes a exercise in joining the dots. This risk is amplified by the fact that many people also use their work email addresses for personal accounts or services such as AmazonMr Walters described Amazon as the white whale when it comes to e-commerce companies, meaning it is a constant target for hackers.Advice for any Amazon customer affected, or anyone concerned\u0026nbspthey might have been, is to change their passwords as a matter of priority on all online services that they use, both work and private.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Apple has traditionally resisted Black Friday, instead running small offers but not slashing prices or offering deep discounts.In the last couple of years, for instance, the company has just offered gift cards when people bought specific products. Those gift cards have to be spent in the Apple Store and the products still sold at full price.Apple said almost nothing about this year\u0027s deals. It announced them with a mysterious set of phrases, reading only: Four days. Special offers and making clear the dates.As such, Apple\u0027s own website does not traditionally offer the best deal on the company\u0027s own products. Better offers can often be scored through other retailers – and a complete list of the best of them can be found in this list.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

This is a long way from the lofty predictions that some analysts forecast for bitcoin this year, with many having forecast a return to the $20,000 price it reached at the end of 2017.But while some cryptocurrency analysts have revised their predictions, others have stood by their figures in anticipation of a major market turnaround in the coming weeks.Follow the latest bitcoin price updates on\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0027s\u0026nbsplive blog.One of the most optimistic predictions comes from Adam Back, co-founder of the blockchain firm Blockstream, who said\u0026nbsphe anticipates gains that will take bitcoin\u0027s price to more than 100-times today\u0027s value.Personally I consider $250k-$500kBTC plausible in the years ahead, Mr Back said on Twitter in response to fellow cryptocurrency enthusiast Bobby Lee, who himself speculated about whether the overall value of bitcoin could overtake the overall value of gold in the coming years.Created with Sketch.Bitcoin\u0027s volatile history in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.18 Satoshi Nakamoto creates the first bitcoin block in 2009On 3 January, 2009, the genesis block of bitcoin appeared.

Increased institutional backing, he said, would help turn bitcoin\u0027s fortunes around.CoinMarketCap)Other analysts have taken a more retrospective look at bitcoin\u0027s recent turmoil, saying that such significant price movements are not surprising given the cryptocurrency\u0027s history.What we’re seeing now are the after-effects of the unprecedented rise of Bitcoin and other cryptoassets seen in 2017. This year is simply a retracement of that. The same is happening in broader markets as well where tech stocks, for example, are following a similar pattern. As with all markets, if prices reach levels that are higher than can be justified they need to pull back, Mati Greem, an analyst at the online trading platform eToro, said in an email to\u0026nbspThe Independent.These cycles can sometimes be accentuated in the crypto market due to the riskier nature of this nascent industry. In the same way previous cycles have not signalled the end for broader markets, these price movements don’t signal the end for cryptoassets. We’re still very much at the beginning of the crypto journey.

We are bound by European rules – as are the Dutch, the Belgians and the Irish,\u0027 he saidBrexiteers are “not telling the truth” when they claim France would not need to impose onerous and costly border checks on imports of UK produce in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the President of the Normandy region has said.Some Brexiteers have argued that because the UK and the EU are currently fully aligned in terms of food and plant standards it would be unnecessary for France to check UK produce entering the EU after 29 March 2019, even though Britain would suddenly be a “third country”.This is what day one of a no-deal Brexit could look likeAnd some have even sought to argue that the imposition of such checks would be illegal under World Trade Organisation rules.Lord Lilley, a pro-Brexit former UK trade and industry secretary, suggested this in an interview with the BBC’s Today programme on Monday, as he sought to play down the economic risks of leaving the EU without an agreement.But Hervé Morin, President of the Normandy region and a former defence minister in the cabinet of President Nicolas Sarkozy, insisted on Wednesday that such checks would be unavoidable due to EU customs union and single market rules.“The British are sovereign, but it’s the European rules we apply in France,” he told The Independent, speaking at the French ambassador’s residence in Kensington, central London.“It’s a decision that stems from the EU. We are bound by European rules – as are the Dutch, the Belgians and the Irish.”“Anybody who says something different is not telling the truth.”The prospects of such checks is deeply worrying for UK for UK farmers.The National Farmers Union president Minette Batters said in September that crashing out of the EU would be an “Armageddon scenario” for British farmers.Trade experts agree with the reading of Mr Morin and dismiss the claim that WTO rules forbid new checks.“The EU is obliged by the WTO to treat the UK as it treats other third countries. That is, with many more frictions than the UK faces at present as a member of the EU,” says Alan Winters of the UK Trade Policy Observatory.Normandy is home to a number of major ports, including Cherbourg, Le Havre\u0026nbspand Caen, serving both the tourist and business trade.Mr Morin said that there were “huge challenges” to get the infrastructure in place for future customs checks, even assuming the UK enters a 21-month transition period in March 2019.“There’s a lot of stake economically,” said Mr Morin. “Customs will have to be set up, capacity will have to be increased.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But I used its publication as a jumping off point to ask a rather simple question: Who is\u0026nbsppaying for it?Rudd admits new Brexit referendum on table if May\u0027s deal rejectedUK will be \u0027frozen out of 182 EU decisions\u0027 in months after BrexitStock markets fall on Brexit, Italy budget and US-China trade tensionsThe answer I got spoke volumes.\u0026nbspFirst a bit of background. The IFT is billed as ‘non partisan’ but its ‘advisory board’ is nonetheless made up of a smorgasbord of Conservative yesterday’s men and women. Former Tory leader Michael Howard, former Spanish PM José María Aznar and former Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott are prominent among them.There’s also Ben Sasse, the Republican Senator from Nebraska, who claims to be an independent conservative but has voted with the decidedly anti free trade President Donald Trump 87 per cent of the time, per an analysis by FiveThirtyEight.\u0026nbspHannan has managed to find some business types to sit with the think tankers on the ‘executive board’, such as Brexiteer blowhard Lord Digby Jones, a former CBI chief who now lives on another planet to most of its members.The ITF has offices in London, near the Embankment, where they can meet together with an august corps of ‘fellows’ and a PR agency for the purposes of making ‘the moral case for open commerce’.\u0026nbspGiven its ostensibly idealistic aims, you might think that the ‘private iniduals, commercial and non-commercial organisations’ putting their hands in their pockets to advance its aims would be only too keen to shout their association with it from the rooftops.If I were contributing to an outfit whose cause, we are told, ‘is the ultimate instrument of poverty alleviation, conflict resolution and social justice’ I’d certainly want people to know about it.\u0026nbspStrangely, however, that’s not the case for the funders of Mr Hannan’s group.\u0026nbspHere’s the answer I got to my question on the subject: “The majority of our income comes in the form of donations from private iniduals.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

We are bound by European rules – as are the Dutch, the Belgians and the Irish,\u0027 he saidBrexiteers are “not telling the truth” when they claim France would not need to impose onerous and costly border checks on imports of UK produce in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the President of the Normandy region has said.Some Brexiteers have argued that because the UK and the EU are currently fully aligned in terms of food and plant standards it would be unnecessary for France to check UK produce entering the EU after 29 March 2019, even though Britain would suddenly be a “third country”.This is what day one of a no-deal Brexit could look likeAnd some have even sought to argue that the imposition of such checks would be illegal under World Trade Organisation rules.Lord Lilley, a pro-Brexit former UK trade and industry secretary, suggested this in an interview with the BBC’s Today programme on Monday, as he sought to play down the economic risks of leaving the EU without an agreement.But Hervé Morin, President of the Normandy region and a former defence minister in the cabinet of President Nicolas Sarkozy, insisted on Wednesday that such checks would be unavoidable due to EU customs union and single market rules.“The British are sovereign, but it’s the European rules we apply in France,” he told The Independent, speaking at the French ambassador’s residence in Kensington, central London.“It’s a decision that stems from the EU. We are bound by European rules – as are the Dutch, the Belgians and the Irish.”“Anybody who says something different is not telling the truth.”The prospects of such checks is deeply worrying for UK for UK farmers.The National Farmers Union president Minette Batters said in September that crashing out of the EU would be an “Armageddon scenario” for British farmers.Trade experts agree with the reading of Mr Morin and dismiss the claim that WTO rules forbid new checks.“The EU is obliged by the WTO to treat the UK as it treats other third countries. That is, with many more frictions than the UK faces at present as a member of the EU,” says Alan Winters of the UK Trade Policy Observatory.Normandy is home to a number of major ports, including Cherbourg, Le Havre\u0026nbspand Caen, serving both the tourist and business trade.Mr Morin said that there were “huge challenges” to get the infrastructure in place for future customs checks, even assuming the UK enters a 21-month transition period in March 2019.“There’s a lot of stake economically,” said Mr Morin. “Customs will have to be set up, capacity will have to be increased.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The crew of seven was the largest to fly on a spacecraft at that time, and STS-41G was the first flight to include two female astronauts1730 A Fresh Perspective on an Extraordinary Cluster of GalaxiesGalaxy clusters are often described by superlatives. After all, they are huge conglomerations of galaxies, hot gas, and dark matter and represent the largest structures in the Universe held together by gravityNasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telescope has unveiled in stunning detail a small section of the Veil Nebula - expanding remains of a massive star that exploded about 8,000 years agoThe arrangement of the spiral arms in the galaxy Messier 63, seen here in an image from the Nasa Hubble Space Telescope, recall the pattern at the center of a sunflowerThe spectacular cosmic pairing of the star Hen 2-427 — more commonly known as WR 124 — and the nebula M1-67 which surrounds itFour images from New Horizons’ Long Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI) were combined with colour data from the Ralph instrument to create this enhanced colour global view of Pluto2230 Fresh Crater Near Sirenum Fossae Region of MarsThe HiRISE camera aboard Nasa\u0027s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter acquired this closeup image of a fresh (on a geological scale, though quite old on a human scale) impact crater in the Sirenum Fossae region of Mars.

Technically, two parts: Starship is the spaceshipupper stage \u0026amp Super Heavy is the rocket booster needed to escape Earth’s deep gravity well (not needed for other planets or moons), a follow-up read.The spaceship – whatever its name – is SpaceX\u0027s big hope for the future of space travel. The company hopes that it will eventually replace not only the existing modes of deep space transport but its existing rockets and spacecraft, too.Eventually, SpaceX\u0026nbsphopes to use the Starship to carry people to Mars, where they will live, and possibly even beyond. In the shorter term, the company is aiming for a 2023 mission that will see a Japanese billionaire pay for a host of space tourists to take a trip around the Moon – if the Starship, which will cost around $5 billion to build – is ready in time.Starship is actually the spacecraft\u0027s fourth name. Before it was known as the BFR, the spaceship was known as the\u0026nbspInterplanetary Transport System or ITS – and before that it was called the Mars Colonial Transporter, or MCT, marking it out as part of Mr Musk\u0027s plan to send people to take over Mars.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It’s also worth limiting who can find your Facebook profile with your number and email address. 49 Control access to your TimelineYou can limit who gets to post things on your Timeline and who gets to see posts on your Timeline too. In Settings, go to Timeline and Tagging and edit the sections you want to lock down. When you block someone, they won’t be able to see things you post on your Timeline, tag you, invite you to events or groups, start conversations with you or add you as a friend. To do it, go to Settings and Blocking. Annoyingly, you have to block people on Messenger separately. One of Facebook’s handiest privacy features is the ability to review posts you’re tagged in before they appear on your Timeline. They’ll still be visible on the News Feed while they’re fresh, but won’t be tied to your profile forever. In Timeline and Tagging, enable Timeline review controls. 79 Clean up your appsYou can view a list of all of the apps you’ve connected to your Facebook account by going to Settings and Apps.

Those are intended to make it easier to cut down on how much time you spend there.That includes a feature where users can set a daily reminder when they\u0027ve gone over the amount of time they want to spend on Facebook. That reminder can be for whatever amount of time, and can be easily dismissed when it arrives – but is intended as a quick way of nudging yourself to get off the app.But it also allows people to easily unfollow pages and unfriend people so that their news feed is a more healthy place to be. Clicking that option will show a host of pages that you might want to hide from your timeline, for instance.The new tool works much like the Your Activity page that was recently\u0026nbsplaunched on Instagram. A range of different companies – including both Google in Android and Apple for iOS\u0026nbsp– have launched similar tools, graphing usage in an attempt to ensure that people are using the services safely.It comes amid increasing concern about the damage social networks and other technology are doing to the people who use them.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But 4K is already old news, after Samsung revealed its first 8K TV meant for consumers – doubling the name, quadrupling the number of pixels on offer and heralding the future of screens.Samsung\u0027s newest television crams a full 33 million pixels into a vast display that it hopes becomes the ultimate way of watching the TV. Despite how it might sound, 8K is actually four times as many pixels as existing TVs, and offers what the company says is a significant improvement and innovation on that technology.But the 8K TV isn\u0027t only the consequence of wanting to cram in more pixels or to add bigger numbers to specifications. That sort of thing is largely pointless anyway, because at a certain point those numbers fail to matter: once you have enough pixels in a small enough screen, the eye can\u0027t actually see anymore and so the extra ones aren\u0027t visible anyway.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 42Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.5G wireless internet is expected to launch in 2019, with the potential to reach speeds of 50mbsUber has halted testing of driverless vehicles after a woman was killed by one of their cars in Tempe, Arizona.

At this biennial event, the participating companies exhibit their latest service robotic technologies and componentsThe robot developed by Seed Solutions sings and dances to music during the Japan Robot Week 2016 at Tokyo Big SightIn fact, it is at least partly the result of a growing trend among consumers: buying much bigger televisions. As the screens expand, so must the number of pixels, if companies want to keep a consistently good look – and so the 8K TV starts at 65, going all the way up to 85. (That vast screen, big enough to fill the wall of a small living room, will set you back £15,000.)And so expanding TVs has left companies like Samsung racing not only against the latest spec numbers and pixel counts, but to ensure that their displays are high quality enough to cater for the vast sizes that people are buying them in.We\u0027re seeing a trend towards larger screen technologies, says Stuart Mayo, Samsung\u0027s director of TV and AV, speaking at the launch of the new displays. People have moved from 32 inches to 55 inches as the average screen size now.Part of the reason that people are embracing bigger TVs is that while the screen has grown, the rest has gradually fallen away – the big bezels and backs that often came attached to the display itself have disappeared. That means that people can fit much more screen in the same amount of space, and that the TVs themselves aren\u0027t quite so ugly, meaning that the average display size has quickly shot up.And so you are convinced, encouraged to drop £15,000 on a television roughly the size of a single bed. But then you start to worry that all of those huge numbers might mean nothing if you only end up watching broadcasts of the same 4K – or, most likely, 1080p at best – content that you have been viewing all along.There\u0027s no reason to be concerned, says Samsung: the TV is smart and beautiful enough to analyse that video and make sure it looks its glorious best on your vast new television. The arrayed computing power in the 8K TV allows it to upscale whatever content it is given and fill in the quality gaps to make it look right at home on the vast new displays.Yes, we have 8K coming out before we have a huge volume of 8K content, says Mayo. But you\u0027ll be able to enjoy everything at the world\u0027s best quality.It upscales any of the content you love watching today. So Netflix box sets, the rugby world cup, the olympics – our TV allows you to upscale any of that content and it will be superior.Hidden behind all TVs is what is perhaps the really important part: a processor that is the engine room of the TV and delivers the picture experience that appears on the display itself. Making the 8K TV has largely been made possible by advances in that kind of technology that allows the whole set to be doing far more work, and more smartly: inside of the television is artificial intelligence that can analyse the huge images, take them apart, and then use its technology to work out how best to show them.However beautiful and lush the TVs look when they\u0027re doing their thing, there is one ugly fact that remains true no matter how smart they are: that they are an unfortunate obelisk of black when they\u0027re turned off. That gets even more of a problem as the TVs get bigger and take up more space, swallowing up rooms with their big black void.Samsung thinks it has a fix for that, too, with its ambient mode. As well as allowing the television to be helpful even when you\u0027re not watching anything – by showing news headlines or other updates, for instance – it has something that Mayo refers to as its chameleon feature. Users take a picture of the wall behind the TV and the display then replicates that, allowing the television to effectively disappear. As TVs get bigger and more beautiful, Samsung is also working to make sure they can be a little more invisible, too.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

For years, the US has been unable to launch its own astronauts to the space station or anywhere else – instead relying on Russia to do so for them – and has been waiting and hoping for private solutions to the problem.The historic launch will take place on 7 January, 2019, Nasa said.Nasa video says it is going back to the Moon –\u0026nbspand staying thereThis will be the first uncrewed test flight of the Commercial Crew Program and will provide data on the performance of the Falcon 9 rocket, Crew Dragon spacecraft, and ground systems, as well as on-orbit, docking and landing operations, it said in an announcement.The flight test also will provide valuable data toward NASA certifying SpaceX’s crew transportation system for carrying astronauts to and from the space station.No astronaut has been launched into space since 2011, when the Space Shuttle programme was retired. Since then, all launches have happened at the Baikonur\u0026nbspCosmodrome, which is run by Russia – a situation that has occasionally caused problems, such as fears that no missions would be able to launch after a major issue with a recent trip to the International Space Station.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

I don’t think most people would expect this type of bacteria to be present in things we’re actually consuming – and certainly not in some of the biggest names in the business.

We consume it, we ingest it, it goes into our stomachs, into our guts, and if it’s loaded up with the wrong type of bacteria then it can make us ill. So that’s why this is a concern. “On the basis of the chains that we’ve looked at, the industry needs to do better, making sure that their cleanliness is being well managed.”The findings come almost 18 months after Watchdog Live found traces of faecal bacteria present in the ice at high street coffee shops including Starbucks, Caffé Nero and Costa.

Hunt has not buried his head in the sand and deserves credit for this.\u0026nbspShe says there is a lot to welcome in the draft resolution, which demands an immediate cessation of hostilities in Hodeidah, Yemen\u0027s main port city.\u0026nbspMs Thornberry added: Can the Foreign Secretary tell us why this latest resolution fails to spell out what compliance with the resolution will be monitored and by whom, and what sanctions will apply to any party who breaches its terms whether in terms of the ceasefire or the restriction of humanitarian aid?\u0026nbspShe also pressed him on whether there would be independent investigations into violations of international law - and whether he discussed this in Saudi Arabia.Jeremy Hunt is now answering an urgent question on the need for a ceasefire in Yemen.\u0026nbspHe says the conflict has escalated to become one of the worst humanitarian disasters in the world, where a third of the population are dependent on international aid.\u0026nbspStatistics cannot convey the enormity of this tragedy, he says, which is a \u0027man-made humanitarian catastrophe\u0027.\u0026nbspHunt called on all sides to set aside their arms and seek a peaceful political settlement.

Nearly 1,400 people are now known to have died as UN officials warned the needs remain vast for both desperate survivors and rescue teams still searching for victimsBritain, the US and other European nations lobbied against his attempts to be elected, arguing his appointment would lead to further Russian abuses of Interpol’s “red notice” system to go after political opponents.Missing Interpol chief Meng Hongwei might already be dead, wife fearsEx-Interpol head investigated for bribery and ‘wilfulness’, China saysMissing Interpol chief’s wife says he sent knife pic before vanishingThe mystery of the missing Interpol presidentMr Prokopchuk is a general in the Russian interior ministry and serves as one of four vice presidents of the agency –\u0026nbspthe first Russian to hold such a senior post.Mr Kim’s win means he secured at least two-thirds of votes cast at Interpol’s general assembly in Dubai on Wednesday.He will serve until 2020, completing the four-year mandate of his predecessor, Mr Meng.“Our world is now facing unprecedented changes which present huge challenges to public security and safety,” Mr Kim told told the assembly, according to the agency’s Twitter.“To overcome them, we need a clear vision: we need to build a bridge to the future.”South Korea’s president, Moon Jae-in, congratulated\u0026nbspMr Kim on becoming the first South Korean to head the organisation.“We’re very proud. I, together with our people, am sending congratulations,” Mr Moon wrote on social media.Britain’s foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, welcomed the result as “very important news for rule of law internationally”.Browder: ‘I am definitely at risk’British financier Bill Browder, a long-standing critic of Mr Putin, celebrated the vote and vowed to continue his battle to get Russia suspended from the police network over its “serial abuse” of arrest notices.He tweeted: “Interpol rejects Russian candidate as president. Instead votes to elect South Korean candidate. Reason prevails in this dark world.”“Now, the clear next step is to suspend Russia from Interpol for its consistent and serial abuse of the red notice and diffusion system for political purposes. My legal team is preparing an initiative to use Interpol’s own rules to begin this process.”Mr Kim, a police official in South Korea, was serving as interim president after Mr Meng’s departure from the post and was senior vice president at Interpol.\u0026nbspBased in the French city of Lyon, Interpol is best known for issuing red notices\u0026nbspthat identify a suspect pursued by another country, effectively putting them on the world’s “most wanted” list.\u0026nbspHuman rights groups raised their concerns two years ago when Interpol’s general assembly approved Mr Meng as president. Amnesty International criticised “China’s longstanding practice of trying to use Interpol to arrest dissidents and refugees abroad”.Several prominent Kremlin critics warned that electing Mr Prokopchuk – who has ties to Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin – would have undermined the international law enforcement agency and politicised police cooperation across borders.\u0026nbspRussia accused critics of running a “campaign to discredit” Mr Prokopchuk, calling him a respected professional.\u0026nbspSir Vince Cable, leader of the Liberal Democrats, warned the Russian’s election would be “an absolute insult to the victims of the Salisbury attack”, while Marina Litvinenko, widow of poisoned dissident Alexander Litvinenko, had said Mr Putin’s critics in the UK would not feel safe if he\u0026nbspwon.The White House came out on Tuesday against the election of Mr Prokopchuk, with National Security Council spokesman Garrett Marquis saying: “The Russian government abuses Interpol’s processes to harass its political opponents.” He said the US\u0026nbsp”strongly endorses” Mr Kim.\u0026nbspThe US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said Washington encourages all nations and organisations that are part of Interpol to choose a leader with credibility and integrity that reflects one of the world’s most critical law enforcement bodies.“We believe Mr\u0026nbspKim will be just that,” he said.Russia, however, secured a win for its ally\u0026nbspSerbia\u0026nbspon Tuesday, when Kosovo’s bid to join Interpol failed to garner enough votes at the Dubai assembly.The move would have boosted Kosovo’s efforts at recognition of its statehood.

The Middle Eastern studies specialist from Durham University visited the country to research his PhD thesis and was arrested in Dubai Airport on May 5. At the last hearing, on October 24, a court-appointed lawyer maintained Mr Hedges\u0027 innocence, arguing that the evidence brought forward - Mr Hedges\u0027 notes from his PhD research - did not contain anything confidential, meaning the court should review it before passing judgment.Matthew Hedges with his wife Daniela Tejada - pictured before his arrest (Image: PA)The court agreed and postponed the hearing until November 21.Mr Hedges was released from detention on October 29 and had since been staying in Dubai, with an ankle bracelet monitoring his movements.Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, and Minister of State for the Middle East Alistair Burt, have both previously travelled to the UAE to make representations on Mr Hedges\u0027 behalf.Mr Hunt urged the UAE court to reconsider the sentence. I am deeply shocked and disappointed by the verdict today, he said.I have personally raised the case of Matthew Hedges at the highest levels of the UAE government, including during my visit to Abu Dhabi on 12 November. On that occasion, I spoke to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed and Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Zayed.However, today\u0027s verdict is not what we expect from a friend and trusted partner of the United Kingdom and runs contrary to earlier assurances.Our consular officials have been in close contact with Matthew Hedges and his family. We will continue to do everything possible to support him. I have repeatedly made clear that the handling of this case by the UAE authorities will have repercussions for the relationship between our two countries, which has to be built on trust.\u0026nbspI regret the fact that we have reached this position and I urge the UAE to reconsider.Ben Ward, acting UK director at Human Rights Watch, said: Human Rights Watch is deeply alarmed by the verdict against Matthew Hedges given the inhumane conditions he was held in prior to his release on bail, the serious due process violations that marred his trial, and the UAE\u0027s disturbing record of mistreating state security detainees.British authorities should closely monitor Hedges\u0027s appeal and insist upon his humane treatment in prison, proper access to a lawyer, and that coerced statements not be used as evidence against him.

It’s quite unusual in a politician.But then I suppose Trumpo isn’t your usual politician.The US President was at it again in France.The idiotic French President Macron has dug up that idea about a European army, run by those genius minds at the EU.Those of us not keen on the EU always worried about this ridiculous notion — but we were told by pro-EU politicians that it would never happen. Another lie.Macron said Europe should have its own armed forces to guard against interference from Russia, China and — the USA.What a rude and stupid statement to make in the run up to Armistice Day.When French people would do well to remember that it was us — and the Yanks — that saved their benighted country.Sometimes I wonderit was worth it.Trump was right on the case, with one of his famous tweets.He des­cribed Macron’s comments as insulting.And he added thatit wasn’t for the Americans, the French would be speaking German by now. Quite right.And he’s right, too, that the EU nations do not pull their weight when it comes to funding the real alliance against our real enemies, Nato.They all like to snipe from the sidelines at the USA.And resent the Americans for their power, influence and success.And for bailing them out of the last war.But then they expect the yanks to spend vast amounts of money protecting them all.Germany, one of the richest countries in the world, spends only . per cent of its GDP on forces for Nato. That is as pathetic as it is typical.The French themselves spend only . per cent.We’re second only to the Americans in our spending — but even then I would argue that it’s not enough.Our Armed Forces have been cut to the bone over the past two decades.Would we be able to retake the Falkland Islands now,Argentina invaded  I doubt it.The truth is that Nato is the one alliance of which we should be glad to be a member.It is an alliance of largely civilised, largely democratic countries which has held fast against tyrants, despots and warmongers for  years.Most notably, of course, the Cold War, in which the Soviet Union was defeated without a shot being fired.But now Trump is getting a bit tired of Nato because the US always has to spend, spend, spend.And with the Europeans thinking again of having an EU army there are many who think the days of Nato are numbered.That would be a terrible mistake.An EU army to replace Nato It would be bureau­cratic, incompetent and short-funded.And it would surrender before you could say “Macron”.THE Lord Mayor of Sheffield is a ludicrous dingbat called Magid Magid who has been coughed up from somewhere deep in the bowels of the Green Party.Shortly before Remembrance Day he posted a publicity shot of himself online wearing a white poppy and a T-shirt saying “never again!”A good moment, then, to ask the vital question: Have you ever met someone wearing a white poppy who wasn’t a complete and utter moron We wear red poppies to commemorate the terrible loss of le in battle.People wear white poppies to commemorate themselves and their fatuous sensibilities.It’s called showing off.WAGES have risen at the fastest rate for almost a decade.They went up by nearly three per cent in the three months to September, compared to a year earlier – and about time, too. This has been the real problem with our economy.But it looks like we’re on the right track.UH-OH – the Beast from the East is said to be on its way back.You remember late last winter. We were snowed in for a week. Nobody could come to visit.The missus couldn’t get to the shops to buy anything.It was just about perfect. All you need is a few bottles of Jack Daniel’s and some soup. Make sure you’re prepared.LUCKY, lucky earthquake victims.Here’s Paris Hilton in Mexico, visiting survivors of the  earthquake.And giving them bottles of Paris Hilton perfume and cushions with “Paris Hilton” stamped across them.Just exactly what they needed.Paris said: “I love the people, I think they are all beautul, they have great hearts, they are beautul inside and out, they are very genuine and incredible.”Just like you, Paris, just like you. A WOMAN who met the Liberal Democrat peer Lord Lester says she was offered an interesting proposition.Have sex with me, the -year-old goat suggested, and I’ll make you a baroness.Can’t say fairer than that, can you The most I’ve ever offered is a bag of Pickled Onion Monster Munch.Lester has been suspended from the House of Lords as a result.Thing is, it’s always the liberals who get up to this kind of stuff.Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacey, Woody Allen and now Lester.Ladies, I’m telling you,a liberal bloke approaches you in a bar telling you how pro-feminist he is, activate your alarm, call the Old Bill and get the hell out, sharpish.THIS is Sophie Michelle. She makes £k a year by whispering to people over the internet.Usually stuff like: “Hello sweetheart.”She says it stimulates the listener’s “autonomous sensory meridian response”.Which is perhaps the longest phrase for “penis” I have ever heard.MONICA LEWIN­SKY was the young intern who had an affair with President Clinton, back in the s.Come on – you remember. According to reports a cigar was involved.And Monica had a revealing stain on the front of her dress.She’s been talking about the whole episode again.And she says she thought the stuff on her dress was “spinach dip”.Really  If it looked like spinach dip I think Bill should have got himself off to a doctor, pronto.Are you sure it wasn’t cock-a-leekie ASIA BIBI is the Pakistani Christian woman who was sentenced to death for alleged “blasphemy” against the Prophet Muhammad.She then had her sentence commuted and some Pakistani Muslims are going bonkers, as usual.Demanding she have her head cut off.

We’ll deal with the savagesthey try ­anything on.We’re getting used to it, after all.I’M trying to work out which of the Remoaners I dislike more. Gary Lineker or Tony Blair.I suppose Gary didn’t illegally invade a sovereign country.But then Blair never sported a stupid goatee beard or spent half of his le selling crisps.Although I daresay he would have donethere’d been enough dosh in it.Lineker, like many other remoaners, was demanding a second vote on Brexit.

Suppose we had to submit to a trade and tarf regime designed solely to benefit the other .I hope both sides could agree that such an outcome would be the worst of all possible worlds. And yet, that is where we appear to have ended up.First, under the transition, we shall explicitly be non-voting members for two years.As Brussels has spelt out with brutal clarity, the only change will be that Britain loses its Commissioner, its MEPs and its vote in Council.Then, under the backstop, that status, or something very like it, will be imposed on us in semi-perpetuity.Surely no one — Remain or Leave — can favour such an outcome.I have been arguing since polling day for moderation.I was prepared to accept any compromise, including European Free Trade Association and including Chequers, provided it restored the supremacy of our laws.But the purgatory that now beckons is surely, by any definition, worse than either staying or leaving.From the start, our objective was simply to reach a deal — any deal.Our negotiators, shell-shocked by the referendum result, approached the talks in a spirit of damage limitation.They never seriously contemplated walking away, and the other side smelt their desperation.To be fair, our officials were not helped by the noises coming out of Westminster.How would you expect EU negotiators to react when senior British politicians urge them to hang tough and force a second referendum We might view Tony Blair, John Major and Nick Clegg as has-beens but, believe me, they are seen in Brussels as men of influence.So we fell into a pattern. Britain would make some new concession in the hope of unlocking a deal.Then Brussels would pocket the concession and demand more and — incredibly — British Remainers would cheer.The UK agreed to hand over more money than was due accepted the EU’s absurd and illogical sequencing made an unconditional security guarantee offered to copy EU standards and promised not to be more competitive than its neighbours.Each time, the EU brusquely demanded “more movement”. Each time, Britain rushed to comply.Which brings us to where we are — facing colonial rule from Brussels, of the sort the EU imposed on Bosnia following the Yugoslav war.I am not one of those Brexiteers who half-favoured no deal all along.On the contrary, I was proposing moderation even before the vote, and have repeated that call many times since.But, paradoxically, our reluctance to countenance no deal has made such an outcome likelier.We have reached the point where the terms on offer are less attractive than either a World Trade Organization-based Brexit or a second referendum. This last point is critical.I suspect that two contradictory arguments will now be wheeled out before wavering MPs.Europhiles will be told that the deal, backstop and all, is better than “crashing out” on WTO terms.Conversely, Eurosceptics will be told thatthey don’t approve the deal, Parliament might vote to extend Article , thus imperilling Brexit.These two lines of argument can’t both be true, of course and, in reality, neither of them is.We’re invited to believe thatBoris Johnson and Jo Johnson, from opposite ends of the Brexit spectrum, both oppose the deal, it can’t be too bad. In fact, both Johnsons oppose it because it is a lamentable failure of statecraft.Boris was no Brexit headbanger: He came out for Leave only after the EU refused to give David Cameron any powers back.And Jo is no Remoaner: He has spent two years in Government trying to deliver a reasonable Brexit. If neither of them will back the deal, that tells us something.There is still time — just — to recover our position.As things stand, the backstop has no legal force.The moment it finds its way into a treaty, it will be binding. If any MPs oppose the current approach, now is their chance to act. There won’t be another.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In the s, Ted Heath and Harold Wilson both knew we would baulk at belonging to a Common Market that robbed us of our national independence.So they hid its true purpose — “ever closer union”, leading to a superstate with one currency. The public was reassured our sovereignty would not be surrendered to any meaningful degree.The Tory and Labour leaders both knew this was a lie. But they kept quiet when signing us up in  and when holding the first referendum in .Voters were betrayed from the start. And the pattern was set.In  John Major signed the Maastricht Treaty, creating the EU, without risking the public vote that saw it initially rejected by the Danes and Irish.In  Tony Blair — who now shamelessly praises fork-tongued civil ­servants for hoodwinking eurosceptic ministers — feared he would lose a referendum on handing new powers to the EU. So he refused to hold it.His successor Gordon Brown, never big on honesty when a lie served him better, pretended this Lisbon Treaty was too insignicant to bother voters with.The EU is founded on deceit. “When it becomes serious, you have to lie,” says President Jean-Claude Juncker. Voters are bullied into reversing inconvenient referendums or denied a say at all.And so to Mrs May, the Brexit deal her Cabinet agreed last night and the revealing EU leak yesterday which makes crystal-clear Brussels’ intentions to keep us in its vice-like grip for ever.That plan being to lock us into its Customs Union for all time, unable to make our own trade deals, powerlessly swallowing its orders and obeying its rules.Our Government knows we cannot legally escape this central pillar of the EU — which we voted to “leave”, remember — without consent from Brussels that it will never give.This is not some minor afterthought, to be bargained away, which is why MPs rejected it in July. It is crucial to the reclaiming of our sovereignty which a .million majority including many Sun readers, voted for in .It is crucial to our post-Brexit prosperity. It looks crucial, too, to whether the deal lives or dies. Yet, knowing exactly what the EU intends for us, the PM still brazenly insisted yesterday that we WILL make our own trade deals.How, Mrs May  We cannot. You surely know it.Do not kid yourself no one is paying attention. The public has been sold a pup again and again. It has had enough.Come clean with Britain. This deal is not wholly without merit.

Preferably driving John Barrowman’s jeep.But definitely presenting I’m A Celebrity . . . Get Me Out Of Here! which kicked off, on Sunday night, with Dec hosting and Holly ­Willoughby hanging around like a competition winner.An arrangement that would be unsustainable in other years. I’m prepared to cut the  series some slack, though, for two reasons.First, it is purely a temporary pairing and, second, ITV has promised me Noel Edmonds, who shouldn’t just have been the first one in the camp, he should’ve been choppered in about eight years ago, when the contestants started all this “bonding” rubbish, which has ruined more series than I care to remember.Oh, what some of them could’ve done with a one-man feud generator like Noel, whose Wikipedia entry will give you a fair idea of his inner turmoil even before you get to the bit where he says: “When I die, my energy willto where it came from.” Ilford He’s also got a le-size mannequin doll called Candice, who accompanies him everywhere and would be a more than welcome replacement for a few of the camp mates, who’ve got a bit of a Rita Who and Knob Too feel about them this year.The knob part of that equation, fairly obviously, is all-singing, all-dancing John Barrowman “MBE” , who described himself as “fabulous”, “an icon” and “down-to-earth” within the space of one sentence, on Sunday, and was wrong on every count.He also hit on the yacht waiter, using one of his dance moves.“It’s a pas de bourrée. Kick ball, change and turn. Can you do that ”“I’m not allowed.”Not even the kick balls bit Shame. He needs someone to calm him down.Although, as horrendous as it must be to live with, I don’t mind Barrowman on I’m A Celeb, as the show does need a massive irritant to get under everyone’s skin.On similar grounds, I also welcome EastEnders’ Rita Simons, who looks like she might have a tantrum or two in her, Nick Knowles, who will be incapable of stling his Sir Galahad complex, and Harry Redknapp, just because he’s Harry Redknapp.Of the others The public jury’s probably still out on Emily Atack and The Chase Governess Anne Hegerty, who “used to be a Brownie”, as well as eating a lot of them.Mentally, though, I have already completely written off Coronation Street’s Sair Khan, some bloke off Hollyoaks, The Vamps’ James McVey and X Factor’s Fleur East, who arrived dressed as a dispatch rider for the first episode.Possibly for the very good reason she’s now working as one.This might sound like a hasty and fairly damning assessment, I realise, but compared to some series, four solidly promising bookings isn’t actually a bad .What it very clearly needs, though, is Edmonds, because, without him, Sunday’s opening episode, for all its high adrenaline thrills, became a bit of a drag.It usually does, of course, as the celebs haven’t yet let their guard drop.But, in this instance it meant the spotlight fell on Holly Willoughby, and you quickly realised Dec hasn’t had to work this hard since he tried bouncing jokes off Hogan the Koala.Just as Edmonds could turn out to be a massive disappointment, Holly Willoughby could get the hang of I’m A Celeb, obviously.At the moment, though, her one signicant contribution came after the parachuting challenge when she asked: “How come Shane had a helmet and Emily didn’t ”’Cos the bloke was doing all the hard work and she was just hanging around.Buckle up, Dec.Alastair Campbell’s far-too-frequent Good Morning Britain appearances always proving as welcome as a turd in a swimming pool.Strictly stars forever banging on about reaching Blackpool without ever mentioning it means they get paid more.Every wretched, product-placing second of the entertainment on Friday’s Children In Need.And particularly EastEnders’ big song-and-dance routine, which had the Disney Company’s Angela Affinita claiming: “We have Letitia Dean actually interacting with Mickey Mouse.”Good luck with that one, Mickey.IF you want to know just how brutally British republicans would mistreat the Royal Family,they ever came to power, just take a look at what those who claim to love them the most do to the Windsors now.Stuff like We Are Most Amused And Amazed, a th birthday tribute, hosted by Armstrong  Miller, on ITV, that probably left the future King Charles III thinking Charles I got off lightly.Two hours of canned laughter and pick-a-card-any-card magical tw*ttery with the likes of Sandi Toksvig, who took  seconds to remind us she’s gay, Omid Djalili, who took an entire  seconds to remind us he’s Iranian, and Rowan Atkinson, who rather set the evening’s tone by announcing: “As the more perceptive of you will have noticed, this is hell.”There was a family of German illusionists as well, which I thought was a bit insensitive, given the royal circumstances, plus Sooty  Sweep and a lot of grovelling from randoms, like Cheryl Tweedy and Kylie Minogue.Presumably because they could both be guaranteed to keep a straight face when describing the birthday boy as “a style icon” and “philanthropist”.Then, at the end of it all, dear old Charles shuffled on, waved and thanked everybody.And he may even have meant every syllable of it as well, given that Alexander Armstrong thrilled the Palladium crowd by deciding not to sing.Truly, the Royal Family is the most wondrous thing.Jenny Eclair: “The last thing any woman needs, during or after the menopause, is a bothersome vagina.”Tough, you’ve got one for another  minutes.MEANWHILE, desperate times call for desperate means at the rugby, as England trail Japan - and Sir Clive Woodward suggests: “We’ve got to start using our physicality, just outside the rucks, to suck these Japanese guys.”A WELCOME antidote to all of the lazy, repetitive, biased, hideously self-satisfied and right-on comedy broadcast by the BBC and Channel  finally reappeared, on Saturday night.Michael McIntyre’s Big Show, on BBC, which has to be the most perfectly judged hour of television, all year.A quota-free joy that’s warm, funny and has mainstream appeal, without ever being too cloying, safe, predictable or slick, as you will have noticed when Lionel Blair completely sabotaged the “Unexpected Star” reveal, in a pop-up Zimmer frame shop, with -year-old David Owen.“Say hello to David,” McIntyre whispered into his ear-piece.“Hello David!”Pause. “How does he know my name’s David ”Well, quite. Among his other gts, though, Michael McIntyre, above, has the ability to charm and ad-lib his way out of these situations, which gives his Big Show a seat-of-its-pants feel, despite being one of the most carefully structured formats on television.As anyone with a brain can see, in fact, it should be the blueprint for almost everything BBC comedy does.So I can pretty much guarantee, this time next year, Have I Got News, The Mash Report and Frankie Boyle’s New World Order will still be telling us how much they hate Brexit and Donald Trump and someone from the BBC, on £, a year, will be assuring licence-payers: “Sara Pascoe is the future of comedy.”Pointless Celebrities: “Hi, I’m Luisa Omielan and I’m a comedian.” Bless.And Good Morning Britain, Susanna Reid: “I don’t think the word ambition applies to me.

He was like a neanderthal man with lots of messy hair. “He was kind of perched about  feet up between two branches of a tree and Im looking at it, trying to register, ‘What is it this  What am I looking at ’“I keep thinking, ‘This isnt happening, this is just a shadow, this is just a tree stump and all of a sudden he turns his head and I know I shouldn’t get any closer.“I ask my daughters: ‘Do you see a head, do you see eyes, do you see shoulders  It was like I was confirming, ‘Are you seeing what Im seeing ’ and they said, ‘Yeah, yeah’.“Then I decided to ‘whoop’ at him loudly - I wanted to warn him, ‘Look at me not my kids’. “I saw him scratch his face and then he started swinging back and forth in the tree and I knew I had to get my kids out of there.”When the shell-shocked family finally made it back to the car, youngest daughter Jenna revealed how she’d actually seen three of the creatures - the large one in the tree and two smaller ones.The day after the sighting on March ,  Claudia visited the same tree and discovered  inch footprint and a  inch footprint near the site - both with five toes.She began looking into the issue and found there were thousands of similar sightings around the US. Claudia put a sign up on the trail encouraging anyone who had an “unusual” experience on the trail to get in touch “without judgement”.She received six phone calls from locals within two weeks, many of who had heard mysterious noises or had sightings themselves.One caller said they regularly heard screams that sounded like “a woman getting raped” along the trail.The mum-of-two is now campaigning to get authorities to take the issue seriously and has even filed a lawsuit against the state of Calornia for failing to protect the public from the creatures.She ended up withdrawing her first lawsuit, filed in January, to try and gather more evidence and is about to file her second lawsuit in the next few weeks. And after she and her two daughters struggled emotionally after the encounter - struggling to sleep and experiencing flashbacks - she’s also decided to set up a PTSD group for survivors of Bigfoot sightings.“I’m on a quest now to try and help people, she explained. Im suing the state of Calornia for their dereliction of duty and my mission is for the Fish and Wildle authorities prove the existence of Sasquatch.“As far as the lawsuit goes, I dont have to prove they exist I just want the wildle authorities to do their job and they will surely prove their existence.“So thatthey get a report of a sighting they dont laugh they go investigate. I get  messages a day from all over the world from people who have had sightings saying, ‘Thank you for what you’re doing - we don’t know what to do’.“There is far too much evidence to dismiss this - it’s a public safety issue.“There’s been hundreds of unexplained disappearances of adults and children in our national parks that could be linked to these creatures.“I also hope to set up nationwide PTSD groups where people who have had encounters can go and talk about it and deal with the aftermath without ridicule.”Since the sighting Claudia has been attempting to communicate with the creatures, leaving gts for them in the woods and stacks of stones and pine cones in dferent patterns.She even made a picture book with recorded audio - to try and teach them language.“Weve noticed a lot of primate behaviour in this area - there’s a lot of tree breaks, things that are twisted, not broken, like with natural winter weather, Claudia said.“Weve also noticed that theres rock stacks - and bears dont pick up rocks and make like little pyramids and theyre all over these woods and Im there signs of them as an example. “There was a full peanut butter jar that was left in the area and we found the empty jar of peanut butter with like a stick, inside the jar, which means something used to hand to use like a stick.“I made a book for them and its basically my voice. You record my voice on this book and you can put pictures of whatever you want and basically tell a story and it records your voice. “We put recorders out in the woods in the middle of the night. Something came and opened up the book and turned the pages - you can hear my voice in the recording.“Its interesting because of course it could be human, but whos going to be walking in the woods at two in the morning and find my gt ”Claudia and Bigfoot researcher Ed Brown have also managed to obtain finger prints and other evidence from the area that they have sent for DNA testing.So far results have come back as “unknown primate” - which Claudia believes should be enough to launch an investigation into the creatures.“They say that monsters dont exist or these creatures are just a myth and theyre not - we have DNA evidence to prove they exist,” she said. “The court case is going to continue soon and the national PTSD group is going to continue and we seem to have a lot of love and support - as well as a lot of haters but thats to be expected.“But in my heart I always told myself, this is really important. If I was leaving that trail that day and saw like a family coming on the trail, what would I say to them  Dont go over there - there’s a Bigfoot “Theyll say, ‘Shes crazy what are you talking about ’ But the truth is there are these huge bipedal primate type species in these woods. “So I feel I have to share my experience with people. Its just my quest and Im not going to stop until something happens.“Ive offered to take a lie detector, test, a drug test, a psych evaluation, whatever I need to prove my story to people - this happened and we need to take it seriously.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

After all, the notion that Merkel, Macron et al will bite off their own electorate’s noses to spite Britain’s volte face on EU membership is an absolute nonsense.In a letter to The Times yesterday, the chairman of pub chain JD Wetherspoon, Tim Martin, wrote: “The great urban myth, promoted by advocates of the deadly exchange rate mechanism, the euro and Remain, is that a ‘deal’ with the EU is a prerequisite of future prosperity.”The reality, he says, is that no deal would allow us to join successful countries such as Canada, Singapore, Israel and Australia in the free-trading world and “by slashing the EU’s , protectionist tarfs, shop prices will fall, with no loss to the Treasury, since tarf income is currently remitted to Brussels”.On top of that, we won’t have to pay the £billion orce bill, will regain control of our fishing waters, borders and laws and, ultimately, all have more money in our pockets.

In , we expect our national broadcaster to reflect all our opinions even-handedly.We don’t want the BBC to tell us that one side is right and the other wrong, or what we should believe, or which opinions are “true” and which are “”.But that is what the BBC has started to do, at least on the subject of Brexit.The BBC tried to be reasonably balanced during the referendum campaign, but it was so upset by the outcome that it has abandoned any attempt at impartiality and become grotesquely one-sided.The views of Remainers are not just over-represented, they are rarely challenged. And scare stories about Brexit which are either exaggerated or completely imaginary are presented as fact.I decided to compile a list of myths about Brexit — particularly scare stories about what will happen when we leave the Customs Union orwe leave Europe without a deal.Then I compared them with the facts. Although the pamphlet did not mention the BBC, most of the myths were things we hear daily on its programmes.The BBC rose to the bait and invited me into the Today programme on Radio  yesterday to be grilled by John Humphrys, its star interviewer. It was a fair enough interview. He challenged my arguments but I was able to refute his claims point by point.However, they then brought on a chap called Chris Morris, described as the BBC “reality checker”, who was invited to rebut my document. But all he did was oppose my facts with the opinions of people with whom he agreed.He systematically argued the Remain case and defended their Project Fear scare stories. The one thing he did not do was bring in any new facts. My central claim was thatwe leave the EU Customs Union but have a free trade agreement with the European Union, our businesses have little to fear.The main dference will be that traders will have to send in a customs declaration detailing the goods they are buying from or selling to Europe.That is a nuisance which we should try to simply as much as possible.But allegations that “this will be hugely costly, cause y delays, disrupt supply chains and undermine economic growth” are imaginary or exaggerated.“Fact checker” Morris said the majority of trade experts and freight companies to whom he had spoken robustly disagreed with me. This is an opinion, not a fact.Surely,trading in a free trade area — like that which exists between Switzerland and the EU or between Canada and the US — is so intolerable, the people there would be calling for a customs union.But they aren’t. I prefer their practical experience to the speculation of Mr Morris’s contacts.I also quoted a report by the CLECAT organisation, which covers , companies handling  per cent of the freight and customs in Europe, who said: “All the ingredients to ensure a smooth exit process of the UK from the EU, and which allow almost frictionless trade after the exit, are already available.”Why should a BBC fact checker’s unnamed contacts count for more than their considered view He then claimed there are no checks at the border at present. I go across to my house in France frequently and see the checks — for drugs, illegal immigrants, alcohol, cigarettes.And companies have to report all their cross-border trade separately on their VAT s and provide statistical s to Brussels.Then Mr Morris claimed there would be more checks by our customs officers at Dover, resulting in delays and disruption. That is nonsense.The Head of Customs and Revenue has said it only stops and searches lorries at present where it has intelligence information about drugs, illegal immigrants, and goods such as tobacco and alcohol, upon which excise duty is paid.It does not expect any of these risks to become more frequent. So it will not need to search any more vehicles.As I was still in the studio, I was able to rebut his pathetic attempts to rebut my facts. Normally he gets a clear run.But what is intolerable is that he almost never tries to rebut arguments by those trying to overturn the referendum result.I asked him afterwards to name a single Remainer whose case he had attempted to dissect. When he replied that there were “lots”, I said it should be easy to name one and, after repeated challenges, he named Jeremy Corbyn.The idea that Mr Corbyn — a man who has voted more often against European membership than any other MP and went on holiday during the referendum — is a Remainer could only be taken for reality by a BBC reality checker.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Its really exciting.Meghan has made several private visits to the community kitchen since January and the cookbook was her first solo project as a royal.She has previously described it as a tremendous labour of love.Meghan, who is around five months pregnant, was greeted by kitchen co-ordinator Zaheera Sufyaan and Abdurahman Sayed, chief executive of the Al Manaar Muslim Cultural Centre.She quickly abandoned any pretence at formality when she got into the kitchen.The US actress made meals which included rainbow roasted vegetables, a recipe in the book from Ahlam Saeid, an Iraqi chemist, who stood chatting to the Duchess as she mixed the vegetables.The book, which features more than  recipes from women whose community was affected by the fire, was the start of a journey into other community projects for the women at the community centre, where those who fled the Grenfell fire were fed in the days and weeks that followed the tragedy.They are now feeding the homeless and the elderly, and embarking on other projects, such as helping others learn English and computer skills.Meghan, who suggested the idea of a fundraising cookbook when she first met the women, said to a group of the women: “It starts from one idea and from this one idea starts so much.“I’m so proud of you.”The Duchess told them: “It hasn’t been a year yet. From that standpoint, what you have achieved in that short space of time - it’s really exciting.”Chef Clare Smyth, who visited the kitchen for the first time with Meghan, said: If everyone took care of their community like this there would be no issues in the world.Ms Smith said Meghan had spoken with passion about the kitchen.Shes really into food, shes a real foodie.The Duchess will also learn about some of the planned new outreach projects at the kitchen, which will be funded by proceeds from Together: Our Community Cookbook.Together it has sold more than , copies in the UK and raised £, so far in the seven weeks since it went on sale.It sold tens of thousands more in international sales but they haven’t got an accurate figure for those yet.They set out to raise £, to renovate the kitchen and open it seven days a week so reckon they will easily surpass that, especially with Christmas coming up.A royal aide said Meghan would continue to work with the women but declined to say whether this might be the start of a wider, nationwide project.She said: “It’s too early to say yet but she will continue to visit here. This project will always have a special place in her heart.”It comes after the US actress revealed her surprising friendship with Michael Buble after meeting him at a dinner party.The Duchess of Sussex met the king of Christmas at a meal hosted by her stylist BFF Jessica Mulroney, , and husband Ben, , in November .Meghan revealed she was still friendly with the singer - who she met while filming Suits in Canada between  and ."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000451015566.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"universal credit foodbank stockup families left without money","story":"Sufra NW London in Brent is urgently replenishing its supply of tinned goods to help people facing hardship and acute stress when the new scheme is introduced in the borough tomorrow.Universal Credit is the Governments new welfare system which bundles six existing benefits into a single monthly payment.The scheme is being implemented across Britain in phases, with the full national roll-out still years away.But areas which already have the scheme have seen some families being left without any money because of delayed payments.Mohammed Mamdani, Director of Sufra NW London, supported by Islamic Relief UK, said: There has been very little public awareness of what Universal Credit is and how people will be affected by it, so a lot of vulnerable people will be in for a big shock.Many people affected don’t read newspapers and don’t have a television, so we are expecting chaos.Research has shown that in other boroughs that have rolled out Universal Credit, there has been a  per cent increase in food banks, so we are getting prepared and are stockpiling as much food as we can.The issue comes from the fact that many people will have to wait a month to receive their first payment.Mohammed added: People who come to our food bank are living hand-to-mouth and being forced to wait for benefit payments could be devastating for them.They could be plunged into debt and unable to pay for essential food and fuel bills.And at this time of the year, as the cold weather sets in, this could be very dangerous.“I have serious concerns for the mental health of many people who will be moving onto this new system. The existing benefits system is already very stressful to navigate but I fear that Universal Credit will send people over the edge.We only have one advice worker for , people at the centre and we are expecting absolute chaos!”When you first claim Universal Credit you wont be paid any money until five weeks after you submit your claim, you will then be paid monthly.So,you need help to pay your bills or cover other costs while you wait for your first Universal Credit payment, you can apply to get an advance.You can apply for an advance payment via your online universal credit account or through your Jobcentre Plus work coach.If you get Universal Credit, you may be able to apply for a budgeting advance of between £ and £ - depending on your circumstances - to help pay for emergency household costs.Again, this MUST be repaid within a year and repayments will be deducted from your monthly Universal Credit payments - or via other meansyou no longer get universal credit.If you fail to meet your responsibilities or what you’ve agreed in your claimant commitment, your Universal Credit could be stopped or reduced - this is called a sanction.You can ask for a hardship paymentyou cannot pay for rent, heating, food or hygiene needs because you got a sanction.The hardship payment is roughly  per cent of the amount you were sanctioned by in the last month.Again, you will need to pay it back through your Universal Credit payments.If you’re having financial dficulties or you’re behind on your rent, you or your landlord may be able to apply for an alternative payment arrangement .Depending on your circumstances, you could get an APA to: Renters and homeowners may also be entitled to housing payment.Plus,youre struggling to pay your council tax bills you may also be allowed an up to  per cent reduction. Contact your local authority for more information.If youre struggling to pay for a food shop, you may be able to get a minimum of three days worth of food from a Trussell Trust food bank - there are around  of these across the UK.Contact your local foodbank to find out which referral agencies it works with in your area and how you can get a voucher.Minister for Employment Alok Sharma said: Universal Credit is central to our commitment to help families improve their lives by moving into work.We know its working - with Universal Credit people are moving into work faster and staying in work longer than under the old system.And now we are rolling it out to a wider range of people in a safe and controlled way."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT000440719076.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"brit holiday destinations tenerife majorca climate change storms","story":"The warning to tourists comes after monster ft waves demolished balconies in Tenere and the Costa Blanca was hit by severe flooding in just the past few days.Italy, Majorca and expat enclaves in the south of France were also devastated by killer flash floods after record rainfall last month.Today a climate change expert said this type of extreme weather will only get WORSE in future as global temperatures rise.Prof Peter Stott, science fellow at the Met Office Hadley Centre, told The Sun Online: People imagine going to places like Tenere the weather will be nice.Instead we see these images of massive waves. Tenere is vulnerable to storms of course, but these are things people arent expecting.Its like the wildfires in Calornia, where wealthy people buy homes because its such a pleasant environment.Climate scientists have been saying for a long time we do expect a rapid increase in the frequency of extreme weather.He said the Tenere storm is part of a general pattern, warning that violent Atlantic storms are becoming more likely and when they hit they are more dangerous.Experts say it is not possible to blame inidual storms on global warming.But research is already pointing to a link to vastly higher levels of rain that leads to killer floods.Prof Stott said one study on Hurricane Florence — which brought biblical flooding to Florida and the Carolinas in September — suggested climate change had increased rainfall by half. At least  died in what was called a thousand-year rain event.He said: Thats just one example of how climate change is making these storms more powerful and more intense when they hit land.We have sea surface temperatures C higher than in pre-industrial times.That brings six to seven per cent higher moisture in the atmosphere as more water evaporates off the surface.All that is fuel to the fire — theres more energy fuelling these extreme weather events.It comes on top of higher sea levels which are rising by mm every year, so coastal defences are at risk of being overwhelmed.This week Spains Canary islands were walloped by their worst storm in  years.Video showed giant waves - powerful enough to register as an earthquake - washing away third-floor balconies on holiday flats in Mesa del Mar, Tenere.Apartment blocks were evacuated, restaurants smashed and cars swept into the sea as islanders and tourists braced for a further seven inches of rain.Further north in the Med, a hotel was struck by lightning and caught fire in Marbella while Alicante and Valencia were deluged.And there were warnings of worse to come as Benidorm and the Balearic islands of Ibiza, Majorca and Menorca were also placed on high alert yesterday.Meanwhile video captured a towering water spout that lted shipping containers into the air yesterday in Salerno, Italy.It comes weeks after  people died in floods and tornadoes as Italy was battered by a series of storms.A wall of mud buried homes in Sicily - killing nine - while where cars were washed away, trees toppled and Venice was underwater.In October at least  died as torrential rain and floods ravaged eastern Majorca near where Love Island is filmed.The victims included two elderly Brits and their driver who were washed away in a taxi.And  were killed and thousands evacuated as torrents destroyed bridges and swept people from their homes in the Aude region of southwestern France."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000451007815.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"labour jeremy corbyn power theresa may brexit","story":"The Labour leaders right-hand man said the Queen would have a duty to make Mr Corbyn Prime MinisterTheresa Mays Brexit struggles continue.John McDonnell insisted Labour would be able to enter Government even without a mandate from the British public.He pointed to the DUP rebellion this week which has stopped the PM winning key Commons votes on the Budget.The Shadow Chancellor said: The test is whether or not Government is losing consistent votes on the issue of the deal itself.“If it is, it is demonstrating as a minority government it hasn’t got the will of House – a majority in the House.“The normal process is the opposition party should be offered the opportunity to seeit can form a Government.He added: If it’s minority Government and they can’t attain a majority in Parliament, usually it is the duty of the Monarch to make the offer to the opposition the opportunity to form a Government.Speaking at a Reuters event in London Mr McDonnell said Labour wants to see a General Election -

Midgets were frequently advertised as being much older than they actually were – whilst ‘Hairy Mary from Borneo’ was not a woman, but a monkey in reality.As science improved and led to many of the freaks physical dferences being explained as genetic mutation or disease, the sideshow fell into decline as the iniduals were treated with compassion and sympathy instead of fear and disgust."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT0004506323741-e1542752109382.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"mark carney backs theresa may withdrawal plans","story":"In a hearing with MPs on the Treasury Select Committee, Mr Carney said: “We have emphasised from the start the importance of having some transition between the current arrangements and the ultimate arrangements.“So we welcome the transition arrangements in the withdrawal agreement... and take note of the possibility of extending that transition period.”The transition period starts on March  and is due to end on December , .

Work is continuing.Mr Juncker has already cancelled a trip to Spain which was meant to last the rest of the week. But the PM is under huge pressure to deliver more concessions from Brussels - or risk her entire deal being torpedoed by MPs in the Commons.Mrs Merkel said today: Well hopefully have a European Council on Sunday to sign the exit treaty and discuss future relations.But she vowed that Britain wont be able to leave a customs union deal without Brussels say-so - further dashing hopes for Brexiteers that the deal can be altered.She told the German parliament: We have placed value on the fact Britain cant decide unilaterally when it ends the state of the customs union, but that Britain must decide this together with the EU.European capitals are unwilling to thrash out last-minute details at the Sunday meeting itself, and wont speak to Mrs May until its almost over.Instead Commission Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis set Friday morning, when EU leaders chief advisors meet in Brussels, as the deadline for a final text.He said: Well need to have agreed beforehand on the Political Declaration on the future relationship and were not there yet.The Commission stands ready to consider the text and take any action at any time.An EU diplomat told The Sun: Its nobodys intention to make [Sunday] a negotiation summit. No Merkel, no summit.If No  feels it needs a negotiating one and is willing to risk another Salzburg, they hold the keys. But the appetite for risk here is low.The PMs spokesman said: A summit has been called, an agenda has been published and we look forward to attending.But the spokesman refused to confirm that the meeting will definitely go ahead as planned.Earlier today Mrs May warned her MPs that her deal is the only way to avoid a isive second referendum on Brexit.The Prime Minister told the Commons it must opt for her deal or risk no Brexit at all.She told MPs at Prime Ministers Questions: If you look at the alternative to having that deal with the European Union, it will either be more uncertainty, more ision, or it could risk no Brexit at all.Mrs May said she would continue to negotiate on that future partnership during her meeting with Mr Juncker.She was asked repeatedly by Tory MPs to go back and renegotiate, with one Brexiteer urging her to cut away the tentacles of the EU for good.But she slapped down the colleagues who want to try and change her deal, said there were three clear ways to get out of a never-ending customs union - and called on MPs to back it when it comes to the Commons.This morning the Prime Minister was warned she must squeeze extra Brexit concessions or her deal will get torpedoed in the Commons. A Tory source said: The Chief Whips view is that fear of No Deal will not be enough to win this one.They went on: The numbers are terrible and he needs something sufficiently dferent from what people currently think they are voting for in order to get this through.But new DWP boss Amber Rudd suggested that Nos strategy of pressuring MPs to vote for the deal because of the fear of nothing at all wouldnt work.In remarkable comments this morning she insisted that there was no majority in Parliament for No Deal.She also said she believed thatMPs voted down the deal, Parliament would prevent us leaving with nothing at all in place.Ms Rudd, who took over from Esther McVey last week, told Radio  that MPs should take a fresh look at the deal once Mrs May comes back with it later.This is the cake, its been baked, the Prime Minister will bring it back... perhaps that will remind colleagues that there is still a negotiation going on, she said.The news came as:It is believed that the Brexiteer rebels are still a few letters short of the  needed, and yesterday Mr Rees-Mogg admitted it had all gone a bit Dads Army - and warned a coup against her could come next month instead.And Cabinet ministers could get behind a new technological solution to solve the Irish border issue - as first revealed by The Sun this week.Mrs May told her ministers yesterday the country could avoid having to use the controversial Irish border backstop after Brexit because of a new plan to avoid a hard border with alternative arrangements of technical solutions away from the border.The current document on our future partnership with the EU is just seven pages long, but Cabinet ministers were this week shown a -page draft which was to be discussed between Mrs May and Mr Juncker today.The more flesh we can put on the bones, the better.

There was an authoritative confidence about him as he picked at the Prime Minister’s Brexit scab in the House of Commons, exploiting the huge dficulties of a PM fighting on too many fronts. With Tory Remainers and Leavers both raising objections to her messy plan and the leader of Northern Ireland’s DUP, Nigel Dodds, nodding along to a Corbyn he’s supposed to hate, the danger’s real for meandering May. Because all of the objections raised by Corbyn - blank cheque costs, dficult trade deals and that Irish issue - all pack legitimacy.  May might even secretly agree with some of his points though, she’s never going to admit that publicly when she’s erasing previous red lines to try and sell as bad deal as better than no deal. She isn’t unintelligent so May will be only too aware that backing the best deal was two years ago voting to remain in the European Union. I suspect her Brextremist MPs won’t buy its her way or no way, May claiming the risk is Britain doesn’t leaveher concoction’s defeated in Parliament.

I go back to my constituency and Ive never seen human suffering like this in all the times Ive been an MP, in the  years Ive lived in my constituency. I cant forgive them for what they have done, the level of poverty. The number of children that can only eat each day because their family are going to food banks, the number of people who sanctioned no benefit whatsoever, the number of disabled people, and I have had them in my constituency surgery, whove attempted suicide as a result of the sanctions - I cant forgive them for. He added: Its not about tribalism, its about being honest with people about what this government has done and what the alternative is. For a large number of people who voted Conservative up the last election some of them are as angry as me. How do we have a UN reporter on poverty visit this country and accuse this government of causing destitution  And I think many of those people who voted Conservative at the last election will be angry at what they have voted for and for what hasnt happened. Asked about becoming Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr McDonnell showed no sign to move to one of the most famous streets in the world.The most important thing for me is the community and family that Im in, he said.Thats what I like going back to every night.

Andrew Rosindell, MP for Romford, Essex, said the draft Withdrawal Agreement does not represents what his constituents had voted for. And just moments later his peer Neil Parish, MP for Bridgwater, Somerset, desperately urged Mrs May to renegotiate the deal. Speaking during Prime Ministers Questions at the House of Commons, MP Rosindell said: I agree with the people of Romford who are deeply unhappy by the proposed EU deal. It does not represent the Brexit they voted for. He urged the Prime Minister to think again and instead lead our country in a new direction completely cutting the tentacles of the EU over our cherished island nation once and for all.  MP Parish said of the deal: It is not good enough as it stands. Please can I ask you Prime Minister to listen to these concerns and renegotiate the deal before we put it on the floor of this house. Mrs May spent five hours in an emergency Cabinet meeting last week to finally agree a draft Brexit deal with the EU. Despite facing heavy criticism for the deal, the determined Prime Minister vowed to continue to fight. Tory Esther McVey - who resigned from the Cabinet over the deal - demanded a guarantee the UK will leave the EU on  March come what may. And in a furious intervention, DUP Westminster leader Nigel Dodds accused the Prime Minister of “pushing the delete button” on guarantees for Northern Ireland to have the final say on erging from the single market. There were audible oohs! in the Commons at the personal attack.

Weve all been seduced by the photos of the burgers, fries and milkshakes on the glowing screens, only to be served a paltry equivalent. McDonalds recently released a new festive hot drink called the Millionaires Latte - and it sounded brilliant. Its supposed to be a large shot of espresso blended with steamed milk and a caramel biscuit flavour syrup. Its then topped with a swirl of chocolate cream and a caramel drizzle - yum. But some customers have been very underwhelmed by what theyve been served by the global chain, and theyve taken to social media to share their photos.  Some have been saying the drink doesnt look ANYTHING like the pictures, even accusing the fast food giant of  advertising as their drinks were missing ingredients. One wrote on Twitter: @McDonalds - is this really what a millionaires latte looks like  I took the lid off and there’s nothing special on top. #advertising me thinks  Another said: was looking forward to my st millionaires latte expecting the cream and toffee on top and was totally disappointed with it! Others branded it vile, an anti-climax and terrible. One man shared a very sad-looking picture of half a cup of coffee with no toppings, claiming thats what his order looked like.  He wrote: millionaire latte taking the p***. No cream and half a cup!!! Another disappointed customer said: went to mcdonalds in dundee tonight for what i thought was gonna be a millionaires latte and got this disaster i know mcdonalds never look like the pics you advertise but this is a joke surely. Dozens more customers have shared their expectation versus reality photos, comparing the companys slick marketing shots with their chocolatey coffees. One person even slammed the taste of the drink as cheesy, claiming they threw it straight in the bin. Not everyone was disappointed, as several people said it was actually well nice and the best thing. A spokesperson for McDonalds said: As with any cream on top of a hot drink,left for a period of time, our swirl of chocolate cream and a caramel drizzle will blend into the latte.Most of our customers are loving it too much to leave it that long, butit does melt then youll still get all of the great flavours, just combined with your drink instead of on top.

Visitors slammed the Basingstoke switch-on, claiming it was chaotic with nothing Christmassy about it - as organisers allegedly failed to provide a tree or Santa Claus. The annual event in Festival Place was meant to involve a parade of hundreds of school children, who had practiced a dance routine and song to perform to the crowds. But they were left disappointed at not being able to do their rehearsed routine, and parents have slammed the organisers for failing to instruct the children where to go and what to do, or guide them safely through the crowds. Parents described children left in tears at not being able to perform, and being pushed and shoved by the crowds.   One parent said her daughter who was asked to take part in the parade was actually abandoned in a side-room for an hour, leaving her panicked and crying. There was further disappointment when , wrist bands given out to the crowds, ten of which were meant to change colour to win pound vouchers, maled. The error resulted in Festival Place refusing to award any prizes, leaving numerous people, including children, disappointed when they believed they had won a prize. Those who attended took to social media to complain about the event. James Waine described the switch on as a shambles, adding: Would love to see their risk assessment for health and safety. Needs to be an investigation and report of the melee I have just witnessed.   Claire Boswell added: The organisers of this event let so many people down. Children were scared, crying and disappointed. I feel guilty now that my children had such an awful evening when it is the organisers who should be feeling this guilty. Carly Woodhams described it as the worst Christmas switch on ever adding: I dont think Ive ever seen so many children crying whilst watching lights being switched on. Kirsty Mason labelled the event as appalling, after her nine-year-old son was almost knocked over in the crowds, adding: Trying to get out was a nightmare, people were packed in so tightly you literally couldnt move. Mum Laura ONeill said her daughter was left panicked and crying having been asked to take part in the parade with her school friends, only to be abandoned for nearly an hour in a disused side room with no information about what was going on.   She added: It was confusing, scary and awful for them. Sara Gook said her six-year-old daughter believed she had won the wrist band competition, adding: She was all excited thinking she had won then after waiting ages just had her band taken off her and told no one had won due to a technical issue. Lauren Heidi Bridgeman had the same problem, thinking her daughter had won, and said: My eight-year-old was in floods of tears and was devastated. The event was also criticised for not being Christmassy enough, with an owl being lit up in the shopping centre rather than a Christmas tree, and the lights turned on by Snow White. Dani Natasha Dacey commented: Nothing Christmassy about it. Where the hell was Santa or a Christmas tree  Such a disappointment.   Kimberley Green accused the organisers of ruining the start of Christmas adding: No fireworks, no Santa, no organisation, no remorse, no safety. Absolute shambles of a light switch on. To make matters worse, shoppers said the roads around the centre were gridlocked following the event, as everyone tried to head home. A statement from Festival Place said: “This year’s Festival Place Christmas was planned to have a new focus with a parade event followed by six weeks of fun from the lights switch-on through to  December. “The Winter Woodland launch was incredibly well supported by the local community, but that did make the centre very busy and some planned elements of the parade couldn’t happen – safety is always a priority.   “We were most disappointed that the children of Hatch Warren Infant School didn’t get to perform the routine they had worked hard on, and are in touch with the headteacher to see how we can best make it up to them. “Unfortunately there was a technical fault with the wristbands which we couldn’t have foreseen and this meant we regrettably couldn’t launch the competition as planned. Following this we have donated all of the prize money to a local charity, St Michael’s Hospice, our nominated charity. “Festival Place is now decked out for the season, there’s a superb grotto for the little ones and lots more fun to come – we’re really looking forward to welcoming visitors to celebrate all that we have to offer this Christmas.” "},{"url":null,"title":"cruel note mums car said","story":"NewsCruel note on mums car said seriously ill daughter does not look disabledRachael Hanley, , of Rotherham in South Yorkshire was on a shopping trip with two-year-old Evie-Mae when she was confronted by the abusive womanShareCommentsByNathan Sandhu:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV NewsRachael Hanley, , with two-year-old daughter Evie-Mae \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA mother, whose young daughter has a serious breathing condition, discovered a cruel note left on her car after a family shopping trip. Rachael Hanley, , was devastated when she ed to the car park to find a handwritten letter from an angry female motorist saying her two-year-old does not look disabled. The note was attached to her windscreen despite an encounter two hours earlier with the shopper where she explained that her daughter was disabled when confronted. Rachael was accused of misusing a Blue Badge in Sheffield, South Yorkshire - and told she should bring a wheelchair for her daughter, Evie-Mae next time.To make matters worse, the tot unexpectedly began fitting and vomiting when they ed to the car and was left needing basic le support following a full body shaking seizure.Youngster Evie-Mae Pinkney, who was born on Valentines Day, has apnea of infancy - an unexplained episode of cessation of breathing for  seconds or longer. The disease means she has pauses in her breathing when she sleeps and the tot can need rapid access to oxygen.She also suffers from seizures - which trigger tiredness - that can be brought on spontaneously and without warning.Rachael had parked at Meadowhall, Sheffield with her two children during a shopping trip to buy Evie-Mae some new shoes and a hot chocolate when she was confronted by the abusive woman.The stay-at-home carer provided an explanation, before locking her car and leaving to go shopping, but ed to find the note tucked under the windscreen wiper.The note read : I have reported you for miss using a blue badge. Your daughter did not look or appear disabled. Hope your car is clamped. Next time bring a wheelchair.Rachael, from Rotherham, said: She said you cannot park there unless you are disabled, she got quite irate and aggressive. I locked the car and went into Meadowhall, we were gone for around two hours.Evie-Mae is quite forward and is aware of peoples feelings. She asked why was I crying, and why is that woman shouting at you .How do you explain to a two-year-old what is going on  When we got back to the car Evie-Mae had a full body shaking seizure, the only advice we have is to put her in the recovery position to make sure her airways are not blocked.After the seizure, I put her into her car seat and thats when I realised what was on the windscreen.The mother, who also has a -month-old son called Kye Pinkney, initially took to Facebook to vent her anger.Evie-Mae, who turns three in February, was diagnosed with apnea of infancy aged around six months but can often present as a child who is well. The tot has been given CPR, including chest compressions and mouth-to-mouth on six separate occasions.Evie-Mae on average suffers one seizure a week but her mum says they used to be daily.She has had a blue badge for over two years.The reason we have the blue badge is because we have to carry portable oxygen at all times and the equipment can be quite bulky, added Rachael. Especially when its a child that looks so healthy. She looks well until she suddenly starts having CPR.She can be having a great day and can end up in AE an hour later. She can become critical really quickly.Some disabilities arent always visible. Some people are old-fashioned and would expect Evie-Mae to be a wheelchairshe has a blue badge.Thats what upsets me the most, everything we have been through as a family having to save her le at times.When Evie-Mae was really young doctors said she wasnt going to make it and advised us to make plans for a funeral. So, to go through that as a family to then having a person saying dont park there is very upsetting. I could not believe someone could be so judgmental even after an explanation.Infant apnea is defined as an unexplained episode of cessation of breathing for  seconds or longer, or a shorter respiratory pause associated with bradycardia, cyanosis, pallor, and or marked hypotonia.Government guidelines state parents of children under three years old can apply for the badgethe child needs to be kept near a vehicle at all times with bulky medical equipment needed."},{"url":null,"title":"gay couple claim were kicked","story":"NewsGay couple claim they were kicked out of Wetherspoons for kissingThe men claim they were told to leave by a doorman at The Rodboro Buildings pub in Guildford, Surrey - but a Wetherspoons spokesman denied their claimShareCommentsBySimon Worthington:,  NOV NewsThe gay couple claim they were told to leave after kissing at the pub \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA gay couple claim they were left mortied after being kicked out of a Wetherspoons pub for kissing.

They claim they were ordered to leave by a doorman as they were making their way out on Saturday night. A spokesman for the pub chain denied it was the kiss that got them thrown out - claiming they were asked to leave because of subsequent behaviour. One of the men, aged , said: Wed been out for a friends birthday, it was the end of the night and we were ready to leave.  Our two friends were waiting outside for us. We were on our way down the stairs when we stopped and had a kiss. There was nobody around. My partner would never have kissed methere was, he doesnt like public displays of affection. Speaking to the Morning Advertiser pub trade website, the man added: Then suddenly there was a shout from the bottom of the stairs from one of the door staff saying Oi you two, out. When asked why they were told to leave, the staff member allegedly said because of that on the stairs. The man then said he asked: Youre kicking us out because I kissed my boyfriend   He just replied Out so I asked him again but he refused to reply. Writing on Twitter, one of the mens friends said: Some friends of minegot thrown out of @Wetherspoon_UK Guildford merely for kissing each other. Seems they like to serve hate and homophobia with the friendly beer. Eddie Gershon, a spokesman for JD Wetherspoon, said: The men kissed at the top of the stairs, which is not an issue. However, they were asked to leave the pub because of their behaviour after that. I would stress thata man wants to kiss a man or a woman kiss a woman - or any other combination - it is absolutely fine to do so in a Wetherspoon pub. But this couple were not asked to leave for kissing each other.

The unit aims to understand factors that contribute to healthy development, as well as those linked to behavioural and emotional problems in children. Research into developmental risk and resilience can help professionals and policy makers realise ways that can improve the lives of children and families.

One of Kate’s key areas of interest is the importance of providing solid social and emotional foundations for children to support their development and emotional resilience as infants, setting them on the best possible pathway for a happy and healthy adulthood.  Earlier this year, Kate set up a steering group made up of practitioners and academics from a range of disciplines, including neuroscience, mental health, nursing, perinatal care and education.

The Duchess of Sussex made two speeches during her and Prince Harrys royal tour of Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga.  In ABC News special Meghan’s New Le: The Real Princess Diaries, which airs tomorrow, royal experts discuss how Meghan penned her own speeches for her first tour. The networks royal editor, Omid Scobie, noticed she was carrying notes with handwritten scribbles all over them. Omid said: I asked a palace aide, has she written this herself , as thats quite unusual for the royals, theres usually other people. This was all her, shes been up for days working on this speech. Penning speeches herself isnt Meghans only unusual move - her content is also a step away from the norm with a focus on womens empowerment and feminism.

Its certainly something the Queen doesnt do, nor does Kate Middleton do. Meghan is the feminist princess of our dreams. During the tour, Meghan, , gave a speech at the University of South Pacic in Suva. She told the students about she worked on campus at Northwestern University and said every penny went directly towards my tuition. Meghan also detailed the importance of education in empowering women.  She said: Everyone should be afforded the opportunity to receive the education they want, but more importantly the education they have the right to receive. And for women and girls in developing countries, this is vital. Providing them with access to education is the key to economic and social development. Because when girls are given the right tools to succeed, they can create incredible futures, not only for themselves but also for those around them.

Now, the -year-old mum has opened up about how she manages the day-to-day chores when it comes to caring for such a large family. The family go through a staggering nine washing loads every day, and  bottles of washing up liquid a month. They also use four toilet rolls every day, reports The Sun.  Feeding the family on around pound a week, Sue revealed how they usually eat large pasta or stew dishes - using meat from their local butcher and beg from the greengrocer.Sue said: For us the kitchen is the heart of our home and the kids just love to be involved with the cooking side of it. If we had to cook three or four dferent meals, it would be absolute chaos. Speaking about the endless washing the parents are faced with, Sue said putting it away was the worst part of her laundry routine. She said: Definitely when you have a lot of children you have a lot of washing and putting it all way - I do not like putting it all away. While the parents might struggle to get a minute to themselves sometimes, Sue said always having children around is actually the best part of having such a large family.

Harri Cooke, from Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, was a happy and healthy tot before his mum, Carly, , noticed he had a weeping eye last September. After initially believing her son had a common cold that had caused conjunctivitis, it wasnt until Harris face began to swell that further tests were conducted and a deadly cancerous mass was discovered behind his nose. In January this year, Harri was diagnosed with Ewings Sarcoma - a rare type of bone cancer - and has since needed gruelling rounds of chemotherapy in a bid to shrink the tumour in his face as well as pioneering US treatment.   Harri is now in remission after nine months of treatment and his mum, Carly, is sharing their story to raise awareness. Carly, a self-employed massage therapist, said: Harri often had colds so at first I didnt think much of his weeping eye. The doctors agreed that it was likely to be a cold but as the weeks passed he was believed to have a blocked tear duct. It didnt seem to bother him, he was so happy all of the time. But when his face began to swell we were referred from our GP to an eye specialist. Once we arrived six doctors turned up, and they all seemed really worried. The NHS did everything they could but we just didnt realise how serious it was. Harris bone structure around his eye had changed, indicating the malicious mass that lay behind.   His type was so rare - we were in complete shock. You never think its going to be your child. It was six days later after Harris diagnosis that he started chemotherapy on February  this year. Carly, and husband James Cooke, , who works as mechanic, found themselves having to focus entirely on Harris treatment. His cancer would require treatment available only in America, as well as other NHS treatments. In order to give Harri the best possible odds, his cancer requires treatment with proton beam therapy - a type of radiotherapy that uses protons as opposed to x-rays. Carly added: I have another younger son called Josh, who is now  months, but we had to focus on Harri.  Family friends managed to raise us pound, for him to receive in order for him to receive proton beam therapy. The NHS fund the treatment and main expenses, but we couldnt have afforded for James to take  weeks off work. And despite everything he was still smiling, it was so hard watching him go through it, it was like torture. Harri endured  treatments in Florida, US - which continued every day under general anaesthetic for six weeks - combined with  rounds of chemotherapy. Thankfully it was all worthwhile and the youngster is now in remission but his parents now worry how his treatment will affect him in the long run. Carly said: I believe that only one percent of fundraising from big cancer charities goes specically to childrens cancer. The medication is so much harsher to children.   Harris treatments means that he could have growth issues, teeth problems and is more likely to have cancer later in le. Hes had to have over  blood transfusions to try and save his le. Carly is urging other parents to recognise the signs, however small, of this deadly illness, and help raise awareness of how a child can be affected. Carly said, Its so rare and unexpected that its hard to know what to look for. Blood supplies are currently depleted, and donors are needed for both blood and platelet transfusions. Charities like CLIC Sargent, a charity for children with cancer, are brilliant for helping families and informing them.

Bopper - nicknamed Bopper the Whopper - was taken in by the RSPCA when his owners became too unwell to look after him. Now the poor pooch finds breathing and standing dficult because of his huge size. He tips the scales at .kg when he should weigh around kg. Gables Farm Dogs and Cats Home, in Plymouth, took Bopper in from the RSPCA but say he is too large to fit in any of their kennels. So he is currently living with deputy manager Ruth Rickard. He isnt the only overweight dog the rescue home has looked after.   Earlier this year they managed to slim down a dog called Hattie, a collie cross, who weighed kg. Ruth says: Just when I thought Hattie the Fattie was the fattest dog we had seen here at Gables in comes Bopper who makes her look tiny! He weighs much more than Hattie did and is a lot older so he will need our help to achieve what Hattie has so he can start to feel better and more mobile. Boppers extreme weight means he is at a very high risk of developing diabetes and will have to have his blood taken regularly to monitor his sugar levels.   He has now been put on a special diet complete with gentle exercise to reduce his size - with the total cost of his treatment and weight loss plan totting up to around pound. The animal home is trying to raise money to help pay for Boppers care.It comes as half of British dogs are now classied as overweight or obese, according to research by dog well-being app PoochPlay. It found that out of , dogs analysed .% were recorded as overweight. The research also found that a portion of canines in the UK lacked an active lestyle.  Nearly half of app users stated that their dog was an indoor pet, while % were recorded as either lazy or sedentary. This is in comparison to % of dogs who were recorded as active. Obesity in dogs can lead to serious health issues, including diabetes, joint and bone disorder and cardiovascular problems – shortening their lespan by up to two years. Research has shown that % of owners do not know the level of exercise their pet requires, fuelling the pet obesity crisis in Britain and beyond. Dferent breeds of dogs naturally require dferent amount of activity, with dogs such as Labradors needing the same amount as a human, whereas smaller dogs, such as chihuahuas, only need  minutes a day.  The research aimed to explore areas of dog health and safety, including the weight of the pet and the level of exercise they regularly receive. Ravi Sharma, CEO and founder of PoochPlay, said: “We want to tackle dog obesity one dog at a time, and hope to educate society on the correct amount of food and exercise their furry friends should be having.

Butyou thought your family indulged in some strange traditions over the festive season, spare a thought for the royal family. It will be Meghan Markles second Christmas as a royal so theyll be no surprises this year. From handing out coal to poor people, to eating penny-sized sandwiches and handing out silly gag gts, here’s what the Royal family will be up to this Christmas... Presents from the Queen If you thought you organised Christmas well this year, you’ve got nothing on Her Maj, who asks her more than  members of staff what they want present they want her to buy them as early as March. The Queen gives a gt to everyone in the Royal household, as long as they have worked for her for more than a year. But they must choose what they get, to a value of   pound for the most junior staff, increasing year by year to a maximum of pound. Then, a week before Christmas, staff gather in the State Apartments, and one by one come forward to receive their gt from the Queen. They thank her, saying it’s exactly what the wanted without even opening it - of course, because they chose it themselves. The Queen buys her presents from just one shop, Harrods, and has been known to shut the entire department store for hours so she can wander round. These days, however, she does most of her shopping on the internet. By tradition, the Queen also gives one hundredweight of coal to “deserving and needy” people in Windsor before Christmas, although because of central heating the numbers have dipped from around  in the early days of her reign to less than  today.  Christmas cards in the Summer   The Queen writes her Christmas cards earlier than the rest of us too - normally during her stay in Balmoral during the summer. She and Prince Phillip send  Christmas cards to heads of state, leading politicians, Commonwealth leaders, friends and family. Phillip also sends another  of his own to the military, naval and civilian organisations with which he is associated. And recipients can tell how dear they are to her by the way she signs them. Close family members have theirs signed Lillibet - the Queen’s childhood nickname. Long-time friends such as Countess Mountbatten get theirs signed Elizabeth, without the R, while others like the Prime Minister, Lord Chancellor and the Speak of the House of Commons get a formal Elizabeth R. Those right down the bottom of her Christmas list don’t get a personally-signed card at all, just one rubber-stamped with the Queen’s signature.  Arriving at Sandringham  A week or so before Christmas, those family members who have been invited to spend the holiday with the Queen and Prince Philip are told by the Crown Equerry in what order they are to arrive at Sandringham House and at exactly what time. Royal protocol being what it is, it’s all worked out according to precedence and seniority, with the most junior and least important arriving first. Prince Charles, the Duchess of Cornwall, Prince William and Prince Harry are always the last to turn up. They then form a “welcoming” committee for the Queen and Prince Philip. Despite having her own Royal Train, the Queen usually makes the journey to Sandringham via public transport, and startling oblivious passengers on the Thamelink train to King’s Lynn has become a Christmas tradition in itself.  Princes’ football matchIn recent years, it has become tradition for Princes William and Harry to play a Christmas Eve football match alongside workers from the Sandringham Estate, with the Princes always on opposing sides. The brothers usually wear the socks of their favorite teams - Aston Villa for William and Arsenal for Harry, and they take it pretty seriously, with William even sustaining an ankle injury one year, and William once demanding that the ref give his brother a yellow card.  The Princes broke with tradition only once in  when they played on the same side, for the local Black Horse Inn pub, winning -.  Unwrapping gag gts The Royal family sit down at exactly pm on Christmas Eve open their presents in the red drawing room at Sandringham. During the afternoon family members creep down to secretly place their gts in the room, where trestle tables are laid out and sections marked off with table to show where each family member’s presents should be. The rule is that no-one should open their present until given permission by Philip, who supervises the proceedings, and that every present should be a cheap “joke gt”, and the cheaper the better.   Among memorable Christmas presents down the years are a ‘Ain’t le a bitch’ bath hat given to the Queen by Harry, a grow-your-own-girlfriend kit given to Harry by Kate, and a white leather toilet seat given by Princess Anne to Prince Charles, although he actually liked it so much he now takes it with him on overseas tours. Princess Diana once fell foul of the family cheap and cheerful motto when on her first Christmas at Sandringham as a newly-wed in  she gave a cashmere sweater to Princess Anne who, in , handed over a loo-roll holder. The next year she cracked it giving Fergie a leopard-print bath mat.  Jam-penny sandwichesWhile the Royal Family enjoy much of the same traditional food as the rest of us, some customs are still exclusively royal. Like “jam penny”, sandwiches cut into circles the size of an old English penny, which are served when the family gathers for afternoon tea in the white drawing room on Christmas Eve. They also enjoy scones cut into the size and shape of a -pence piece. Later on, the family meet up again for a black tie dinner and drinks, where each royal has their own traditional tipple. The Queen favours a cocktail call the Zaza, made from Dubonnet and gin, Prince Charles prefers cherry brandy, while William and Harry both enjoy a pint of Sandringham cider, made from apple trees planted by the Queen’s father King George VI. During the dinner the Queen is known to read out corny jokes from the Christmas crackers. Later the family play charades until midnight, with nobody permitted to go to bed until Her Majesty retires.  Two church servicesOn Christmas Day the family go to church twice. First, the family attends a private service at am, when the Queen receives Holy Communion from her chaplain. Then she leads the Royal family to St Mary Magdalene Church for the traditional Christmas Day service at am. All the family walk to church except the Queen, who is driven. When the collection plate is passed round, Her Majesty’s equerry, who sits in the pew immediately behind her, hands her a pound note - the only time in the year the Queen uses money.  Whiskey with the chef  Just like most of the rest of the country, the Royal family will stuff themselves full with a traditional Christmas dinner. Theirs starts at .pm with a starter of salad with shrimp or lobster, followed by roasted turkey with traditional sides like parsnips, Brussels sprouts and carrots, then Christmas pudding with brandy butter for dessert. Menus are all in French and the family eat from blue and white Copeland dinner service and drink from crystal stemware engraved with EIIR. As is tradition, just before the family tuck in, the senior chef goes into the dining room and carves the rib roast of turkey, after which the Queen presents him with a glass of whiskey and they toast - the only time in the year that the chef joins the royals in the dining room.  After lunch the family will watch the Queen’s annual address to the nation, before adjourning to the Saloon, where the Queen’s favourite jigsaw puzzles are laid out. There are actually five Christmas dinners served at dferent times at Sandringham - one for junior staff at am, then for the senior footmen an hour later. After the Royal family’s dinner at .pm, the junior kitchen staff have theirs at .pm, and the royal chef is last to have his lunch at pm. Christmas goes on until February The Queen and Prince Philip stay at Sandringham until early February, in memory of Her Majestys late dad George VI, who died at the estate on February , . Not in the least superstitious, the Queen insists on the Christmas decorations remaining up until she leaves.

The holiday celebrates the fruits of the harvest, and has been celebrated in America since the s - before the USA even existed as a country. Today it is a national holiday in the US, celebrated every year on the fourth Thursday in November. Workers are given the day off - and often the following day too so they can enjoy a four-day weekend. But while Brits may have seen the celebrations on TV or films, they might not know all the traditions that go along with this big day. So heres the big Thanksgiving traditions to be aware of...  The food A hearty meal is one of the most important Thanksgiving traditions for most Americans. The central element of a traditional meal is usually a huge roast turkey. Alongside this are sides like mashed potato, stuffing, cranberry sauce and vegetables. Americans also often talk about eating yams. Yams are a starchy root vegetable grown in the Carribean. But Americans usually mean sweet potatoes instead. The meal is often rounded off with a pumpkin pie.  Pardoning the turkey As a day of the year where people eat a lot of meat, it cant be a good time to be a turkey. So each year the US President officially pardons a turkey, and it is sent to live on a farm rather than heading for the dinner table. The odd tradition dates back to , when President Lincolns son Tad asked him to spare the le of the turkey bought home for dinner. The tradition became more formalised under the George H W Bush White House. This year Donald Trump pardoned two turkeys, named Peas and Carrot.  The parades Many cities in the US host massive parades as part of the Thanksgiving Day celebrations. The biggest and most famous is the Macys parade in New York, which attracts thousands of spectators to the streets of Manhattan. The three-hour spectacle features floats, costumes and giant helium balloons of famous cartoon characters.  The sports American Football games are a huge part of the long Thanksgiving weekend, and NFL and college teams have played on Thanksgiving practically since the games invention. It is one of the biggest days in the football calendar, and this year is no exception. The three NFL games on Thanksgiving day this year are all big league rivalries: Chicago Bears vs Detroit Lions - :pm GMTWashington Redskins vs Dallas Cowboys - :pm GMTAtlanta Falcons vs New Orleans Saints - :am GMT Black Friday The day after Thanksgiving every year is one of the busiest shopping days of the year. People take advantage of their day off and massive sales at stores to make a start on their Christmas shopping. Black Friday has become notorious for scenes of violence as mobs of customers fight over discount TVs.  The shopping tradition has now spread around the world, as stores in other countries try to cash in on the huge numbers of shoppers desperate for a bargain. In the UK, theres all sorts of deals to be found in the annual sales.

Josephine Repique, , said the pregnant goat went into labour earlier this month on November  at the small farm in Sultan Kudarat, the Philippines. The two babies had to be removed by cesarean section but onlookers quickly realised something wasn’t right.  There were shrieks of horror when one of the strange-looking animals emerged from the goat. Josephine said the baby looked like a pig, with a mix of human. The small fur-less animal even had a naval - just like a tiny human. She said: We were shocked. We cant explain how it looks like that. “All our neighbours flocked into our house to get a good look.

He had been cycling to work in Strand, close to Cape Town, when he was attacked by two men - one of who stabbed him in the head. The kne with a six-inch blade was stuck hard into his head as the pair tried to grab his bike but incredibly Shaun fought back and managed to beat them both off. Amazingly he then got back on his bike and cycled half a mile with the kne sticking out of the side of his skull to the surgery of his local GP Dr Brendan Venter, . Dr Venter – a former Springbok rugby player and a rugby coach – said: “One of our female doctors was on duty and she was called to a patient with a kne wound.  “To say it was dramatic to see him with a kne sticking out of the side of his head was an understatement but he was very calm and lucid although bleeding a lot. He asked very politelywe had a doctor free to see him. “The doctor decided that rather than wait for an ambulance she would drive him to hospital in her car herself and he askedit was ok to leave his bike with us. “The patient was very lucky in that although the kne was plunged into his skull it bent on impact with the bone and the blade went down his face outside the skull. “He was very very lucky that the blade hit him in the wrong spot to kill him.  “He fought for his bike back and rode to us as he knew where we were and we are his GP and when he got here he just walked in and calmly asked for help. “This is not something that happens every day and it seems it is a violent gang who have struck viciously a few times in the last few weeks and they will be caught. “It was not even an expensive bike and is one he cycles on to and from work each day. Why they used the level of violence they did is just beyond me” he said. Shaun is the popular manager of Soo She restaurant which is a local sushi and Asian eating place on the Strand and he cycles to and from work every day. He was rushed into the Tygerberg Hospital nearby on Monday afternoon and underwent emergency surgery and a spokesman confirmed he was “stable”. Doctors told his mother he was expected to make a full recovery. Friend Carl Block said on Facebook: “I was with him in the doctors. He rode himself there was was so calm and polite to the doctors saying: “Can a doctor please help ” “This guy is an amazing person and I have known him for five years and was in tears last night and couldn’t sleep. I am asking you to all please pray for Shaun”. The photographs have gone viral on social media with one showing Shaun stood bleeding in the doctors surgery and a second of an x-ray of the kne in his head.

It was seen from the port city of Salerno and many locals recorded the action, and took photos of the phenomenon. The water tornado appeared on Tuesday afternoon skirting ports and reportedly damaging containers as it finally crossed the shoreline. Waterspouts are similar to tornadoes, but form when cool unstable air passes over warmer waters, producing vigorous updraughts that can turn into a spinning column of water. They generally collapse once they move across solid ground.  The Salerno Today said that the spout damaged some containers near the waterfront, but no injuries had been reported. Back in  a boat full of people was swept up in a powerful waterspout.

managers operating in the Championship right now who know better than Robbie Neilson just how powerful fans can be.As a player, he played more than two thirds of his  plus games for Hearts, whose supporters, arguably, create the best atmosphere of any club outside of the Old Firm when their team is playing in front of them at Tynecastle.And Robbie, of course, experienced more of what the Jambos fans have to offer when he successfully managed them for two-and-a-half years.Those spells in Edinburgh, in particular, taught him the backing of a passionate support can be worth points to a team.And he believes that can prove the case now he’s in charge at Dundee United.Since taking over from Csaba Laszlo at Tannadice last month, Robbie has mentioned the quality of the backing Arabs have given his rejuvenated team on several occasions.And he firmly believes they’ve more than played their part in an impressive unbeaten run of four wins and a draw that has seen the Tangerines re-emerge as serious promotion contenders from the second tier.On Tuesday night, however, it could be a case of ided loyalties for some Arabs, simply because United will be facing Alloa in a re-arranged league outing at the same time as Scotland face what could be a vital Nations League clash with Israel at Hampden.Having been blown away by the backing so far, the manager suspects it will be a case of club before country for most.“I’m definitely looking for a big turnout,” he said.“If there are any more pull-outs, my problem could be a few players might get called up for the Scotland squad!”Jokes aside, he does believe most Arabs will be in their usual seats at Tannadice and providing the kind of backing that’s become the envy of the rest of the second tier.“You have that Scotland game but the fans have been brilliant since I came in,” he said.“We took nearly , fans up to Ross County last weekend and we took , to Dunfermline the other week as well.“We’ve had great backing at home as well and, hopefully, they will turn up in numbers.“I understand midweek football means it’s always dficult for fans to make the journey.“We hope we can prove to them thatthey come along we’ll try to entertain and try to get a result.”As good as the backing so far has been, the manager does stress it remains down to his team to always make sure the supporters in the stands are given something to shout about.“The fans can make a massive dference but the initial stage will come from the players because the players, in the first  minutes of the game, have to set the tone,” he said.“They have to set the intensity and they have to get the fans off their seats.“If we can do that it reciprocates from the fans and we start putting pressure on teams and that’s what we need.”And that experience of playing with Hearts tells himthe support is on top form, at times it can mean points are picked up before a ball is even kicked.“I’ve played in venues where teams have come and you knew, because of the atmosphere and intensity, the game was done in the warm-up,” he said.“You knew you were going to win the game because the opposition couldn’t handle the atmosphere.“We need the supporters to try to give us that and we know they can.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/11/Howff-Cemetery-in-Meadowside-this-afternoon.jpg ","title":"its 1 30pm and dundee

I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute. It is our country’s most pressing public health issue – one we must address now, collectively.Scotland has made a lot of progress over the past  years, including a guarantee of a year’s post-diagnostic support, better education and training for staff in health and social care and better standards of care for people with dementia in hospitals.There is still, however, an unacceptable gap between national policy and dementia care and support in our communities. Alzheimer Scotland wants to make sure that people with dementia and their carers can work with local decision makers, helping to influence important decisions about how vital care and support is delivered in their area.We need your help to ensure people with dementia and carers get the best possible standard of care and support, anywhere in Scotland.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Star lost possession in midfield and Connor Crawford’s clearance was closed down by the Kings Park forward whose shot beat Kalache from the edge of the box and the hosts took a - lead on the hour mark.This visibly knocked the confidence of the Star team and Kings added a second goal when poor play again from Star trying to break gted possession to the hosts and once again their striker was on hand to make it - and give Star a mountain to climb in the last twenty minutes.Star didn’t give up however and could have been back in the game when the ball fell to Gregor Peacock in the box, the ing striker hit the shot and the ball was saved by the Kings Park goalkeeper.Kyle Selfridge went close to claiming a late leline but his free kick from twenty yards cannoned off the bar and the game finished - to the home side.The Star management team were disappointed as that’s the first time the Lochgilphead side have failed to score in the league in more than two years.On Saturday November  Red Star play host to Campbeltown pupils in what looks like another tough league match.

This never happened.The work on the rescue of the historic Asknish House also looks like attracting a lot of interest.#We are really pleased that once again villagers have responded with photographs to liven up the telling of the story of Lochgair,# said Marion Lacey of the Lochgair Association and one of the exhibition organisers.#We are grateful to folk like Katinka Dalglish, Curator for Archaeology at Kelvingrove, and to local writer Marian Pallister, whose book Argyll Curiosities features some unanswered questions related to Loch Glashan and who is keen to support oral history projects like ours.#The organisers hope that folk from neighbouring areas will come to the exhibition and share some of their own memories and finds.The Long Memories exhibition will take place in Lochgair Village Hall from pm to pm over four days from Saturday November  to Tuesday November ."},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13471434.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_080918AyrCurrie_09JPG.jpg","title":"ayr rugby club near move","story":"NewsAyr Rugby Club near move to new town centre base at Dam Park as they prepare to sell Millbrae homeThe Millbrae men, who top the Tennents Premiership, are in advanced talks to sell their Millbrae home and move to Dam Park in Ayr town centre.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  OCT NewsDam Park could play host to Ayr Rugby Club as soon as  \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBooming Ayr Rugby Club are nearing a deal to sell their Millbrae home and move to the town centre. Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13594714.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_ayr-u.jpg","title":"ayr united appear itv show","story":"NewsAyr United appear on ITV show The Chase as Bradley Walsh asks questionsThe Honest Men appeared as an answer on hit ITV show The Chase yesterday .Share.\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"facebook|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"messenger|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"twitter|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"whatsapp|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"linkedin|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"flipboard|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"email|share|\"ByLochlin Highet:,  NOV NewsThe Chasers \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyr United have been flying high at the top of the Championship - and now theyve made prime time national TV.

Five primary schools in the area were ordered to raise standards by Education Scotland inspectors. They include Catrine, Logan and Drongan and Kilmarnock schools Hillhead and Mount Carmel. Four of the schools: Drongan, Logan, Catrine and Mount Carmel have seen head teacher changes since the inspections took place. Hillhead got a new school boss shortly before the Education Scotland visit. The recently recruited heads appeared before a council meeting to report on progress this week. Commenting on the shake-up of leadership in the schools, Councillor George Mair said it “seems to be head teachers disappear”. And he asked: “Is there an island they are all on ” Speaking at the council’s Governance and Scrutiny Committee last week he said the new head teachers appeared to be doing a good job. But he added: “What has been going on before  What is the problem with head teachers ”  Committee chairman Councillor Barry Douglas said: “We are not here to discuss inidual head teachers.” The council’s chief governance officer David Mitchell said there is a link between the strength and quality of leadership in schools and reports received. The meeting heard about the status at each school with the new heads giving updates to councillors. Catrine Primary and Early Childhood Centre was ordered to carry out a list of ‘requirements,’ ‘improvements’ and ‘recommendations’ in . A new head teacher, Judith Govans who was previously depute in Hurlford, was recruited to the post in June, . Ms Govans told the Committee: “To get Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Educationin was very exciting. I have had a lot of support from the local authority and my colleagues, which is appreciated.” A report presented to the meeting said: “An experienced head teacher within the local authority was re-deployed within the school.  Progress at the school is now rated satisfactory and good at the nursery. Another update on the primary from the council is due at a later date. Sean Maddocks has just become acting head of Drongan Primary and nursery. Both the school and nursery received two weak and satisfactory scores in May from Education Scotland. Mr Maddocks said: “Following the inspection in May we have a clear action plan.” A further inspection of Drongan will take place at a later date Logan Primary and Early Childhood Centre has made good progress since it was given a list of improvements from Education Scotland in . Head teacher Denise MacColl was appointed in  after the inspection. The meeting heard how she managed to turn around the school’s fortune quickly and there will be no more visits from inspectors. Councillor Sally Cogley, of the Rubbish Party told her: “Well done.” "},{"url":null,"title":"borders-binmen-miss-more-than-2000-collections-each-year","story":"SCOTTISH Borders Council chiefs have been forced to admit they miss more than , bin collections each year.Figures released through a freedom of information request show that over the last five years, council bin crews have failed to empty more than , bins from around , households.Furthermore, the number of bins missed each year has been rising since , when , bins collections were missed.Three years later, in , that number had risen to ,, and already this year , bins have been missed.Opposition councillors have lined up to criticise the figures, particularly in the wake of allegations that Scottish Borders Council is considering moving to three-weekly bin collections when the budget is proposed in February of next year.Hawick and Denholm councillor Clair Ramage said: ldquoBin collection is a very emotive subject and as councillors we receive many complaints over this very issue.ldquoTo see that there has been a rise in the number of missed bin collections is extremely alarming and has to be investigated as a matter of urgency but this is only the tip of the iceberg.ldquoIn the last month we have been informed that Scottish Borders Council is considering tri-weekly uplts, a change that I am completely opposed to.ldquoAt the moment Scottish Borders Council is struggling as we have seen householders use their recycling bins for general waste when their general waste bins are full.ldquoThis creates other problems, the recycling vehicles are then contaminated with general waste and have to pay penalties to the processing company.ldquoIf bi-weekly lts are not working then tri weekly lts will create even more problems, for example fly tipping.ldquoI realise that budgets are tight but the combination of missed bin collections resulting in rubbish spilling over encouraging vermin is not something that as a community we should accept.Hawick and Hermitage councillor Watson McAteer also commented: \"I do not recall missed bin collections being a statistic that is regularly shared with councillors. Perhaps the fact that for whatever reason , bins have failed to be collected explains why this is not on public record.ldquoI am regularly receiving complaints from constituents who find their bins still full on the pavement after the collection date.ldquoWhile of course there will always be occasions when the council have no control of the situation the figures being produced certainly challenge the current collection policy.ldquoCan you imagine the problems this would causethree-weekly collection was to be introduced  I for one will not support such a move and would ask the council to explain to council tax payers why this problem exists and what they are doing to resolve it.According to data collected by the Local Government Benchmarking Framework, which is a comparison network for Scottish councils, . per cent of Scottish Borders are satisfied with their local refuse collection.However, this is below the Scottish average of . per cent and is the second lowest of the rural and island councils that Scottish Borders Council is grouped with.The council also spends pound. per premises on waste disposal, which is below the Scottish average of pound..Leader of the opposition and Tweeddale East councillor Stuart Bell said that Scottish Borders Council officers work hard to recty issues, but residents need to be aware of how to report missed bin collections.He said: ldquoI will be interested in the councilrsquos conclusions on the long term trend. As I recall there has been a gradual introduction of food waste collections into the larger communities in the last few years, so the number of total collections may have increased at the same time as the number of missed collections has increased.ldquoBut I am concerned to see the detail of missed bin collections. I had expected, and can see, that the number of missed collections is higher in the winter months when the teams can have dficulty getting round in the snow, but it is worrying that the level of missed collections never drops below  in any one month. ldquoThe public needs to know that there is a very easy mechanism of reporting missed collections on the councilrsquos website and, in my experience, refuse and recycling staff at Scottish Borders Council do follow-up on issuesthere is a systematic cause.A spokesperson for Scottish Borders Council said that the number of bins left unemptied each year is actually very small compared to the number the council collection.The authorityrsquos waste management service says it collects around .m bins each year, meaning the number of missed bins equates to less than half a per cent.The spokesperson said: ldquoThe number of missed bin collections over the last five years will be dependent on a number of factors including: the provision of a new weekly food waste service to around , households in  access issues due to obstruction and road closures vehicle breakdowns adverse weather service error an increase in the number of new homes which bins are collected from each year and bins not being presented by householders by am on scheduled collection days and incorrectly reported as missed.ldquoIt is not possible to determine the exact cause of any increase in missed collections but the increasingly challenging winters experienced across the Borders will be having an impact.ldquoThat was the case this year, when the extreme winter conditions experienced in January, February and March caused signicant disruption, with three full days where collections were unable to be carried out across the Borders.ldquoHouseholders reporting a missed collection over this period will have contributed signicantly to the increase this year."},{"url":null,"title":"a72-to-close-at-clovenfords-while-manhole-cover-is-repaired","story":"DRIVERS in the Tweed Valley are being warned the A will be closed at Clovenfords this Sunday.Scottish

four-fold in the space of a year.According to figures just released by the Trussell Trust, foodbank use in the Borders has risen by  percent in  months - the highest percentage rise of any local authority area in Scotland.The Trussell Trust, which support a network of  foodbanks operating out of more than  centres across the UK, have reported that between April and September , a total of  emergency food parcels were issued in the Scottish Borders  to adults and  to children.And many other locally-organised foodbank services arent even included in the figures.In comparison, the same period in  saw just  being issued.Despite the percentage increase, the number of parcels issued this year in the Borders remain the lowest in Scotland over the same period.The figures also report a UK-wide increase of  percent in providing emergency supplies to people in crisis.The charity claims the rise in reliance on foodbanks coincides with the UK Governmentrsquos Universal Credit rollout, which was introduced in the Borders during the summer.The charity says the inability of benefit levels to cover essential living costs and issues with payments remains the most common reasons for referral to a foodbank.They said: ldquoUniversal Credit is not the only benefit people at foodbanks are experiencing problems with, but the new system is increasingly driving referrals due to benefit delays, which include waiting for a first payment or having problems with a new claim.The charity is calling for the five week minimum wait for a first Universal Credit payment to be reduced.Emma Revie, Chief Executive of The Trussell Trust explained: ldquoWersquore seeing soaring levels of need at foodbanks. The time to act is now. If the five week wait isnrsquot reduced, the only way to stop even more people being forced to foodbanks this winter will be to pause all new claims to Universal Credit, until funding is in place to reduce the five week wait. Foodbanks cannot continue to pick up the pieces ndash we have to make sure our benefits system can protect people from hunger.Commenting on the figures, Tweeddale MSP Christine Grahame said: ldquoThese are truly heart-breaking figures for the Borders, which bring into sharp focus the devastating impact the Tory government is having on our local community.ldquoThe fact that people cannot afford to eat is a disgrace in any circumstances, but we can see from the statistics that in the previous year there have been  incidences where emergency food has been given to children specically ndash this is an abomination in a developed country such as ours.ldquoWhile sustained Tory cuts have created this problem, we can see that where Universal Credit has rolled out, which is the case in the Borders, it has made things worse.ldquoMichelle Ballantyne MSP who is the Toryrsquos Social Security spokesperson, represents the South of Scotland which covers the Borders ndash despite her ardent defence of Universal Credit in parliament recently, she must see now how devastating this roll out has been.\"I call on her to review her position and urgently press her colleagues at Westminster to halt the roll out of UC, so the fundamental flaws can be addressed.In response Michelle Ballantyne MSP said: ldquoWhile Ms Grahame might be correct that foodbank usage has risen across the UK, she might want to look closer before placing all the blame with the UK Government.\"We should also remember that, despite this increase, foodbank usage in the Borders is still at the lowest number in Scotland.ldquoI would consider it narrow-minded to attribute the entire increase with Universal Credit there are many other factors contributing to foodbank usage across the country.\"Aberdeen City Council and Perth and Kinross have also implemented Universal Credit around the same time as the Borders and the same report notes that foodbank usage has actually decreased in these areas.ldquoHer assertion that Universal Credit is the sole reason that foodbank usage is rising in the Borders just doesnrsquot add up.ldquoI appreciate there are issues with Universal Credit and the UK Government has said they will address them. An example of this is the announcement that there will be increased work allowances which will give a boost to hundreds of thousands of people including a pound boost for couples with children.ldquoI suggest that Ms. Grahame spend less time scaremongering and instead focus on how we can address the drivers of poverty instead."},{"url":null,"title":"pet-of-the-week","story":"This weeks Pet Of The Week, from Borders Pet Rescue, features Willow and Mittens.The charity told us: \"This lovely pair of nine-year-old sisters came into the centre as they couldnt live with the dogs in their previous home.

Perhaps a little too early for the jumpers, I attended the Memorial Hall eager to feast upon the much-anticipated performance of these young thespians.Could they really deliver this magical Christmas story and live up to the incredible reputation set by their mentors, Innerleithen  District Amateur Operatic Society  You bet your bottom dollar they did!From the moment the music started and the curtain opened on this stunning production, I along with the audiences were captivated.Playing the hopeful orphan was Freya Wilson. She already looked the part with red hair and freckles, and with stunning vocals she belted out classics lsquoTomorrowrsquo and lsquoMaybersquo, which I have no doubt produced a few tears from the audience. She embraced the character with her cheeky charm and wit, and carried out the role of the ever-optimistic character beautully.Hatching a plan to escape the orphanage and find her parents, Annie is helped by her urchin friends, who had the crowdrsquos toes-tapping and knees bouncing to a fantastically choreographed lsquoHard Knock Lersquo. Credit where itrsquos due, this incredible young cast, who reprised their roles as servants and New Yorkers, were amazing, bringing le to the entire show.But Anniersquos cunning plan to escape fails, and it isnrsquot long before she is dragged back to the evil clutches of the vile Miss Hannigan, played by Lizzie Bell. What was in the champagne bottle, I do not know, but the teenager stumbled about the stage, and conveyed the child-hating orphanage boss to comic perfection. Hanniganrsquos flirtatious manner with Officer Ward , who brings Annie back after running away, had the audience chuckling, and truly convinced us of her distaste for the girls in her care with a jaw-dropping performance of lsquoLittle Girlsrsquo.Anniersquos capture isnrsquot the end of her adventure, itrsquos only just begun, as she s in perfect time to meet Grace Farrell.Miss Farrell is gracefully played by the suave and sophisticated Ava Church, dressed impeccably as the rsquos private secretary to Oliver Warbucks. Annie cheekily seizes a golden opportunity to spend Christmas with Mr Warbucks, and is swept off to live the le of royalty at his mansion.Annie soon melts the heart of wealthy businessman Oliver Warbuckswho gave an endearing performance as the billionaire. The two gave a heart-warming rendition of lsquoI Donrsquot Need Anything But Yoursquo. This will be Thomasrsquos first and last performance with KIYT, but Irsquom sure it wonrsquot be last wersquoll see of this talented young man.After promising to help Annie find her parents, in step the villains of the show ndash scheming Rooster Hannigan and his ditzy blonde girlfriend Lily St Regis.Together with Miss Hannigan, the three plot to swindle Mr Warbucks out of a , dollar reward by posing as Anniersquos parents.Alex Paterson pulls off the flashy self-assured gangster brilliantly, and with his money-grabbing side-kick Lily St Regis, the two are perfectly paired bringing not only the comic element to the show, but impeccable American accents, which polished off their characters.Now at this point I must declare my motherly interest, as Lily was played by my daughter Neve Scott. It is very dficult for one to critic her own child. However, I am very proud to call her a vain, blonde bimbo, red-lipstick wearing, smoking, winey voiced, floozy!The three baddies gave a show-stopping performance of lsquoEasy Streetrsquo which had the audiences in stitches.True to the classic, their evil plotting is foiled and Annie has her happy ending after being adopted by Mr Warbucks. The whole cast came out in glorious chorus for the finale of lsquoTomorrowrsquo.There is one furry four-legged actor who deserves a mention for his tail-wagging performance, the adorable Harry who is no stranger to the spotlight after his dog debut as Toto in the Operarsquos lsquoThe Wizard of Ozrsquo.

One thing I am absolutely certain about is this: a no deal Brexit would be a disaster for Scotland and the whole of the UK.It would harm the economy, threaten jobs and damage peoplersquos standards of living. I will do everything I can to stop that happening.Irsquove been disappointed by the soap opera of cabinet resignations over the past few days and Irsquom dismayed that colleagues might yet try to force a vote of no confidence in the Prime Minister.That would be a huge distraction at the worst possible moment.It is time for MPs on all sides to recognise that the alternative to the deal we have negotiated is leaving the EU without a deal. I hope that nightmare prospect really focuses minds in the days ahead.There is nothing to stop the SNP and Labour backing the deal. It achieves key goals set out in their own Brexit plans, like protecting trade and citizensrsquo rights. However, to support their own political objectives, they currently plan to vote against the proposed agreement.Prime Minister Theresa May has shown resolve, determination and strength of character as we move towards the final, dficult stages of the Brexit process.

It is a collection of stories and anecdotes mainly relating to sporting le and animals.The following tale is inspired from one of the anecdotal stories in Eganrsquos book:ONE autumn evening in the early th century, a storm descended on the county. Dark clouds opened their dreich souls and drenched the land with a torrent of rain. The wind and downpour kept people awake for the whole night, and but by sunrise the tempest was over.Yet all the sudden rain had caused the River Tyne to flood. The folk of Haddington gathered by its banks to witness a strange sight. For the surface of the water was laid with huge masses of hay. The storm had obviously caused the hay recently cut and stacked in the fields upriver to be blown into the flood water, or swept away by it.They watched as small mountains of hay floated by. It was an intriguing sight but of course for farmers it was their winter feed for their animals going waste to the sea.Then someone spotted a swan. It seemed to be attempting to find a place to land. The river was in a torrent and at times the majestic creature seemed to give in to the current and glide on its course until once again it found the strength and motivation to make for the river bank. It was in no imminent danger, but clearly desired to get out of the fast-moving water.As people watched the swan it was noticed that a strange black spot could be seen amidst its white feathers. As the swan drted closer to the bank, people realised what the black spot was: a rat!The rat was clearly alive, at times peeping over the plumage asto see where they were. The swan seemed unperturbed by the ratrsquos presence on its back. In fact, as people watched more closely there seemed to be a connection between the swan and the rat which was most unusual.The royal bird was clearly giving the rat a collie-buckie, or piggy back. How the rat came to be on the swanrsquos back in the first place nobody could tell. The wee creature was very likely at home in one of the bales of hay when it was swept away by the river. In the swirling water it must have struggled to survive.Then rescue came with the swan. Could the creature have scrambled onto the swan without its permission  Surely not! Did the swan actively help the rat  If so, the moment of rescue had been a compassionate act unseen by human eyes. As people followed the drama they realised that the swan was looking for a place to land, not for itself but for its passenger.A crowd had soon gathered to witness the swanrsquos progress. The power of the flood water meant it had real dficulty in finding a place to get close to the river bank. But finally the swan found the strength and opportunity to swim close to the riverrsquos edge.The rat, recognising the opportunity, leaped from the swanrsquos plumage and landed safely on dry land. For an instant the rat turned and looked at the swan, then scampered away. The swan, its mission accomplished, majestically glided back into the main flow of the river.If the rat had thought itself safe then it soon realised this not to be the case. The people watching the spectacle had motivations very dferent to the swan. As soon as the rat landed, dozens of young men, urged on by their elders, chased it with sticks and set their dogs upon it.The animal, having survived naturersquos tempest, now faced an even greater danger his le was sport for humans. The creature zigzagged as people, yelling and howling with delight, chased it this way, then that. The rat, being cornered by a group of about  lads armed with stones and sticks, turned and headed back towards the water.But it didnrsquot make it. The creature was given a deadly blow by a lsquomerciless fellowrsquo. A cheer rang out and people came to view the dead rat. Then a strange silence descended as people reflected, now too late, on what had happened. In the frenzy of the chase it had been so easy to see the rat as merely vermin, rather than a living creature who had struggled to survive and so earned the right to le.People dispersed, no longer cheering.The whole scene had been witnessed by the swan from its vantage point on the river. What its thoughts were on the human behaviour it saw we can only guess.Humans can be made to do this to each other as well, of course. In the frenzy of war, people are encouraged to see others as no more worthy of le than that rat. And the insidious power of this is that both sides are encouraged to think the same way.But deep down, when we touch our humanity, we know how wrong this is. Old soldiers themselves are the first to understand the tragedy of it and see the humanity in those who had been on the lsquoother sidersquo. While there are undoubtedly people who commit evil and need to be stopped, it is the conditions which allow hate to flourish which give rise to their power and influence in the first place.In our remembrance of those who have fallen, let us do so with the reflection and not the frenzy.

We had just popped in to get a few simple items, but I ended up with a very upset wee boy. The supermarket had already begun to display toys. My son had noticed them immediately because they had been deliberately placed at his level.I eventually managed to distract him and we made it out without a major meltdown, but it just highlighted to me the pressures we are all put under.I kept on saying to my son: ldquoNo, but maybe for Christmas.It was a tactic to get some immediate peace, but I realised I was building up expectations that Christmas is the time when all the accumulated desires for stuff are met.We are made to feel that the value of Christmas is measured in the amount of stuff we acquire or give. I hate this and reject it but I am by no means immune from its pressure. I am made to feel guilty and every year I give in some way or another.The psychological warfare in our minds has already begun. The new toys laid out in that supermarket was but the opening shot. Soon a lsquoChristmassyrsquo atmosphere will engulf us as we do our shopping, designed to press our internal panic button that we need get on with buying lots of stuff, like a stressed squirrel collecting nuts for the winter.I know Irsquove ranted about this before but in February I spoke to a group of vulnerable parents in a course I was delivering. Many had huge debts yet had spent literally hundreds of pounds on Christmas presents, most of which were by this time broken, forgotten about or discarded.One of the parents encapsulated it perfectly: ldquoThe trouble is itrsquos easy to realise after itrsquos all over that yoursquove gone overboard, but the pressure is so hard to resist before Christmas. Yoursquore made to feel that you are a bad parent or a failureyou donrsquot get all that stuff. Itrsquos everywhere you go and on the screens. Itrsquos impossible to escape from it.In the discussion the parents said they wished there was a course or some guidance on how to resist the pressure while still making Christmas special for their kids.In a sense, this issue is not just a Christmas one, although the consumerist pressure is at its most intense in the run-up to Christmas, and even immediately afterwards with the sales. We have literally been sold the idea that buying stuff is what defines us.It has been a conscious, deliberate and sustained ideological assault on us and our children.In her brilliant film The Story of Stuff, Annie Leonard gives a quote from a retail analyst Victor Lebow: ldquoOur enormously productive economy. . . demands that we make consumption our way of le, that we convert the buying and use of goods into rituals, that we seek spiritual satisfaction, our ego satisfaction, in consumption. We need things, consumed, burned up, worn out, replaced and discarded at an ever-increasing rate.While this was in reference to the USA a number of years ago, it holds true for us here and now.Christmas, as well as other seasonal festivals, have been made a festival of buying stuff.Itrsquos destroying the very planet we live on, it piles our homes with unneeded and soon-to-be discarded consumerist items .Meanwhile, more and more of us are time poor and running about to pay for things we soon forget we even bought and are likely already in the dump or charity shop.I was once told I was being a Scrooge when I spoke of this issue. But the message in Scrooge, when he realises whatrsquos important, is that he gives his employee time off to be with his family, and a pay rise so they can eat he shows kindness and shares a meal and social time with his family. Itrsquos not about tons of stuff.Our time together is the most valuable and valued thing we will ever have. Irsquod never say donrsquot buy presents, as I know a thoughtful present is a wonderful thing. Butitrsquos lost in a sea of other stuff then its signicance is lost too.What I think is important is doing things together and measuring the value of gts by the thought put into them, rather than the price or quantity of them. And there are a host of local Christmas fairs taking place in schools and community halls all over East Lothian where many local craftspeople, artists and others will be selling locally produced and environmentally friendly gts which have real value and are designed to last. It seems to me this is the best place to take our custom.I know this has not been a proper story but, then again, in a sense it is. Itrsquos the story of how our rituals and the meanings of our lives have been turned into market value, and we now often feel powerless or unable to step out of it without feeling guilty, inadequate or ldquoa Scrooge.Thatrsquos how I feel every Christmas but Irsquom going to make a Herculean effort this year to practice what I preach. Irsquom not rejecting that lsquoChristmassyrsquo feeling or refusing to buy presents. But Irsquom defining it on my own terms, or at least Irsquoll try. Itrsquos about my time with people I value. Itrsquos about putting in thought rather than looking at the price tag.Itrsquos also about understanding how terribly dficult Christmas is for so many people and finding ways to connect with them and show them some kindness and inclusion.Maybe itrsquos just me, but I think that is one of the best gts you can give your children and others you love."},{"url":null,"title":"great-grandmother-84-enjoys-microlight-flight","story":"Jenny Lyall, , was the passenger in a microlight, taking off from East Fortune Airfield, earlier this month.The small aircraft, piloted by Kim Ritchie, gave Jenny the chance to look over her home in Haddington.Clients at the townrsquos day centre, managed by Caroline Scott, have been outlining things they would like to do, from having a holiday in the spring to going on the London Eye.For Jenny, though, it was a chance to take to the skies.She said: ldquoIrsquove always watched the microlights going over and would be sitting in the garden saying: lsquoI quite fancy doing that.rsquoldquoWhen Caroline askedthere was anything anybody would like to do I said I would like to go up in a microlight.A few days later Jenny received a phone call telling her there was a surprise for her at the day centre and she said she was thrilled when she found out that was a microlight flight, adding: ldquoI thoroughly enjoyed it ndash I would do it again tomorrow.ldquoNot bad for an -year-old!Caroline was delighted to be able to help.

But meantime, what do we do about Brexit, Neil  ldquoI donrsquot want to deal in that, he says, placing his coffee cup down with a slightly emphatic clump, suggesting hersquos learned to avoid controversy. ldquoIrsquom careful not to offer an opinion on any of that. My tour aim is to put an arm around the shoulder of someone I care about, which is this archipelago. Itrsquos a love letter to the British Isles, a spectacular place which has looked after me, and now itrsquos my turn to look after him ndash or her.He offers a thought: ldquoThe motto of the Isle of Man, lsquoWhichever way you throw me I will standrsquo, the three legged symbol, I think thatrsquos a great motto for people to live by.Thatrsquos easy to say, but wersquore facing confusion, polarisation of politics, right-wing extremism. You must be afraid of the isions politics has produced and the invective that comes with it  It seems everyone wants to be angry.ldquoIrsquom sick of politics, he admits. ldquoIrsquom completely disenchanted with all of it. Politicians lack so much knowledge. If Irsquom honest, I donrsquot think therersquos a politician out there worth listening to, of any creed or colour. I donrsquot have any truck with any of them. Irsquom just looking away at the moment while they do what they do, which is self-aggrandizing and performing their Punch and Judy nonsense. I cannot be bothered with it.He adds: ldquoI was in that arena vaguely for a while on account of a few opinions I was invited to give.He certainly was. Oliver incurred the wrath of the Nationalists back in  when he declared independence for Scotland a \"dead dog.\"But does he now regret becoming involved in the independence debate He pauses for thought. ldquoNo, I think itrsquos important to say what you think is true. But I donrsquot like the atmosphere at the moment whereby you canrsquot say what you think. If you are not pleasing the social media mob you are silenced or destroyed. I was asked some questions and I gave an honest answer.Oliver rejects the offer of half a sconeand instead sips at his coffee cup. ldquoHow it really started for me was when I was being interviewed for Bannockburn  [his TV show] and a journalist asked me about the referendum. ldquoI remember saying, lsquoA referendum is like going shopping for food when yoursquore hungry.rsquo You donrsquot want to be making snap decisions.Because you come away with a packet of Hobnobs and a jar of Nutella  ldquoExactly. I donrsquot think we should have referendums to decide which side of the road we should drive on, never mind kicking the ball back to the general population to determine a nationrsquos destiny. Thatrsquos why we have political democracy, whereby we employ hundreds of people to read tedious paperwork, shout and bawl at each other in a room for as long as it takes. Thatrsquos why these -odd people have a job.He becomes more animated. ldquoReferendums are a bad idea. After the Scottish referendum there were immediate cries for another one. lsquoThat disnae countrsquo. Now therersquos been Europe. And that was seen to be wrong. And so you claim for another one. What do you do  Go for best of three  Or best of five Oliver smiles. ldquoIrsquove never been a card-carrying member of a political party. I used to scoff at university friends who were. In the same way I couldnrsquot understand why anyone would get excited about football. Irsquom not minded that way.Yet, but he is minded to recognise how politics overlaps into culture and issues of identity, which he loves to wax lyrical about on his TV shows. But there are those who donrsquot countenance his passion for explaining the likes of Iona and the coming of Christianity. Some, such as Professor Tom Devine, see Oliver as an irritant.The historian once attacked the fact Oliver had been asked to front a History of Scotland ndash given he didnrsquot have a degree in history.Oliver didnrsquot take Devinersquos comment laying down however, describing the historian as being like of the old grumps from The Muppets.More recently, Oliver got it in the neck when appointed president of the National Trust for Scotland, and many Nationalists demanded his removal, which seemed odd given the TV presenterrsquos passion for this space we live in.But the writer presenter took it on broad shoulders. Did his personal history prepare him for the future stre  Seems so. Hersquos used to adjustment. ldquoI was born in a council flat in Renfrew, my dad moved to Ayr to work [he was a commission salesman] and then to Dumfries. The family was ldquocomfortable, he says. It certainly wasnrsquot an Angelarsquos Ashes set in Scotland storyline. They even managed a holiday to Spain once.Yet, the man who would go on to explain the Picts and Vikings and anacyclosis to uswasnrsquot top of the class at school. ldquoI was in the upper half but I wasnrsquot so great at maths and science so I focused on English and history, which I was quite good at.Oliver was blessed with encouraging parents who most likely were baffled why their son wanted to study archaeology, University I fell in love with the prospectus given it rarely leads to a career. ldquoI did work as an excavator for a few years going on digs, he recalls. ldquoIt was fun, but there was no money in it. And during the winters it became a bit grim.One Friday afternoon he was excavating the Roman Road in Greenock, and on the Monday he was covering a peace protest in Lockerbie for the local newspaper. Why the switch to journalism ldquoI liked the idea of journalism because it was essentially noseyness about people, he explains, grinning. ldquoItrsquos a bit like archaeology in that itrsquos the chance to poke through the rubbish, to find out what people were doing and why. Instinctively, I want to know who, what, where, why and when.Journalism has been as important to his current career, he says, as his time spent scraping dirt with a big spoon. ldquoWhen Irsquove been cast in the likes of Coast as a presenter it helped me get something out of people. And this Magpie-like work taught me how to become engrossed in a subject for a day then drop it, and move onto something .The curious mind continued to search for the next adventure and in  he joined a BT internet company. ldquoI thought that may be my future. I was also fascinated to learn how it had evolved, largely financed by the US military, who wanted to knowcomputers could survive after a nuclear attack. And so they hired these hippies to find out. And then I wondered what do we do with it  What are the consequences of it He answers his own question: ldquoItrsquos created titans such as Mark Zuckerberg, and Amazon, Google and Pay Pal. He adds in soft, serious voice, ldquoNow, Zuckerberg is almost at the point he has more power than Putin, without the missiles.While working for the internet company, Oliver decided to set off for Zululand.ldquoI had met up with my close pal from university Tony Pollard one day in the Granary Bar in Glasgowrsquos Shawlands and we came up with the idea of going to Zululand to make a film [which became the BBCrsquos  documentary, Two Men In A Trench].Boldness has to be part of the reason for Oliverrsquos success. He had a good job, with a good salary, a car and an Amex account. ldquoBut I didnrsquot have a mortgage. I wasnrsquot married. I could take a chance. And I knew I had had experience. When the TV job ran out Irsquod do something .Does the job flipping suggest a malcontent  ldquoNo, when I was at BT I figured Irsquod give it a couple of years, he says with a wee hint of umbrage in his voice for me having suggested such a thing. ldquoAnd we made the film really because we wanted to go to South Africa. The voice warms again: ldquoArchaeology was my first love and we met again. It was like Friends Reunited. And wersquove been together ever since.Hersquos a television natural. But did he always feel confident speaking to the camera  ldquoYes. Irsquove always had a good memory and Irsquom lucky in that I can remember  words in the right order, he says, grinning. ldquoTalking to the camera is not a natural thing to do. Itrsquos like a golf swing. But some people can do it. And I enjoyed being with these like-minded people. It was quite collegiate. I loved it from the get-go.Oliver landed on the box at the right time. ldquoI was   when television began to happen for me. I had few delusions about my own reality. Irsquod been in a few dferent jobs, had the rougher edges knocked off by le experience. Irsquod filled shelves at Presto supermarket while eating the Mars Bars. Irsquod worked on an MS till. He adds, with a wry smile, ldquoIrsquod been dumped often enough by women.Women. Yes, now hersquos married to one. And history taught him he should incorporate this woman into his future. Oliver met his future we Trudi when he was at university. ldquoI was in third year at the time, the president of the archaeology society and she was in first year, and she came in to join. I made a bee-line for her when she walked in the door.He grins. ldquoI donrsquot think she was as impressed by me as I was by her.She must have liked him a little because the pair were together for seven years. ldquoAnd it just sort of fizzled out. Then, years later, I met her wee brother Johnny and we swapped numbers and a few months after that I was back in touch with Trudi. It was asIrsquod seen her the day before.He reflects: ldquoThatrsquos another great thing about my le. Whatever happens, I know Irsquom with someone who remembers me when I was  and a silly arse. She remembers me when I had all sorts of archaeology student affectations, all patchouli oil and cheese cloth shirts. We can remember the teenagers we were.Oliver reveals he had the long hair back in the day. He didnrsquot create the soft Tarzan look for telly. He has just never bothered to have it cut. And it works for him, gives him a USP, although watching him on TV with the wind blasting into his face as he stands on a clf edge he does have to brush it away from his mouth a little too often but, I suppose, a kirby grip or a hair scrunchy would wreck the image.He laughs. ldquoIrsquove been holding out for the Head and Shoulders contract for  years but itrsquos never happened.Therersquos a calm about Oliver, even though he does become animated when he talks about the politics he says he wants nothing to do with. And he clearly loves his le, beaming at the delights of a career which allows him to take his family adventuring in the likes of Australia and New Zealand while filming Coast. Yet with three children hersquos not immune to worry, about the impact of social media, for example. ldquoPeople can have , friends, but ironically they have never been more isolated and lonelier. People go to Facebook ndash I donrsquot ndash hoping to see other people in this clearing in the forest who are equally lonely.Hersquos happy however, very happy. ldquoThe thing I most love these days is writing. I wrote as a student, as a journalist and then in TV with scripts. Irsquove written ten books or so and itrsquos something Irsquoll be able to do.And now hersquos making live appearances. ldquoIrsquove sort of blundered into them. Irsquom out there talking about our world, like Simon Reeve and Dan Snow. Maybe I can do this every year. Why not So the world will be all right, Neil  We need you to tell us it will be. ldquoWe tend to think this is a modern concern, but perhaps Stonehenge and Avebury are partly expressions of feeling the same concerns, people feeling they are little specks in the great scheme of things and wanting to be heard, to make a mark.He grins, reassuringly. ldquoWersquoll be fine, but I wonrsquot beI donrsquot do this school pick-up in time.Neil Oliver ndash The Story of the British Isles in  Places, the Theatre Royal, Glasgow, November ."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-insider-guide-stornoway","story":"But therersquos so much more to the Hebridean capital than just great views. Indeed, this bustling port on the Isle of Lewis has a thriving arts, culture and food scene that puts many bigger mainland towns to shame.Itrsquos also a place to soak up Gaelic hospitality, history and tradition, while appreciating the ever-changing terrains of this magical, wind-swept isle.Historical HighlightsKnown as Stjoacuternavaacutegr, or ldquosteering bay in Old Norse, Stornoway was founded by the Vikings in the early th century, people have inhabited Lewis for around  years.The main street, Cromwell Street, is named for Oliver Cromwell, whose forces fought to take control of the town in .Owned by the Mackenzies of Seaforth for more than  years, Lewis was sold to Sir James Matheson for pound, in . The new laird built Lews Castle, which still overlooks the bay, as well as many of the islandrsquos roads and schools.With its sheltered harbour and strategic location, Stornoway played a key role in both world wars.

But theres a time when resilience turns into defiance, and then defiance turns into delusion. Theresa Mayrsquos staying power is the nations curse, as she perseveres with a orce deal which has no hope. She has finally united Leavers and Remainers, but only to the extent that theyrsquore against her. Shes lost both her Brexit Secretaries, a host of ministers and both houses of parliament. But, like Monty Pythonrsquos limbless Black Knight, she battles on regardless.MPs on all sides say the European Court of Justice will continue to have effective jurisdiction over UK laws on things like state aid, labour conditions, environmental standards and tax. Theresa May insists it wonrsquot, and that by , a deep and meaningful future trading relationship will have been negotiated, which will make the backstop unnecessary. But that is a triumph of hope over experience. No one has yet come up with a way of ensuring frictionless trade that doesnt involve either membership of the Customs Union, or accepting many of the rules of the European Single Market. If you keep all or part of the single market you keep the ECJ.This doesnt mean that the ECJ is involved in every negotiation. There is to be an arbitration  to sort out everyday problems between the EU and UK. But when it comes to a dispute on EU law, the ECJ rulings are final. That is crystal clear in Article  of the Withdrawal Agreement which says that the ECJ ldquoshall have jurisdiction to make such a ruling, which will be binding on the arbitration .Theres nothing sinister in this ndash except in the eyes of paranoid europhobes. When you join a tennis club, no one complains that your rights and liberties are being removed just because you accept the rules. The real issue is whether you have any say in the making of them. Democracy demands that members of an international trading organisation should have have a share in the decision-making process. This is where the Withdrawal Agreement, indeed the whole Brexit project falls down, because as things stand, we dont. We will be rule takers.Theresa May realised very early on that the economic cost of leaving the EU completely was just too high. She gave assurances to all those big international companies like Nissan, Siemens and Rolls Royce, who have complex, just-in-time supply chains, that she would negotiate a deal that was at least as good as the single market. She effectively promised no tarfs, border checks or regulatory issues ndash ie no ldquofriction - between Britain and the EU. She had to, or theyd have upped and left . Components for Vauxhall cars are said to cross and recross EU borders at least  times before theyre finally assembled in Ellesmere Port.But removing tarf and non-tarf barriers is precisely what the Customs Union and the European Single Market were originally created to do. The EU is first of all a free trade area, the most comprehensive in the world. When Britain decided to leave, it meant that frictions would inevitably . Theresa May has been trying to square the circle ever since: getting the benefits of a single market without being in it.Shes achieved quite a lot, to give her credit. Under her orce deal, Britain gets broad access in to the single market in goods without having to accept free movement. But the cost was always going to be some continued observance of the EUrsquos regulations, plus ECJ oversight. Weve had to agree to ldquodynamic alignment with EU regulations, meaning that when they change in future Britain will have to go along with the new rules.The obvious solution might be to just join the single market, as Norway did after . It is not in the EU, the Common Fisheries Policy or the Common Agricultural Policy. This is Nicola Sturgeons preferred option, and she said last week thatScotland even got the same deal as Northern Ireland, which is to remain largely in the ESM, she would vote for the Withdrawal Agreement. But while this Norway option has worked after a fashion, it has powerful critics. It costs quite a lot, and there have long been complaints in Oslo about ldquofax democracy - that new laws are simply faxedfrom Brussels. But hey ndash thats just how these things work. You are either in the EU or you arent.So what happens now  Mays deal wont fly, yet she stands her ground. The deal will almost certainly be rejected in parliament, even though Labour dont really have a coherent alternative. Jeremy Corbyn was scathing about Mayrsquos ldquobotched deal, but he too wants to leave the EU. Nor do Labour wish Britain to be a formal member of the Customs Union or the European Single Market. John McDonnell, the Shadow Chancellor, says he would renegotiate the deal to achieve a ldquoclose and collaborative relationship with the single market. In other words, a better deal than Mayrsquos. But the German Chancellor, Angela Merkell, has made clear that negotiations are over. End of story.Faced with a disastrous no deal, and no prospect of renegotiating the Withdrawal Agreement, the opposition parties face a very hard parliamentary choice next month. Do they join with Jacob Rees Mogg and the DUP, and vote for an economic disaster which would damage the livelihoods of countless Labour voters  Or do they suck it up, back Theresa May and then blame the Tories in future for landing Britain with such a bad settlement  If they vote down Mayrsquos orce deal, they must know that renegotiation is not now an option. Nor is a general election, because the Tories wonrsquot vote, like turkeys, for an early Christmas. The only alternative is for the opposition parties to do what they should have done months ago: unite the Remain majority in the House of Commons to demand a delay on Article , and then force May to hold a repeat referendum.If parliament cant decide what to do, the only option is to hand it back to the people who got us into this mess in the first place: the voters."},{"url":null,"title":"the-cool-list-hotels","story":"Built in  by Lord MacDonald of Sleat and once surrounded by orange trees ndash hence the hotelrsquos name ndash Marmalade is a -minute walk from Portree harbour and offers fine views over Portree Bay and to the Cuillins beyond.

The issue of pushing for a Peoples Vote is also likely to come up.Last night, Labourrsquos Sir Keir Starmer said Labour could even try to bring down the Conservative Government to block a no-deal Brexit.The Shadow Brexit Secretary told the Parliamentary Labour Party he was prepared to ldquowork with all sides to prevent the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal.\"There will be opportunities to make the majority against no-deal heard.

who last week turned down the job of Brexit Secretary following the resignation of Dominic Raab - Andrea Leadsom, Penny Mordaunt, Liam Fox and Chris Grayling were all reported to be unhappy with the terms over the Northern Irish border.However, there was little sign that they were preparing to force a fresh showdown at the weekly meeting of the Cabinet in Downing Street on Tuesday, which was expected to last longer than the usual hour due to the circumstances.Elsewhere, in a further sign of the Governments weakness, ministers were forced to offer fresh concessions to stave off a damaging defeat over the publication of the Governments assessment of the economic impact of Brexit.Robert Jenrick, the Treasury Minister, told MPs they would now release a comparative analysis of the economic impactBritain was to remain in the EU rather than leave in March .Previously, the Government had only undertaken to publish its assessment of the impact of leaving with a deal, compared with a no-deal Brexit."},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-admits-indyref2-may-be-after-2021","story":"The First Minister said she may not be able to overcome the UK Governmentrsquos rigid refusal to grant Holyrood the power to hold another vote before .Ruling out an unofficial Catalan-style vote, she suggested the best option could be to complain vigorously about the UKrsquos action and seek a new mandate from the voters.:Scotlands \"Union idend\" is pound, per person, says David MundellHowever polls suggest the SNP will lose seats at the next Holyrood election, with Unionist parties in the majority, and so there would be no chance of a referendum after  either.The statement is likely to dismay many in the SNP, including MPs like Angus Brendan MacNeil, who called for a swt second vote at the SNP conference in October.Ms Sturgeonrsquos admission, made at a weekend meeting of the Women for Independence group, came after repeated delays to her long-awaited ldquoprecise timescale on Indyref.A new poll also gave a -point lead to No campaign.:Supreme Court rejects UK Government bid to appeal Brexit reversal caseMSPs voted -

The agreement really only covers the Irish backstop, the orce bill and the rights of EU citizens. If the negotiations on the future trading relations are successful, Mrs May insists, the Irish backstop may never be needed. But these negotiations havenrsquot begun.

Another two years of legal wrangling, red lines, ultimatums, delays and last minute compromise.In fact, the transition period is already being extended to , and could go on to ldquoXX according to the Political Declaration. The UK will certainly remain in the EU orbit for many years, eventhere is that Canada plus Norway minus Switzerland-type deal that Mrs May envisages. Itrsquos mind-numbing. If only someone could just stop the whole process now, Irsquom pretty sure most British voters would accept it. Theyrsquore past the point of capitulation and worrying about their sanity.:Questions over governmentrsquos battle to stop Brexit legal caseAll credit to Nicola Sturgeon, therefore, for holding talks with Labour in Westminster about halting the Brexit process by delaying Article , which formally takes us out of the European Union in  days. She says her MPs would endorse a Peoplersquos Vote on staying in the EU. This is good ndashunfortunately, there seems vanishingly little chance of them having the opportunity so to do. Scotland getting a special deal like Northern Ireland or remaining in the single market. Scotland fell off the Brexit map after the aborted independence referendum in , and no longer counts.Mrs May is clearly not willing to call a Peoplersquos Vote, and shersquos not going anywhere. The Prime Ministerrsquos authority has been greatly enhanced by the stupidity of the Brexiters. They staged a premature leadership challenge and, effectively, lost it by not delivering the numbers for a no confidence vote. Just about sums up their entire self-deluded approach.Labourrsquos still hoping for a General Election, even though therersquos no chance of getting one. If and when Labour MPs vote against Mrs Mayrsquos Withdrawal Agreement next month, the Government wonrsquot fall. There needs to be a two-thirds majority to force an election, and Tory MPs wonrsquot vote for an early Christmas. The Prime Minister will simply come back to the house with a face-saving amendment or two, perhaps agreeing to extend British participation in the customs union or ldquoterritory beyond the backstop.By then there will be huge pressure on Labour to sign up to her deal ndash not just from the PM. The Irish Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, Michel Barnier, Angela Merkell, the CBI, the UK presswill all be screaming for Labour to endorse this deal as the only way of avoiding a disastrous no-deal Brexit. Is Labour really going to walk through the lobbies, with Jacob Rees Mogg and the DUP, to vote for chaos at the ports, a stock-market crash, the Army on the streets and tens of thousands of Labour voters laid off work Labourrsquos grounds for opposing the Withdrawal Agreement are anyway paper thin. Eventhe negotiations could be restarted before March, what would Labour be asking for  Jeremy Corbyn doesnrsquot want the ldquoNorway Option of staying in the EU single market, because that would involve free movement. He doesnrsquot want to stay in the EU Customs Union either, only ldquoa customs union, which Labour says it would negotiate. But Theresa May has already been there, done that.Anyway, Mr Corbyn wants Brexit, a ldquojobs Brexit to succeed. He is avoiding any firm commitment to a Peoplersquos Vote, which would undermine Labour in English Brexit constituencies. I doubtMs Sturgeon is going to persuade him otherwise. Labour may not avoid voting, in the end, for withdrawal under EU terms.So we have it. Britain plunges ahead into a Blind Brexit no one wants, leaving the EU, and all its benefits, without any future trade deal.

The effect on society has now become secondary to political dogma. We are in this current predicament because a weak Tory Government is in thrall to a right wing which wishes to turn us back into a lone, island nation in the Atlantic, yearning for the days of Empire. The Labour Opposition will vote against whatever deal is proposed regardless of whether it is the land of milk and honey promised by the leading Brexiters. Its sole aim is to discomfit the Government in an attempt to force an election and thereby gain power. The SNP see the shambles as a godsend in their pursuit of independence.Oh, for politicians like Teddy Taylor, John Smith or Charles Kennedy whose aimwas the good of their constituents and our nation.Jim Coley,Calderwood Road, Rutherglen, Glasgow.THE pages of history are littered with examples where the stubbornness and determination of a leader have simply served to worsen what was already a desperate situation. While Theresa May has to be commended for her survival skills, we surely have reached a point where her actions are compounding the serious errors of judgement that have characterised her troubled premiership.Having campaigned, albeit somewhat half-heartedly, to Remain, she succeeded David Cameron and proceeded to give key Cabinet posts to arch-Brexiters whose febrile anti-EU rhetoric has come back to haunt her. She has consistently failed to take them on and to discipline them for their all-too obvious disloyalty to her premiership.Presumably it was to appease them that she made the awful mistake of triggering Article  in March . By doing this she set the exit clock ticking before any serious due diligence had been carried out as to the drastic consequences of Brexit for the UK. As a result, we are playing a desperate game of catch-up. Scarcely a week goes by without another sector of our community flagging up serious worries and concerns. Permanent damage has already been done, witness the number of companies and organisations choosing now to relocate where. They are highly unlikely to ever come back to the UK. Some of this harm could at least have been predicted and considered before that fateful triggering of Article .Then in April , Mrs May opportunistically called a General Election rather than wait for  as laid down in the Fixed-term Parliaments Act . Here was yet another mistake as with her Parliamentary majority gone, she has had to rely on the dubious ndash and costly ndash support of the DUP.To make matters worse, in September  in her Florence speech, Mrs May laid down the \"red lines\" that would underpin the UKrsquos negotiating position. It was clear at once that her determination to leave the customs union and to end the free movement of EU nationals threatened aof a hard Irish border. To believe that the EU would compromise on its founding principles to accommodate the departing UK was fatally flawed.Eric Melvin, Cluny Place, Edinburgh.IN your coverage of the Brexit crisis, you carried a piece with the headline \"Mundell may quitUK tied to EU fishing\"which I read in conjunction with Owen Kellyrsquos description of David Mundellas lsquothis most inconsequential of politicians\". Why our Secretary of Statersquos apparent threat of resigning merits a headline is beyond me ndash frankly, who would notice, or care,he did go  Mr Kellyrsquos description is quite accurate, and I hardly think Theresa May is going to lose any sleep over Mr Mundellrsquos eventual decision around his recently-acquired interest in the fishing industry.At another level, it is of some consequence that we have a Secretary of State unable to make any political utterance that doesnrsquot include a Pavlovian request to the SNP to take a second independence referendum off the table. Constructive policies, as with Ruth Davidson, are nowhere to be seen. In this respect, Mr Mundellrsquos vacuity is emblematic, of course, of the Toriesrsquo indference to Scotland and its distinctive needs. So perhaps he has the usefulof reminding us of this, and holding it in mind come the next election. In the meantime, my advice to Mr Mundell is: just go now, and go back to your knitting.Dr Angus Macmillan, Georgetown Road, Dumfries.AS a citizen of Scotland, the UK and Europe I would urge First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP not to get into bed ndash metaphorically speaking ndash with the ideological purists and the to-hell-with-the-consequences led by Jacob Rees-Mogg by voting down the agreed deal between the EU and the UK.It would be absurd and sad to see the progressive SNP vote on the same side as a bunch of reactionary Tories. Surely that cannot and will not happen.As independent-minded people I am sure that our Westminster SNP members can see the reckless folly of the path being pursued by Mr Rees-Mogg and his cohorts. If they cannot then Britain and particularly Scotland will pay a high price.David McMillan, Strathmore Avenue, Paisley.NICOLA Sturgeon faces signicant challenges ahead,she attempts to demand an independence referendum be held in the short to medium term.She was of course rejected in March  by Theresa May because of Brexit uncertainty. Eighteen months on its clear \"now is [still] not the time\". The UK Government is in a state of massive upheaval and seemingly no one has a clear view of what Brexit may mean, or indeed whether itll definitely happen. Possibly Mrs Mays compromise will be rejected by the Commons we may have a new prime minister and or there may be another General Election leading to either a Labour or a Tory government ndash theyre close in opinion polls. Should or can another deal be negotiated with Brussels  Will there be another EU referendum ndash and what question would be asked  Again opinion polls predict another close result.\"Now is not the time\" is an even more appropriate response to the SNP leader than last March.Brexit may be the drama du jour but our relationship with the EU will feature heavily in British politics for many years.

threatDuring Prime Ministerrsquos Questions, Brexiteer Andrew Rosindell told her that he was \"deeply unhappy\" with the withdrawal agreement and urged her to lead the country in a new direction by \"completely cutting away the tentacles\" of the EU.His Conservative colleague Neil Parish, Chairman of the Commons Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee, also warned that the Irish border backstop \"threatens the integrity of the UK\" and advised Mrs May to listen to concerns raised by MPs.In parallel, the Labour leader pushed Mrs May over the detail of her plans although the PM countered by claiming the Labour leader had not read the draft Brexit deal, adding: \"Never mind a second referendum, he hasnt got a first clue.\":Questions over governmentrsquos battle to stop Brexit legal caseOpening what was largely a more subdued PMQs than usual, Mr Rosindell claimed his constituents in Romford in Greater London, were ldquodeeply unhappy by the proposed EU deal, which did not represent the Brexit they had voted for.\"Will she now, even at this late stage, please think again and instead lead our country in a new direction completely cutting away the tentacles of the EU over our cherished island nation once and for all \"Mrs May insisted her deal delivered on the promises of Brexit and ensured a continued close trading relationship with the EU.Mr Corbyn began by referencing comments from Amber Rudd, the new Work and Pensions Secretary, that no-deal could be prevented by the UK Parliament.He said: \"A number of Government ministers have confirmed this morning that leaving the EU with no-deal is not an option, does the Prime Minister agree there are no circumstances under which Britain would leave with no-deal \"The PM replied: \"The point that has been made by a number of my colleagues in relation to the vote that will come before this House on a meaningful vote on a deal from the European Union is very simple.\"If you look at the alternative to having that vote with the European Union it will either be more uncertainty, more ision or it could risk no Brexit at all.\"Mr Corbyn argued the PM did not answer the question before saying Mrs Mays \"idea of taking back control of our money is to hand the EU a blank cheque\" and added the UK would have no rebate after .Mrs May hit back by claiming Mr Corbyn \"hasnt even read\" the draft Brexit deal and also criticised his interpretation of it.The Labour leader said the Government had got Britain into this \"shambles\" before repeating his party had not ruled out all options.Concluding his remarks, Mr Corbyn labelled the deal a \"failure\" and told the Commons: \"It fails the Prime Ministers red lines, fails Labours six tests, and it fails to impress the new Northern Ireland minister [John Penrose], who just hours before he was appointed said the deal is dead.\"Instead of giving confidence to the millions of people who voted both Leave and Remain, this half-baked deal fails to give any hope that it can bring the country together again.\"Isnt it the case that Parliament will rightly reject this bad deal, andthe Government cant negotiate an alternative then it should make way for those who can and will.\"Mrs May replied: \"He is opposing a deal he hasnt read, hes promising a deal he cant negotiate, hes telling Leave voters one thing and Remain voters another - whatever he will do, I will act in the national interest.\"Later, Mr Parish told the PM, noting how he was a great supporter of hers: \"The Northern Irish backstop threatens the integrity of the UK and weakens our negotiating position and my farming instincts tell me you do not hand over pound billion before you get a deal.\"Please can I ask you to listen to these concerns and renegotiate the deal before you put it onto the floor of this House \"Meanwhile, Nigel Dodds, the DUP Westminster leader, who was nodding as Mr Parish made his remarks, accused the PM of \"deleting\" previous assurances over the Irish border issue.He said: \"In the December joint report agreed between the European Union and the United Kingdom it was agreed that Northern Ireland would have the final say on whether or not it erged from the UK single market and was subjected to single market European rules with no say, why has the Prime Minister deleted all reference to that in the withdrawal agreement.\"Did she push the delete button \"Mrs May responded by saying he was \"absolutely right\" about the December report but added: \"The December joint report referred to a decision being taken by the Northern Ireland Executive and Northern Ireland Assembly which sadly we do not have in place today.\""},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9046931.jpg?type=article-full","title":"theresa-may-rebuffs-ian-blackfords-call-for-softer-brexit-and-insists-scotlands-wish-is-to-stay-in-uk","story":"Speaking

It was something we were very reluctantly forced to do.He said estimated figures show the number of primary school pupils receiving tuition dropped from , last November to  this month.For secondary schools, it fell from , to  in the same period.Meanwhile, the number of school bands and ensembles plummeted from  to five.Mr Dodds, who was giving evidence to Holyroodrsquos Education and Skills Committee, said poorer areas had been particularly affected.He said: \"Although we have introduced a standard charge, it may be an equal charge but it is not an equitable charge.\"In some cases that charge will be met by families who have a reasonable amount of disposable income and who are able to meet that charge.\"In other cases I think the families who are facing that charge are looking to find money after they have paid for the basics, key things such as food and clothing, and for anything  they have left, every penny is accounted for.\"When we set our level of charging we had assumed a maximum level of dropping off of  per cent but in fact our retention level is closer to %.\"So based on that, what were now offering doesnt achieve what we set out to achieve, so we would need to look at that and that would need to include looking at ing to some kind of form of free provision.\"He added: ldquoI think given the levels of drop-off, we will have to address that. We are now at the margins of being able to provide a viable music tuition service\".Mr Dodds said a % discount is available for siblings, while those receiving free schools meals or sitting an SQA music exam do not pay.However he said some pupils may be opting to study music simply so they can afford to continue with the additional tuition.Councillor Willie Wilson, of Perth and Kinross Council, said it introduced a % hike in fees last year after a six-year freeze ndash the equivalent of around pound extra annually.Glasgow brought in charges around a decade ago but quickly reversed the decision amid declining numbers.MSPs were previously told the introduction of fees for music tuition in Scottish schools had led to more than , fewer pupils learning an instrument in just one year.Ten councils currently charge for tuition, with fees ranging from a few pounds a week to more than pound a year in Clackmannanshire.Holyroods ongoing inquiry into the issue was sparked after a petition calling for free musical instrument tuition to be made a statutory right was signed by nearly , people."},{"url":null,"title":"community gathers to remember mark","story":"Staff, parents and children of Logie Durno School gathered together on Friday afternoon to pay tribute to a local father.A remembrance event was held for Mark Mathers, who sadly died following an accident at his work on September .The green balloons were released by Marks family and friendsWhile taking part in the remembrance event, pupils wore ribbons that were green - Mark’s favourite colour.School pupils sang a number of songs at the event before Mark’s family released nine green biodegradable balloons.After the remembrance event was over, Mark’s we Deborah and sons Connor, Arron and Blair presented a cheque for £, to representatives of the Grampian Child Bereavement Network .Speaking to the Herald, Deborah said: “The money was raised at Mark’s funeral.The community gathered to watch the balloons float away“After we had the final total myself and Mark’s father thought about what charity we should donate it to.“We looked at ious charites but we thought it made sense to give it to a local charity that was already helping us.“They are the best people for it as they aren’t well known and we want people to be aware of them and what they do.”She added: “The remembrance event was very well done, but it’s tough for the children to fully understand what is going on.“This is such a small community but everyone has shown a lot of community spirt over the last couple of months and the staff at the school have been amazing.Commenting on the donation Jan Sanders of GCBN said: “For us it’s humbling that people going through something so sad like this choose to support us.“It’s an incredible amont to receive and it is a huge privilege to come here today.data-src\"https:res. jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Game of Thrones star Iain Glen may have recovered from deadly greyscale in the epic drama but hes asking his fellow Scots to own up to the inevitable and make a will. \"  \"  What do Iain Glen, Dame Judi Dench, Graham Norton and Robert Peston have in common  viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"“The money will be used to support other families to help them build hope for the future and to make them smile again.”Grampian Child Bereavement Network is a small charity that provides direct support to bereaved children and young people throughout the region."},{"url":null,"title":"academy hosts art exhibition","story":"Inverurie Academy held its second Art Exhibition on Thursday, November .The exhibition featured ious pieces of artwork by National , Higher and Advanced Higher pupils.Pupil Natalie Thomson with her work Pick  Mix TreatsHead of Creative Arts at Inverurie Academy, Olefine Richardson, said: “This year we have  National  exhibitors, ten Higher and one Advanced Higher.“The work on display is by our th, th and th year pupils.“This is the second year that we have held an art exhibition at the school and it is bigger than last year’s event.“The evening celebrates the pupils’ exceptional work and the phenomenal effort that they have put in to it.Many pupils created designs for new items including an apron, umbrella, and perfume boxes“We are really proud of them all and their hard work.”S Higher pupil Natalie Thomson had her work ‘ Pick  Mix Treats’ on display.Natalie said: “I chose Pick and Mix because it was fun to draw and I could eat it afterwards.

Jim therefore tried to find historical accuracy as far as possible by researching contemporary documents and manuscripts that held vital evidence.\"There are certain liberties you can take, like for example the drumming used by the armies preparing for battle and that is often for dramatic effect.\"The film is billed as a \"true David versus Goliath story\" of how the great th-century \"outlaw king\" Robert the Bruce used cunning and bravery to defeat the larger and better-equipped occupying English army.At the films debut during the Toronto Film Festival last year there were a few raised eyebrows when American actor Chris Pine, who plays Bruce, appeared full-frontal naked in one scene.Directed by Oscar-nominated film-maker David Mackenzie the epic was shot in ious Scottish locations throughout  and Jim spent six months working on the diegetic soundtrack.Jim said: \"I had a meeting with David Mackenzie just a few weeks before the shoot and none of this particular aspect was planned. David calls himself a jazz film-maker and doesnt really like to spend too much time planning it all out. Its very much part of his style.\"Jims mother, Beryl, still lives in Thurso and said she is \"immensely proud\" of her sons achievements.Wednesday  Nov  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118144.jpg","title":"Writings on the wall for Graffito","story":"THURSO has embraced an artistic legacy stretching back to the s with a vibrant mural in the town centre created last Wednesday by an artist from the Black Isle.Unlike the earlier work on Tollemache House by Polish artist Caziel Zielenkiewicz ndash a student of Picasso ndash the latest piece of public art has so far achieved great praise from the majority of people commenting on social media.The Facebook page for Caithness Horizons Museum and Art Galleryndash who commissioned the work by Marc Delaye ndash has attracted many comments about the colourful artwork gracing a wall of their carpark.Lora Dillon said: \"Went down to see it today. We all love it.\"Gill Arrowsmith and Shirley Sinclair both thought the painting was \"fantastic\" while Annemarie Simpson thought that a similar venture in Wick would help tackle the \"towns eyesore\" buildings.While on that subject, one dissenting voice condemned the piece and said there was a \"masterpiece eyesore now in Wilson Street thanks to Caithness Horizons\".Beauty is, of course, in the eye of the beholder.The mural depicts a portrait of Thursos renowned botanist and geologist Robert Dick surrounded by a kaleidoscopic representation of the CHMAG facade and the scientists specimen collection.The bold use of line and colour based on modern urban graffiti cannot fail to be noticed just like the mural on nearby Tollemache House but is sited in a much less conspicuous space ndash the gallerys car park.CHMAGs curator Merran Gunn, who was instrumental in commissioning Delaye to create the work, said the artist had also spray painted a wall within the building as part of a show running called Graffito.His earlier piece has an explosive anime style figure punching out of the wall toward the viewer.\"Marcs work is bold and vibrant, electric colours jostle for dominance, and the new outside mural is no exception with tangerine skies set behind the historic Thurso of Robert Dick,\" said Gunn.Thursos illustrious scientist had his herbarium collection feature in an earlier work by the artist Joanne Carr which in turn is featured within Delayes mural ndash a clear case of one artist paying homage to another.\"Graffiti and street art is more relevant than ever whether it be in the art world ndash with the recent record sale of Banksys girl with a balloon ndash or here in the Highlands where graffiti has made its way onto the syllabus at Farr High School through art teacher Tracy Wilkinson,\" she said.After garnering great positive feedback from the current show Merran decided to \"have a moment of spontaneity\" and raised funds through a crowdfunding website and the Dounreay Communities Fund to commission Marc Delaye to breath some le into a fairly drab corner of the town.Tracy Dodson, commercial manager of CHMAG, said that the gallery was \"breaking boundaries\" with Graffito.\"It questions what actually constitutes art and what gets shown in a gallery. Graffito is an exhibition that celebrates artwork that is available to everyone.\"Traditionally graffiti has been seen as anti-social, fringe or even as criminal vandalism, but with an emphasis on social inclusion, we are celebrating street, pop, comic and zine work as mainstream art for hanging in our gallery.\"Tracy unabashedly declares that Graffito is \"aimed at young people and the young at heart, as a way of inviting new and future audiences to a museum and gallery experience\".\"This is a multicoloured on-the-wall exhibition devoted to all manner of graphic mark-making and breaking the boundaries of what art is all about,\" she said. \"We have also hosted street painting and comic workshops, guided gallery tours, and collaborating with our local schools and council.\"Marc Delaye is an established community projects artist with Freshpaint.org which is based on the Black Isle.\"Murals are as alive now as ever before and an excellent way to introduce art to internal and external spaces, giving iniduals and communities something that they can be proud of and enjoy each and every day,\" said Marc.The murals can be privately commissioned and can be an \"ideal means of advertising products, services, messages and campaigns\".Other exhibitors at Graffito include Andy Strachan, of Comic Creations Studios Dundee, David Robertson of Fred Egg Comics and Zu Dominak, all of whom work at the University of Dundee within the Masters degrees in Comics and Graphic Novels ndash the only course of its kind in the UK.Other exhibitors include Victor Nobis and his series Fallen Giants ndash a fantasy dream space where cities like Edinburgh rise and twist through the torso of neon lit giant figures.Graffito finishes on Saturday with a day of childrens workshops, guided tours and a colouring competition.Wednesday  Nov  : PM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"November ,  at : pmOrkney Archaeology Societywas delighted to announce, this week, that it has received a National Lottery grant of £, for its St Magnus Graffiti Project.

We are pleased to confirm we have made some changes to the substation design at Finstown, which we hope will go some way to address concerns raised. We are also pleased to confirm that we will underground the proposed infrastructure at Hoxa Head.#In the coming weeks, SSEN’s project team will continue to assess the responses received as it further refines the project design.SSEN plans to submit its planning applications for the proposed substation at Finstown, the subsea cable and the underground land cable that will connect Finstown to the subsea cable later this year, while a final round of public consultation will be held in Spring  on the onshore infrastructure required to connect the ious renewable projects looking to connect on Orkney to Finstown substation.For more information on the project, including the latest visualisations of the proposed substation at Finstown, please visit: https:www.ssen-transmission projects orkney copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Albyn Housing is asking them to pay a lot more each month in some cases.The concerns were echoed by the MP Mr Blackford who said ldquofor quite a while now, he has been working with the CAB to get to bottom of ldquowhat I would generously describe as curious practices from Albyn Housing.He added: ldquoIn one case an Albyn Housing client who had just undertaken a tenancy was immediately sent a letter informing her rent was already in arrears.ldquoIn effect, they are asking for a payment arrangement in view that it is a debt, and extra payment is, therefore, being requested each month.ldquoI am sure as a charitable organisation Albyn Housing has their tenantsrsquo best wishes at heart, however, their recent practices raise many questions.ldquoThese must be reviewed to ensure that no additional hardship is being brought upon the people who take up a tenancy with them.In response, Calum Macaulay, chief executive at Albyn Housing Society, insisted his rent due date had not changed and said his organisation followed the statutory form of tenancy laid out by the Scottish Government in the HousingAct  ldquowhich states that rent is due on, or before, the first day of the month, paid in arrears.He went on: ldquoTenants claiming housing benefit previously had their rent paid directly to Albyn Housing.ldquoWe were always made aware that the payment was due, and as such, any arrears would be treated as technical.ldquoNow, with universal credit, the tenant is responsible for paying their rent direct. The society has no dealings with the DWP and we are not made aware of incoming housing payments. This means that all tenants, regardless of whether they are claiming universal credit or not, are required to pay their rent in accordance with their tenancy agreement.He said housing officers would be ldquomore than willing to help tenants make arrangements that work for them.It comes weeks after Albyn Housing had to apologise to a vulnerable tenant in Inverness after a boiler check bungle ended up leaving the single mum locked out of her flat for the night with her toddler daughter and having to rely on social workers to pay for emergency accommodation.Wednesday  Nov  : PMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

To navigate our way out of such a shambles, we have to be frank about how we got into it.It began with a lie: that Britain could leave the EU but still keep all the advantages of membership. We could walk away from the responsibilities and irritations of political union, but still claim all the benefits of the economic union that comes with it. The EU would be so keen to keep us, they’d agree whatever we asked for. We’d be inside it and outside at the same time – inside for the bits we liked, outside for the bits we didn’t. Cake could be had and eaten.Then we moved from cake to fudge. To keep the Tory party together, Mrs May’s approach has been to fudge, postponing the day of reckoning until after we’ve left. No choice had to be made. We can become both Canada and Norway. She’s still trying. It hasn’t united her party, and reality has caught up with her anyway. The rubber hit the road at the Irish border, but this isn’t really an Irish question. Leaving the EU is all about setting up new borders, for trade and regulation. It just happens that the only land border we have with the EU is that fractal line round six Irish counties which we’ve repeatedly promised would never be a hard border again. By its own lights, the EU has been reasonable, accommodating Mrs May’s ambiguity and fudge, but no amount of flexibility can avoid the fact that the EU’s border has to be somewhere, and we have to be inside it or outside it. Remember Schrödinger’s cat, in a box and supposedly alive and dead the same time  The point is that, when you open the box, it turns out to be one or the other.: Fight to defeat Theresa May’s Brexit deal a national ‘emergency’, SNP saysThat’s what Mrs May’s supposed deal tries to avoid: opening the box – making up our mind about the future relationship. But the Irish backstops remind us we must decide whether to be in or out of the EU’s customs and regulatory borders. Out means a border of some sort, either on the island of Ireland or across the Irish Sea. This basic contradiction in the Prime Minister’s position was willed on her by a split party, but her terrible tactics have made things worse. Triggering Article  put a gun to Britain’s head. She didn’t have to set the deadline we are now staring at. Her negotiating position was a criss-cross of red lines, ruling the possible out, and only the impossible in.Now, in the endgame, her tactics could do irreparable harm. Her deal will not survive parliament. Too many oppose it. She needs DUP support, but they know how to say No. Brexiteers denounce her. They cannot depose her, but won’t vote for her plan. Otherwise loyal Tories despair of her. She’s tells her party it’s her deal or no deal: take what’s on the table, or leave with nothing – no transition, no trade deal, no protection for citizens’ rights – only disruption and chaos. But they won’t all vote for it. Nor will the opposition.: Supreme Court rejects UK Government bid to appeal Brexit challengeWhen her deal falls, perhaps we’ll get a new government, maybe after an election. But the underlying problem remains: there’s no magic fix, and the EU is not going to reopen negotiations to listen to more fantasies. They might agree to our leaving the EU but staying in the customs union and single market. That’s what happens in the transition period, and is close to where the proposed backstop will likely take us anyway. This has been promoted by the SNP and is close to Labour policy. It’s clear and simple, but problematic. Outside a political union but in an economic union, the UK would have no say in many of its laws.Meantime, however, Mrs May’s tactics have changed signicantly. So far, she’s threatened no deal to frighten Tory remainers. Now she’s decided to threaten the Brexiteers too, with no Brexit. They’re not both going swallow it. Soher plan falls but her government doesn’t, she will end up offering either no deal or no Brexit.That isn’t a choice for the Government, or even for Parliament, but for the people. They voted for Brexit when told it would be easy. Faced with the no deal prospect – the Government is apparently planning for chaos, even soldiers guarding petrol stations – the choice must go back to the population in another referendum. People in all political parties are now supporting this. Some on the Conservative backbenches, many in the Labour Party , and the Lib Dems and SNP also. If the country faces such a possibility, they all need to get together to deliver a People’s Vote.Let’s not deceive ourselves. Having another referendum might avoid the chaos of no deal, but doesn’t solve every problem. The big political lesson of this decade is that referendums create ision. Remainers might think that another vote will be the end of the matter, but the country needs to address that ision and the economic and social concerns of those who voted leave.

The Cairns of Coll are so small that you have to look quite hard for them on the map, but there they are, some of them not much more than an expanse of rock raised up from the surrounding sea. The largest island is about  acres, a low hill that discloses signs of ancient occupation but is now home only to seabirds and, at its edges, colonies of seals. On one, the most northerly, a small Stevenson lighthouse sits, powered by solar energy, dutully sending out its warning to passing vessels.You can beach a boat here on one of the slopes of pure white sand. You can explore the low saliences that afford a view of the Hebridean Sea to the west, of Rhum, Muck and Eigg to the north, and of the high ramparts of Skye beyond. With exception of the lighthouse, nowhere are the works of man to be seen. There is a beauty here that is beyond price in a world where such places are becoming more and more sullied by the pressure of human population – and by the relentless human desire for more of everything.I was in the fortunate position of being able to buy these islands from the person in Barra who was selling them. Her family had looked after them for years and now she wanted to hand them over. I have no plans to do anything with them – they are to remain pristine, a natural reserve in a world that is increasingly being covered in concrete or stripped of its plants. They will be there for those who can get to them – most often, people going out on whale watching or nature cruises – or for sailors who are able to go ashore and picnic and explore. Divers sometimes land on them and explore the rich seabed around them. I go out there once or twice a year and just stand and breathe in the air and close my eyes, knowing that I am being watched by curious seals, their heads popping up out of the surrounding waters. If anybody really owns these islands, it is those seals.: Kelp ban branded a ‘chilling’ message for scientistsThe marine environment in that part of Scotland is now being threatened by a proposal to license the large-scale commercial harvesting of kelp from the sea-bed. This will involve mechanical removal of kelp forests, essentially stripping them out by their holdfast. The proponents of these schemes say that this can be done only in limited areas and that there will be little overall damage to the seabed and the le systems it sustains. There is weighty evidence from many reputable marine scientists that contradicts this. This technology will destroy the habitat of fish and many other creatures. Our kelp forests should be left untouched – completely. It is no good saying that only a little will be taken , tonnes a year – what the scheme proposes to take – is too much. Even , tonnes a year would be too much for the bit of the sea bed affected.Opposition to this scheme has come from many quarters. No less a naturalist than David Attenborough, whose credentials in the defence of nature are above question, has joined the clamour of protest. Local communities, including fishermen, have made known their opposition to what is proposed. A petition against the proposal has been signed by thousands of people who live in the area and who have a stake in preserving our precious marine environment frm destruction. The matter is to be voted on at Holyrood today. : Kelp dredging  Why it’s time to stop pundering the sea – Jonny HughesEverybody understands that we have to make some use of the sea and that we cannot always leave nature undisturbed. But surely we have to be extremely cautious that any intervention we make in the marine environment is kept to the minimum, and that in particular we should we should avoid industrial activities that will inevitably destroy signicant areas of the marine habitat. Kelp can be harvested, but must be cut by hand, on a controlled scale, rather than left to the mercy of marine combine harvesters.What we lose we cannot always get back. Our poor world is reeling, and as it reels, the metaphors abound. We are now in injury time when it comes to global warming the nuclear disaster clock is set at a few minutes to midnight. Scotland is a tiny bit of our natural world, but it is a precious and lovely part of it. Holyrood is its steward. Those who sit there must listen to the conservationists and scientists who are trying to get them to hear a simple, urgent message: don’t do this.I think of the Cairns of Coll. I think of those waters, those hills, those breathtakingly lovely places that make up the world of the Hebridean islands. The underlying eco-system will unquestionably be harmedlarge scale harvesting of kelp is allowed. There will be fewer fish. There will be less protection for the shoreline. Little marine deserts will be created. So, little by little, we destroy the things we love and need.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4833018.1542811457!/image/image.jpg","title":"pmqs prime minister rejects plea to work with nicola sturgeon on alternative brexit plan","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Theresa May has rejected a call to renegotiate for a softer Brexit.Speaking during Prime Minister’s Questions, SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford appealed for her to listen to alternatives to her Brexit deal, but was firmly rebuffed.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon met opposition leaders to try and forge a softer Brexit option on Tuesday, before meeting Mrs May to urge her to change course.: Mike Russell apologises over ‘alien jibe’Mr Blackford said: “The First Minister made it clear there are other alternatives to her Government’s Brexit plan.

Yet it has nothing to do with Britain#s traditional January and summer sales.This year, Black Friday falls on Friday  November . People all over the world will be buying discounted products as retailers slash prices.Such is the frenzied excitement over the event that in the past fights over TVs have broken out, queues have stretched far out of shopping centre car parks, and near-riots have unfolded as people desperately try to grab bargains.Last year, the novelty seemed to be wearing off in Britain, but Black Friday is still a considerable event.WHICH UK SHOPS TAKE PART Like Halloween and McDonald’s, Black Friday is another US import. Amazon is often credited with bringing Black Friday to the UK – it began offering discounts as far back as .For Amazon, the event is massive, with days of deals and a long series of changing promotions.Asda, owned by US firm Walmart, began taking part in  it’s only really since   that it’s started being a big deal here.These days, all British supermarkets and most big high street retailers offer some deals on Black Friday. John Lewis, Argos, GAME, Curry’s PC World and major supermarkets get involved.Last year, Marks and Spencer cancelled its Black Friday offers claiming that it merely ‘sucked sales forward’.WHAT ARE THE BEST BLACK FRIDAY DEALS Black Friday deals are already underway for a host of retailers, and you can see in-depth, up-to-date round-ups of all the best bargains here as tey become available:Amazon Black Friday  dealsJohn Lewis Black Friday  dealsCurrys PC World Black Friday  dealsArgos Black Friday  dealsGAME Black Friday  dealsGymshark Black Friday  dealsThe best travel deals for Black Friday The best TV and laptop deals for Black Friday WHAT HAPPENS ON BLACK FRIDAY Shops reduce prices, offering discounts that are far greater than normal.Usually the sales last for  hours, though some retailers extend deals for longer and over the course of the weekend.Consumers queue for hours on end in the hope of picking up the best buys.There’s a lot of pushing and shoving.Although Cyber Mondayalso takes place – where the focus is on shopping online – Black Friday deals aren’t always restricted to stores.Shoppers, particularly those in the UK, often prefer to trawl through websites hunting for purchases.Websites have been known to crash in the past. Although Black Friday isn’t totally tied to Christmas, there’s definitely an emphasis on getting Christmas purchases in early.WHERE DOES BLACK FRIDAY COME FROM Black Friday originated in America, where consumerism is basically a religion.It traditionally follows the US holiday of Thanksgiving and is regarded as the beginning of the Christmas shopping season.The story goes that after US stores enduring an entire year of operating at a loss , they earned a profit thanks to a large-scale shopping spree, which in turn put them back in the black.There may be some truth to this, but above all it’s just a big s PR stunt to get people to spend lots of money.There are also far more sinister stories harking back to slavery in the US.The term is also sometimes used on changeover day for NHS doctors.BLACK FRIDAY TROUBLEIn past years, there were scenes of violence and carnage as shoppers rushed to get the best deals.There were reported fights in Asda and Tesco superstores, and chaos in larger Argos and Currys stores.The police were called out on numerous occasions and videos of mayhem surfaced on social media.Last year, however Britain didn’t take to Black Friday in quite the same manner.More people stayed at home to shop online and there was also the feeling of a backlash in people here dismissing American-style shopping.Richard Lim, head of Retail Economics, an independent consultancy, last year told i: “The novelty of Black Friday seems to be waning.

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests!

I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted.

So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"whalsays new research arrives in lerwick for first time ","story":"The Research leaves Symbister with bunting flying as she heads for Lerwick on Saturday.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested.

He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

SIC has a poor record of flag flying in my opinion from the senior flagstaff. It#s the UK government#sand Scottish Parliaments policy to encourage councils to fly the Union Flagon a regular daily basis. It#s very rare to see a flag flying any time except on the Lord Lieutenants flag flying days list ofwhich is out of date.It is troubling to hear where the British media still blame German militarism and nationalism for WW, asnationalism and militarism were ever missing from the British national outlook. All major European powers fought to gain advantage over neighbours.It is refreshing though to hear the French President tell world leaders, including Putin and Trump, that nationalism is a #betrayal of patriotism#.#By saying #our interests first and never mind the others#, you stamp out the most precious thing a nation has # its moral values,# he said, thereby insisting these sometimes exist.The European Union used to be widely regarded as a moral endeavour. It seems most of our neighbours still see it that way, as something worthwhile which tempers selfish instincts and secures peace.If Brexit goes ahead the prospect of Britain forgetting its responsibilities as a victor, as Churchill put it in, #for the immediate future of the world# looms large. Let us hope some lessons can be recalled.#Patriotism is when the love of your own people comes first nationalism, when hate for people other than your own comes first.# # Charles de GaulleSadly we see Donald Trump, #America First!, Let#s make America great again#. A nationalist doctrine of utter selfishness!We seem the same doctrine of the Alt-right gaining a foothold in the UK and Europe. Remember #The Only Thing Necessary for the Triumph of Evil is that Good Men Do Nothing#,It is a sad reflection of the many, many people which has died due to war and conflict.There is one institute which promotes, encourages and sanctions war and conflict more so than any other establishment within a modern society.We have probably killed and maimed more people in the last  years than at any other time in  years. What has brought this to the fore is technology but also the institutes which have remained silent on such atrocities, this being the backbone of modern societies driven by economics, our banking systems.Never has there been so much money spent on war and conflict, never have so many countries been destroyed by war and conflict, and who stands by the sideline reaping in massive profits as a result, our banks.The Bible says # For the Love of Money is the Root to All Evils # never a truer word said with our modern banking systems.Rather sad that at a time when we remember those that saw the horror of so many European conflicts, we also saw the French and German leaders announce they want to create a #real# EU Army. I presume by #real# they mean, #the ability to kill people#. Not only was it tactless of Merkel and Macron, we surely have enough standing armed forces already in the world.

A lot of visitor experiences are going to be marred.\"Adam Gough, CairnGorm Mountain representative, who had told of the need for the slopes aimed at beginners and intermediates, was clearly stunned by the rejection.Asked immediately after the decisionan appeal was likely, he said that a statement would be issued later.CNPA head planner Gavin Miles had stressed from the outset the application had to be determined on planning issues ndash landscaping impacts in particular ndash and not on its commercial merits, which had generated much argument.He said the business case was a matter for Natural Retreats.Mr Miles told the committee the articial slope would not extend the ski area in any signicant way but the footprint of obvious development would increase.He commented: \"Initially the team were very concerned about the landscaping but as more information was given to us by the applicants it was considered that in the long term planting would mitigate against that. There would be an impact in the short term of the dry ski slope.\"Whether it will ever be an attraction in its own right and generate signicant income, who knows, but that is not a consideration of the planning process.\"In effect it is a ersication of business in this area and therefore acceptable andit was to strengthen the stability of CairnGorm Mountain then thats a good thing.\"He said there were some hefty planning conditions attached to control the development.CairnGorm Mountains representative said some  per cent of total visits to the resort were in just three winter months of the year.Mr Gough had told the committee Natural Retreats had explored several options in depth to remove the reliance on winter income including mountain biking and zip-wiring but this plan was the most viable at this time.He said it was imperative the attraction can provide year-round employment in order to retain its best staff. This site was the most sheltered for the ski slope and close to other facilities without impacting on other slopes, he said. It could also be used for tubing and other activities.Mr Gough acknowledged the clamour for better ski uplt at CairnGorm which has been overtaken as Scotlands most popular ski resort.He said: \"We would like nothing more than to be able to upgrade ski infrastructure to improve the snowsports experience for everyone but this has to be a long term process built on solid commercial foundations.\"He said the slope could be in operation for  per cent of the year outwith winter and ice would not be a problem as it was easy practice to break it up.ABA secretary Alan Brattey said history showed articial slopes at Scottish resorts including the Lecht, Glenshee and Glencoe had not worked.He also said a bright green Snowflex slope would stand out like a sore thumb and no consideration had been given by the operator to an alternative by market leader, Neveplast, which could be camouflaged.He said that of just over  votes on Facebook on the application,  per cent were against it.Tessa Jones, of the Badenoch and Strathspey Conservation Group, asked the committee: \"What are you going to say to the world about this peatland destruction \"Committee member Dave Fallows moved the application be refused and he was seconded by Carolyn Caddick.He said he appreciated the efforts to mitigate against the ski slope but said: \"It cant possibly soften in the long term the impact that this makes on the area.\"Mrs Caddick said: \"We are going to see it for miles and miles around.\"Peter Argyle had moved in favour of the application saying he had faith in the planning officers conditions but was not supported.Mr Brattey said after the vote: \"This was very much the right decision and wed like to congratulate the planning committee for deciding to reject this planning application against the advice of their planning officials.\"We very much hope that common sense will now prevail and that the plans for the Ptarmigan Building will be dropped.\"We are left to wonder just exactly why HIE allowed their tenant to take such a madcap plan all the way to the CNPAs planning committee who were very decisive in their rejection of it.\"He said HIE should ert the pound million to new uplt. \"The hill business requires to be funicular proofed as soon as possible,\" said Mr Brattey.Wednesday  Nov  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118063.jpg","title":"Green light for Dalwhinnie quarry work","story":"Gavin MusgroveA quarry operator has said that measures are in place to allay concerns that their excavation plans could lead to a surge in speeding lorries in a Badenoch village.Leithshas been given the green light by the Cairngorms National Park Authorityrsquos planning committee to recommence operations at the site at Carn Dhomhnuill Bhain on the doorstep of Dalwhinnie.The company has said that it is not contingent on winning a contract to supply aggregate to the dualling of the A but that the produce will be used for housebuilding and other local construction projects.The firm was granted temporary permission for  yearsatthe CNPArsquoslatest planning committee meeting at Boat of Garten Community Hall.Production will be stepped up dramatically at the quarry around one mile north of Dalwhinnie by the A.It was previously in operation up to .But now Leiths has permission to extend the site from two to  hectares.

Importantly that means that visitors will be travelling through the Sleat peninsula, where communities have worked long and hard to build up a viable industry.“In the midst of the important debates about ferries and not least the importance of the MV Coruisk to the Armadale-Mallaig crossing, it’s important to celebrate the huge contribution that RET has made to the island economies.”If CalMac#s league tables of ferry route usage tell us anything, it is that moving the MV #Coruisk# from its purpose-built harbours on the busiest crossing in the north-west remains inexplicable.If the two tables of passengers and coaches highlight anything , it is that CalMac badly needs its two new ferries from the Clyde to be delivered according to their revised schedule and not experience a third delay.It is a mild surprise, as Kate Forbes MSP says, to discover that more people sail between Mallaig and Armadale in Skye than between Stornoway and Ullapool and that more coaches cross the Sound of Sleat than make any other journey on CalMac#s itinerary.It is good news not only for Sleat but for the whole of the island. It is good news which is tempered by the fact that this busy, bustling route is now served only by whatever ships CalMac can spare, when the tide permits them, while its purpose-built vessel, the MV #Coruisk#, which can dock at Armadale in all tidal conditions, is ploughing between Mull and Oban  nautical miles away.If CalMac had the ships, Mallaig Armadale would be dependable and therefore even busier, Mull would have a vessel of its own and almost everybody would be happy.CalMac do not have the ships in large part because two new deep-sea vessels which were commissioned in  from Ferguson Marine Engineering at Port Glasgow show no sign of turning up for duty.One of them is due to operate on CalMac#s busiest passenger route between Ardrossan and Arran. The other is to work between Uig, Tarbert and Lochmaddy, which last year carried almost , people.The delivery date for those two ships has been put back twice. On each occasion, the £ million contract to Ferguson Marine — which is the property of one of the Scottish Government#s friends, advisors and allies, the billionaire tax exile Jim McColl — was topped up by a multi-million-pound handout from the public purse.If all was on schedule at least one of those ships would now be in service, and CalMac would have substantially more leeway in manoeuvring its fleet from one part of the west coast to another. They might even be able to keep the #Coruisk# on the Sound of Sleat.They are very far from on schedule. The new Ardrossan Arran ferry is now supposed to be delivered next summer, and the new Uig Tarbert Lochmaddy ship in spring .Will they be delivered  Or will we experience a third delay, which would certainly plunge CalMac into even greater chaos as its ageing fleet breaks down or requires routine maintenance somewhere in the Baltic Those are important questions. As we reported last week, the chief executive of Outer Hebrides Tourism, Rob MacKinnon, has criticised the Scottish Government for a lack of any #tangible action# to address the islands# ferry problems.The Scottish transport ministry, said Mr MacKinnon, must #pursue all feasible options to increase ferry capacity in both the long and the short term for the benefit of both visitors and islanders#.As we report this week, Labour#s Western Isles# candidate Alison MacCorquodale has added her voice to the many demanding to know the precise terms of the private finance initiative deal which has bound the Scottish Government into using just one ferry for all passengers and freight between Ullapool and Stornoway, with unacceptable consequences.Ullapool Stornoway may not yet carry as many tourists as Mallaig Armadale. But it is the definition of a leline service, with , passengers last year, many of whom found themselves unable to squeeze onto an overbooked #Loch Seaforth#.We should be told how and why one of our biggest and most important ferries came to be owned by Lloyds Bank.We should be toldJim McColl is going to deliver two badly-needed ships at the third time of asking.It is not enough to say, as does transport minister Michael Matheson, that building CalMac#s ferries is #providing vital support to our shipbuilding industry#The way things are going, building and rebuilding CalMac#s ferries will keep Scottish shipbuilding alive well into the next decade. Their higher purpose, and Mr Matheson#s job is to provide vital support to the Hebridean ferry service.

November, in which Councillor Ian Cockburn put forward a motion whereby the local authority would determinefunds were available for design work to begin on replacement options to the bypass. This motion was agreed. earlier this week, the chair of the EDI committee, Councillor Allan Henderson said that the council was putting pressure on the Scottish Government to have the route classed as a trunk road. However, during Thursday’s meeting Councillor Cockburn was quick to dismiss the likelihood of this happening: “Who in their right mind would take  miles of the worst road in the Highlands” He said. “After six and a half years we still only have two options… and the delays and the consequences for the wider community have been absolutely shocking.”The SNP member for Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh also went on to question the tendering process behind the work at the bypass, saying: “Was it necessary to shut the road during the day  I believe there was a tender on the table that would have allowed the road to open during the day.”He went on to argue that the council needed to release money straight away to enable design work on the replacement options for the current bypass to begin, adding that it was a matter of urgency due to the risks identied in the  annual sloping report which detailed four very high-risk rock slopes at the Stromeferry bypass.In response to Councillor Cockburn, the council’s head of infrastructure Colin Howell said that the council did receive an alternative tender from a contractor who said they could carry out the required works at night, however, Mr Howell said the cost was signicant and due to concerns about these plans it was decided it would be wise for some of the work to be undertaken during the day.Mr Howell said that while there were ongoing issues with rockfalls and managing slopes, he believed that the council had done a good job. He went on to add that the council were prioritising the high-risk slopes and currently working on the cost and details in relation to stabilising those areas which would be delivered at the next EDI committee meeting. He added that there were “three optimum solutions” in respect to replacement options and said that the committee had “decided to leave those three on the table# and seek dialogue with Scottish Government for funding. He said: “The administration is looking for feedback, we are working on slopes with high risks and will come back to the next EDI with the costing.”Councillor Derek MacLeod described the current situation as “one episode in a long, long history of problems with the route#, and in contrast to his fellow ward member, Councillor Cockburn, he argued that the route should be “trunked between Auchtertyre and Garve” as he believed it to be strategic in linking the ferry points of Uig and UllapoolCouncil Leader Margaret Davidson told the committee that she would be meeting with the Transport Secretary Michael Matheson and would report back “what options have been put on the table.” Councillor Davidson said that the council were “acutely aware of what’s needed” and were working towards a long-term sustainable option for Stromeferry.

For anartist of his stature this was courageous, dependent as he was, tosome extent, on commissions from people who, to say the least, wouldnot be subscribers to our paper. But this was an artist who went hisown way in art and who acted as a citizen with a conscience in anIreland where State-imposed censorship distorted not only politicaldebate but also national self-image. For Robert Ballaghcreative work and active citizenship have gone hand in hand all hisle. This is depicted in his double self-portrait ‘Upstairs No.’,one of the many illustrations of his work in this superbly writtenand beautully presented book. It is not a standard autobiographywith chapters set out in chronological order beginning with genealogyand ending with this week’s news. As you would expect from Ballagh,he takes a dferent approach, starting towards the later years andcircling through his days in no particular order before coming backto the present. More than that, he weaves narrative, anecdote andreflection together seamlessly and conversationally showing a skillwith words akin to his skill with brushes. He has a story to tell ofa very ied le, from his unusual family background to his time asa showband guitar player, through his unorthodox beginning as apainter and his development as an artist and an activist. Withfrankness and clarity he tells us how he learned and matured as anartist and his brief commentaries on many of his works areilluminating both of how they were made and the concepts behind them.It makes the reader want to look again and more intensely at thepictures. The Prologue isessentially a dedication to Robert’s late we Betty, his lelonginspiration, mentor and most important critic. The first chaptertells the harrowing story of how Betty, in her serious illness, wasdisgracefully let down by a healthcare system which basically allowedher to die through neglect, as was admitted in legal proceedings. Butthis does not cast a shadow over the book, as her positive presenceis felt throughout, and is celebrated by the author. These days I rarely getthat urge immediately to re-read a book when I reach the end, but Idid with this one. Thankfully the chapters are so well defined thatthey can be read as stand-alone essays or stories. Take just twoexamples: ‘Who Fears to Speak ofEaster Week’ recounts the tremendous people’s commemoration ofthe  Centenary in which Robert played a central part, aculmination of his activism which has included campaigning againstapartheid, for the Birmingham Six, for artists’ rights, with theIrish National Congress opening border roads, in solidarity withPalestine and as an enthusiastic participant in Féile an Pobail inWest Belfast from its commencement.‘Dining at McDonald’s’is a brilliant critique of the dominant and stultying modernistideology and practise in art and an appeal for an opening up. Ballaghattacks “the notion that the artists’ choice imbues a givenobject with special properties which are tantamount to a metaphysicaltransformation of the object that it ceases to be a pedestrianartefactand becomes,by virtue of the artist’s choice, art”. This ideology leads tothe absurdity of much of the ‘installation’ stuff in galleriesthat baffles all but elitist insiders and, as Ballagh recounts, theclaim by loyalist killer Michael Stone that his attack on Stormontwas a piece of performance art. He argues that the bureaucracies mustset aside this ideology and make galleries more open and democratic .For these views and forhis artistic method and, among some I suspect, for his politics,Ballagh has been frowned upon by certain elites. One prominent figurein the Irish art world said of him with dripping condescension thathe is “not a real artist, he is a mere illustrator”. Typically,Ballagh responded with humour and defiance in a self-portrait wearinga t-shirt saying ‘Fuck the Begrudgers’. I cannot recommend thisbook highly enough. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27486  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National Chairperson“The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office”Ive been wondering lately whether anyone in Democratic Unionist Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27487  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe Liberal Party was in government in Britain and had introduced the Home Rule Bill with the support of the Irish nationalist MPs in Westminster. They had abolished the veto of the House of Lords and Home Rule was due to be implemented in . The Tories seized on the issue of Home Rule as the most effective weapon to bring down the Liberals. Leading members of the British landed aristocracy, capitalists and senior military figures jumped on the bandwagon and backed up Unionist leader Edward Carson with threats of civil warHome Rule was brought in.Amidst the political frenzy there were very few Protestants in Ulster who were prepared to oppose Carsonism. But there were some and among them was the Reverend J.B. Armour of Ballymoney, County Antrim. A minister of the Presbyterian Church, Armour stood out from most of his co-religionists in advocating self-government for Ireland. In , he opposed a resolution at the Presbyterian General Assembly condemning Gladstone’s second Home Rule Bill. He was also a strong critic of landlordism.In , he again opposed a resolution against Home Rule at the Presbyterian General Assembly.Calling for freedom of conscience for Protestants to support or oppose Home Rule, Armour slammed the intolerance of Carsonism when he told the assembly:“If you deny the right of private judgment and of free speech, how much do you have of Protestantism worth keeping  Nothing at all.”Armour organised a public meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney to support Home Rule and oppose Carsonism. Banners in the hall proclaimed “No provisional or provincial government for us” and “Ulster for Ireland and Ireland for us”.The resolution stated that the meeting of Protestants of Ballymoney and the protests in The Route“against the claim of Sir Edward Carson and the self-constituted Provisional Government of Ulster to represent the Protestant community of north-east Ulster” and “disputes the narrow claim that dferences of creed necessarily separate Irishmen and women into hostile camps”. Among the speakers at the Ballymoney meeting were JB Armour himself, historian Alice Stopford Green, Jack White, son of a British Army general and later a leading figure in the Irish Citizen Army, and Roger Casement, who was executed in . This was Casement’s first appearance on a political . With his Antrim family background, Casement regarded the occasion as hugely signicant and in his speech he denounced any notion of partitioning Ireland. The meeting was a once-off and failed to turn the tide of Carsonism but it did show that a signicant minority of Protestants in the North-East were still prepared to stand up for Irish unity and self-government. The meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney in support of Irish self-government was held on  October ,  years ago this week. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27490  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.- Declan KearneyLast weekend the Irish Congress of Trades Unionsand Irish Labour History Society organised a conference to commemorate William Walker in Belfast.Walker was an anti-Home Rule unionist who was a leader in the Belfast Independent Labour Partyin the early twentieth century.When James Connolly, Irelands most signicant historical, socialist republican leader called on the ILPs membership to support socialist unity in Ireland, his appeal provoked a rebuke from Walker.This led to a robust debate between both figures in the pages of Forward between May and July .Their debate came to be known as the Connolly Walker controversy and later became an historical reference point for the anti-imperialist struggle in Ireland.I participated in a  alongside veteran trade unionist Joe Bowers, Ulster Unionist councillor Chris Mc Gimpsey, and ICTU Assistant General Secretary, Owen Reidy, to discuss the post Walker years and the current situation in the north.Not surprisingly we delivered four very dferent perspectives on Walker and his legacy as well as, Brexit the north strategy and politics on the Left and, future prospects.A very challenging but fraternal debate ensued between the lists and the audience.I opened my comments by saying that any consideration today of William Walker’s legacy needs to be within the historic and contemporary reality that the advancement of socialist and Labour politics has been held back due to the effects of British colonial policy in Ireland.He was a product of his native Belfast and directly influenced by the communal environment within which he grew up.He was a protestant in a largely protestant workforce. Sectarianism in the late s and early s stalked Belfast.While Walker was severely limited in his political analysis he was committed to improving the conditions of his fellow workers.He is an integral part of Belfast’s industrial history and his contribution to the city’s labour heritage deserves recognition.British policy in Ireland and its consequences for Irish society has ided Irish workers along communal lines. It has paralysed the labour movement from effectively challenging partition and championing the strategic aim of Irish unity.Partition is the central fault line at the heart of Irish society and politics.Sectarianism remains a visceral blight in this state.Following partition, it was used by the ruling unionist elite to cement the foundation of the state and prevent unity among citizens on issues of common concern.The fact is Labour was indeed told to wait as the resurgent struggle for national independence grew in momentum just over  years ago.The counter revolution which took place post partition represented a strategic setback for labour and working-class interests in the new free state.It eclipsed the seminal influence which socialist republicanism had on the  Proclamation and the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil.The rights of workers became subservient to the conservative elites, north and south.However, sections of the labour movement were compliant with British policy in Ireland and the imposition of partition.That was personied in the political thinking of Walker and others pre partition.This tendency opposed Connollys core position that \"the two currents of revolutionary thought in Ireland, the socialist and the national, were not antagonistic but complementary\".Walkers debate with Connolly reflected a key contradiction inherent in the Irish labour movement and its relationship with the Irish national liberation struggle, and anti-imperialism generally.That contradiction has existed ever since.Walkers brand of ‘Municipal Socialism’ was in reality a euphemism for self-imposed strategic and political limitations which went on to define the Trade Union movement in the north.As a result, the Irish labour movement, particularly in the north has failed to challenge partition and modern British political policy towards Ireland.Partition has been an abject failure. It was never designed to make the northern state a political or economic success.From the beginning this state has carried within it the conditions of inherent instability.It was built upon institutionalised and structural sectarianism which ensured that a substantial minority was destined never to be treated as equals.The Civil Rights Movement fty years ago exposed the inability of the unionist state to treat the minority as equals.That belligerent opposition from powerful sections within political unionism against reform of the northern state persists today in the form of political unionism, and specically DUP hostility towards implementation of the Good Friday Agreementsince .Refusal by the DUP to embrace a rights-based society and equality, culminated in the collapse of the GFA political institutions in January , and our associated political crisis which has continued since then. Those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power-sharing.The party brand is now indistinguishable from financial scandal and sharp practice in government.As a party, the DUP is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic reforms, social modernity, and standards in public office.Its project is negative and tactical, and entirely focused upon slowing down and blocking progressive change, while maintaining a sectarian hegemony within the unionist constituency.The DUP is in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarian, homophobic and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists and many others, including sections of civic unionism, have concluded that the DUP has had its chance and cannot now be trusted in government.They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power at the risk of allowing it to continue practicing discrimination, intimidation, bigotry, or sharp practice.The enduring political crisis is accentuated by systemic structural weaknesses in the regional economy.The required investment in local public services and protection of workers’ rights are confronted with a combination of Tory austerity and Brexit.Pressures on public services are intensying.The regional block grant, or public expenditure settlement, has been reduced by .%.Real term cuts to public funding are now factored into future budget profiles alongside ·         Actual net cuts in take home pay for public and private sector workers·         Welfare cuts and the universal social charge·         Higher inflation and living costs, adults in working families live in relative povertyAverage wages in the north remain lower than ten years ago.Precarious working conditions, zero hours’ contracts, and the scam of bogus self-employment used by some employers are in common practice.Workers’ rights and protections are being systematically reversed.The onset of Brexit will be a catastrophe for the regional and island economiesIt will deepen an existing race to the bottom by further undermining the potential for economic growth, and new investment.The Brexit agenda, twinned with Tory austerity threaten jobs across all economic sectors, workers’ terms and conditions, and, any potential for sustainable public services in the north.The dawning political and economic reality is that Brexit has changed everything.It has exposed the negative role that partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentally anti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.  The British state has been pushed into an unprecedented, existential political crisis.Brexit is a train wreck being jointly steered by the DUP and extremists in the British Tory party.But it also has become a defining moment for these islands.A new generation is questioning partition.There has been a seismic sht in the ambitions and expectations of citizens in the north.A new political discourse has begun about the future of Ireland north and south, and our relationships with Britain and EuropeThe debate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have moved centre stage.The time has come for a fundamental paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.The Irish government needs to begin preparing constitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish Unity.It should facilitate an open, inclusive national conversation involving all citizens, political parties, social partners, and civic society.That is a dialogue about our collective future on this island which addresses all the concerns, accommodations and compromises relevant to negotiating a new, all Ireland, constitutional, pluralist democracy.Today this new focus upon Irish unity provides Irish trade unionists and workers with an opportunity to influence the debate about future constitutional and political change.Previous moments of political change have required that labour should wait.The emerging challenge for the Irish labour movement north and south is to engage with this emerging discussion.To paraphrase Connolly in his opening contributions to the Connolly Walker debate\"Constitutional change then is almost a certainty of the future.”The labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.I said to the Belfast conference this reality will require Irish trade unionists to take strategic positions on supporting an Irish unity referendum and then to campaign positively for constitutional change.On Monday of this week I reiterated that opinion when I met Patricia King, General Secretary of ICTU in Dublin.Of course, this will be a challenging discussion for the Irish labour movement, as comrades noted both during and after the plenary discussion. But it should not be feared or avoided.Today in modern Ireland there is a battle for hearts and minds about how society is organisedThe status quo has failed us all.Connolly’s vision of a united Ireland which serves the interests of the many instead of the few will not be wished into existence.Labour should not wait again.The Irish labour movement needs to assert itself on the Irish unity debate by introducing a progressive labour agenda to the unfolding discourse on future constitutional and political change.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27491  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe writer, newspaper editor and Irish republican Seumas O’Kelly was a native of Loughrea, County Galway.

He was a fellow student of James Joyce in University College Dublin. There is a remarkable photograph of the BA degree class of  including Joyce, O’Kelly and George Clancy. Like O’Kelly, George Clancy, a close friend of Joyce, was to die a tragic death. He was Sinn Féin Mayor of Limerick when on  March  he was murdered in his home by the Black and Tans, on the same night as former Mayor Michael O’Callaghan. Seumas O’Kelly was a committed republican from an early age.

While a full list of attendees is not available it is probable that he was at the founding meeting of Sinn Féin in November . In  O’Kelly was appointed editor of the Leinster Leader in Naas, County Kildare. He founded a branch of Conradh na Gaeilge in the town and was active in Sinn Féin locally. He welcomed republicans to his home during the annual Wolfe Tone commemorations in nearby Bodenstown. O’Kelly’s first book of stories was published in  and his first play was produced the following year.

He joined Óglaigh na hÉireann when they were founded in  but was unable to play an active military role. His brother was a Volunteer and was jailed in England after the  Rising. The paper Nationality, edited by Grfith, was established in  and O’Kelly was one of its writers. It was the main organ of Sinn Féin during the  and  by-elections. In May  Grfith was arrested and jailed in England and O’Kelly took over as editor of Nationality. Following the  November  Armistice which ended the First World War, British soldiers and loyalists ran riot through the streets of Dublin, attacking suspected Sinn Féin supporters. On the night of  November a crowd of drunken soldiers invaded the Sinn Féin Ard Oig at  Harcourt Street . Seumas O’Kelly was at his desk in the Nationality office and tried to defend himself with his walking stick. The office was wrecked and O’Kelly collapsed.

In Ireland there had been groups working for women’s suffrage but the campaign really began here on the instigation of Hanna Sheehy Skeffington and Margaret Cousins. Margaret Cousins came from a unionist family in Dublin but she later wrote: “I belonged in my heart from the beginning to the fighters for freedom.” Her husband James Cousins also rejected the unionism of his background and became involved in the Gaelic revival. Margaret came into contact with the women’s movement in England in . On herto Ireland she co-operated with a remarkable young woman who was to make her mark on Irish history. Hanna Sheehy was the daughter of a Fenian, David Sheehy, who took part in the  Rising and was elected as a Parnellite MP in . Hanna was an exceptional student and excelled academically despite the restrictions on women’s access to education she achieved a first class honours MA in . She became a teacher and married Francis Skeffington. In line with their shared feminist principles they adopted each other’s surnames. Francis resigned his post as registrar of University College because the authorities refused to register women on the same basis as men. In  Hanna and Margaret founded the Irish Women’s Franchise League , with the active support of both Francis Sheehy Skeffington and James Cousins. From the beginning they stressed that the IWFL would address the specic needs of Irish women in “a subject country seeking freedom from England” and would “work on independent Irish lines”. Margaret Cousins described the IWFL’s position: “Its policy was to educate by all forms of propaganda the men, women and children of Ireland to understand and support the members of the League in their demand for votes for women, and to obtain pledges from every Irish Member of Parliament to vote for Women’s Suffrage Bills introduced in the British Houses of Parliament, and to include Women’s Suffrage in any Irish Home Rule Bill.” The IWFL campaigned throughout the country and made an impact beyond their numbers of about  activists. Not all militant women agreed with the IWFL’s tactics the republican group Inghinidhe na hÉireann refused to join in lobbying the British parliament, preferring to “organise a women’s movement on Sinn Féin lines, or on lines even broader still”. Despite this dference, republican women such as Constance Markievicz played an active role in the IWFL’s work and Hanna Sheehy Skeffington herself was strongly republican. Markievicz urged young Irishwomen to prepare to fight: “Arm yourselves with weapons to fight your nation’s cause. Arm your souls with noble and free ideas. Arm your minds with the histories and memories of your country and her martyrs, her language, and a knowledge of her arts and industries. Andin your day the call should come for your body to arm, do not shirk from that either.” Markievicz said Irishwomen were “doubly enslaved with a double battle to fight”. Following the  general election the Irish Party at Westminster was in a position to press the Liberal government to publish a Home Rule Bill. But Redmond and his party still refused to support women’s right to vote. The IWFL became more militant and Hanna and Francis founded the Irish Citizen newspaper to further the cause of women’s rights as well as Irish independence, social justice and pacism. When British politicians visited Ireland they were challenged by the IWFL. Margaret ‘Meg’ Connery confronted British Tory leader Andrew Bonar Law and Unionist leader Edward Carson when they came to Dublin. In Belfast Hanna Sheehy Skeffington challenged Winston Churchill. Margaret Cousins joined protests in England in  and was jailed for a month. In June  eight women from the IWFL smashed windows in Dublin Castle and other prominent buildings. Hanna was arrested at the Castle and she and the seven others were imprisoned in Mountjoy. The following month British Prime Minister Asquith visited Dublin and there were more protests. Three English feminists had followed Asquith to Ireland and they were also jailed for their protests. After a hunger strike in Mountjoy by the English suffragists and the IWFL women, all were released except two of the Englishwomen who were subjected to forced feeding. Many meetings of the IWFL were physically attacked at this time by Redmondites who saw the campaign for women’s suffrage as a threat to their political dominance and their relationship with the British Liberal government. In contrast, republicans such as Pádraig Mac Piarais and Thomas MacDonagh were supporters of the IWFL. The IWFL also won the support of prominent trade unionists James Larkin and James Connolly. They were closely allied with the Irish Women Workers Union in Liberty Hall and in  Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed after a confrontation with the Dublin politan Police during the Great Lockout. She was released after a six-day hunger strike. That year also saw the death in England of feminist Emily Davison who ran on to the course at the Epsom Derby and was trampled by a race horse. Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed again in  for campaigning against recruitment to the British Army. Her influence and that of the IWFL was seen in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic of  which enshrined women’s right to vote. Her friend James Connolly told her: “You will be glad to know that in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic we are including equal citizenship for women.” Hanna replied that she knew who was responsible, meaning Connolly himself. “We were practically unanimous, Only one questioned it,” replied Connolly. Francis Sheehy Skeffington was murdered in Portobello Barracks by a British Army officer during the Easter Rising. Hanna embarked on a tour of the United States to expose the truth about the murder and other British atrocities. She continued to play a leading role in the struggle for Irish freedom, as did many of the pioneering feminists of the IWFL. In  the IWFL saw its central aim achieved when women voted for the first time in the general election which resulted in a massive Sinn Féin victory, although women under  were still excluded. The IWFL actively opposed British rule and supported Dáil Éireann. For example in August  Hanna was badly beaten by the RIC who attacked a Sinn Féin meeting at which she spoke in Kilbeggan, Co. Westmeath. IWFL women went on to champion women’s rights in the decades following the Treaty when they faced the very dferent challenges of a partitioned Ireland with conservative anti-women governments North and South. The Irish Women’s Franchise League was founded  years ago on  November .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27493  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonA wreckers’ agenda is being driven by the DUP and Tory government.

They must not be allowed to destroy the democratic option formaking change in the north.It is these circumstances which bring sharply into focus theIrish governments responsibilities.Those who courageously signed this letter to the Irish government are saying the negative position of the DUP and British governmentmust not be tolerated.These are citizens who want the political institutionsre-established but only on the basis of democracy and equality.They are assertive in their resolve to see a rights basedsociety created, which guarantees rights, respect, and parity of esteem, in ashared, inclusive future.But they are not prepared to be treated as second-classcitizens in this part of Ireland.Those days are over.It is time for the Irish Government to indeed redouble itsefforts to step up to the mark by absolutely opposing the imposition ofBrexit, and guaranteeing equality and rights for all citizens in the north.An Taoiseach and the Irish Government needs to reflect verycarefully about the signicance and timing of this intervention, respondpositively and act decisively, in cooperation with the politicalrepresentatives of Irish citizens, and others in the north, to ensure thattheir democratic rights are delivered upon.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27494  ","story":"• th NOVEMBER  - Newly elected Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams Mícheál Mac DonnchaTHE Ard Fheis of  marked a signicant stage in the political development of Sinn Féin. The historic gathering came in the wake of the campaign in support of the H-Block and Armagh prisoners, the epic Hunger Strikes, the intervention of prisoner candidates, North and South, in  and Sinn Féin’s electoral rise in the Six Counties in  and .The party’s performance in the October  Assembly elections – when five republicans were elected to the body set up by British direct ruler Jim Prior – caused alarm to the SDLP and their supporters in the Establishment parties in the  Counties. Sinn Féin’s lead in boycotting the Assembly was followed by the SDLP for fear of losing further support to republicans. The Fine Gael Labour Government, led by Garret FitzGerald, set up the New Ireland Forum in Dublin mainly as a  for the SDLP. In June , the political establishment in Ireland and Britain was rocked by the election of Sinn Féin Vice-President Gerry Adams as MP for his native west Belfast. For long a leading republican activist, Adams advocated the deeper politicisation and popularisation of the republican struggle and the building of Sinn Féin across the  Counties.The British Tory government of Margaret Thatcher was also concerned at the rise of Sinn Féin. In the week before the Ard Fheis in November , Prior told Tory MPs that Ireland could become a “Cuba off Britain’s west coast”. He said he feared Sinn Féin could overtake the SDLP electorally and “we must do all we can to strengthen constitutional nationalism”. When the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis gathered in the Mansion House in Dublin on  and  November, it was set to elect a new leadership. Ruairí Ó Brádaigh had been president since  and he announced that he would not be seeking re-election. He said the four-province federal Ireland plan, of which he had been a strong advocate, had been rejected at the  Ard Fheis and his approach on other issues, including electoral strategy, had been rejected by the Ard Chomhairle.In his address, the new party president, Gerry Adams, dismissed media claims of a ‘Northern takeover’ and said:“We are not a Northern, nor a Southern party – we are an Irish republican party organised throughout Ireland.”The main theme of his speech was the need for republicans to break out of political isolation and “get among the people in the basic ways which the people accept”. In line with this approach, the Ard Fheis voted to contest European Parliament elections with the intention of taking seatsthey were won. This followed the expansion of party electoral strategy the previous year. The Ard Fheis coincided with a by-election campaign for the Dáil seat of Dublin Central, which was contested by Sinn Féin candidate Christy Burke, turning in a creditable performance. There was further controversy after the Ard Fheis, and discomfort for Fianna Fáil leaders in particular, when Gerry Adams was confirmed as the main speaker at the annual Kilmichael commemoration in west Cork. Gerry Adams was elected president of Sinn Féin at the Ard Fheis of November ,  years ago.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27495  ","story":" Robbie SmythOver the last  years Irishsociety has evolved and transformed in many ways.

Ireland north or south was never a concern yet we will all pay the cost for generations to come.Brexit represents a huge threat to the social, economic and political le of this island. The outworking of Brexit could be the imposition of hard border.That is why the people of the north - from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27499  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonGUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers# rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.- Declan Kearney MLADimitrios Papadimoulis is a Greek MEP who represents the Syriza party in the European Parliament.He has spent a le time involved in left wing political activism in his native Greece and has been a member of the Syriza central leadership which brought the party from opposition into government in , while the country was still in the midst of its financial and economic crisis and subjected to extreme political and economic pressure by the European Unionestablishment.Dimitrios is ‘laconic and philosophical in the way of Sparta’ – to borrow a phrase he used during a contribution at a recent conference which we attended together in Brussels, organised by GUE-NGL the European Parliamentary group to which both Sinn Féin and Syriza are affiliated.This meeting brought together leadership representatives and MEPs from twenty of the most signicant political parties on the progressive Left in the EU to discuss the future direction of GUE-NGL and future political strategy and co-operation among left wing and progressive parties including the  European elections, and the next term of the EU parliament.During one of our conversations at the conference Dimitrios recalled a story from - years previously, when he was travelling to deliver a speech.Dimitrios told his taxi driver what he was planning to say at the meeting.The taxi man replied:“Remember, you are a politician, not a prophet. Do not promise me things it will take  years to achieve. Make change for me tomorrow.”Dimitrios immediately decided to change his speech. He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8700094.1541778907!/image/image.jpg","title":"local mum hails go for it programme after she achieves life goal of opening her own business","story":"Helen McBurney from Ballymena explained that she always had an interested in beauty and owning her own business was a le goal. with Melanie Christie Boyle, Chief Executive of Ballymena Business Centre.

Sinn Fein Councillor Patrice Hardy brought forward a motion as last weeks full council meeting, which stated: This Council supports the Right to Work: Right to Welfare groups Peoples Proposal aimed at introducing a simple but vital checklist for social security decision makers.‘This Council supports the aim and will write to the Permanent Secretary of the Department of Communities for the issuance of guidance to all Decision Makers, requiring them to ensure that both due process and impact assessments are undertaken and fully compiled with in the decision making process.Speaking in support of the motion, Councillor Hardy said: For me this is about protecting the most vulnerable in our society.“It is about building protections for the many citizens in the Mid and East Antrim Council district who are in the receipt of benefits. The Right to Welfare Group are calling for a risk assessment to be carried out by social security decision makers and have developed the Peoples Proposal which is a human rights checklist. “The checklist includes the right to due process, including the right to information and representation, presumption of innocence and transparent decision making prior to the appeal stage.”Councillor Hardy spoke passionate about the Peoples Proposal and about the recent benefit changes.She said it is needed because: On average over  financial sanction are issued against unemployed people every month, while  decisions are made on a monthly basis to stop sickness benefits.People are being financially sanctioned first and then appealed afterwards while suffering forced poverty.She gave figures, saying that: , people were forced to use food banks last year, including , children. This isnt good enough.Speaking about children, she said levels of child poverty have continued to increase here.Over a quarter of all children are living in poverty. This is not just a statistic, this is a sad reality. Many children are arriving to school hungry. Every child should have the right to food and every child should be free from poverty. Seconding the motion, fellow Sinn Fein Councillor James McKeown, said: This highlights the disaster that is austerity and changes in the welfare system have brought upon people in our society. He also added: We need a fairer and more professional approach to benefits.UUP Councillor Stephen Nicholl, said: The substance of the motion is absolutely correct. The impact of the changes in welfare delivery are causing a signicant impact in society, especially on those who are the poorest in society.He added: The increasing use of food banks in areas where universal credit has been ruled out, the use of food banks have increased by %.I have seen some horrendous decisions going through. So I think anything that introduces greater clarity and greater consideration of the actualconditions is to be welcomed to try and make this a fairer system.DUP Councillor Billy Ashe said this affected everyone. He commented: We would support this motion. The benefit system is not working for the most vulnerable.He added that the community planning directorate compile a report on this subject that Council can use to influence decision making at a higher level in the future.Council unanimously voted in support of the motion.

After an introduction to the abattoir, the group was given a comprehensive tour of the kill floor and lairage.In the chill area, the group members had the opportunity to see dferent grades of lambs coming through the plant that day. Gary outlined what the ideal lamb is for Linden Foods to allow them to process for their customers’ needs, with discussion on how farmers can market lambs that meet this specication. The group was joined by William Chesneywho explained the grading system and what the grader is looking for when assessing each carcase as the lambs were weighed and graded at the scale, prior to entering the chill.William and Gary both reinforced the importance of weighing and handling lambs regularly to assess their market readiness. In particular, they emphasised the importance of not allowing lambs to becoming overfat. This not only restricts the potential market outlets, but is uneconomical for the farmer.The farmers were guided through the slaughter area where each stage of the slaughter process was explained. The visit finished with a walk through live lamb reception area where Gary was able to demonstrate the type of live lambs that produce the carcases Linden require for their customers. There was good discussion on the use of electronic identicationand especially feedback to the members on inidual lambs. Members stressed that, where they had invested in electronic readers and on farm software packages using EID to become more efficient, they were not receiving enough feedback information from the abattoir. Gary agreed that more information on inidual animals would be of benefit to the farmers. Linden Foods have invested in the hardware and software to allow inidual animal feedback to farmers linked to tag numbers and are keen to develop put this service in place for suppliers.The group members were impressed by the skill or the operators on the slaughter and processing lines and the efficiency of the overall processing system. The high level of animal welfare standards demonstrated was impressive in such a busy but efficient working environment.

Playing over  characters between them, Jo and Marty are still being stopped by fans eager to catch another viewing of the production such was its success during a run at the Roddy’s in August.“We wanted to bring the play back as we have such a successful relationship with the Balmoral Hotel, especially in the run-up to Christmas,” explained Brassneck Director Tony Devlin. “This will be the fourth production we have brought to the hotel. There has been huge demand for aof the show, as a lot of people didn’t get a chance to catch it first time around. We thought it was the next natural step to bring it to the Balmoral.”Jo spoke of how from the first night the play was staged “we soon realised very quickly that this was something special.”“The audience response was incredible after opening night,” she said. “People are still stopping us saying ‘When are you coming back, when are you coming back ’”“I think it’s a perfect way to finish the year especially after all the celebrations for Féile,” explained Marty. “One of the loveliest things was the audience reaction we got when we travelled to Coalisland. The audience there, who might not have been all that familiar with the beginnings of Féile, gave us a standing ovation, they were bowled over by the Féile story. To have a Christmas slant on it is just the icing on the cake. The performances in December will be a chance to raise a glass and tip the hat to all the people who created the festival combined with the celebration of Christmas,” he said.“The play starts with our two protagonists waiting to get into heaven, it will be a nice Christmas gt to find outFra or Bridie get into heaven or end up in limbo in Larne,” he laughed. A Christmas Station Once Again will be performed at the Balmoral Hotel from December  to  at pm. Tickets are priced at £ and are available from the hotel or by telephoning  .

I am not doing the work here for the students to recognise me in that way, I teach because I love it but it was such a great boost. I came into the classroom so happy and delighted to share the news with the class,” she said.Alanah spoke of the importance of young teachers making their mark in the city especially with so many who are choosing to go across the water or travel further afield.“Loads of my friends have left and gone to Liverpool, places like Qatar. I’m very much a home bird, I love being here, teaching here but I ask myself the question what does going across to Liverpool to teach have that we don’t have here at home  How are we supposed to make young lives betterwe leave and take our skills where “There is a young teaching staff in the Religion department here and our big focus is very much on ethics, making the subject more relevant to the pupils’ lives, how do you live out your faith through action  The girls I teach are so kind, there is a real kindness about our pupils, they would offer you the food from their lunch boxes, they are just so, so caring. At the minute our ‘Mini Marillacs’ named after St Louise, are collecting for the homeless and I would put a big emphasis on helping those less fortunate and the girls would bring in hats, gloves, scarfs, toiletries which are then brought to the Legion of Mary for distribution.”“Our sixth years go up to St John’s residential home every Tuesday to make cups of tea, bring buns and biscuits for the elderly.

These pressures have left many of our members on the verge of quitting their jobs. This is an intolerable situation for the NASUWT, we are committed to defending the rights of our members in this school and hope that a constructive engagement can begin soon with the employers to fully address the situation.”A spokesperson for the CCMS, which oversees St Patrick#s said: “CCMS fully appreciates the right of teachers to take industrial action. However, we do not believe that in this instance such action is either proportionate or warranted. It is our firm belief that the issues at the heart of this dispute can best be dealt with through an open and honest dialogue which seeks to provide balance to the concerns of both sides.“CCMS echoes the Board of Governors in its call for a suspension to the proposed industrial action in order to create the time and space for meaningful and respectful dialogue aimed at resolving the issues of concern and dispute.”"},{"url":null,"title":"can you help photographer identify these belfast characters","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Stormont collapsed in January  following the resignation of deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness over the RHI Scandal and equality issues.Subsequent attempts at reestablishing the institutions have proved unsuccesful.

The Prime Minister said that Mr Dodds was \"absolutely right\" about the December agreement.\"The issue of what the processes would be within the UK to look at this issue of regulations is a matter that will be a matter for this United Kingdom to determine.

destined for Corfu failed to accelerate at the necessary speed and struck an approach light at the end of a runway.The Canadian Boeing , owned by Sunwing Airlines, was taking off from Belfast International Airport taking holidaymakers to Greece at around .pm.The report states that an outside air temperature of -C was mistakenly entered into the Flight Management Computer by a member of the aircraft crew, instead of the actual temperature of C.The plane then took off from the airport with “insufficient power to meet regulated performance requirements” and struck the light.Had an engine failed at a critical moment during take-off, the consequences could have been catastrophic.AAIBFacebookTwitterThe error meant the assumed temperate thrust only delivered % of the thrust required for take-off.The report also states that the crew did not recognise the issue until they reached the end of the runway.The Air Accidents Investigation Branchonly became aware of the serious incident on July   after the Transportation Safety Board in Canada informed the office.The aircraft operator, tour operator or aircraft commander did not tell the AAIB about the incident, despite having a legal duty to do so.An investigation found there were no injuries and no damage to the aircraft which continued its flight to Corfu without incident but the report adds that this was only because of a lack of obstacles in the flight path.“It was only the benign nature of the runway clearway and lack of obstacles in the climb-out path which allowed the aircraft to climb away without further collision after it struck the runway light.“Had an engine failed at a critical moment during take-off, the consequences could have been catastrophic,” the report said.The -year-old pilot and -year-old co-pilot, who have over , hours of flight experience between them, had twice flown together before and both said they had felt rested before the flight.The investigation also found that the aircraft’s computer did not have the capability to alert the crew to the fact that the outside temperature was incorrect.This capability does now exist in new software.It also adds that the crew “were unlikely to detect any abnormality because of normal limitations in human performance”.A spokeswoman from Tui, who were the tour operator of the flight, said: “We are aware of the Air Accidents Investigation Branch’sfinal report with relation to the July  incident at Belfast International Airport and can confirm that the carrier is in agreement with the findings and has already implemented the recommended actions.“We would like to reassure Falcon and First Choice customers that their health and safety is of paramount importance to us.”"},{"url":null,"title":"ulster university to introduce irish

Thanks to everyone who campaigned for #nokelpdredge and to the MSPs who worked so hard in Parliament to make this happen. 🌊🌱🐟🦞🦑🐙🌱🎉🍾 pic myUMmeys— Help The KelpNovember , Ms Cunningham also announced a review of the regulations surrounding all kelp harvesting activity, including that which does not require a licence.She said: “I would plan to keep the situation under review, and not wish unreasonably to block the future development of forms of harvesting which might in time be established, through a proper assembling of the evidence, as sustainable.”The Conservatives abstained and the party’s John Scott said the whole regulatory and development system required changing or warned that would-be investors in the sector would no longer consider Scotland.Labour’s Claudia Beamish saidit was a land issue, rather than sea, there would be “no question of not harvesting in a sustainable fashion”.🎉 We’ve done it!

Thank you to everyone who has campaigned to make this happen! pic MHKttvaXw— Mark Ruskell MSPNovember , Mr Ruskell said: “Kelp forests are hugely important to our marine environment. They dampen waves, protect coastal communities from flooding and erosion, act as a habitat for hundreds of species including commercial fish and store more carbon than the rainforest.“Greens have been working extremely hard to ensure unsustainable dredging practices are prohibited in legislation and I am delighted that this has now been realised.”Sandy Dobbie, chairman of Ayr-based Marine Biopolymers, behind a plan to collect , tonnes of kelp off the Scottish coast, said it was “disappointed” by the “confusing” parliamentary debate but welcomed the review.He added: “The Cabinet Secretary appeared to claim that Scotland’s regulatory processes were very robust while, at the same time, appear to bypass them to support Mr Ruskell’s amendment.”"},{"url":null,"title":"this dad made an amazing action film with his kids as the stars","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Scotland’s west coast is home to the UK’s only resident orca population, a group of eight iniduals that haven’t produced a calf in more than  years. MacCluskey told Press Association: “This pod of orca is dying out, they haven’t produced a calf in over  years. It’s thought to be because of pollution, so it’s sad that eventually they’re going to die out.”"},{"url":null,"title":"watch dominic solankes swanky backheel chip for england","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He will not end his le in an old folks’ home. He has to behave himself.”Israel and Hamas recently stepped back from the brink of their fourth war in a decade thanks to an Egyptian ceasefire.Palestinian militants fired  rockets and mortar shells into Israel last week in  hours, in response to a botched Israeli raid that left seven Palestinian militants and a senior Israeli officer dead. Israel responded with a wave of air strikes. Seven Palestinians, including five militants, were killed, while a Palestinian labourer working in Israel was killed by a Gaza rocket. It was the heaviest fighting since the  Gaza war.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the time was not right for a wider confrontation in Gaza, but he has come under heavy criticism for agreeing to a ceasefire. \" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Benjamin Netanyahu has been criticised for having a ‘soft’ stance Defence minister Avigdor Lieberman resigned in protest, accusing Mr Netanyahu of being soft on terrorism, and another hardline minister threatened to do the same – which would have sparked early elections – before backing down.In the wake of the political crisis, and with early elections still a distinct possibility, ministers have begun talking tough about the next round of fighting.“We are now close to a no-choice war against Hamas in Gaza. We must strike hard to restore deterrence,” intelligence minister Israel Katz told the conference. “Any attack on Israeli soil must be met with a tough response …Sinwar orHaniyeh were to fire a bullet or a rocket at a soldier or Israeli citizens they will pay with their heads.”Israel assassinated Hamas leaders Ahmad Yassin and Abdel Aziz al-Rantisi in , and tried to kill another leader, Khaled Mashaal, in .

been given to Carryduff girl Cara Mailey.The nine-year-old has a form of dwarfism which means that living in a standard-sized world can present challenges for her.Born with achonlasia, Cara dared to dream big and applied last year to have a special den created for her by the team from the popular CBBC programme The Dengineers.The plucky and determined child is now the proud owner of a colourful sweet-themed garden den that is ideally sized to suit her height mdash and her sweet tooth.Despite the production team swamping the Mailey family home in June to carry out the work, the show was only broadcast on Sunday morning.Cara found herself a star attraction at St Josephrsquos Primary School, in Carryduff on Monday.ldquoA lot of people have been telling me I saw you in the newspaper, I saw you on TV, giggled Cara.She has made great use of her den since then.ldquoI play in it most of the time, I sometimes do my homework there and bring in my friends to play or go in just get some sweets and bring them into the house, she told the Recorder.ldquoHaving the den makes me feel a lot happier and safer as usually I would be climbing up stuff to reach things but now I can pick them up and

never had anything like it when I was younger, she said. For Cara all of the toys or bikes for her age group are all too big or tall for her, so this is brilliant.Mrs Mailey said Cara came up with the idea of having a sweet-themed den after attending a birthday party at Aunt Sandrarsquos Candy Factory in Belfast last year.ldquoCara decided herself that she wanted to apply for the Dengineers and I honestly didnrsquot think she had any chance of getting it as there were over , applications from throughout the UK, said Trish.ldquoCara did a phone interview with the producers, then a Skype interview, then they came over to spend a day with her and it was all hush hush until we got the call to say she had got it.Her parents had to keep the news a secret until presenters Lauren Layfield and Joe Traconi surprised her with the news in May after she won bronze in the m sprint at the National Dwarf Games in Birmingham.Trish added: ldquoA team of four came over in June on a Monday as the den was created by designer Mara Tulip and the big reveal day on the Friday.

Despite their objections, the Housing Executive look set to apply for a vesting order.The main opposition came from disgruntled Shore Street residents who claim that, with the aid of rehabilitation grants, their homes could avoid the chop.Some  new dwellings are to be built, providing accommodation for nearly  people in a iety of house types, both two and single storey.The Housing Executive have guaranteed that any of the existing residents who want to move back to the site on which they are now living will be given first option on that house.This means that all the  families in the area at present will be accommodated in a new house on, or very close to, their present location.However, many residents were not convinced that the Housing Executiversquos plans were what was really required.Mr Marks, who owns a house in Shore Street, told officials that, at present, he has the luxury of a garage and garden at his home.ldquoIf the property is vested I will have nothing at all, he said. ldquoNo matter how well I am reimbursed there is still no way I can afford another house that would cost in the region of pound,.DOWNPATRICK mdash The headmaster of Down High School, Mr J E Buckley, has hit out at the ldquononsense talk surrounding many of todayrsquos educational problems and stressed that ldquobright ideas usually only help one pupil at the expense of another.In his annual report to the school, he warned that there can be no universal solution to educational problems because methods which are effective with one child may oe completely ineffective with another.Mr Buckley said that in Down High a ldquocautious attitude had been adopted towards new methods.NEWCASTLE mdash A unanimous decision to keep alive the efforts of Newcastle Town Committee was recorded at a specially reconvened public meeting last week.A resounding vote of confidence was passed by over  residents and local business people who attended the meeting at the Slieve Donard Hotel in response to an appeal by the committee.The future of the town committee was plunged into question at the annual meeting in September when only a handful of people bothered to attend.In a do or die effort it was decided to hold a further meeting to ascertain whether the people of Newcastle felt the need to maintain a town committee or not.Mr Bill Martin, past chairman, said the town committee had ben there driving force behind the upsurge in the development of the town and to let it die now would knock the resort back into the doldrums.Mrs Hugh Davey felt that there were far too many committees in Newcastle, all striving towards the same end.Mr Colman Hanna suggested the town committee could adopt the role of a co-ordinating group for all committees in the town.Councillor Norman Bicker was of the opinion that the committee should seek a new image. ldquoIt would appear that the town committee is trying to do too much and perhaps be more profitably engaged in organising only three or four events, he said.Many local business people at the meeting said they had no hesitation in financing the committeersquos efforts and would continue to support the activities in the future.BALLYNAHINCH mdash A  year-old Ballynahinch girl whose Christmas Eve turned to tragedy when she was injured in an accident was awarded pound, damages in the High Court.Veronica Lynn, of Windmill Gardens, was struck down by a car on her way to a dance and as a result she suffered severe head and leg injuries.The court also heard that after the accident she was unconscious for three weeks and could not speak for another month.CROSSGAR mdashBreadman Alec Holmes is looking forward to a well-deserved retirement at his Crossgar Road home.With an army gratuity payment of pound, le savings of pound and a pound loan, Alec bought over the bread delivery round of Carsons, a Belfast-based firm,  years ago.His route never changed over the years and each day he could be found doing the Crossgar, Shrigley, Killyleagh, Downpatrick, Dundrum, Annalong and Kilkeel run.Over the years Aled has seen tremendous changes in the bread business. ldquoBack in  a loaf of bread cost four old pence and soda bread sold at a penny, Alec said.ldquoMy first weekrsquos salary was the princely sum of pound and, believe me, I wasnrsquot doing too badly.

It is also impacting on residents being able to park outside their homes, particularly in the Irish Street, Fountain Street and Saul Street areas.Cllr Sharvin believes the combined voices of the business community and residents can see the charges reduced to their previous level to ldquosupport the economical sustainability of Downpatrick town centre.He is also encouraging people to complete the online survey or pick up a paper copy from the council offices at the Downshire Civic Centre.Cllr Sharvin confirmed he has also asked council officials to survey the condition of its three car parks in Downpatrick, suggesting the surface in Irish Street is ldquoparticularly poor.Downpatrick councillor, Dermot Curran, has also expressed concern about the impact of the increased charges and believes the increasing concern is exactly the kind of issue a tradersrsquo group in the town should be addressing.He added: ldquoThe town needs a thriving business organisation to help with its continued economic regeneration and to discuss issues like increased parking charges. Such a body would provide the business community with a much-needed voice on a range of important issues.The series of roadshows to discuss parking charges moved to The Lodge in Castlewellan and the Newcastle Centre last night and takes place next Tuesday, November , at Ballynahinchrsquos Market House between .pm and .pm, before later moving to The Hub in Saintfield between pm and pm..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Symbolic lantern walk rekindles time WWI ended  ","story":"A SPECIALLY designed beacon was lit in Killyleagh on Sunday night to mark the th anniversary of the end of the First World War.Local man Martin lsquoTinarsquo Charters, , one of Northern Irelandrsquos last survivors from the Second World War, lit the gas beacon of light at the front of Killyleagh Castle to mark the moment the guns finally fell silent.Mr Charters was accompanied by two local schoolchildren, Zac Gordon, from St Maryrsquos Primary School, Killyleagh, and Louise Craig, of Killyleagh Integrated Primary School.The cross-community event was attended by more than  people at the end of Remembrance Sunday.The eveningrsquos events began with a lantern walk from Shrigley to Killyleagh.

It has also argued that the current application represents the ldquobest value for money.ldquoThe RNLI applies the highest standards and practices to all its applications for its facilities. The site chosen, from what was available, is the one that represents the best location and value for money for the Institution.That assertion is one that has been challenged by the LEYC who has said in its letter to members: ldquoWe also believe that the cost of the new site will be considerably more expensive overall with higher ongoing maintenance and cost and therefore a waste of donations.The LEYC also claim that the RNLI have changed their mind over the site of its proposed new station: ldquoWhen we originally discussed the proposed site with the RNLI they told us that they preferred to build as part of a bigger development as originally it was submitted as part of a bigger development plan. They later changed this to saying that the newer site would give them more visibility and potential footfall despite it being obvious that the original site was much more public facing.The LEYC also asserts that the original site it refers to would not require as much dredging as what is being proposed by the RNLI. In its letter however the LEYC stated that ldquowe are supporters of the RNLI and any objection we have is only to the proposed siting of the boathouse and should not be interpreted as any fallout with the local volunteers who we respect and support.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

North Antrim MLA Mr Allister has been equally critical of business leaders for backing the accord, and yesterday warned that the backstop,triggered, would destroy NI’s economy.He said: “With £.bn of goods flowing annually from GB to NI, why do our business leaders think it is better to prioritise the £bn which comes from the ROI and ensure for them frictionless entry at the price of a regulatory border for the far greater volume that comes from GB “The attempted answer that the Brexit deal gives us the best of both worlds is a lie, because it only allows frictionless trade to GB, but not from GB. “Yet, such trade is vital to our supply chain and is what fills our supermarket shelves and for farmers what supplies most of our feedstuff ingredients, fuel and fertilisers. “Thus the rush to embrace a crippling Irish Sea border is as absurd as it is destructive of our economy.” Mr Allister accused those who support the deal of “failing to appreciate” the long-term implications of legally making Northern Ireland, alone within the UK, part of the EU customs territory.He added: “This is a staggering dereliction of duty by business leaders, aided by a ‘look the other way’ approach by most business journalists who have abandoned all objectivity to clamber on board the anti-Brexit bandwagon.“It will be too late for business to waken up when we are a semi-detached part of our all important UK single market and the free flow of goods is impeded to NI from GB and EU tarfs strangle our imports.”REACTION: Bombardier in Belfast to cut  jobs Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch     .               ..

Our new security provider, Wilson James, took over this contact on  November and have an ongoing recruitment drive with  vacancies currently available at enhanced rates of pay. “We are working hard behind the scenes to try to resolve these issues as quickly as possible but the recruitment, training and security clearance of staff will take time to implement. “We would ask all our passengers to arrive two hours before their flight and fully prepared for the security search process as this will speed up processing times for everyone.”A spokesperson for Wilson James said: “Wilson James took over the security contract at Belfast International Airport on  November .“Wilson James inherited a staffing shortage from the previous provider which has continued to impact the service delivery. However, we are pleased to confirm that the recruitment process for  employees is already under way and candidates are moving through a rigorous security vetting process to ensure that aviation security standards are maintained.“To complement our recruitment strategy, we are also pleased to confirm that last week we agreed an improved pay deal which will raise pay rates across the whole the security contract. “We are confident that this priority on our employees will deliver a higher calibre of service and provide passengers a more seamless journey through the airport.

ICTS said it had provided an “excellent service” and claimed the inadequate service provided to customers over the summer months was beyond its control.Meanwhile, George Best Belfast City Airport, which has officially opened upgraded terminal facilities following a £ million infrastructure investment, says its new security search area has reduced average queuing times to just six minutes.• See Morning View in tomorrow’s News Lettertry catch     .               ..

The veteran hooker was joined at the palace by his parents, who have both been decorated with MBEs, as he received his honour from the Prince of Wales.On Saturday, Best captained Ireland in their hard-fought - win over New Zealand at Dublin’s Aviva Stadium – widely regarded as one of Ireland’s greatest results of all time.The euphoria had barely died down before the Craigavon-born British and Irish Lion was back in the limelight for what he has described as his greatest inidual accolade to date. “You play rugby because you love it and then all of a sudden you get these awards, but I think of all the inidual awards I’ve received in my career this is certainly the highest,” he said.Best’s father John was previously honoured with a MBE for services to agriculture, while his mother Patricia was also recognised with an MBE for services to the public sector.Best said:“I suppose they can’t really believe it. When I first told my family they were shocked but absolutely delighted – it means a lot to our family, especially with mum and dad having received MBEs.“It’s a lovely family celebration.”In more than  years of trying the Irish beat the All Blacks for the first time, also under Best’s captaincy, in Chicago in November .In a glittering career he has made  appearances for Ulster, been capped  times by Ireland and won four Six Nations titles – including two grand slams.Speaking following the announcement of his OBE award in June this year, Best said: “To be recognised for contributing to a sport, for someone to feel I’m worthy of being nominated, and then to be deemed worthy, it’s quite incredible.“My parents were obviously delighted. My mum and dad actually both have MBEs...so it was quite funny telling them I’d gone one better than them.” Best became the first Ulster player to reach  caps for Ireland when he helped the men in green overcome Australia - in Dublin in November .REACTION: Bombardier in Belfast to cut  jobs Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"At the same investiture ceremony, actor Hugh Laurie was awarded a CBE for services to drama.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community.

Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Plans have now been submitted to construct the homes close to Sprucefield, outside Lisburn. It would also involve a new link road on the M motorway. An initial pre-application notice was issued for the scheme last year, but now the developer behind the scheme – Neptune Carleton – has submitted an outline planning application for the ambitious project. If the plans, which could include , homes on the large site at Blaris, get the go-ahead, it would be one of the largest residential property developments to be built in Northern Ireland in recent years. Elsewhere, this week a major £m housing development in Larne was awarded outline planning permission. Nuport Developments has been given the early go-ahead for  houses on the -acre site at Ballyboley in the town.

Since Wednesday evening, several cabinet members have resigned, opposed to what they see is a softening of Theresa May’s position on leaving the EU. Essentially, for Northern Ireland’s business community in particular, it would remain part of the same customs territory as the rest of the UK and the entire area would be subject to \"level playing field\" commitments requiring the UK to follow EU rules in areas like animal welfare, environmental and workplace protections. Northern Ireland would be in a deeper customs relationship with the EU than where in the UK, and more closely tied to EU market rules. But what do Northern Ireland business groups think   Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium “While it will take some time to go through the  plus pages of the agreement, on the face of it this document provides some reassurance to our industry and the NI consumer. “It provides solutions to customs, tarfs, an innovative solution on VAT, support for the Peace Process and a possible longer transition period. There certainly is some work to be done by both the Westminster Government and  the EU on the checks and administration for goods coming in to Northern Ireland from GB. “That will need to be light touch and be mitigated in further agreements, hopefully to an absolute bare minimum. However this agreement must pass through Parliament. We have always said the backstop is better than no deal.”   Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI director-general “After  months of debate, this agreement by Cabinet is progress. It moves the UK one step away from the nightmare precipice of no deal and the harm it would cause to communities across the country. Securing a transition period has long been firms’ top priority and every day that passes without one means lost investment and jobs, hitting the most vulnerable hardest. “Time is now up. This deal is a compromise, including for business, but it offers that essential transitional period as a step back from the clf-edge. \"More clarity on the final relationship is needed, and uncertainty remains high, but this is an important step forward. “Transition and the backstop are not the intended permanent solutions for either side, but should pave the way for more work on the future deal. This must secure frictionless trade, ambitious access for our world-beating services, and a say over future rules. “The UK has had many months of discussion and ision. A long journey still lies ahead but now is the time for decisions. And the first decision is to avoid no deal.”  Retail NI chief executive, Glyn Roberts and Hospitality Ulster, Colin Neill  “This is a complex and detailed document which needs considerable analysis and further clarication from the UK Government. “We will be consulting our respective memberships on this document and we will set out in greater detail our views when we have completed this process. “Both our organisations have always sought a deal that ensures no delays in the supply chain, which promotes bridges rather than borders and above all , ensures that Northern Ireland businesses have full and free access to the EU and UK single markets. “Retail and Hospitality are two of Northern Ireland’s leading sectors of industry and our voice needs to be heard as this draft deal moves toward a vote in the House of Commons”  Michael Hall, managing partner, EY Northern Ireland “Business will clearly welcome last night’s announcement in that there is now better clarity on the terms of a deal however many will also be reluctant to put contingency plans on hold until there is a stronger signal on whether this will hold politically in the UK and Europe. “The backstop guarantee is a positive development for NI firms operating on an all-island basis, not least the restatement that both sides intend to work towards a free trade agreement longer term, which should not be overlooked. “The scale of political uncertainty and the volatility which this creates can be seen in the signicant currency fluctuations we have witnessed in the past  hours. Firms should not take this lightly and as such, factor these continued unknowns into their scenario planning. “On the positive side, Northern Ireland businesses have continued to expand and employ more people in the period since the Brexit referendum, which we remain hopeful they will continue to do as we look towards a further period of uncertainty. “By focusing on business fundamentals and contingency planning, firms will arm themselves so that they are ready to act when the road ahead becomes clearer.”  FSB NI policy chairman, Tina McKenzie “Businesses have been calling for months for agreement to be reached between the UK and EU negotiators, so it can only be welcome that a text has been agreed and approved by the Cabinet. “We are acutely aware of the political machinations which are ongoing, however it must be remembered that without an agreed withdrawal agreement, the UK will crash out in March , without a transition period, nor agreement on citizens’ rights, nor any plan to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. “While the exact nature of the backstop is being robustly debated, it must be remembered that the backstop will only take effectthe future relationship fails to deliver a frictionless border, after December . “We believe that the Withdrawal Agreement is a signicant step back from the clf edge which would result in a chaotic no deal Brexit that would be deeply damaging and dangerous for our small firms. “We would encourage all political actors to keep this in mind as we move forward.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/shore_1.jpg","title":"alternative london the place to be seen in the city","story":"Posted on Monday  November  by Ulster Business From London’s thriving bohemian hub and street art capital to a food, drink and nightle must-visit... John Mulgrew explores Shoreditch and beyond Once just the purview of the artistic and trendsetting, Shoreditch has fast become a location worthy of a trip in itself when visiting London.Nestled in the East End of the city, Shoreditch offers up a buzzing cultural environment, lots of independent places to eat and drink, and boasts one of the city’s best markets. Now, those in the north west always feel a little hard done by when it comes to connectivity outside Northern Ireland.In this case though, Flybmi now connects City of Derry Airport regularly with London Stansted. From there, it’s a regular train into Liverpool Street station, and then onwards using the tube or bus across the city.Andyou’re visiting Shoreditch, it’s hard to miss Boxpark. Sitting close to the tube station, it’s an array of black-clad shipping containers, with a host of retailers and places to eat. A bite at posh chip shop Poptata helps fuel the day.Journalists often prefer the freedom to explore a city at their own pace – picking up things along the way, without being ferried from place-to-place. But a food-focused tour from Alternative London brought out areas that might have otherwise been missed.Shoreditch is famous for the sheer volume of graffiti and art strewn around the area, but getting an insider’s view on the changes taking place in the area – including paid-for advertising now adorning some of the spaces reserved for artists from the area, or a Banksy – really helps take in as much as possible.Christiaan Nagel’s mushrooms, which can be found in several roof-top locations, led us to teashop T, taking in a salt-beef bagel at Beigel Bake on Brick Lane, followed by the modern, family-run self-styled home-style Indian restaurant, Gunpowder. The aloo chaat is a signature, with punch, depth and zing, while an almost unavoidable venison and vermicelli ‘doughnut’ is worth the visit alone.A brief half in the grade II listed Ten Bells, which has links to Jack the Ripper, was followed by a familiar trip to Old Spitalfields Market. It has a dense, tight offering of top-end food stalls, from Asian steamed buns at Yum Bun, to Portuguese custard tarts and fruit tea at Yi Fang.An unmissable food destination sits across from the market. St John Bread and Wine is one of Fergus Henderson’s London outlets. It’s a casual, laid back and sparse affair, which allows you to same some of the best British cooking available. You can stop by for a very reasonably priced, and one of the restaurant’s signature dishes, such as Welsh Rarebit, devilled kidneys on toast or, my choice on this visit, blood cake and egg. Think richer, chunkier black pudding, crispened in a pan with a rich-orange hued yolk. There are plenty of spots to socialise in and around Shoreditch, with some of London’s better beer bars included. The Craft Beer Co has a location on Old Street, while there’s a Brewdog and the Draft House, hidden in the Bower development.Arriving back to the hotel in the evening, don’t expect dull or leless environment at the Hoxton. The downstairs is thriving during the day, with the usual spectrum of aluminium-clad Apple Macs, but at night, especially at the weekend, it’s very much a nightspot in the area.Butyou’re after a decent night’s sleep, there’s very little sound making its way to the bedrooms from the ground-floor buzz.Leaving the hip surroundings of Shoreditch, and heading to the rather more touristy affair of Leicester Square, the Hotel Indigo is offers a grand view of the London skyline.The new rooftop bar is a superb vantage point to overlook the square, and pick out the city’s most famous structures. Then there’s the National Portrait Gallery – which sits just a short distance away from the Hotel Indigo.During the trip there was a Michael Jackson ‘On the Wall’ exhibition – one for Jackson fans, certainly – but the gallery itself, which is free, is worth a visit for everyone . It also hosts a ‘Friday Lates’ event – opening into the night, and with a small pop-up bar for visitors.Not far away, the Japan Centre offers up a myriad of everything the country has to offer in regards to food and drink in particular – from freshly made miso, to a ied and wide-selection of sake, it’s a stop worth making for anyone keen on trying to replicate the flavours they’ve had while visiting the country.Meanwhile, Shoryu Ramen – located very close to base camp at the Hoxton – offers some of the best casual noodles in the city. Starting off with cleanly flavoured salmon sashimi, followed by the garlic kick of the Dracula Tonkotsu – a heady allium-rich version of their -hour pork broth.For those in and around what is one of the city’s most tourist-heavy locations, Granaio is a reasonably recent addition.It’s a fairly familiar format – Italian classics and a wide-ranging menu, which will keep the majority of visitors content, at a reasonable price, considering the location. A beef tartare was solid, and a ribeye cooked correctly on the inside, despite a lack of charring on the outside.The theatre obviously plays a large part in the attraction to London, but the Immersive Gatsy experience turns a chunk of a Long Lane building into an interactive re-telling of F Scott Fitzgerald’s the Great Gatsby. It’s dferent, but impressively choreographed, and something alternative to spending a huge wad of cash on a West End show.A crisp sunny day before heading back on the train to Stansted offered a chance to try Hawksmoor. The steak restaurant now has nine locations in the UK, and focuses on dry-aged beef and all that comes with it.A Sunday lunch of rich, pink rump of beef comes with a Yorkshire pudding, stunningly crunchy roasties and a roasted bulb of garlic, and shallot – leaving them soft and packed full of umami.

Here Emma Deighan scours some of the top NI venues to see how they are catering to the corporate Christmas Arguably the most anticipated social event in the work diary, the Christmas ‘do’ has evolved over the years.And many of Northern Ireland’s top hosts agree and have widened their offering in response.Event managers and venue owners say everything from the format of the Christmas party to its timing have changed to accommodate the demands of employees today. How, when and where we celebrate are top priorities.Take the evening do, for example. For many, that age-old three-course setup doesn’t cut the convenience factor, prompting my employers end the work day early to take advantage of lunch dates. It’s a favourable move that delivers on two fronts – it offers time-poor workers the relief of a shorter day but doesn’t infringe on family obligations.Owner of Bishop’s Gate Hotel in Derry and former president of the Northern Ireland Hotel’s Federation, Ciaran O’Neill agrees. “Christmas has changed over the last number of years for our industry with more businesses looking for lunches, as opposed to the traditional party nights of old,” he said. “We do still have ‘big nights’, but these tend to occur on Fridays and Saturdays.”Ciaran says he has also noted an increase in smaller party sizes over the years.“We are seeing less private large events and more small groups dining with us. Employees are arranging ‘get togethers’ with colleagues or teams that they work directly with.”Bishop’s Gate, which has become Derry’s hospitality jewel attracting the AA Hotel of the Year- accolade, among many other awards, pairs an historic setting with parties for Christmas.The Bullitt Hotel in Belfast is setting the scene for the experience-savvy hipster workforce – and this Christmas Bullitt’s ‘experiences’ reflect the discernment of its guests.General manager at Bullitt, Michael Sullivan has seen a spike in ‘experience’ events, upgrading the turkey feast to a cooler, more casual event.“We have had a number of enquiries for informal gatherings in our Good Room event space, with a festive lunch to follow. The Good Room is the perfect space to blur the lines between work and play for intimate company get togethers ahead of a more traditional Christmas do,” he said.“We’ve also had enquiries for private gin and whiskey tastings and can also organise a number of unique events and team-building activities for groups, from candle-making to chunky knitting workshops for a truly memorable Christmas party.”This December Bullitt has a range of packages to suit private and shared s – from sit-down meals in its restaurant Taylor and Clay to VIP packages in its Baltic Bar or secluded enclaves above in Babel – its rooftop bar. And its ‘Tipsy Tea’ is geared towards the day-time revellers. Prices range from £. to £. a head.“Bullitt has brought something new and exciting to the traditional Christmas party market, with a range of novel spaces set within cool, contemporary surroundings. We like to think that we’re helping to shake up the scene somewhat by offering something a little dferent,” Michael said.If you want to push the boat out with your corporate squad, Titanic Belfast is ready for boarding. Its play on Belfast’s shipbuilding heritage and the fateful Titanic is always a crowd pleaser. Laura Cowan, head of sales at Titanic Belfast said: “We host bespoke private Christmas party nights, which are tailored to our clients’ needs across all of the Titanic venues – Titanic Belfast , SS Nomadic and the Titanic Exhibition Centre. “These can range from private dining, iconic tailored experiences, drinks receptions and gala dinners. We also host our traditional Christmas party nights – featuring a Christmas cocktail reception on arrival followed by a delicious four course banquet and live entertainment.”For sheer luxury, the more refined office workers take to the Cathedral Quarter in Belfast to sample the Merchant’s opulent offering.And Clare Mullin, meetings and events manager there, said the hotel’s renowned afternoon teas are bucking the turkey dinner trend but are every bit as fancul. “Over the years we have seen an increased demand for Christmas parties and festive events that offer something a little dferent, memorable or exciting. People increasingly seem to be looking for something out of the ordinary.“We have seen a trend for corporate bookings where companies are looking for alternatives to a traditional evening dinner. For example, our Festive Afternoon Tea is very popular – especially the Champagne iety. Festive drinks in our famous Cocktail Bar continue to be a popular option for the corporate market too, with bespoke offerings such as our Redbreast whiskey flight extremely popular. gtClient lunches in The Cloth Ear and Berts Jazz Bar are also growing in popularity.”Casual begins in its neighbouring Cloth Ear from £. a person, retro at Berts Jazz Bar will cost you £. for lunch or £ for dinner.For private s The Roof Garden Alpine Lodge at the Merchant can cater to  and for the more luxurious three-courses will be served in the Rita Duffy Suite for £ a person.The newly revamped and extended Ten Square is another setup that combines afternoon tea with tradition.Swapping caffeine for mulled wine and pastries for mince pies, Ten Square’s Loft, located on its top floor and flaunting some pretty impressive city centre views, plays the backdrop to this year’s festive afternoon teas at £ a head, from pm to pm.It also offers more familiar packages in its Linen Hall suite where tradition mingles with s DJs to live bands.And for those who really want to go that extra mile, Belfast’s newest Hastings sibling is ready and waiting.The Grand Central Hotel on Bedford Street boasts unrivalled views from sky-high Observatory, where afternoon tea takes on a Christmas theme or tradition can be celebrated at its Seahorse Restaurant and ground floor Grand Cafe.
