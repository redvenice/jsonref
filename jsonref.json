Among other things, they discussed what to do when news of the relationship became public – and Harry advised Mr Markle to avoid the paparazzi at all costs.Mr Markle recalled: ‘Harry told me that I should never go to the press. That it would end in tears. He said, “They will eat you alive.” He was right.’    Prince Harry (pictured) called Mr Markle to ask if he had co-operated for shots which showed him, among other things, supposedly being fitted for a wedding suitInstead of taking Harry’s advice, Mr Markle made a secret arrangement to pose for a series of pictures – a decision he now bitterly regrets. The photos made £100,000 for the photographer and a smaller amount for Mr Markle.On Friday, May 11, the MoS informed Kensington Palace of the revelations we were to publish two days later after we discovered CCTV footage of Mr Markle collaborating with the photographer.Harry called Mr Markle to ask if he had co-operated for shots which showed him, among other things, supposedly being fitted for a wedding suit.At this point, Mr Markle admits, he lied to the Prince.After our story appeared, Harry and Meghan called Mr Markle again, though by then he was in hospital recovering from a heart attack. Mr Markle said the Prince told him: ‘If you had listened to me this would never have happened’.Mr Markle said he told Harry: ‘Maybe it would be better for you guys if I was dead… then you could pretend to be sad.’‘Then I hung up.’In hindsight, he admits Harry was ‘absolutely right’ to criticise him. Yet it was Meghan who dealt perhaps the most painful blow when she told her father he would not be allowed to make a speech at the wedding. ‘That hurt,’ he said.Mr Markle added: ‘I’m not mad at Harry. I’m not mad at Meghan. I love them. I wish them well. But as for the rest of it, f*** it. I’m done.’Kensington Palace declined to comment last night.           Prince Harry and Meghan Markle after their wedding at St George\u0027s Chapel on May 19"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/10/14/4EF7FE1200000578-0-image-m-25_1533906561537.jpg","title":"I breathe Im itchy properly Liz Jones describes week wearing burka","story":"    Liz Jones was challenged with spending an entire week wearing a full burkaI remember during my week catching sight of my reflection in a shop window in Knightsbridge. Instead of seeing me, I saw a woman who was hunched and shuffling. A dark, depressed alien. A smudge. A nothing.I’ve long felt antagonistic towards women who wear the burka. I would see a woman on the streets of London, a black crow at the side of a husband or male relative, and I’d roll my eyes and tut loudly. I put the rights of women and girls to dress as they please before the rights of people of any particular faith. How dare you demean yourself in this way, I would think as I walked past. You insult every woman who died fighting for your rights and your freedom.The burka has its origins in the Middle East before Islam, when men and women covered their faces to keep out sand. In Afghanistan, the burka is known as the chadri it has a thick grill over the mouth and eyes, and is the one I chose to wear. The chadri only became a common sight when the Taliban came to power, banning women from wearing cosmetics, and shoes with a heel: the noise of a heel on pavement was said to be too arousing for men to cope with.I remember in Kabul meeting former TV newsreaders, businesswomen, who once wore Manolos and lipstick, forced to cover up. They were cowed, mere shadows of their former selves, now unemployed, able only to sit at home.\u0027We have a thing called freedom of speech in this country\u0027:...Furious Tory MP accuses No10 of launching a ‘witch hunt’...Share this articleDuring my week in the shadows, I soon found out why: there is no way a woman can work in one. Each time I had to go to meet or interview someone, I had to take the headpiece off. I couldn’t even see to type. Most importantly, I couldn’t think straight.That first day, I was afraid to put it on. When I did pluck up courage, I felt suffocated, as though forced to live inside a dark tent. I got in my car to go to the station and realised there was no way I could drive safely with my eyes blinkered like a racehorse. Already deaf, the fabric snuffed out any residual sound.On the walk to the station I could hardly breathe. My shroud made me itch all over, and my eyelashes kept banging against the cloth. A friend recently came back from a spell working in Qatar and said that whenever he drove he had to keep swerving to avoid running over the flocks of women who stumble on to roads. ‘They are like children. They have to be guided by men. None of them speak. It’s like the Middle Ages.’I felt scared, vulnerable.I walked to the kiosk to buy coffee. ‘Mumble mumble,’ I said to the young man serving. To his credit – the station is in a rural area, so I’m sure this was the first time he had encountered a full veil – he didn’t bat an eye, and smiled. I pointed. I automatically lifted the cup to my lips. Ah. How was I going to do this? I tried to work the cup up the inside of the cloth, performing an elaborate jig on the platform, but got stuck halfway.Later that day, at a coffee shop in Fulham, I sat outside at a table, faced with a sandwich and a latte. As I weighed up my hunger, an Arabic man shouted abuse at the white, male photographer sent to chronicle my day. I have no idea what he was saying – perhaps I shouldn’t have been eating in public – but the interesting point is that during the entire experiment, he was the only person who gave me any abuse.    Women wearing a burka, clothing that covers their entire bodies shopping at a bazaarThe only time I became furious at my treatment was when, for a domestic flight, I swanned through security unmolested, when normally I’m made to remove jacket and shoes. This smacked of PC pandering. I was heartened, though, that throughout my week I was only ever met with helping hands.Getting into a cab in London I was still called ‘darlin’ by the driver. Getting out of said cab, a passing decorator opened the door and grabbed my shopping – a burka makes you clumsy, slow, helpless I spent most of the week feeling like a disabled person.In fact, the only curious glances I attracted were from small children and my border collies, who started barking like maniacs.One day, I had lunch with a friend in Primrose Hill. She walked past my table three times. I waggled my Prada bag, which I thought she might recognise.‘How fantastic,’ she said when at last she realised it was me. ‘You don’t have to bother to put on make-up or wash your hair. How much spare time you must have!’ This was a common response from my much-groomed, often scantily-clad female friends.I admit, too, this rather jokey response had, as someone who never leaves the house without having had my roots retouched, crossed my mind. Aren’t we in the West equally imprisoned by the pressure to be perfect?But having worn my burka (it’s still upstairs in a box, like the ashes of a dead pet), I find that attitude naive. Telling women to cast it off, making a joke of how they appear, is disrespectful of those who are forced to wear what amounts to a mobile prison for fear of being beaten, or worse.You become not just not female, you become inhuman. All through my week I’d worn scent, something I never normally do, so compelling was the feeling I had to be feminine in some small way.I was supposed, during my sentence in purdah, to wear trainers so as not to expose ‘toe cleavage’, but I got so hot I resorted to flip flops: the steam had to escape somehow.          The burka has its origins in the Middle East before Islam, when men and women covered their faces to keep out sandThe second most common response from Western women was that, thank goodness, at least men won’t leer. Well, this isn’t a problem I face daily. Yes, of course it’s helpful not to walk along dark alleys in a miniskirt and boob tube, but let’s not forget the extremely high incidence of rape in countries where the burka is prevalent. Extreme modesty does not breed safety.The ridiculous claim the burka protects women from male harassment was wheeled out yet again on Woman’s Hour. A British Muslim woman defended her ‘choice’ because not only did it bring her ‘closer to God’ but because ‘before I used to get men asking for my number, can they have dinner with me’.I’ve no idea what she looks like but to evoke that response she must be up there with Ava Gardner. She went on: ‘I’m not going to stop because people are ignorant. I have had so much abuse on the train.’Well, she has obviously never travelled with First Great Western. On my trips back and forth I found both passengers and staff courteous. At one point, after a particularly hot day in Regent’s Park, trying to lick a 99, I wobbled to the buffet car and mumbled for a G\u0026ampT. ‘Would you like ice with that?’ the young lady asked, deadpan.Rather than being the brunt of abuse, I felt that by wearing a veil I was the one being rude. I had to keep tucking my hair back, like Audrey Hepburn as she disappeared forever, married to Christ in The Nun’s Story, and started to wonder: what is so disgusting about the female form that it has to be hidden?On yet another perfect summer’s day in Hyde Park during my week covered up, I saw a crocodile of schoolchildren, aged maybe nine or ten. Several of the girls were in headscarves: only the small moon of their faces exposed. For the first time I knew how they were feeling: different. Hot. How about, too, marginalised, objectified, kept fresh only for the eyes of their male relatives?After just a few days, what I mostly felt was exhausted. I asked a young Muslim woman who lives Bristol how on earth she coped and she answered: ‘You just have to get used to it.’ I’d rather not, thanks very much. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/11/17/4F03D46D00000578-6046661-image-m-6_1534006378293.jpg","title":"Brian unlikely follower Queen Victorias official photographer unveils new book","story":"    One of two images of Queen Victoria, previously unseen until published in Brian May and Professor Roger Taylor’s book, George Washington Wilson          May said the \u0027resulting 3D images proved immensely successful and established Wilson’s national reputation as a pre-eminent photographerThe new book will display the incredibly rare and expensive pictures which May had to design and manufacture modern versions of in plastic to include them. He described the book as a \u0027labour of love\u0027, a tribute both to the photographer and the text by his mentor Roger Taylor, an expert on Victorian photography and Wilson\u0027s work. EXCLUSIVE: Freddie Mercury drinking wine in a New York limo,...How I built the guitar that rocked The Queen (with a LOT of...Share this article‘For me, the realisation of this book is a double labour of love.

The people that knew him said he was a nice guy.’ Christenson said he was sitting on his deck Friday night at his Tacoma home with his wife, his cousin and his cousin\u0027s wife when he saw the Horizon Q400 fly over his house. ‘All of a sudden one of the Horizon Q400s came over the house at 500 feet, followed by two F-15s one was high, one was low,’ Christenson said, adding that he knew something was wrong because the plane was flying way too low.The former supervisor said he grabbed a pair of binoculars to watch the aircraft, admitting that he was \u0027scared\u0027 and \u0027concerned\u0027 because he didn\u0027t know what was going on. ‘He was doing a lot of weird flying, weird turns,\u0027 he said, \u0027but he was coming back towards us, towards our way.\u0027 Christenson said while the plane was over the water it did a 360 degree roll \u0027and went into a steep e\u0027. ‘He brought the one wing up and the whole airplane rolled and as it rolled it went into a e. It looked control,’ he said, adding that the plane pulled up with less than 50 feet between the nose of the aircraft and the water. Christenson said two minutes later there was ‘big plume of black smoke’, indicating the plane had crashed.During a press conference on Saturday, officials said they did not believe Russell had a pilot license. Christenson said because of the complicated rolls and es he was doing, Russell may have had some type of experience.          Two F-15 fighter jets scrambled from Portland \u0027minutes later\u0027 to intercept it, according to Pierce County Sheriff\u0027s Office.

Lord Carey said ‘oppressive’ veils should not become ‘normalised’.Their comments represent the most powerful intervention to date by senior clerics on the issue. They are likely to add to the fierce debate sparked last week when former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson wrote a newspaper article on why he opposed a ban on veils in public but compared women in burkas to ‘letter boxes’ and ‘bank robbers’.Eye-Sis? Covered from head to toe (except for her amazing...Killer who shot dead a policeman and soldier and tried to...Share this articleHis comments have prompted an investigation by the Conservative Party.Bishop Nazir-Ali told The Mail on Sunday: ‘We have all seen how even male terrorists have escaped arrest by donning a burka and making an effective getaway.‘For reasons of national security, there will be places like Parliament or Whitehall or town halls and council chambers where the burka should not be allowed.’He said institutions including universities and schools were justified in wanting to know the identities of visitors or those who worked or studied there.Staff at airports and courts also needed to see people’s faces.Perhaps more controversially, he added: ‘Many professions require personal interaction with the client. In business, both the trader and the customer should be able to see one another’s face and to interpret expressions if the transaction is to be mutually beneficial. This is even more true of doctors, dentists, nurses and paramedics.’          The bishop said burkas and niqabs should be outlawed in a wide range of situations where people interact, including in hospitals, GP surgeries, universities and schools. Stock imageWarning of the threat posed by the wearing of veils, he said: ‘It is true that some women choose to wear the burka or niqab because they feel it makes them more observant Muslims…‘It is also true, however, that the burka or niqab is being weaponised by Islamists to impose what they consider to be “Islamic” character on communities, neighbourhoods and even nations.‘In Britain, this has serious implications for the freedom of women, but it also has implications for integration and social cohesion. Where there is widespread use of the face veil, there will be greater isolation from one another and a sense of segregation will grow.’Lord Carey, Archbishop of Canterbury between 1991 and 2002, said he ‘strongly supported’ the position taken by Bishop Nazir-Ali.He said: ‘We need to be able to identify people in government buildings, transport centres and tourist attractions, to take three examples.

My own experience with him on the radio has been that he makes controversial comments to elicit controversial responses! This makes for good radio but it can offend this or that person or section of the population.We shouldn’t be too alarmed by this because freedom of expression necessarily involves the possibility of giving offence, as long as there is no threat to the safety of an inidual or community or of discrimination against them.The furore, however, about his language regarding the appearance of those wearing the burqa or niqab, has meant that many have missed his extremely relaxed attitude to the actual wearing of these garments in public situations.The only restrictions he seems to countenance have to do with private preferences or rules in schools or offices.Like him,I am not in favour of an absolute ban on the burqa but unlike him, I am in favour of a qualified ban on wearing the burqa or niqab in a wide range of situations.I am not for a total ban because that would violate the freedom of people to dress as they choose when they are at home, with friends or at their place of worship.There are many reasons, however, for restricting the wearing of these garments in a number of important areas of our common life.    Former British Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs Boris Johnson sparked controversy recently with his comments about burkasI come myself from both a Muslim and Christian family background and have lived and worked in Muslim majority communities.I have had beloved aunts who, at first, wore the burqa and then abandoned it because it was incompatible with their work as schoolteachers.I have seen also how increasingly ‘ modest’ dress, whether the burqa, on the frontier between Pakistan and Afghanistan, the niqab in Egypt or the chador in Iran, is being imposed on women in the name of religion, custom or culture.We cannot assume that such compulsion is not taking place in this country!We have all seen how even male terrorists have escaped arrest by donning a burqa and making an effective getaway.For reasons of national security, there will be places like Parliament or Whitehall or town halls and council chambers where the burqa should not be allowed.Government and local authority buildings, as well as institutions like universities and schools, will want to know the identities of those who come to visit, work or study, not only at the point of entry but throughout the day.There needs to be legislative and regulatory backing for such bodies to be able to ban the burqa and the niqab on their premises.Immigration and border control is another area where a ban is required.This is, of course, to determine the identity of those entering or leaving the country but it is also necessary to maintain adequate security in and around our ports and airports.Those responsible for our security need to able to tell, by people’s behaviour in public places, including facial expressions, whether they are a danger to others.The courts have ruled already that a face veil must be removed at the time of testifying but this is not enough.Judge, jurors and counsel will also want to observe the facial expressions, of those involved in a trial, at other stages, when different people are testifying or when counsel for the defence or prosecution are arguing their case.          Some choose to wear the burqa  because they feel it makes them more observant MuslimsMany professions require personal interaction with the client.In business, both the trader and the customer should be able to see one another’s face and to interpret expressions, if the transaction is to be mutually beneficial.This is even more true of doctors, dentists, nurses and paramedics.They need to know, from facial expression, how a patient is feeling, if they are in pain and whether pain has been relieved through treatment.Those engaged in therapeutic counselling and in social work, similarly, have to be able to tell, by observing the face, the extent of a person’s distress or well being.Both Boris Johnson and Jack Straw have declared that they would refuse to see someone from their constituency if they were wearing a face veil because that would make a real conversation very difficult. Such a difficulty extends to those working in job and advice centres and in any number of community and family projects.I have seen women driving in some countries with a niqab or other voluminous covering.How they do so safely is a mystery to me! Public safety on roads means that those wearing burqa, niqab or other full head covering, which obscures all round vision, should not be allowed to operate vehicles where they pose a danger to the public.This must also be true of operating certain kinds of machinery at the work place or of working in difficult terrain or challenging weather conditions.Again, the Police, The DVSA and employers will need legislative sanction if they are to enforce such bans.It is true that some women choose to wear the burqa or niqab because they feel it makes them more observant Muslims although there doesn’t seem to be anything in the Qur’an or in Islamic law that requires this.It is also true, however, that the burqa or niqab is being weaponised by Islamists to impose what they consider to be ‘ Islamic’ character on communities, neighbourhoods and even nations.Culture and custom can also be appealed to in persuading women to take the face veil.In Britain, this has serious implications for the freedom of women but it also has implications for integration and social cohesion.Where there is widespread use of the face veil, there will be greater isolation from one another and a sense of segregation will grow.          Young Saudis, including three women wearing the traditional niqab and black abayas, relax on the Corniche waterfront in Jeddah, Saudi ArabiaWhile Islamists have succeeded in introducing or re-introducing the veil in a number of countries, other countries, like Egypt, are resisting this trend.The highest Islamic authorities there have banned it in educational institutions and Parliament is considering legislation to ban it altogether.What is happening there has certainly influenced the European debate and we also need to learn from Egypt and other countries about the social and health consequences of observing strict purdah or the seclusion of women, including the wearing of face veils.Boris Johnson claims that banning the burqa would result in a general crackdown on wearing any religious symbols in public.The Scottish Conservative leader, Ruth Davidson, has said, similarly, that banning the burqa is like banning Christians from wearing the crucifix.Neither of these claims bear examination.A crucifix, or similar religious symbol, does not conceal anyone’s identity or expression nor can it be used to conceal a weapon which could be a danger to the public.When are we going to stop always seeking equivalences between Christianity and other religious beliefs?Christianity has given us our civilisation, our values and the dignity and freedom of the person.Let us celebrate that instead of always dragging it down to the lowest common denominator!We need then both to uphold personal freedom and regulation for the sake of the public good.For weighty reasons of security, safety on our roads, control of our borders and professional conduct, the wearing of full face veils can be and should be restricted in our society. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/11/09/4F02286300000578-0-image-m-23_1533977087510.jpg","title":"Thomas Markle reveals phone Harry heated call following staged paparazzi photos","story":"    Thomas Markle (pictured) last night revealed how he dramatically hung up on Prince Harry during a heated telephone call – after the MoS exposed him for staging paparazzi photosIn our searingly frank and revealing interview – which Mr Markle vows will be his last – he adds that:Meghan told him there would be ‘no room’ for his speech at her wedding, leaving him feeling ‘hurt’Claims of a rapprochement between him and the Royal couple are wrong and that they have not spoken for monthsHe ‘doesn’t care’ about the Royals and wants his old life back.Mr Markle, 74, made global headlines in May when he pulled out of walking his daughter down the aisle days before her wedding at Windsor, blaming a heart attack.His shock decision came the day after The Mail on Sunday revealed he had been colluding with a paparazzi photographer to pose for staged photos.Meghan\u0027s wedding hotel dragged into racism storm as National...Like spy, like son: How father of double MI6 agent Kim...Share this articleToday we can reveal details of the remarkable calls that took place between Mr Markle and Prince Harry following our exposé.Though they have never met, Harry and Mr Markle had enjoyed a series of ‘warm and chatty’ phone conversations after Meghan told him of her romance with the Royal. Among other things, they discussed what to do when news of the relationship became public – and Harry advised Mr Markle to avoid the paparazzi at all costs.Mr Markle recalled: ‘Harry told me that I should never go to the press.

The photos made £100,000 for the photographer and a smaller amount for Mr Markle.On Friday, May 11, the MoS informed Kensington Palace of the revelations we were to publish two days later after we discovered CCTV footage of Mr Markle collaborating with the photographer.Harry called Mr Markle to ask if he had co-operated for shots which showed him, among other things, supposedly being fitted for a wedding suit.At this point, Mr Markle admits, he lied to the Prince.After our story appeared, Harry and Meghan called Mr Markle again, though by then he was in hospital recovering from a heart attack. Mr Markle said the Prince told him: ‘If you had listened to me this would never have happened’.Mr Markle said he told Harry: ‘Maybe it would be better for you guys if I was dead… then you could pretend to be sad.’‘Then I hung up.’In hindsight, he admits Harry was ‘absolutely right’ to criticise him. Yet it was Meghan who dealt perhaps the most painful blow when she told her father he would not be allowed to make a speech at the wedding. ‘That hurt,’ he said.Mr Markle added: ‘I’m not mad at Harry. I’m not mad at Meghan. I love them. I wish them well. But as for the rest of it, f*** it.

Each is anxiously rocking a baby. One after the other, they are called before a panel of grave-faced men to be questioned about their children. Or rather, to be asked how they came to be pregnant in the first place, whether the conception was forced upon them, and in what circumstances. What will they do if the baby is accepted, asks the senior inquisitor, strictness rising in his voice. And have the girls attended Sunday school?This is the opening twist in artist and model Lily Cole’s fine new film for the Foundling Museum. The disjuncture between past and present is deliberate. For although these scenes are filmed in contemporary times, conveying the hardships of teenage single mothers in council flats, parts of the script are taken directly from the transcripts of actual cases that came before Thomas Coram’s Foundling hospital for 19th-century children whose mothers could not keep them.Old words are put into new mouths, to shattering effect. Did you think he was going to marry you? Did he just disappear? The girls nod, clinging to their babies, unable to look after them, unable to give them up. Their dilemma has its metaphor in the random system adopted by the hospital when there were too many applications. Mothers were presented with a bag from which to draw a ball. A white ball meant the baby got in, a black ball the opposite, and a red ball meant that the mother had a second chance.In Cole’s film, the white mother gets a white ball, which leads to a harrowing scene of farewell the black mother gets a red ball and feels she is momentarily reprieved. But what will become of her baby son Heath remains a mystery, returning the viewer to the single line from Emily Brontë’s Wuthering Heights that precedes the film: “But where did he come from, the dark little thing?”The dark thing is Heathcliff, a foundling discovered on the streets of Liverpool (where this film has also been screened). It was the sight of London babies abandoned in this way that inspired the sea captain Thomas Coram to found his hospital for “exposed and deserted young children” in 1739. He walked for miles, gathering signatures to petition for a royal charter, a campaign that took more than 17 years.On the site of the old hospital in Bloomsbury stands the Foundling Museum, containing the original wooden staircase down which generations of abandoned children slid, and many of the paintings that once hung on the hospital’s walls. One of Coram’s co-founders was William Hogarth, whose ebullient The March of the Guards to Finchley, showing English troops massing to fight off the supposed threat of Bonnie Prince Charlie, cheered on by London crowds, was decisive in turning the hospital into the first public gallery of art in Britain.The museum commissions artists to respond to the hospital’s history. Cole, model turned actress turned art film director, is the latest Foundling Fellow, succeeding Cornelia Parker, Grayson Perry and Yinka Shonibare. Shonibare’s Trumpet Boy stands at the foot of the stairs, a black globe for a head, dressed in Victorian clothes made out of contemporary west African cloth, the artist’s trademark dissonance, lest we forget that some of the foundlings were mixed-race. This was the case with Black Peggy, raped by a white servant, upon whom Cole’s black girl is based. Peggy has a far harder time than the white girl before the inquisitor (beautifully played by John Sessions), who foolishly asks if her baby is “coloured”.Peggy’s own piercingly tragic petition to have her child taken appears in a glass case alongside the film. It stands as a precise example of the challenge faced by these artists: how to reflect, illuminate, or in any way create a sufficient parallel to these tales of real life. Cole has succeeded, with her curious and gracefully filmed parable of the agonies of adoption, the past dramatised in the present. Another recently commissioned artist, Jodie Carey, has produced three installations, ranging from a sea of white cloth fragments dipped in liquid clay to the bronze cast of the hole left when a rope was buried in the earth. All require copious wall texts to overcome their lack of visual eloquence they cannot speak for themselves.More remarkable are some of the works made by adults who were once children in care – the rows of white shirts in all different sizes worn to school in London. Instead of name tags, these have labels stitched into the collars bearing the phrases they too often heard: “Who brought you up?” “Why come to school if you can’t bring a pen?” The gorgeous “sky marbles” made out of coloured waste paper by today’s children in memory of foundlings long ago. But above all the array of mementos mothers left their babies in the 18th century – a stitched initial, a twisted ribbon, a delicately carved penny: the art of true love.• Lily Cole: Balls is at the Foundling Museum, London, until 2 December"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3daff6c6de0594e78e468d6a7ef0e1eb55047c4f/0_261_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f62ed4f6c11d136d21741b0cc7eb8f3","title":"the 20 photographs of the week","story":"Wildfires in California, airstrikes in Gaza, protests in Buenos Aires, the 2018 European Championships and the face veil ban in Denmark – the week captured by the world’s best photojournalists"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4793859eb9d9d44b9edc6533203cbb49bd9c8e5e/425_230_2511_1506/master/2511.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2a61f8230c7524de94ec115db952f700","title":"algiers third world capital elaine mokhtefi review","story":"In the 1960s Algeria became a beacon to the world, and exiled artists, intellectuals and guerrilla fighters flocked there. The militant author met them all“This is a story with a beginning and an end,” Elaine Mokhtefi writes in the preface to her extraordinary memoir. The title is a bit misleading – this is\u0026nbspno dry history – but it carries something of the revolutionary optimism of\u0026nbspher tale’s beginnings, and, in its anachronism, something too of the heartache of its ending. Because who can even talk of a first or a third world any more, rather than a whole planet of uncertainty and want, dotted here and there with well-guarded islands of cosmopolitan abundance? And who can remember anything as unitary as a capital, or as beautiful as a solidarity that doesn’t care for borders?Mokhtefi, born Elaine Klein in prosaic Hempstead, New York, was 23 when she moved to Paris in 1951. She thought she would find something like history there – “I would drink at the fountain of the past,” she wrote – and that it would have something to do with Émile Zola and Alfred Dreyfus, Marcel Proust and Gustave Flaubert. It turned out that history wasn’t over. By 1960, when no fewer than 17 African nations announced their independence, Mokhtefi had become deeply involved with antiracist and anticolonial struggles. In France that meant agitating for Algerian independence, and against a brutal war that had already dragged on for six years.In the process she had befriended anticolonial thinker Frantz Fanon and had fallen in love with an Algerian activist. She returned to New York that autumn and began working in the tiny apartment headquarters of the provisional government of the Algerian Republic. When independence came in the summer of 1962, she moved again, to Algiers, to be with her lover. She was, as she put it, “one of the dreamers who came to build a more perfect world”.The challenges were enormous. The French had left trauma, stubborn hope and little else. There were only 500 university graduates in the entire country, which had a population of more than 9 million. A quarter of the populace had been confined in concentration camps. Hundreds of thousands had been killed. Throughout the 1960s, Algeria nonetheless became a beacon to the world, with “an open-door policy of aid to the oppressed”. Exiled artists, intellectuals and guerrilla fighters flocked to Algiers, representing liberation movements from the rest of Africa, Latin America, the Middle East and Southeast Asia. Mokhtefi met most of them, from South Africa’s ANC to the Viet Cong. Timothy Leary, Jean-Luc Godard, Simone de Beauvoir and Nina Simone make appearances, too.Mokhtefi vacillates between describing herself as\u0026nbspa\u0026nbspparticipant – “We were fellow militants and the future was ours” – and a privileged observer: “I was a\u0026nbspfly on the window, looking in, beating its wings.” She was both. She found work as assistant to the president’s press adviser, then in the national press agency and at the radio station, and finally at the university. Officially she wrote press releases and opinion pieces, organised conferences, published a magazine, wrote and directed radio shows. Unofficially, she did whatever needed to be done. When her relationship with her Algerian partner ended, Mokhtefi stayed on. “I had espoused a\u0026nbspcause and taken the consequences,” she writes. “On\u0026nbspa deeper level, I had found a home.”Late one night in June 1969, her phone rang. Eldridge Cleaver, the Black Panther party’s minister of information, had landed in Algiers. After a shootout with police in California, he had been charged with attempted murder, skipped bail and fled to Cuba. He was no longer welcome there. “The Cubans dumped me,” Cleaver told Mokhtefi. His wife, Kathleen, was pregnant. He had no contacts in Algeria, or even permission to stay. “Can you help me?” he asked.For the next three and a half years, she would be Cleaver and the Panthers’ (more would soon arrive) fixer, interpreter, comrade and co-conspirator. She had the connections and knew how to make things happen. When Cleaver wanted official recognition for the international section of the Black Panther party, she got it for them, plus monthly stipends and a villa in\u0026nbspthe hills. They called it “the Embassy”. When a German support group bought the Panthers a minibus, she picked it up from the Volkswagen plant in Hanover and ferried it to Algiers. In 1971, after Huey Newton expelled Cleaver from the Panthers, she toured the US\u0026nbspwith Kathleen, raising money for the Cleavers’ latest venture. The next year, when things were beginning to look dodgy in Algiers, she smuggled a\u0026nbspstack of stolen US passports to a Red Army Faction contact in Frankfurt, then smuggled them back with the exiles’ photos sealed in place of\u0026nbspthe originals.Cleaver is as charismatic and contradictory here as in his own books: by turns warm, brilliant, manipulative and ruthless. One morning in 1969 he confessed to\u0026nbspMokhtefi that he had killed another American fugitive, Clinton “Rahim” Smith, who, he said, had been planning to run away with the Panthers’ money. The Algerian police found Smith’s body but did not pursue the case. (She later learned that Smith was rumoured to have become involved with Kathleen.) By telling Mokhtefi, Cleaver had made her complicit in the murder they never spoke of it again.The authorities would be less offended by killing than by their guests’ inability to reckon with the realities of their position. The Panthers made little attempt to understand their hosts. They didn’t follow local news and interacted with few Algerians other than the women they dated. In 1972, a group of African American hijackers landed in Algeria with a\u0026nbspmillion dollars in ransomed cash, and Cleaver, “vibrating to the overtones of dollar bills”, published an open letter complaining that President Houari Boumédiène had confiscated the money and abandoned their cause. The next day police raided their villa, took their weapons and cut off the phones. The crisis passed, but the message was clear: it was time to go.For all Cleaver’s flaws, Mokhtefi writes, “I admired the man”. Her feelings ran deep. Early on the morning he left – New Year’s Day, 1973 – she drove to the Embassy to say goodbye. Cleaver, disguised in a Chesterfield coat and homburg, was sweating. “He hugged me,” she writes. She drove home “and cried uncontrollably”.They would see each other again. One year later, Mokhtefi was deported to Paris. No explanation was given, but she had repeatedly refused the Algerian security service’s demands that she inform on a friend who had married the deposed former president Ahmed Ben Bella. Because of her political activities, she was legally not allowed to stay in France. Cleaver at this point was associating with “a swish Parisian crowd” his glamorous photojournalist girlfriend was also sleeping with the minister of finance. Mokhtefi asked Cleaver for help. He promised to get back to her, but never did.“I bear no grudges,” she insists, “I feel no rancour.” I believe her. Cleaver’s silence must have wounded her deeply. Algeria certainly broke her heart. The world that she and so many others struggled to create went instead in another direction. Many of her generation grew bitter in their disappointment and turned against the ideals of their youth. Mokhtefi is compassionate – true to her younger self, the people she knew and the dreams that animated her life. She is generous enough not to mention Cleaver’s later transformations into a born-again Christian, a drug addict and a Republican. She did not return to Algeria and was spared the pain of witnessing its collapse in the 1990s into civil war. She leaves us this eloquent record, written with great humility and with love.• Algiers, Third World Capital is published by Verso.

He finished writing his latest novel, Exit West, which was published early last year and shortlisted for the Man Booker prize, well before Trump and Brexit brought questions of borders and national identity to the forefront of the global narrative. The novel was in part a response to the migrant crisis that was unfolding in various corners of the world as Hamid was writing, but it also predicted with almost uncanny prescience the rise of nativist paranoia and racial intolerance, which have become such features of life in 2018.The novelist Kamila Shamsie, a friend of Hamid, told me another story about his proleptic powers. “On September 9 or 10, 2001, I was having dinner with Mohsin in London and he told me about the book he was working on,” Shamsie said. “It was about a young Pakistani man doing very well in the corporate world in New York. Despite all his success, one day he found himself listening closely to a speech by an extremist Muslim – it wasn’t the religious content of the man’s words that caught his attention, but the political content. I saw Mohsin again on September 12, 2001. ‘Mohsin, your novel… ?’ I said. ‘I don’t know,’ he replied. ‘I think I have to go on writing it.’ ‘Of course you do,’ I said.”That novel, Hamid’s second book, became The Reluctant Fundamentalist and was seen by many as the definitive literary response to 911. Certainly it was far more successful both critically and commercially than the attempts of more established authors to address the twin towers. John Updike, Martin Amis, Don DeLillo – the great and good of Anglo-American letters queued up to respond to the attacks, but it was Hamid’s protagonist Changez, bursting with charisma and ambition, who spoke with the greatest clarity and authority about what might have driven the terrorists to act. Shamsie suggests that the very reason for the novel’s success may have been precisely because it wasn’t an attempt to seize upon 911 as a subject, but rather that Hamid was “a writer already looking at the world, and the conflicts shaping within it, and turning his imaginative attention to them before those conflicts became headline news everywhere”.I speak to Hamid in early August. He is in London as part of an extended holiday with his family. He’s been away so much over the past 18 months promoting Exit West, he says in a voice that has something of the New Yorker’s pace and inflection, that he wanted to spend the summer relaxing with his wife Zahra Khan and their two children. Their vacation has taken in the Greek islands, which he fell in love with as a 21-year-old backpacker his favourites are Naxos and Santorini. They also spent time in Amsterdam and Berlin. I ask him about the ability of novels in general – and his novels in particular – to engage not only with their own times, but also to take prophetic leaps into the future. “Novels don’t simply look,” he says, “they also exist. Just as in looking on something we change what is being observed, novels and the arts more generally, in looking at what may come, are also shaping what may come. It isn’t an entirely passive position.”Exit West is largely set in a near-future dystopia of unfettered migration. Saeed and Nadia, the protagonists of the story, journey through a series of Narnia-like portals that take them from the unnamed city in which they have grown up to a camp on Mykonos, thence to a darkly repressive London, and on to a life in California that carries echoes of the first settlers to strike out for the west. At the very end of the novel – and I don’t think this is a spoiler – we move further forward in time and end on a note of optimism, with Hamid painting a picture of a very different world, but one that might almost be called a utopia. I ask him about this upbeat conclusion. “What I’m trying to do is not just to say: ‘What is the middle of the probabilistic distribution? What is the 50th percentile of what humanity’s likely to look like in the future?’ But rather to lean on that a little bit and to say: ‘What happens if we look with a degree of optimism towards the future?’ That’s very important. I’ve come to the belief that pessimism is a deeply conservative and reactionary position. It tends to lead towards deference, towards the strong and powerful, towards powerlessness and a kind of surrender.” The end of Exit West feels like a kind of blueprint for humanity, a path out of our nightmarish political squabbling and towards a more socially balanced future. “Putting forth an optimistic vision like that makes that vision, in some small way, more likely to come true.”Hamid is exceptionally well placed to write about a world of porous borders and perpetual mobility. He has lived in his birthplace – Lahore, Pakistan – for the past nine years, but before that moved between Pakistan, the US and the UK, seemingly equally at home in each. His father was an academic at Stanford University during Hamid’s childhood. There was a return to Pakistan for high school and then Princeton, a spell at Harvard and a law firm, and some time in London as a management consultant. I ask him what caused him to return to Pakistan. “When we moved back in 2009, it was two months after our first child, our daughter, was born,” he says. In the lead-up to the birth, he and his wife had been discussing commonplace questions about schooling and childcare and realised that, if they didn’t move back to Pakistan then, they perhaps never would.Hamid’s wife, Zahra, also from Lahore, studied abroad like her husband and then returned to star in a popular Pakistani TV drama. She went to London with Hamid but, like him, felt an urge to return. Hamid recognises that it took a degree of bravery to make the move home. “Pakistan had a slightly frightening reputation in the news,” he says, “so we thought let’s go back, so our parents could enjoy their grandchildren, and so that we don’t become so alarmed by what life in Pakistan is like that we never make that choice and end our lives wondering what might have been. But we’re both British citizens, so moving to Pakistan didn’t end up feeling like an irrevocable decision.” I ask him whether they ever regretted the decision. “The experience has been a very mixed one,” he says. “In terms of the children having time with their grandparents and us having time with our siblings, it’s been wonderful. But Pakistan, politically, has been a tumultuous place. There have been moments when the law and order situation or the terrorism situation have been alarming.”Now, following a contested election and allegations of widespread manipulation of votes by Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party, the political backdrop in the country seems more problematic than ever. “I think there has been a severe disruption of the democratic process in Pakistan,” Hamid says. Notwithstanding this, many of Hamid’s friends appear to be happy with the election of the former cricketer. “I suppose their reasoning is, you know, was the open, civilian, political space of recent years particularly great? Not really.” He maintains optimism by focusing on the energy and hunger for change he perceives in young Pakistanis. “What I see is that each subsequent generation in Pakistan seems to be significantly better educated than in the past. In cities like Lahore, there are all kinds of interesting things happening, whether that’s at university level, or in the arts. Is Pakistan improving? In some senses yes. In some senses it’s much more polluted and dangerous than when I was a child. But in some ways it’s much more dynamic.” In the end, the thing he clings to is “the sense that in Pakistan the number of people who will not stand for this bullshit is growing”.Hamid still works occasionally for New York-based brand consultancy Wolff Olins – he’s listed as their chief storytelling officer. “I find that the consulting is really wonderful,” he tells me. “To get on the phone with someone every so often in San Francisco, or London, or Chengdu, and talk about issues that concern them – to every so often meet up to discuss some shared project – it’s an important antidote to the horrific solitariness of my chosen profession. I do not think that being a novelist is a good profession for anyone’s mental health.” I wonder, though, how he manages to keep up with the world of business as well as the arts. Actually, he says: “I have the opposite problem, which is not how to stay in touch with developments in literature or business or politics, but how does one achieve the distance required from this so that one can look at the world with one’s own eyes and not become obsessed with the media entertainment machine? The course I’ve taken more recently is actually to detach myself from the news.”Since Trump came to power, Hamid has stopped reading newspapers or watching the news. He also shies away from social media. When I look for him online, I find a couple of tweets from 2015-16 and a mothballed personal Facebook account. There is a more active Facebook profile, but this, he tells me, is maintained by his publisher. “I was totally going to go on social media about two or three novels ago and was on Twitter for a few months and I found it to be a kind of addictive and bizarre experience. Not only is it addictive in that it has been designed to be an experience that is addictive – micro-rewards, constant feedback – it’s sort of heroin in terms of its design. But it’s pernicious in terms of how it makes one comport oneself. I wasn’t particularly good at it and I certainly didn’t enjoy it, and I became deeply suspicious of myself on it – and therefore of it as a whole – and I got the hell off.”Reading Hamid’s biography, there’s the sense of someone who has risen with ease to every one of life’s challenges. He didn’t even know that Princeton offered creative writing before he went there. He enrolled as a student of international relations – “It was the class that allowed you to take the most classes in other subjects” – and then found himself selected by Toni Morrison as the only one of her students to read his work to the whole university on graduation. Morrison also read the first draft of the novel that was to become Moth Smoke and gave him extensive feedback on it in her “beautiful handwriting in fountain pen”. He wrote seven drafts of the novel, many of them while studying at Harvard Law School, before he (and his mother – he showed her the second draft and she said: “Mmm… I don’t like this much”) was satisfied with it. Moth Smoke, the riotous tale of an out-of-work Lahore banker who falls into a spiral of drugs and crime, was a huge hit in south-east Asia and won critical admiration and awards across the world.Subsequent novels – The Reluctant Fundamentalist, How to Get Filthy Rich in Rising Asia and Exit West – attracted further praise and prizes. The Reluctant Fundamentalist was turned into a film by Mira Nair, while Exit West has been optioned by Joe and Anthony Russo – the latest directors of the Avengers franchise. Whether in business or literature, everything Hamid touches turns to gold. I ask him whether he recognises himself in this portrait of a man who has enjoyed seemingly effortless success. “I think it is very difficult for me to think of myself as having succeeded,” he says with a chuckle. “Even to the extent that many of the things that I’ve tried have gone off quite well, I think that part of the reason that many people push themselves is because of an inability to feel that what they have done is good enough. Now I think that there is a real problem to this. It’s very important to savour the moment, to feel a sense of contentment, not to live one’s life gazing towards the future and what one might do next and instead to concentrate on the present moment, which is all that life consists of. So I’m working on that kind of thing. I try to root myself in the present.”Lila Azam Zanganeh was one of the judges on the panel that shortlisted Exit West for the Man Booker last year. In an email, she said the judges “admired Exit West both for its spareness – stylistic, narrative – and its breadth. Mohsin writes at the heart and centre of the 21st century: he tackles war and migration. Exit West, in essence, is a story of migration told through a kaleidoscope of angles a story that reads like a fabulist’s ‘prolegomenon’ for this century.” The book, she said, “is not about Pakistan, but about the universal experience of loss, and the meaning of ‘home’. It explores how we never cease to conjure new identities for the express and urgent matter of survival.”Exit West employs a narrative device that has presented itself in each of Hamid’s works to date: anonymity. No characters other than Saeed and Nadia are named the city from which they set out, even the country, also remain unnamed. While the lack of proper nouns is not as extreme as in How to Get Filthy Rich in Rising Asia, where the only names are those of continents, the nonspecific locale does intensify the allegorical atmosphere of the novel. Hamid tells me he wanted to explore a question: “To what extent can a story speak to humanity as a whole? The best examples of the stories that do this for me are children’s stories. And children’s stories very often operate in a world of significantly reduced name specificity.” Saaed and Nadia’s home town is based on Lahore, Hamid says, but he couldn’t bring himself to give it a name. “I didn’t wish to write the demise of Lahore. It felt to me too horrifying, because it’s not impossible. But I don’t think it’s likely. I think the narratives of Pakistan’s Talibanisation etc are very unlikely narratives and I didn’t want to be peddling a story of Pakistan’s collapse.”The coming months hold a return to Pakistan for Hamid and his family, and the beginning of work on a new novel – in itself a daunting task. “As far as the novels I’ve written so far,” he tells me, “each of them has done what I wanted them to do as well as I was capable of doing it at the time. I’m happy with all of them. But none of them does what I now want a novel to do. What I now want a novel to do, I don’t know how to do – and I’m not sure that I can.” Hamid will miss the National Youth Theatre’s Edinburgh performance of The Reluctant Fundamentalist, although he has corresponded with Stephanie Street, who is adapting it, and has heard that it’s an extraordinary production. Above all, Hamid says he is concentrating on maintaining his hard-won optimism, a position at once personal and political: “I have to work at being an optimist, but it’s worth that work. And as a parent, it’s my job to be optimistic about the future, at least while my children are under my care. ‘You will go to school and come back safe.’ That’s an optimistic position, but a position you have to adopt if you’re going to do your duty to your children properly.”• Exit West by Mohsin Hamid is published in paperback by Hamish Hamilton (£8.99).

He has been investing in more upmarket brands – expanding Flannels, a designer fashion chain, and Four Holdings, the group which owns lingerie brand Agent Provocateur but also distributes desirable labels including Paul \u0026amp Shark, Orla Kiely and Stone Island.“Mike has secretly been trying to become respectable for years, so revitalising a lovely old store like Frasers in Glasgow really appeals to him,” said someone who knows him. “It was now or never. If he didn’t buy House of Fraser he would always be known as the man who clothed a generation of tracksuit-wearers. He wants to leave a legacy.”But will it turn out that way? In its stock exchange statement, Sports Direct said it had acquired all 59 stores, the House of Fraser name and the stock. “Our deal was conservative, consistent and simple,” said Ashley. But it also included a half-promise that “we will do our best to keep as many stores open as possible”.While the deal ostensibly looks to have saved 16,000 jobs, Ashley could still opt to close stores further down the line. That is because Sports Direct has only taken over the running of the stores under licence from the administrator and can hand back the keys to any of them if he is unable to secure the rent deals from landlords that he wants.One landlord said he thought the long-term future for House of Fraser was likely to be messy. “Ashley is backing multi-brand stores against the trend. Single-brand stores are doing better.”However, the entrepreneur would only have to shift the stock still sitting in House of Fraser to make money on the deal, he suggested – a tactic Ashley had used on previous\u0026nbspoccasions.Pressure from the internet, a declining pound, rising business rates and consumption fatigue – retailers are under fire from all sides. Online shopping now accounts for about a fifth of retail spending and means there are fewer shoppers on the high street. Department stores – hobbled by big premises on long leases, selling brands that are easily found online – have suffered more than most. Among the casualties have been:• Allders of Croydon, one of the biggest department stores in the country, which went into admin­istration in 2012 after 150 years.• Jacksons of Reading, a family-run store that opened in 1875, which shut on Christmas Eve 2013 due to poor sales and the need for costly repairs.• Cumming of Leven, a chain with 16 stores that went into administration in 2015. The group operated the Sphere \u0026amp Turret stores across Fife and other outlets across Scotland.• BHS, which failed in 2016 with the loss of 11,000 jobs and a pension deficit assessed at £571m.• McEwens of Perth, which also collapsed in 2016, with the loss of 110 jobs, after trading problems.\u0026nbsp• Austins in Derry, one of Europe’s oldest department stores, which went into liquidation the same year.• Beales, a national chain founded in 1981, which had to arrange an insolvency procedure to cut its rents and closed several branches in 2017.• Bodgers of Ilford, which shut in 2018 after 125 years. It was the largest independent department store in the\u0026nbsparea.Among the businesses still standing but struggling are:• Debenhams, which has issued three profit warnings this year and has been downgraded by ratings agency Moody’s.\u0026nbsp• John Lewis, which said in June it would make no profit in the first six months of this year and would be closing five Waitrose stores.• Fenwick, whose chief executive, Robbie Feather, warned earlier this year that a “significant number” of the upmarket chain’s 2,200 jobs were at risk.\u0026nbspIn what has been a grim year for the high street, department store chains in particular are struggling as the transfer of sales to the internet makes it harder to turn a profit from sprawling high-street sites, many of which incurred hefty increases in business rates as a result of last year’s revaluation. At the same time, shoppers have reined in spending on clothing and household goods because of a squeeze on spare cash and a shift to renting rather than owning homes.But House of Fraser’s story is one of a long, slow decline rather than a sudden death. The chain has suffered blows from rising costs and stagnating sales along with the rest of the high street. But it was also saddled with heavy debts and a hefty pension scheme thanks to bad management decisions taken in the past, such as selling the freeholds of its stores and acquiring the Beatties department store chain.The group’s young and inexperienced boss, Alex Williamson, had no retail experience when he joined last year from Goodwood, the group behind the Goodwood Revival and Festival of Speed events. Last year’s decision to take the redevelopment of its website inhouse was also a disaster, with sales plummeting after it disappeared from Google searches.One former staff member said that a revolving door for senior managers, many of whom were pushed out in order to save money, had not helped: “When you take lots of people out then mistakes happen, because no one has experience of making those mistakes before.”Much was promised four years ago when House of Fraser was sold to an offshoot of Chinese conglomerate Sanpower in a £450m deal.But instead of helping House of Fraser recover from the lost years that followed the collapse of its previous owner – Baugur, the now defunct Icelandic investment fund – it only trickled funds into a business that desperately needed cash to deal with its ageing portfolio of stores and a £400m debt mountain.The collapse of a deal to sell a stake to C.banner, another Chinese company, at the start of this month was the final straw.In the end, it all culminated in an unceremonious and short-lived dunk into administration on Friday morning. The deal means House of Fraser’s secured lenders, who are at the front of the queue to be paid in the event of administration, will recoup around 22p in the pound. The store chain’s suppliers, who were due to be paid about £60m next week, are expected to get only 3p in the pound.House of Fraser’s pension scheme will now be assessed by the Pension Protection Fund (PPF), the industry-backed “lifeboat” – but as it is in surplus, it could be taken over by an insurance firm. However, any deal is still likely to fall short of previously promised pension benefits.Nigel Lugg, chairman of the UK Fashion and Textile Association, said: “A lot of suppliers will be owed a lot of money. It will be like a tsunami after the administration.“Mike Ashley has bought the business and we want to wish him every success with keeping a department store going, a premium department store with premium brands. We will wait and see what he wants to do, but we want to support House of Fraser going forward.”In winning control of House of Fraser, Ashley outflanked Philip Day, another entrepreneur who likes to buy retail brands that have fallen on hard times. Over the last two decades the Dubai-based businessman has been quietly buying up swaths of the high street – a haul that includes Edinburgh Woollen Mill, Peacocks, Jaeger and Austin Reed.One deal insider said Ashley winning control was a better outcome for the 16,000 people who work either directly for House of Fraser or are employed by the fashion brands it sells: “More people are going to end up employed.”Independent retail analyst Richard Hyman said Sports Direct’s ownership of House of Fraser would be a two-act play: “Initially, House of Fraser will appear to be trading as it has done for years because they have bought the stores and the stock.“What happens after that stock has been sold is more difficult to fathom. Ashley has made no secret of his plans to add an upmarket business stream and has done well with some small brands, but the scale here is quite different. It’s a huge\u0026nbspchallenge.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6507896e75c62a5199fdb2c7ef584df395c445a5/0_19_3499_2099/master/3499.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f5f4973b687e502bae213c9d3a96542","title":"seven more marks and spencer stores close as restructuring continues","story":"The high street chain is aiming to reduce costs by £350m over the next three yearsSeven Marks \u0026amp Spencer clothing stores will close their doors for the last time on Saturday as the high street chain pushes ahead with a radical transformation plan.The retailer announced in May that it plans to close 100 stores by 2022, putting hundreds of jobs at risk.As part of the business restructuring, M\u0026ampS will also be looking to reduce its costs by £350m by 2021.On Saturday 11 August, clothing stores in Falkirk, Kettering, Newmarket, Northampton, Stockton, Walsall and New Mersey retail park in Speke will trade for a final day – while a Simply Food in Bayswater in central London will also close.Three stores – in Darlington, Fleetwood and Newton Abbott – have already ceased trading as part of the phase of closures.Three more – in Clacton, East Kilbride and Holloway Road in London – are expected to close at a later date.The latest round of closures comes after 21 stores were wound up by the chain.On Friday, Steve Rowe, M\u0026ampS chief executive, said: “There are likely to be more redundancies.”The firm’s chair, Archie Norman, said the size of the company’s store portfolio had become “a drag on our performance”.“For me, the results in the next two years aren’t the most important thing. We are here to deliver a profitable, growing business in five years’ time,” Norman said.“This is probably the biggest turnaround in UK retail.”Norman joined the business last year to help lead a turnaround, and said on Tuesday that he wanted to present the “unvarnished truth” about its prospects.He said M\u0026ampS faced competition on many fronts, both from online retailers and from discounters such as Aldi, Lidl and Primark.To improve its operations, M\u0026ampS has been moving from its old IT systems and has been shutting warehouses in its distribution network.M\u0026ampS has already announced that it is closing its warehouses in Neasden and Warrington, and Rowe said on Tuesday that the future of the Castle Donington warehouse was under review.On Friday, House of Fraser went into administration and was bought by Sports Direct, the sportswear chain controlled by Mike Ashley, for £90m."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d3f7b7a1b11d191ab7ffc64f2bcdb1933764190/0_0_4734_2841/master/4734.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bded5516e88724442a0025cd4498e936","title":"calm amid the concrete britains best urban green spaces","story":"From shopping centre beehives to grand hidden gardens, there’s respite from the madding crowds in Britain’s towns and citiesDalston Eastern Curve Garden, LondonThis leafy lifeline, situated slap bang in the middle of Dalston’s lively chicken shops, boutique bars and technicolor nail salons, is a vital addition to one of London’s most densely populated boroughs, where few people have access to their own garden.

Then you can check out the Corinthian columns and explore an elaborate, shell and fossil-lined grotto, complete with lioness and river god – a perfect spot for your very own Jane Austen moment. Tours of Goldney Gardens are run on various dates throughout the summer till 23 August and can be booked online.Bonnington Square Pleasure Garden, LondonOnce part of the 17th-century Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens, this plot of land became a bombsite, then a derelict playground dominated by dog poo, before it was imaginatively re-designed in the 1990s by a group of local residents, led by film-maker Evan English. It now features a 9-metre-high Industrial Revolution iron waterwheel, a huge Helping Hand sculpture and lush sub-tropical plants. And zero dog poo.Cambo Gardens, FifeWith winding paths, fast-flowing streams and swarms of butterflies, the walled, wild gardens of Cambo House seem straight out of a storybook. Eclectic in design – think cascades of roses and carpets of more than 300 varieties of snowdrops – the garden has been specially planted to reward the visitor no matter what season it is. Views of the sea at sunset are particularly Instagrammable.Rooftop of the Dolphin Shopping Centre, PooleThis shopping centre in Poole has a bit of a buzz about it recently, thanks to a new sustainable roof garden, complete with two beehives. Not only do bees here help with local pollination, they also produce the honey that is sold in the centre, with all the proceeds going to charity. Tended to by shopping centre staff, the garden has been made entirely from recycled materials, and there are big plans to grow veg up there too.Aimed at shielding skin from environmental assaults like pollution, Clinique’s Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly works to hydrate, strengthen and protect skin for 24 hours.

The sun shone for months on end, as if Britain was not leaving the EU but moving to southern Europe. England’s footballers tore up their history of failure and to the astonishment of the nation reached the semi-finals of the World Cup. Consumers with stagnant incomes were inspired by the heatwave to somehow find the money to pour into pubs and restaurants.Barbecue sales at garden centres were up by a fifth. Bottles of rosé and sparkling wines shot off the shelves. “My suppliers have run out of Strawberry Split and Rocket lollies, despite stepping up production,” said Paul Field, an ice-cream seller from Berkshire. He wasn’t complaining because he had never seen a summer like it. “If I park the van outside my home, and pop in to get something, I come back to a queue.” For a moment, it seemed as if a shortage of CO2 would cause beer production to stop, but the crisis passed, leaving the press free to consider whether the heat made men’s penises bigger. (“There’s a reason people don’t take honeymoons to the North Pole,” a coy “sexual health expert” told the Mail.)Historians could look back on the summer of 2018 as they look at the summer of 1914: an innocent time when people did not realise they were sleepwalking towards disaster. The warning signs are there if you care to draw the parallels. The causes of the First World War provide an endless source of historical controversy because the conflict was avoidable. You don’t have to agree with AJP Taylor’s gloriously self-confident assertion that all you need to know about the seminal catastrophe of the 20th century was that it was “imposed on European statesmen by railway timetables” to accept that the politicians of 1914 could not control the military or stop the outbreak of war once the troop trains had started moving.The referendum result is our railway timetable: it must be stuck to, whatever the consequences. In normal circumstances, politicians would assert their view of the national interest and ask the voters to judge them at the next election. But the direct democracy of the referendum has superseded representative democracy. Unless we somehow can force a second vote, we must crash out of the EU and pay the price of wholly unnecessary damage to Britain’s economic and strategic position. Or we must accept a deal that protects the economy at the price of obeying so many EU rules it’s not worth leaving. Almost as bad as no deal is a deal that fudges the big questions and turns Brexit into a rolling crisis that will enfeeble Britain for the best part of a decade.Both main parties are dominated by cranks, who not only have no answers to the big questions of the day, but haven’t even thought about them. For what unites the Tory right and Corbyn left is not just their support for Brexit but their inability to say how they would cope with the collapse in productivity, the health and social care crisis, the end of the era of cheap money and the rise of China.To say that the public has appeared unconcerned this summer is to put the case at its mildest. The most striking feature of the summer television ratings, once the mega audiences of the World Cup had passed, was how nostalgic the most watched programmes were. The Antiques Roadshow, Poldark and Countryfile were the reliable hits for the BBC (comfortably beating Love Island). Coronation Street and Emmerdale were their ITV counterparts. Not once in July did a news programme appear in the top 10 most-watched shows of the major broadcasters. It was as if the British were happy to live at any time except the present.You can tell people off for stupidly thinking they can escape Britain’s fate. You can analyse and dissect their manifestation of what economists and psychologists call “the ostrich effect”: the refusal to face alarming facts about your investments, health, relationships or, indeed, the wretched state of your country. And there’s truth in that dismissive diagnosis.Alternatively, you can praise people for retreating into sport, tourism, family and friendship. Boris Johnson talked in an anguished voice of the Brexit dream “dying”, as if the country had a duty to sustain itself in a state of frenzied agitation until his fantasy came true. Ignoring him and all the other seedy fanatics of right and left who would dominate our lives can almost seem an act of defiance. Either way, it is not as if the British have a choice.I find no poet more contemporary than Auden. The engaged fury of his early work as fascism grew, and the cool dissections of cruelty and folly in his later poems, speaks to us (or at least to me) with a directness few modern poets manage. Contemplating Bruegel’s Fall of Icarus, Auden wrote of how life carries on in the midst of suffering:The sun shoneAs it had to on the white legs disappearing into the greenWater and the expensive delicate ship that must have seenSomething amazing, a boy falling out of the sky,Had somewhere to get to and sailed calmly on.This may be a stupid summer, but the British have to get on with their lives. It’s as if the whole country, or at least that growing portion of it that does not believe in the “Brexit dream”, is waiting: waiting for a government that will refuse to follow a policy it knows will isolate and impoverish us waiting for an opposition that is willing to oppose waiting for the supposed British values of pragmatism and common sense to rise from their graves. While we wait, what else is there to do but take whatever pleasures we can find wherever we can find them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48be7658f064e94e150cd220115df29a1e7d281c/432_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f3ee7b873754ff647db2c101052edf71","title":"the oscars are pandering to the populist mood sweeping the globe","story":"I love shark movies as much as the next cinema-goer. But we should also reward high-quality filmBoy, does Jaws take you back, and I don’t mean only to that moment when, sitting cross-legged in front of the television in your pyjamas you saw a severed, crab-crawled hand, and ran terrified from the room (as a child, I managed to see it all the way through only on my second attempt, and even then there was a sticky palm over at least one eye in the scary bits). Nor am I making reference to CGI, a wizardry still far off in 1975 (as every fan knows, three pneumatically powered prop sharks were made for the production – and yes, they do look a bit rubbish now).No, what I mean is that Jaws had it all in a way that movies only rarely do nowadays: loved by the critics (in the New Yorker, Pauline Kael called it “the most cheerfully perverse scare movie ever made”) adored by the Academy (at the Oscars, it was nominated for best picture, though it lost out to Milos Forman’s One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest) wildly popular with audiences (until the release of Star Wars in 1977, Jaws was the highest grossing movie of all time).But it also changed the landscape: the prototypical summer blockbuster, it would have three (crummy) sequels henceforth, studio bosses had in their sights an eager young audience that would return to the cinema again and again if the thrills, as opposed to the art, were just right. As Thomson notes, for all the brilliance of Jaws – great performances by Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss a gut-twisting score by John Williams masterfully calm direction from Steven Spielberg oh, and that great “comic-book Moby-Dick” speech Shaw delivers about the USS Indianapolis – there is a certain vacuousness at its heart. “The audience,” he writes, “is cheering when it is not moaning with terror. And it means nothing at all – not even the half-baked social criticism of the resort town that would rather not frighten tourists away. It is zero to the power of 10.”Zero to the power of 10. Are these the kind of numbers the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has in mind when it says it plans a new category of Oscar for “outstanding achievement in popular film”? I guess not. As some have already pointed out, the figures with which it is most preoccupied are probably the ratings of the TV Oscar ceremony, which fell to a new low this year, though perhaps it also has an anxious, tokenistic eye on Black Panther, which has taken some $1.35bn at the box office worldwide and is now the ninth highest grossing movie of all time. (Quite why it believes seeing the producers of Black Panther collect a statuette will improve ratings is anyone’s guess their speeches will be just as drippy as anyone else’s, unless they fly in on a remotely piloted jet.)Others, though, beg to differ – by which I mean those who really care about film. For them, we’re now fully into zero to the power of 10 territory. When Adam McKay, director of The Big Short, heard the news, he suggested some other possible new categories: “Best movie where shit blowed up good” and “hottest female alien”. Rob Lowe couldn’t even bring himself to crack a joke. “The film business passed away today,” he said. “It is survived by sequels, tent poles and vertical integration.”This isn’t snobbery, on their part, or mine. The point, surely, is that popularity is its own reward. If an intricate, singular, challenging film also turns out to be popular, well, bingo. But it’s the intricate, singular, challenging film that the Academy should be in the business of celebrating, not the merely popular. Not, of course, that it’s possible to feel even the remotest sense of surprise at this decision. On the Booker longlist, there squats a pretty bog standard crime novel, Snap by Belinda Bauer. At the National Portrait Gallery, visitors can see a Michael Jackson exhibition in which the images on display reveal nothing at all save for the fact that no revealing image of him exists. Placed end to end, the column inches that have been devoted to Love Island in recent weeks put even the megalodon to shame.Popularity is in the air we breathe, from politics to culture, the latter being to a degree a natural corollary of the former the result of much the same nervousness that has struck dumb our representatives when it comes to explaining, say, the full consequences of Brexit (or, among decent Republicans in America, of Trump). All of which makes it all the more vital that some small pockets of resistance remain. Hooray for Black Panther and the rest. But before you get in the popcorn, tell me this: what great, mind-changing films are out there that we haven’t all yet seen?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3bce2f4b0e7b015d1907542d957534654041503/559_179_3038_1823/master/3038.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=48ece1a837a4e2c7682072754046d0c7","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"A Sumatran orangutan, fireflies mating and a sea lion cooling off in record-breaking Californian heat are among this week’s pick of images from the natural world"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f3d5a72b996bb15bcd4fdca9ad1cba6839d69a74/0_168_4480_2688/master/4480.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d4ed488b03669c962e538d8bc95efae5","title":"rubber gloves fashion summer 2018 prada marc jacobs","story":"This season’s It buy is not a bag, and is not weather-appropriate. Rather, it’s a pair of statement summer gloves. Black, or brightly coloured, usually in synthetic rubber or PVC, they have nothing to do with practicality – and everything to do with aesthetics.First seen this year on Vogue’s February cover, where Nicole Kidman sported a pink pair from Italian maker Sermoneta, gloves appear twice in its September issue, the largest and most scrutinised of the year: Rihanna wears orange Prada gloves on the cover and, inside, a lace pair by Cornelia James.Most high-fashion gloves are black. Those in Marc Jacobs’s springsummer collection were long and matte Max Mara’s were also long, in tight leather. Aalto has a pair in marigold orange, while pink rubber gloves in Raf Simons’ Calvin Klein collection cost £385 and bear an uncanny resemblance to washing-up gloves. At Richard Quinn’s show, chintzy tops came with gloves attached to the sleeves, and ballgowns were paired with leather gloves at Valentino.The trend is proving stubbornly long-lived. Autumn variations come in pink and purple (Chanel), or shiny black (Moschino). They’ve even made it into menswear – Raf Simons’ eponymous label saw models in long mustard pairs. And, while one of the most surprising accessory trends of recent years has been the single statement earring, Louis Vuitton models wore just one leather glove.With the global market for high-end personal goods at its lowest since 2009, none of this is hugely surprising. Brands are doing what they can to push revenue – and accessories currently drive sales far more than clothing. That does not make them any easier to wear in real life. Elle’s fashion features editor, Sara McAlpine, thinks collectibility could be part of their appeal. “I don’t even like gloves, but I was quite into an embroidered tulle pair by Gucci,” she said.

Chelsea were far from perfect, even shaky at times during the first half, but they improved as the game progressed and made off with maximum points from their first league match under Maurizio Sarri. N’Golo Kanté, Jorginho and Pedro scored and the visitors could have added more goals but Huddersfield had their moments, too, and there were times when Sarri seemed to chew particularly hard on the item he had in his mouth throughout the match, which looked suspiciously like a cigarette filter.“If you look at the result you think about an easy game but in the first half we were in trouble against a very physical team,” admitted Sarri. “The best part was we showed our capacity to suffer. Then in the second half the opponents were a bit tired and it was easier.”The last match between these teams concluded with Huddersfield celebrating rapturously, as May’s 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge confirmed they would compete in the Premier League again this season. Survival is their primary aim again and this was a reminder that the challenge remains formidable. They played well but were well beaten. Yet there were moments when another upset seemed feasible. “If you want to create a sensation you need the small margins to go for you but they did not,” said the manager, David Wagner.The goalkeeping debutants highlighted the difference in the way these clubs operate. Ben Hamer made his first appearance for Huddersfield following his free transfer from Leicester City while Chelsea gave an immediate start to Kepa Arrizabalaga after this week’s world record £71.6m move from Athletic Bilbao. The visitors also gave a Premier League debut to Jorginho, who struggled during last Sunday’s Community Shield after joining from Napoli for £50m. That is more than Huddersfield’s total outlay on eight summer signings. And, of course, Chelsea had a recently crowned world champion in their ranks, though few would have foreseen Kanté opening the scoring. Yet that is what the Frenchman did, finding the net in the 34th minute to claim his first goal in nearly a year.Perhaps Sarri did envisage that. The manager assigned Kanté a slightly more advanced role than he has filled in previous seasons, appointing Jorginho as the deep scavenger in Chelsea’s midfield trio and allowing Kanté to probe down the right, often combining with Pedro. The breakthrough goal came, however, after a period in which Chelsea’s midfield had been overrun by their more dynamic hosts.Huddersfield had also made regular incursions down the flanks, as Florent Hadergjonaj and Chris Löwe exposed Chelsea’s back four, with Marcos Alonso in particular difficulty.The visitors were lucky not to concede a penalty when David Luiz handled after trying to use Alex Pritchard as a springboard as he leapt for a header. The referee decided the Chelsea defender had been fouled, a decision he might have reversed with the benefit of VAR.Up until then Arrizabalaga had been the busier of the two keepers, slashing at a couple of attempted clearances and making a routine stop from a shot by Pritchard. Despite their spluttering, Chelsea took the lead 10 minutes before the break.The move that created the opportunity was slick even if Kanté’s finish was scruffy. Jorginho began it in midfield before Pedro fed Willian, who skittered down the left before crossing. Kanté mishit a volley from nine yards, perplexing the keeper and sending the ball bouncing into the bottomcorner.Huddersfield almost equalised within two minutes but Steve Mounié’s terrificheader rebounded out off the inside of the post – small margins.Chelsea struck again just before the interval thanks to their best move of the half. Jorginho and Barkley combined on the edge of the area to slip the ball through to Alonso, who had made a burst into the box. Christopher Schindler tried to poke the ball off the left-back’s foot as he shot but the referee judged that he caught the player. Jorginho ignored the boos to convert the penalty with outrageous audacity, duping Hamer with a delicious feint before rolling the ball into the net.For the second half Wagner introduced Laurent Depoitre, who scored against Chelsea in both matches last season. But the visitors had found a groove and never looked like losing their lead. Antonio Rüdiger tried to increase it but Hamer pushed away his header from a corner. Two minutes later another header by Rüdiger was going wide until Alonso hooked it against the bar. Alonso threatened again from a long-range free-kick, missing by a couple of yards. Sarri’s side were not quite dominant but were definitely the more dangerous, and there was no need for the manager to disrupt Eden Hazard’s rest on the bench until the 76th minute.That was in response to a spurt by Huddersfield, for whom Mounié went close with another header. It took less than five minutes for Hazard to make an impact. After receiving the ball he skedaddled forward and flipped it through to Pedro, who finished with a neat dink over the advancing Hamer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cfe82bd83641776a2497628586b3447e829ab516/0_170_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2abbc4925e72ac01f0ce7bf0be35c6bc","title":"manchester united director of football","story":"• José Mourinho has been unhappy with transfer policy• It is unclear how Portuguese would react to the moveManchester United are set to appoint the first director of football in their 140-year history, as soon as the current restructure of the club and expansion of facilities are complete.The move will allow United a continuity of football style and ethos as well as a more streamlined transfer policy. It is understood this is also recognition by the hierarchy of the need to modernise in an era when managers are often in situ only for the short term. This can lead to disjointed recruitment and a disconnect between the manager and the executive.United suffered precisely this in the transfer window that closed on Thursday. José Mourinho believed he required a frontline centre-back to strengthen his squad and while the board led by Ed Woodward, the executive vice-chairman, was supportive it was not prepared to sanction what was viewed as the exorbitant valuations demanded for the manager’s particular targets. Woodward is still expected to have a key role in recruitment following the appointment of a director of football, with Mourinho and his successors still substantially involved in player recruitment.In the summer, the manager identified Leicester’s Harry Maguire, Bayern Munich’s Jérôme Boateng, and Atlético Madrid’s Diego Godín as possible signings. Yet United decided against a move for any of them as the conclusion was that none would markedly improve on the central defenders already at the club, Eric Bailly, Marcos Rojo, Phil Jones, Chris Smalling and Victor Lindelöf. This left Mourinho frustrated at the board and the executive bemused at some of the manager’s public pronouncements regarding transfer policy.A director of football would provide a buffer between the hierarchy and manager with the extra layer of expertise designed to maintain United’s style and ethos. This will allow an instantly recognisable blueprint to identify players and any fresh manager appointment.It is unclear how Mourinho might react if a director of football is appointed during his tenure. After Friday night’s 2-1 win over Leicester he acknowledged his influence over transfers has waned, when complaining about missing out on a centre-back.Mourinho, whose side won thanks to goals from Paul Pogba and Luke Shaw answered only by Jamie Vardy in added time, said: “I had my plans for many months and I find myself with the market closed in a situation I did not think I would be in. I think football is changing and managers should be called head coaches.”An example of how a director of football can work is available nearby. At Manchester City, the champions have Txiki Begiristain, under the job title of sporting director. A fundamental part of the Spaniard’s role is to identify suitable managerial candidates, as was the case with Pep Guardiola, appointed in 2016.United have previously adhered to a long-term managerial model and while this remains the ideal the demands of the position have become more relentless, often making a tenure at an elite club a two or three-year cycle. After Sir Alex Ferguson’s retirement in May 2013 David Moyes was given a six-year contract in the hope he could build a similar dynasty at Old Trafford to his predecessor. Ferguson was in charge for 26-and-a-half years but Moyes was sacked in April 2014 and his replacement, Louis van Gaal, lasted two seasons before being succeeded by Mourinho.Mourinho, who is contracted until June 2020, has suggested any title challenge this season is unlikely and that defending the second place achieved in May will be difficult. The view from the top of club is that the Portuguese can be too reliant on short-term fixes and that given United’s strong defensive record in his two seasons in charge Mourinho should be able to mount a credible title tilt.The executive believes that if an increased number of goals can be provided in support of Romelu Lukaku – who top-scored with 16 in the league last season – then the 19-point gap to City can be bridged. This places pressure on Mourinho to coax improvements from Pogba, Marcus Rashford and Alexis Sánchez, among others.United are discussing the expansion of their training complex in Carrington because the recently formed women’s team requires facilities and extra personnel. Once these changes are executed it is expected the director of football will be appointed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/057aa05b8e0cd6332375786ae75b1b5ec81917a6/51_450_2132_1279/master/2132.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e1bfbb9e8e874b3b0e5e827561334f2f","title":"newcastle tottenham premier league match report","story":"Even by football manager standards it is a creative excuse but the good news is that Pochettino is infinitely more convincing as a coach than an economist, and his young squad were arguably not really in need of reinforcement anyway.Although Spurs were most definitely not at their best in the warm Tyneside sunshine they still enjoyed an opening-day victory, with Jan Vertonghen and the quietly impressive Dele Alli both scoring on an afternoon of excellent crosses, towering headers and dodgy defensive cameos.“Newcastle showed massive energy and it was difficult for us but I feel so proud,” said Pochettino, whose side included five players, Harry Kane among them, who resumed training only last Monday after returning from post-World Cup holidays. “Everyone showed their commitment to the club.”Tottenham’s manager looked irked when someone suggested the hard-working if seemingly ring-rusty Kane had lost his edge. The England striker “is at his best”, Pochettino replied, “but Harry can’t score a hat-trick every week”.Rafael Benítez said he believed Newcastle at least deserved a draw. He did, though, acknowledge that merely competing with Spurs necessitated his team being at full throttle throughout. “A difference of quality made the difference between the teams,” explained the home manager pointedly. “When you have money and you buy players you buy quality.”The day began with Newcastle fans staging a protest against Mike Ashley’s stewardship of the club outside a city centre outlet of his Sports Direct chain, chanting: “We want Ashley out.” Although the distribution of 200 chocolate bars to shop workers by the organisers emphasised the demonstration’s peaceful nature, targeting Ashley’s business signified an escalation of long-festering discontent. It seems a transfer market profit of around £20m was a watershed for protestors who want to see Benítez receive the funding required to pursue silverware.For now Newcastle’s manager says avoiding relegation is the target and he looked suitably dismayed as Spurs took a ninth-minute lead from a corner. Christian Eriksen’s outswinger was flicked on by Davinson Sánchez for Vertonghen to direct a header against the underside of the bar. Goalline technology confirmed the ball crossed the line.Joselu equalised within three minutes. The Spanish striker – preferred, controversially, to the West Brom loanee Salomón Rondón – was cued up by a fabulous left-footed, right-wing Matt Ritchie cross. Joselu dodged the suddenly dozy Sánchez before powering a header beyond Hugo Lloris. The intense glare Pochettino shot his errant centre-half spoke volumes. The same applied to Ritchie’s expression when he was later replaced by Christian Atsu and was caught on camera mouthing an expletive.Spurs restored their lead thanks to the defensively vulnerable Serge Aurier’s excellent cross and a fine header from Alli, who timed his late run to perfection. That goal prompted yet another glare, this time directed at DeAndre Yedlin by Martin Dubravka. Alli’s clever movement had thoroughly deceived the former Spurs right-back.Almost imperceptibly Pochettino’s players took their foot off the pedal and regressed. Where previously they had manipulated the ball with dexterity and calmed Newcastle’s ferocious tempo now every other pass suddenly seemed badly weighted. Benítez’s players duly forced their way back into things and Mo Diamé’s 12-yard left-foot shot hit a post.A fine Joselu through-ball might have created a goal for the Brazilian Kenedy, had the Chelsea loanee’s touch not let him down. At the other end Dubravka did well to block Moussa Sissoko’s shot after the former Newcastle player – did Spurs really pay £30m for him? – met Ben Davies’s superb cross.Eric Dier, Sissoko’s sidekick in what swiftly morphed into a new-look 4-3-3 formation for the visitors, was perhaps slightly lucky not to receive a second yellow card after fouling Ayoze Pérez. Rondón replaced Joselu and saw a late shot deflected on to the bar.Pochettino’s tiring defence wobbled but somehow clung on with a constant anti-Ashley soundtrack as the backdrop. How Benítez must wish Brexit was his only worry."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f364ef21f5a1b1949a35651102da9669dd5a7d6d/0_143_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f5f4ab20d7fabea1840f53e84a918d6b","title":"wolves everton premier league match report","story":"As the old saying goes, you get what you pay for. A seesawing match packed with plenty of incident including a straight red card for Phil Jagielka and four goals ended in a draw after brilliant performances from two 21-year-olds on either side.More than a few eyebrows were raised when Everton paid £40m to Watford to sign Richarlison a few weeks ago but the Brazilian showed exactly why he is rated so highly with two goals that seemed to have secured an opening day victory for his manager, Marco Silva.Yet in Rúben Neves, who scored a stunning free-kick before setting up new boy Raúl Jiménez for a late equaliser to earn a deserved point for his side, Wolves have a real gem. Purchased for £15.6m from Porto last summer, despite his tender years Neves is already the fulcrum of the team built by Nuno Espírito Santo that, on this evidence, look good enough to do more than merely survive.The Wolves manager said: “Rúben has this kind of talent but it is all about the organisation of the team. That is what is fundamental to our side. He came last season and adapted well to English football but this is a player who was captain of a big club when he was 17. At 21 now he still has a lot of things to improve.”In their first match in the top flight since 2012, Wolves fielded four new faces including goalkeeper Rui Patrício and João Moutinho in midfield, who boast almost 190 caps for Portugal between them. The club’s last Premier League campaign ended in relegation with 25 points after Mick McCarthy was sacked in February but – after the low point of spending a season in League One – Molineux is a different place these days.Fosun, the club’s Chinese owners who are estimated to be worth around £60bn and have a stake in super agent Jorge Mendes’s Gestifute company, already invested heavily in the playing squad before the arrival of the likes of Patrício, Moutinho and Adama Traoré, who joined from Middlesbrough for £18m this week. The intention – as witnessed by the fireworks that preceded kick-off here – is clearly to make quite a bang.Silva was taking charge of his first match after replacing Sam Allardyce at the end of May, having been unceremoniously dumped by Watford four months earlier, and was delighted to see Richarlison pounce in the 17th minute after some sloppy defending from a Leighton Baines free-kick.That certainly was not in the script for the home supporters and Everton seemed to be coasting towards victory until disaster struck four minutes from half-time. Jagielka was under minimal pressure from Jota as he allowed a pass to run across his body but after a slip of concentration the former England defender was shown a red card for clumsily bringing down his opponent. “It was a really harsh decision,” said Silva. “Maybe the game would have been different if we had 11 men.” Neves stepped up and curled the resulting free-kick into the top corner to rub salt into their wounds.Jordan Pickford will have been disappointed to have conceded after seeming to take a step in the opposite direction at the crucial moment, although there was no doubting the quality of the strike from a player who made a knack of scoring spectacular goals in the Championship last season. With Gylfi Sigurdsson sacrificed in favour of Mason Holgate in an attempt to shore up his defence, Everton retreated deep into their own half and it seemed only a matter of time until they conceded again. The Mexico striker Jiménez wasted the best chance when he failed to finish off Ryan Bennett’s superb through-ball, failing to find a way past Pickford as he charged off his line.They were made to pay when Richarlison combined with Baines and Cenk Tosun to curl a wonderful finish into the corner of the net to set up a frantic finale. “We had very good organisation in the second half and looked like we could score more goals after that,” acknowledged Silva.It was not to be. Espírito Santo threw on Léo Bonatini and Rúben Vinagre as Wolves poured forward in search of an equaliser and they were rewarded when Jiménez touched home another pinpoint cross from Neves 10 minutes from time. With him in the side, who knows what may be possible this season."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09865bfca6a3916215098e2d1e17d1eac72647e7/0_103_3584_2150/master/3584.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=26ebb0ea1a3d59d5f7453aad53c2822c","title":"the big premier league preview football weekly extra","story":"Max Rushden is joined by Barry Glendenning, Andy Brassell and John Brewin for Football Weekly’s bumper preview of the 2018-19 Premier League seasonRate, review, share on Apple Podcasts, Soundcloud, Audioboom, Mixcloud, Acast and Stitcher, and join the conversation on Facebook, Twitter and email.

I hoped a MyHeritage test would bring me the peace I needed my Irish mother had never been able to give me any information about my biological father. Raised by her and my white dad, I’d always longed for a country to attribute my blackness to, or for help answering the ubiquitous “Where are you from?” question. I’d spent years making up exotic-sounding combinations to justify my appearance (some days Jamaican-Spanish-Swedish other days half Brazilian, or half Iranian). But, at 24, I was done with occupying a box of black ambiguity. Could I finally get a clear answer?The results arrived by email on a summer’s day last year. I clicked on the “ethnicity estimate” link, which offers an analysis of DNA by country, my heart pounding as I scanned the digital map.I had no cultural knowledge of Nigeria should I now start claiming it as my own? Did the results mean my very distant ancestors were Nigerian, or that my biological father was probably from there? Why did my features not resemble a typical west African? I felt more confused than ever.This wasn’t quite what the adverts had promised. Targeted marketing for home-testing kits shows smiling (often mixed-race) models under the banner “find out your ethnicity”, or urges people to book holidays based on their “DNA story”. It’s estimated the industry will be worth a staggering £7.7bn by 2022 in the last year alone, market leader AncestryDNA pulled in $1bn in revenue.While DNA home tests are more popular than ever, people are starting to raise questions about what happens after the results land. Concerns about the storage of sensitive genetic information were highlighted recently, when an open-source DNA testing site, GEDmatch, was used by the police to identify California’s Golden State Killer. As well as privacy concerns, there’s the emotional fallout of receiving confusing or life-changing results. Identities that have been cherished by families for generations can be dismantled overnight.Ayshah Blackman, in her 50s, is of Caribbean descent and lives in London. She had always known two things about her family: that they had Indian heritage, and that her father had another daughter he wasn’t in touch with. Last year, with his permission, she set about trying to track down her half-sister through the UKTV show The Secrets In My Family.Blackman was encouraged to take the AncestryDNA test as part of the programme, and thrilled to eventually connect with her long-lost sibling, living on the other side of London. But she was shocked by the details of the results according to the test, Ayshah had no Indian DNA at all. “It made me question my ancestry, the fact that I might not be what I thought I was. I began to think that my grandmother had had an affair, that my mother had an affair. My imagination ran riot,” she tells me.For people of African descent, whose inidual and collective histories are blurred by the legacies of colonialism, slavery and rape, what they know about their identities is particularly important. Blackman felt that one of the narratives woven through her family had been broken.“That little thing of not having any Indian ancestry is now sitting on my shoulder – I may not be as much a part of this tribe as I thought I was,” she says. “If I had to do it again, I wouldn’t.”YouTube is full of videos of people revealing their DNA results, often with “click me” headlines such as What Am I? and I Was Lied To – My Shocking Results. They film themselves “unboxing” test kits like a new toy and taking cheek swabs, and then cut to footage in which they analyse their results. Many seem astonished by what they find, and begin to question whether their parents have been unfaithful, or whether they have been misled about their heritage some clips are heartbreakingly difficult to watch.Rachel Nye, 30, from London, was also left without a clear answer. Nye’s mother has a black mother and a white father, but Nye has never known exactly where her grandmother was born.“My nana died in 2008 but was always very vague about where she came from. She often gave different answers,” Nye says. “Some days she was British-born, other days she was from Barbados, some days she was African. I remember seeing two passports – one of them was Kenyan – but the names and dates of birth were different.”Nye says she was frustrated by the lack of country breakdown within Africa despite the fact the vast majority of the world’s genetic variation comes from the continent, DNA testing companies often have very few samples from Africa.23andMe has launched a number of initiatives to redress this. In 2016, the company launched the African Genetics Project, offering free DNA kits to people with all four grandparents born in the same African country, or from the same ethnic or tribal group. Now it has launched the Populations Collaborations Program, which encourages researchers studying remote populations to submit their data to the website.But questions have been raised about the ethics of European and American scientists harvesting genetic information from Africans and African scientists for economic gain. 23andMe has announced plans to share the test results of five million customers with GlaxoSmithKline, the drugs giant, in order to facilitate the design of new drugs. (Users are asked if they want to participate in scientific research when they sign up.)Privacy is a major concern for everyone using these sites, but perhaps more so for those from minority backgrounds. For those who are already discriminated against, having their genome used against them – for example, in the criminal justice system – could have serious implications. AncestryDNA’s privacy agreement states it can only share a customer’s DNA with research partners with explicit consent but it could disclose personal information to law enforcement if requested. (An internal report revealed that in 2017, AncestryDNA received 34 law enforcement requests, and provided information to 31.) MyHeritage asks customers to email if they want their sample removed from its database, though a representative tells me that the company does not sell or share DNA data with third parties. “We would need the explicit permission of our users – we do not own anyone’s DNA”, I am told on the phone. In 2010, to illustrate the privacy risks, researchers from the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research in Massachusetts identified nearly 50 people who had participated in an anonymous genomic study, based on publicly accessible information.There are many scientific limitations to the home DNA test. “These companies aren’t actually testing your ancestry at all,” says Mark Thomas, professor of evolutionary genetics at University College London. “They’re problematic in their claims to be able to infer an inidual’s ancestry.”There are a few reasons for this. First, the genetic information these DNA testing companies hold is based on living populations. When you send your spit off in a little tube, it is specific snippets, or markers, in your genome (the total collection of DNA that resides in your cells) that are being analysed, and then compared to the markers of others who are good representatives for distinct regions or ethnicities around the world. But as Thomas notes, the companies are only looking at very recent samples, from a relatively small group, in one specific database. “They are just saying: ‘If I wanted to make your genome, I could pull bits of your DNA from people all over the world who are around today. And this is just one way I could do it,’” he says.The databases are skewed towards different parts of the world, too. “23andMe has more American customers, and AncestryDNA has more British and Australian,” Thomas explains. “And none of these companies asks: ‘What do we know about the genetics of the past, and which of those past inferred genetic clusters do we get our ancestry from?’ They are giving us what the market wants, not what the genetics tells us.”There’s also the question of just how much information is passed down through a person’s DNA. Thomas explains that we probably inherit very few genes from our ancestors DNA is inherited in “chunks” that break up the further back in time you go. “You start with two parents, then four grandparents, then eight great-grandparents, it goes to 16, 32 and so on. And by the time you go 10 generations back, there are ancestors from whom you inherit no DNA.”I ask Dr Yaniv Erlich, who works for MyHeritage, how the company’s “ethnicity estimate” is created. He says they define good DNA “representatives” for English people as having “at least all of their eight great-grandparents born in England”. He believes you can “estimate that present-day iniduals probably reflect populations from about 200 to 300 years ago, as they never got DNA of any other ethnicity. Evolution is not acting fast enough to create any substantial changes.”But as the American academic Sheldon Krimsky and journalist David Cay Johnston explain in their online consumer guide, Ancestry DNA Testing And Privacy, markers maketh the result. “Today’s markers do not necessarily match the markers of 400 years ago, during the African colonisation and enslavement period,” they write. In other words, markers are inconsistent sometimes they’re passed on and sometimes they’re not. There might be a lot of genetic markers Nigerians share, for example, but that are not necessarily exclusive to them.Thomas tells me it is very possible that my birth father could be from anywhere, but have parents or grandparents who are Nigerian, or are from a “combination of countries with broad genetic similarities to Nigerians”.The bigger question is, how much should we connect geography and identity anyway? An inidual’s “ethnicity” is largely based on their own perception of cultural and social traits, not which geopolitical borders they were born between. And there aren’t universal genetic traits within certain groups, Thomas points out.“Let’s be honest, these companies are using ethnicity as a nice, polished euphemism for race, and they’re trying to define biological races using this genetic data. That in itself is shifty,” he says. “If genetics has taught us one thing over 30 years or so, it’s that there are no clearcut biological racial categories. Everyone in the world is racialised in some way. But rather than overturning these outdated notions of race, these companies are servicing them instead – presumably because they get better profits.”When I ask the home-testing sites about linking the language of ethnicity to science, they offer varying responses. An AncestryDNA spokesperson told me that “analysing DNA to determine a person’s ethnic breakdown is at the cutting edge of science”, explaining that they have “thousands” of DNA samples from around the world. “Each is from a specific location and most are accompanied by a documented family tree indicating deep heritage in a particular region.” A 23andMe spokesperson tells me the company does “not refer to ethnicity” in its analysis, instead calling it an “ancestry composition”. Yaniv Erlich of MyHeritage says: “Ethnicity is not encoded in someone’s genes, but this human-made construct can be in correlation with genetic variations. We use this correlation to infer the ethnicity.”After I got over the initial shock of my own test results, I began to explore the rest of the MyHeritage site. I was amazed to find that I could contact a fourth cousin on my biological father’s side – my first black relative – and that she lived in the same city as me. We plan to meet up, and my quest to find out more about my biology continues.But I know that decoding my DNA is only one chapter of my history. Ancestry is a legacy, not a bloodline. Our genetic script may be one of the most valuable things we own, but it’s never the whole story."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6730a49a419008421d7d5620d2cc60cdc386e2b/0_442_4286_2572/master/4286.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb3fb2fa3bf4d266660012e94d75f906","title":"yotam ottolenghi revamped british classic recipes","story":"Make over a prawn cocktail with a crispy twist, swap coronation chicken for chickpeas or recreate a famous lolly with these updated dishesMy take on three British summer classics is as eccentric as they come. The coronation chicken doesn’t include chicken, the seafood cocktail has got way too many ingredients, and the pudding is a homemade Solero, an ice-cream introduced by Walls in 1994 (– delicious, but scarcely old enough to qualify as a classic). I hope you’ll forgive such transgressions, because all three are deliciously summery and, in my book, British enough.My son gave these two thumbs up, which is high praise indeed.

Warm for about five minutes, whisking gently until the sugar and cornflour dissolve. Leave to cool, then transfer to the fridge to chill.Meanwhile, put the mango, the remaining 40g sugar and the peaches in a blender and blitz smooth. Tip into a bowl, stir in the passion fruit pulp and refrigerate to chill.Put the chilled cream mix and the creme fraiche in the bowl of a stand mixer and whip on a medium speed to very soft peaks – you don’t want to whip it too much: it shouldn’t be stiff and you should be able to spoon it easily into the moulds.To assemble the lollies, pour alternating large spoonfuls of the cream and fruit mixtures into the moulds to create a ripple, tie-dye effect. Tap the moulds a few times to make sure they are completely filled with the mixture and there are no gaps or air pockets, then freeze until solid – at least five hours, or overnight. To release, dip the moulds in hot water and gently pull out the lollies.This marie rose sauce is made with seriously charred chillies and tomatoes, and a whole garlic head. They give it a particular depth that I love, and you can use it with all kinds of cooked vegetables and meats. The seafood cocktail also works perfectly fine without it, though you can also serve the cocktail with a commercial tomato or chilli sauce.Prep 15 minCook 40 minServes 4 as a starterFor the marie rose sauce1 small garlic bulb, the top fifth cut off to expose the clovesFlaked sea salt and pepper180g cherry tomatoes4 large red chillies1 tbsp maple syrup2 tsp Worcestershire sauce½ tsp chipotle powder (or smoked paprika)60g mayonnaiseFor the fried seafood60g panko breadcrumbs40g desiccated coconut40g sesame seeds10g black sesame seeds2 makrut lime leaves, pulled off stalks and finely chopped (optional)100g plain flour2 eggs, beaten200g squid tubes, cleaned, patted dry and cut into 6cm x 3cm rectangles250g raw large king prawns, patted dry600ml vegetable oil1 red chilli, finely julienned1 spring onion, finely julienned1 lime – zest finely grated, to get ½ tsp, then cut into wedges, to serveStart with the sauce. Heat the oven to 230C450Fgas 8. Sprinkle the garlic bulb with some salt and pepper, wrap tightly in foil and put on an oven tray lined with baking paper alongside the tomatoes and chillies. Roast for 20 minutes, until the vegetables begin to blacken and blister, then remove from the oven. When cool enough to handle, squeeze the garlic cloves into the small bowl of a food processor, and discard the papery skins. Add the chillies (deseeded, if you don’t like too much heat), tomatoes, maple syrup, Worcestershire sauce, chipotle powder and half a teaspoon of flaked salt, and blitz to combine. Leave to cool completely, mix in the mayonnaise and refrigerate.While the garlic is roasting, mix the panko in a bowl with the coconut, sesame seeds, lime leaves (if using), a teaspoon of flaked salt and a generous grind of pepper. In a second bowl, mix the flour with two teaspoons of flaked salt and plenty of pepper. Put the eggs in a third, shallow bowl.Set a metal rack over a tray, then prepare the seafood. Dip the squid and prawns first in the flour, then the egg and finally the panko mixture, shaking off any excess as you go, then lay on the rack while you coat the rest of the seafood.Heat the oil in a large saucepan on a medium-high flame and have ready a large tray covered with plenty of kitchen paper. Once the oil is very hot, fry the chillies and spring onions for about two minutes, stirring them with a slotted spoon until crisp and golden brown, then transfer to the lined tray and sprinkle with a little flaked salt.Fry the squid and prawns in batches, so you don’t overcrowd the pan. Drop each piece carefully into the oil and fry for one to two minutes on each side, until golden brown and very crisp. Transfer to the lined tray as you go, and sprinkle with flaked salt.When you’re ready to serve, arrange the fried seafood on a platter and sprinkle over the lime zest, fried chilli and spring onions. Serve with the marie rose sauce and lime wedges.There are many points of difference that distinguish this salad from the original coronation chicken that inspired it, but the sweet-savoury creaminess that makes the original so loved (or loathed) is still here and makes this, at least for me, a perfectly satisfying summer meal.

She lives in Nice, southern France, with her husband, Antoine, and their two primary school-aged children, and this was exactly the lifestyle they had in mind when they migrated from Buckinghamshire, eight years ago.To make their dream a reality, Kate had to commit to working Monday to Thursday in London, continuing with her senior marketing role.“I didn’t decide to be a long-distance commuter,” she says, “it was a byproduct of a move that was designed to provide a different lifestyle for us as a family. My husband and I had good jobs and a lovely life but we found ourselves asking: ‘Is this it?’ – commuting into\u0026nbspLondon, with the stress of rushing home at the end of the day to see the kids, aged four and two, before bedtime.”In France, Kate’s husband runs his holiday rentals and seasonal property management business mostly from home, so that he can look after the children when they are not at school. His mother also relocated to Nice, and helps with\u0026nbspchildcare.Knowing that her children are being raised by family rather than a nanny, are bilingual and have access to a wonderful life – skiing in winter, beach in summer – helps, but Kate still finds it hard being separated from them when she’s in London. “If the kids are ill or there’s a family emergency, the distance feels very real,” she says.However, she earns significantly more than she would if she worked locally, and it still makes financial sense to work this way, even with the additional overheads of their flat\u0026nbspin London.“The cost of living is higher in France,” Kate says. “But the commuting costs are actually cheaper now. I spend less per week doing a round trip from Nice to Gatwick than it used to cost to take the train from Leighton Buzzard to Euston every day, with car parking.” She says, however, that the family has been hit by the post-Brexit exchange rate, which is costing her several hundred pounds a month, as\u0026nbspshe is paid in pounds, while home expenditure is in euros.What she finds most infuriating about her work-life arrangement, though, is judgment from others. “There have been a range of comments from outright sexism to veiled horror that a woman could be doing something as outrageous as being away from her children during the week,” she says.But she is pleased she is doing her bit for feminism. “I know we’re in the minority in terms of role reversal, but for us this is a benefit. I like to think that we’re showing our son and daughter that mums can be career-oriented and professionally successful, and dads can be caregivers and homemakers. Life choices should not be defined by\u0026nbspgender.”The TUC believe the increase is down to people being priced out by unaffordable housing, and an inefficient transport system. But it seems the promise of a more wholesome, outdoors lifestyle – alongside a London income – is also a draw for some.Belfast to LondonKatie Scott and her husband, Jonny, left London for Northern Ireland, with their baby, in search of fresh air, green space and to be closer to Jonny’s parents. They rented out their two-bed flat in Brixton and now\u0026nbsplive in a lovely cottage surrounded by woodland, a river and fields.Initially Katie was working for Cancer Research UK in Belfast, commuting for an hour and a half each way, five days a week – with trips to London twice a month. But on returning after having their second baby, she was promoted to a role that involved travelling two-three days a week to the head office in Angel, north London.“I do the five-hour each way commute because it keeps me working for a large national charity,” she says. “The job market in Northern Ireland is completely different and charity jobs aren’t well\u0026nbsppaid, so I get the benefit of a London salary and much lower living costs.”Katie tries to condense her working days in London to avoid commuting back and forth in a day, and travel expenses are covered by her employer, so she is no worse off\u0026nbspfinancially.She stays with a friend or family member for two nights a week, which also enables her to catch up with her own family, who are mostly based in London. Once she is back in Northern Ireland, working from home, she is around for her children, making it to parent-teacher meetings or sports day, and doing the school drop-off and collection.“Seeing the kids running out in the garden or on the beach – 30\u0026nbspminutes away – makes all the travel worthwhile,” she says.Glasgow to LondonMay Rosenthal began a long-distance commute for different reasons. She lives in Glasgow, where\u0026nbspshe studied at university and has lived ever since, and gets the four-and-a-half-hour train to London early on Monday morning, returning home to her partner and\u0026nbspfour-year-old son late on a Thursday evening.Rather than craving a more idyllic\u0026nbsplifestyle, it was a dream job offer, as a researcher for the Victoria\u0026nbspand Albert Museum, that lured May back to London, where she grew up, to live and work part of\u0026nbspthe week.She worries about the impact of her choices on the rest of the family. “I’ve been doing the commute for a year and a half, and it now feels like we have a really good rhythm and balance but early on it was tough on\u0026nbspour son who got quite upset about it. And for my partner, it has definitely added pressure – in terms of having to deal with both the practical and emotional aspects of\u0026nbspraising our son.“We FaceTime twice a day, which really helps, but even that requires extra organisation from my partner, making sure there’s time to do it before and after nursery.”Financially it’s difficult but that’s more to do with working in a low-paid sector, says May. The weekly return train costs about £100, depending on times and how far in advance she books it. This eats into\u0026nbspher salary, but lower living costs\u0026nbspin Glasgow means they can make it work.“I couldn’t afford to do this job while living in London and paying for childcare,” she says.The family live in a large flat, with easy access to parks, museums and galleries, and when in London, May stays with her dad and his partner, paying a contribution to the household but “not on a proper London rent level”.An advantage to working this way is being able to concentrate fully on work while in London and on the train journey back to Glasgow – and then, aside from Fridays when she’s working from home, “it’s very much family time”, she says.“I’m proud that we are setting an\u0026nbspexample for our son of women doing fulfilling work, and of men having really strong caring roles. I think our set-up is building his resilience and adaptability and has been amazing for the relationship between my partner and our son.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64ef0db2c92a52723054b7daf19a16ebdf6a0fad/515_63_3235_1941/master/3235.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7b2077fb3f877dfc58837bba86379e0f","title":"one to watch rosalia flamenco randb pienso en tu mira","story":"If you’d predicted that flamenco would be the most exciting thing to happen to pop music in 2018, you might have been told to gather up your ruffles and scram.

We ask whyJohn takes a brief break from sweeping the polished floors in Swansea’s celebrated indoor market to ponder his momentous decision to vote Leave in the EU referendum.“If I had the chance, I’d change my vote,” he says. “There has been talk of a lot of job losses and I’m not happy with that. It’s just a mess. I don’t think they know what they are doing.”He is not the only Welsh voter switching sides amid dire warnings of economic turmoil, food shortages and threats to jobs if Britain leaves the European Union without a deal next March. A new constituency-by-constituency model by data scientists at Focaldata, which uses new YouGov polling, has found that 14 Welsh constituencies swung from Leave to Remain this year, putting Wales firmly in the pro-EU camp.In a cafe near the market, Geraint Davies, the passionately pro-EU Labour MP for Swansea West, puts the dramatic swing down to voters’ frustrations with the tortuous negotiations, and a growing realisation that the tempting promises about inward investment and jobs will come to little in the end.“People voted to leave the EU on the promise of more money for the NHS from the membership fee, access to markets and more trading opportunities, and taking back control of our borders,” he says. “People are now realising that a lot of those promises won’t be delivered.”Davies also points to a growing feeling that Swansea is losing out rather than benefiting from Brexit. Recent plans for a £1.3bn tidal lagoon in Swansea Bay to generate renewable power and proposals to electrify the rail line between Cardiff and Swansea have both been dropped by the government.“The overall amount of capital expenditure is being constrained because we have to pay a €40bn orce bill for leaving the EU. People are beginning to see that some of the big promises about investment are evaporating, and that is feeding into this feeling that we are being left out in the cold again,” he says.The city’s Brexit voters are increasing bewildered and disillusioned. Rachel Jones, who has been selling sweets from the family stall in the market for seven years, is so fed up with the uncertainty she says she wouldn’t bother to vote if she got the chance again.She says she wanted to register a protest vote by putting her cross in the Leave box: “Swansea is having a really hard time at the moment. If you walk around you just see boarded-up businesses and charity shops.” But she says that now uncertainty around Brexit risks the very future of the market. “People are frightened to spend money. Things have gone up in price but wages haven’t gone up. None of us knows what is going to happen.”Butcher Peter Mills, who voted Leave, says many people would vote differently given another chance. “I think the country would vote Remain now. Everybody is fed up – it’s gone on and on,” he says from behind his meat chiller. “I know a lot of money is coming from the EU, but whether we will have the money from Whitehall when we go out is another thing.”One of his customers, Mal Guard, who also voted Leave, says he wouldn’t vote again. “I probably wouldn’t bother because the government doesn’t listen to Joe Bloggs in the street. They listen to their own cronies and that’s it,” he says.Chris Lewis, the Swansea-born and bred Baptist minister who runs the food bank, says the city has never fully recovered from the decline of heavy industry in the 20th century. “It is a significantly deprived area. Regeneration hasn’t really replaced the industrial base that employed people in this area,” he says as a steady stream of people come in to pick up emergency food parcels.Lewis, who voted Remain, says many Leave voters were angry about the state of their community, which had been further impoverished by benefit cuts and austerity. “Some of it was a protest vote. They felt alienated by sort of every elitist, privileged government,” he says. “There was a degree of racism too – some people felt threatened by immigration.”But he believes Leavers are now switching sides as the reality of a Tory Brexit dawns on them. “Some of the people who voted as a protest have flipped. They think these posh idiots are leading us to disaster in a charge of the light brigade.”On the main shopping street in the east of Swansea, there is still considerable support for Brexit. Michelle Whitton, who works in an insurance call centre, says it is not going well but she would still vote the same way. “I’m glad I voted Leave, but whether we are going to get what we wanted I don’t know,” she says.But other Leave voters would choose differently now. Kaywan Ahmad, who is cutting a boy’s hair in a barber’s shop in Woodfield Street, says he feels as if he was tricked. “I read on Facebook that a vote for Leave was good for the NHS. But afterwards I realised it’s bad for the NHS,” he says. “I’d vote to stay if there was another vote.”Brexit has already hit his business. “I had about 12 Polish customers who used to work in Swansea. They would come every two weeks, but now they’ve gone back home,” he says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/739f1deaa14acabf4ba6291e56ddeb22ef68cc21/0_132_2737_1642/master/2737.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9f51c690a151e4e4893179d296042dec","title":"more than 100 pro leave constituencies switch to remain","story":"Major new analysis shows most constituencies now have majority who want to RemainMore than 100 Westminster constituencies that voted to leave the EU have now switched their support to Remain, according to a stark new analysis seen by the Observer.In findings that could have a significant impact on the parliamentary battle of Brexit later this year, the study concludes that most seats in Britain now contain a majority of voters who want to stay in the EU.The analysis, one of the most comprehensive assessments of Brexit sentiment since the referendum, suggests the shift has been driven by doubts among Labour voters who backed Leave.As a result, the trend is starkest in the north of England and Wales – Labour heartlands in which Brexit sentiment appears to be changing. The development will heap further pressure on Jeremy Corbyn to soften the party’s opposition to reconsidering Britain’s EU departure.Researchers at the Focaldata consumer analytics company compiled the breakdown by modelling two YouGov polls of more than 15,000 people in total, conducted before and after Theresa May published her proposed Brexit deal on 6 July. It combined the polling with detailed census information and data from the Office for National Statistics. The study was jointly commissioned by Best for Britain, which is campaigning against Brexit, and the anti-racist Hope Not Hate group.The 632 seats in England, Scotland and Wales were examined for the study. It found that 112 had switched from Leave to Remain. The new analysis suggests there are now 341 seats with majority Remain support, up from 229 seats at the referendum. It suggests that there is now a majority for Remain in Scotland and Wales – meaning greater pressure on the union following the UK’s departure. Young voters and those from ethnic minorities have also driven the switch to Remain.It comes with the prime minister still having to negotiate Commons votes over Brexit later this year and also the prospect of a parliamentary vote over the final Brexit deal. Plans are already being drawn up by May’s opponents to try to force a new referendum or election.On Saturday Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said those opponents had to work together to bring about a chance for people to have another say. “We have to work across party frontiers,” he said, speaking in Bristol at the first of a series of regional rallies in a planned summer of action by the People’s Vote campaign.Data scientists compiling the study used a technique known as multi-level regression and post-stratification, similar to that used by YouGov in its pre-election model, which proved far more accurate than conventional opinion polls. However, the polling sample used by YouGov for its election model was much bigger, covering some 50,000 people.The doubts among Labour Leave voters have been accompanied by a less dramatic hardening of Brexit support among Tory voters. While no constituencies saw a switch from Remain to Leave, support for Brexit went up in some constituencies. Remain campaigners said that the findings should give more MPs the confidence to back a Brexit rethink. However, some pro-Remain MPs are still doubtful that there has been a significant shift and think a second vote would be a huge risk.Eloise Todd, the chief executive of Best for Britain, said: “This groundbreaking research shows that Brexit is still not inevitable. People across the UK have witnessed the last two years of uncertainty with dismay and are thinking differently – 112 constituencies have switched to majorities that back staying in our current bespoke deal with the EU.“The sands of public opinion are shifting and politicians risk falling behind. Our research shows that the deal must be put to the people. Westminster should legislate for a people’s vote on the Brexit terms, giving the public the option to stay and build our future on our current deal with the EU.”Nick Lowles, head of Hope not Hate, said: “Our data shows a clear shift in public opinion against Brexit and people’s growing anxiety over how leaving the EU will affect themselves and their families. This cannot be ignored.“The rate of change appears to be quickening as the realities of what Brexit would mean become more apparent and the fears of a no-deal Brexit grow, especially for Labour Leave voters who initially believed that leaving the EU would improve their economic prospects. Brexit is failing these voters and the country as a whole. Politicians need to understand that public opinion has changed.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d13200f178de0f33cb45162e07d792431432c8d/264_90_5088_3053/master/5088.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=199f50d15c8918a97e2e3fa7ec23f15b","title":"carl zimmer genetics heredity epigenetics she has her mothers laugh","story":"The science writer and Yale professor on intelligence, the promise and dangers of gene editing, and how we get heredity wrongCarl Zimmer is a rarity among professional science writers in being\u0026nbspinfluential among the scientists\u0026nbspon whose work he writes and comments – to the extent that he has been appointed as professor adjunct in the department of molecular biophysics and biochemistry at Yale University. Zimmer has just published his 13th\u0026nbspbook, She Has Her Mother’s Laugh, a\u0026nbspsurvey of “the power, perversions and potential of heredity”. What is the book’s main message about our attitudes to heredity?Heredity is central to our existence and how we define ourselves. But it’s not what we think it is. It’s not just genes, for example. We inherit culture too, and there may even be other channels of heredity. And the way genes enable heredity doesn’t fit our common notions. We tend to imagine that we inherit particular genes from our parents, grandparents and so on, and that these shape us in ways that are easy to understand and trace. But that’s not how heredity works. Each trait is typically influenced by hundreds or thousands of different genes, and the environment in which those genes are acting makes all the difference to how we turn out.You talk in the book about how some of these questions were brought home to you when your first daughter was born in 2001. What’s your personal journey into the story of heredity?In 2000 my wife was pregnant with our first child, and our doctor asked us to go to a genetics counsellor. I thought this was pointless. But the counsellor started asking me questions and I suddenly realised I had a really terrible grasp of my family history. I felt very ashamed and irresponsible, because here was this child who would be inheriting a lot of my genes. This was the first time heredity went from being something I learned about in class to one of the most important things in my existence.Linking our traits to genes still has bad connotations for some people. Why is that?In the 19th century, people like Charles Darwin and Francis Galton framed heredity for the first time as a scientific question, and by the early 20th century some thought they had found the complete answer in genetics. In the short term, that had a terrible social impact, because several scientists and politicians felt we knew enough to control heredity for the betterment of society: to practise eugenics.These incendiary questions haven’t gone away. The links between genes and intelligence or race are still hotly debated. What is your take on those connections? There are lots of different ways to define intelligence, but the tests do measure a factor that is stable across people’s lifetimes and that is partly heritable. That’s a firm result, both from studies of twins and now looking directly at genes.Yet environment certainly affects outcomes too. Take height. It’s much more heritable than intelligence, but each gene on average just makes people an eighth\u0026nbspof an inch taller or less, and there are over 3,000 common genetic variants that influence height. On\u0026nbspthe other hand, everyone across the world today is a few inches taller\u0026nbspthan they were a few hundred years ago, and that has nothing to\u0026nbspdo with genetics. It has to do with\u0026nbspbetter food, better medicine, better health systems.A hundred years ago, people would use the discovery of genes to dismiss all the problems that face society, like poverty. They’d say: this is just genetic, and the only thing we can do to make it better is start sterilising people.One of the main ways our picture has changed in recent years is the concept of epigenetics: how genes are switched on and off in different cells at different points of our development and life. How important is that?Effects from the environment can turn on and off genes in a long-term fashion, and epigenetics is what makes that happen. So what your epigenetic profile looks like when you’re 50 depends on your life – the various contingencies and strokes of good and bad luck that you’ve had.There have been some studies suggesting that epigenetic effects can be inherited – but this is controversial. Do you believe it? The possibility of epigenetic inheritance is intoxicating because it raises the possibility that experiences can produce biological\u0026nbspchanges that are then passed down to future generations. It has completely taken popular culture by storm. We now have epigenetic skincare, epigenetic yoga… I’ve seen a book by a psychotherapist claiming that you\u0026nbspcan heal your psyche by treating\u0026nbspthe traumas of your grandparents that have been passed\u0026nbspdown to you.But there’s a lot of scepticism in the scientific community about the evidence for it in humans. The experiments are tantalising, but the studies are small, the effects are small, they haven’t been replicated, and they really strain the\u0026nbspimagination because you have to\u0026nbsprethink a lot of basic biology just\u0026nbspto make the idea work.The story of heredity may be changed by the fact that we can now edit genomes. Should we?We shouldn’t try to look to our genes for some quick, simple way to make life better. There are a few cases where that is going to be the case, but many more where it’s not. For example, Huntington’s disease or sickle-cell anaemia are life-threatening diseases encoded by a single gene mutation. You can imagine treating someone born with sickle-cell anaemia by rewriting a little bit of DNA in their cells to give them a supply of blood cells that don’t have this mutation, and in theory they should recover and lead long and healthy lives. It’s hard to argue with that.But when you intervene in a tiny clump of embryonic cells in a way that will pass down altered DNA to future generations, you need to think about what could be the broader effects. The risk could come when people read about the genetics of intelligence and say: “How much do I have to pay to get that programmed into my child?” It’s going to be hard to have any real control over this stuff. If one country says we’re only going to allow genome editing for fatal hereditary diseases and nothing else, then people may just go to some clinic in another country where they promise the moon and the stars for your children. In fact, this is already happening.You have had your own genome sequenced. What did you find out? The prospect of looking at my own genome was thrilling and terrifying at the same time. It turned out I didn’t find anything to get particularly worried about. But I did learn a lot about my\u0026nbspDNA. I’ve discovered exactly which pieces of DNA I inherited from Neanderthals and how they may influence my health. I’ve learned that I’m missing vast chunks of DNA found in other people. And I’ve also learned how hard it is to draw lessons from your own\u0026nbspunique sequence of DNA.Are people being allowed to do this testing without a full grasp of the real implications this information might carry?It is a kind of wild west. Companies, to a greater or lesser extent, will provide warnings about the information you might get and how to deal with it. For example, some people find out that their immediate family is not what they thought it was – maybe the person you thought was your father isn’t. These are the things the tests can reveal in a pretty clear-cut way, and they can be devastating.Where things get a little more problematic is when people try to read some sort of profound significance into the results about their ancestry. Say someone finds they are part Italian when they thought they were just German and Irish. It doesn’t make a lot of sense to start breaking out the pasta that you never liked before – as if your DNA carries culture on it. That’s just not how these things work.The more we understand about how heredity actually works and about our own values about heredity, the better experience we have of these things.•\u0026nbspShe Has Her Mother’s Laugh\u0026nbspby Carl Zimmer is published by Picador (£25).

I think it’s important we understand these scientific facts. We need that ammunition to counter the weird mistruths that are circulating within and outside science about sex difference”.To female scientists fed up with being treated as though their brains are the odd exceptions among their sex, Inferior is more than just a book. It’s a battle cry – and right now, it is having a galvanising effect on its core fanbase. On 31 July a crowdfunding campaign to send a copy of Inferior to every mixed secondary school in England with more than 1,000 pupils was launched by Dr Jessica Wade, a British physicist who writes 270 Wikipedia pages a year to raise the profile of female scientists. Within two days the campaign had raised £2,000. Yesterday it reached its original £15,000 target and was powering its way towards £20,000 – a figure which would allow the book to be sent to every state school in the country.“There’s nothing you want more than for people to be inspired by your work,” says Saini, 37, a multiple award-winning science journalist, who first became intrigued by sex difference research when she wrote about the menopause for the Observer. “What Jess is doing means such a lot to me. I hope if my book can empower her, it can empower other young women, and men, too.”The key message she hopes her readers will take away is that nothing in science suggests equality is not possible. “We are not as different as the inequalities in our society makes us believe we are. Even now, there are people saying we shouldn’t be pushing for gender equality because we’re never going to see it for biological reasons.” For example, many people think there are large psychological differences in spatial awareness, mathematical reasoning or verbal skills between men and women. “Actually, those differences are tiny, a fraction of a standard deviation,” says Saini. “Psychologically, the differences between the sexes are not enough to account for the inequalities we see in our society today.”Inferior is not a children’s book by any stretch of the imagination. It includes a firsthand account of female genital mutilation and deliberately examines a large number of academic studies in painstaking detail. But, like recent bestselling children’s books Goodnight Stories for Rebel Girls and Fantastically Great Women Who Changed the World, it could play a valuable role in breaking down gender stereotypes for the next generation of would-be scientists and mathematicians, and Saini is confident many teenagers will engage with it. “Girls and boys aged 13 or 14 upwards have really responded to the message, and the earlier we can get this message to them, the better.” She was the only girl in science and maths classes at school. “Even if it’s not overtly stated to you, just being in a minority – especially a minority of one – makes you think maybe there are some differences between the sexes.”Researching and writing the book has totally changed how she feels about herself, destroying her own “subconscious stereotypes” about women. “It made me look at the world differently. That’s the power of science.”In one of the most shocking chapters, Saini relays a letter written by Charles Darwin in which he argues that women are intellectually inferior to men. “He was looking at society. He saw women weren’t achieving as much and he treated us almost the way you would treat observations of lions or peacocks in the wild. He thought: this reflects the biological facts.”Even at the time, contemporary female intellectuals pointed out that this theory ignored a lot of obvious historical and cultural factors, but Darwin failed to take on board their arguments. “It was quite lazy of him, which is surprising, because he wasn’t a lazy scientist. He was usually so painstaking and thorough.”But she still admires him for everything he got right. “Even the best scientists can fall into this trap of looking at the world around them and thinking: things are the way they are because of nature.” After all, she points out, assuming 19th-century scientists could be biased but 21st-century scientists never are makes no sense. “That’s why, in the book, I look not just at the science, but at the scientists.”These range from Kristen Hawkes, whose research suggesting postmenopausal women played a vital role in increasing the human life has been met with dogged resistance from some male scientists, to Robert Trivers who, Saini shows, used evidence from a flawed 1948 experiment on fruit flies when he famously argued that men are more naturally promiscuous than women. “A lot of people – especially scientists – view science as perfectly objective and rational. But the questions researchers choose to ask, and the answers they come up with, are heavily affected by their prior assumptions.” At times, the book shows a staggering lack of respect from male scientists towards the work of their female contemporaries. “Science won’t improve unless we understand that we all have biases and those biases affect research,” says Saini.Since it was published in 2017, her book has sold 20,000 copies, won Physics World Book of the Year and triggered a worldwide “STEMinist” book club movement among feminist scientists, technologists, engineers and mathematicians. Saini says she has even had positive feedback about it from James Damore, a Google software engineer who made headlines last year when he wrote an internal memo arguing biological differences were the reason behind the low number of women in tech. “We need scientific arguments to counter those politically motivated statements,” she says. “These arguments matter personally, in terms of how we think about ourselves, but also politically. We cannot afford to be complacent. There are movements around the world that are trying to take back the rights of women – rights our mothers and grandmothers fought so hard for. We can take anything for granted.”Wade says the book gave her “all this power. You read it and you have evidence. You can debate it”. She set up the crowdfunding campaign because she suspected private girls’ schools would be buying it for their libraries, and wanted state school students to have the same access. “Reading this book when doing your GCSEs or A levels is the perfect time, because you’re making decisions that will impact your entire career. I want girls to recognise they can do anything.”The actor Daniel Radcliffe, a childhood friend of Wade, is planning to release a video in support of the crowdfunding campaign this week. He describes Inferior as “a truly mind-blowing book”, which has made him completely reevaluate his understanding of the world.“As many people as possible should have access to this book, and I am certain Jessie – who has always been the smartest person I know – is going to make that happen,” he says.Saini, a Londoner with Indian parentage, is working on her next book on the science of race. “Race science is more taboo, but the way prejudice plays out within the research illuminates similar issues as those of Inferior.”Despite the sexism and racism she has documented in science, she feels positive about the future. “If we catch children early, we can achieve enormous change. I don’t think anyone is born with prejudices. I’m optimistic.” She points out that, historically, male scientists gained their power by excluding women from clubs, societies and institutes. “Now women are forming their own networks. And there’s no limit to what we can achieve.”Myth: There is such a thing as a typical male brain and a typical female brain from birthFact: Research has found that only the tiniest gaps, if any, exist between boys’ and girls’ fine motor skills, ability to perform mental rotations, spatial visualisation, mathematical ability, verbal fluency and vocabulary. Under normal conditions, large gaps between boys and girls haven’t been found by scientists studying the typical development of babies. In fact, the overlap between the sexes is so huge that scientists have struggled to find and replicate results that suggest there is any real gap at all.Myth: Men are better at carrying out a single task, while women are better at multitaskingFact: In 2013 this claim was put forward in a press release summarising an important study by the scientist Ruben Gur on the brain wiring differences between the sexes, but was not detailed in the study itself.

Residents nearby said the homeless men living in Hamadryad Park had left shortly after Aaron French-Willcox, 19, was found cold and unresponsive in a tent at an encampment in the early hours of 13 February.French-Wilcox, who had type one diabetes and died from diabetic ketoacidosis, started living in one of the three tents at the site after he was reportedly caught taking the synthetic cannabinoid spice at a homeless shelter three weeks before his death. “He didn’t belong out here,” said a Cardiff rough sleeper who knew him. “He was a nice guy. Goodhearted. Just a decent 19-year-old.” The teenager was one of a growing number of homeless people in temporary and semi-permanent encampments throughout the UK, in what has become an increasingly common fixture of British life, living underneath bridges, clearings in woodland and quieter corners of city centres. The official rough sleeper count in England – widely considered a big underestimate – has strict rules about what constitutes a rough sleeper. People living in encampments are not necessarily included in the 4,751 people who bedded down outside overnight in 2017. The government is expected to release its strategy for tackling street homelessness within the next few days. The strategy aims to halve rough sleeping by 2021 and eliminate it by 2027.In the past year, encampments of varying sizes have been reported in cities and towns including Bristol, Milton Keynes, Cardiff, Manchester, Oxford, Sheffield, London, Northampton, Cambridge, Stoke-on-Trent, Leeds, Glasgow and Exeter.Police and councils are often quick to try to break up encampments and move people on using enforcement orders and public space protection orders (PSPOs).In the centre of Slough, eight homeless people camping outside a Catholic church have been issued with a notice to vacate by the local diocese. A church volunteer told local media that members of the congregation had complained about the encampment and said the group were “intimidating”.Last month, 10 police officers broke up a camp on the banks of the Severn near Worcester Cathedral where about half a dozen rough sleepers had been living. Days later, former camp members were reportedly seen sleeping rough in the city centre. Homeless encampments are also entering popular culture. For the first time in the soap’s 57-year history, Coronation Street is running a storyline on homelessness in which the longtime character Sean Tully experiences cashflow problems and ends up living at a homeless camp underneath railway arches. Matt Downie, the director of policy at Crisis, said: “People living in tents and cars and squats and various different forms of homelessness should just be viewed as part of the homeless population. To a large extent, the problem should be viewed as simply another form of rough sleeping.“It’s true that it’s an underrepresented group. We are pretty confident that the numbers of people experiencing those forms of homelessness aren’t picked up, particularly in the rough sleeping statistics.”Downie said a future in which US-style tent cities become a normal part of life in the UK would be “unimaginable”, but warned that more and more people would be forced to live on the streets and in encampments unless government policy changed.Last summer, Milton Keynes hit the headlines when more than 60 tents were pitched in underpasses and on the streets, many inhabited by low-wage workers, former soldiers and people with mental health issues. Milton Keynes council said it has since had success in housing the town’s rough sleepers. It said the number had fallen to just under 50, with 14 tents still standing in July. The council credited a partnership between homelessness organisations, police and other services to help house people, using charities with existing links to rough sleepers to get people into emergency accommodation. Peter Marland, the leader of the council, said higher rents and government cuts were the main drivers of the encampments. “A lot of this is to do with service cuts, whether that be the NHS, the police, some council services, those support services that were previously there if you had a drug or alcohol addiction,” he said.“With austerity, we’ve seen a lot of those services go away because homelessness had seemed to go away, but obviously what a lot of those support services were doing is keeping people away from being homeless.”At the start of the year, the Labour council launched a housing first scheme, which offers rough sleepers long-term secure accommodation alongside support services, which Marland said had helped get more than 50 people off the street. “Milton Keynes in a way is different. We’ve overtaken Liverpool and Sheffield in terms of our economy size. In becoming a big city, it means you get big city problems,” he said.“Quite early, we ruled out PSPOs. We didn’t want to criminalise the act of being homeless. Nobody wakes up in the morning and says: ‘I’m going to live in a tent.’”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1cf501077a3f5a114e0b9de34ff9cc4da13add34/0_308_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8a234f2fa5bf5bf5dbffa284c9437a55","title":"100m drive to end rough sleeping in england by 2027","story":"New strategy will offer mental health and addiction support, says communities secretaryA £100m government drive will aim to end rough sleeping in England by 2027. The new strategy, being launched by James Brokenshire, the communities secretary, on Monday, will offer help with mental health and addictions, as well as targeted support to get rough sleepers off the streets and into long-term accommodation.Brokenshire acknowledged that efforts to tackle homelessness had “not been good enough” and said he wanted to see quick progress in reducing the estimated 4,751 people sleeping rough on any given night in England.He told the Sunday Times the growing number of people sleeping on the streets was not consistent with “the type of country, the type of society that I profoundly believe we are”.Brokenshire said: “To see that number of people on the streets isn’t good enough. We need to make progress quickly with the new strategy.“We shouldn’t punish people for being homeless. This strategy is about how we can support people, how we can direct, and yes, sometimes challenge, some of those who are living rough to get into those services that will help make a difference.”The new strategy will take a three-pronged approach of prevention, intervention and recovery. About £30m will be spent on mental health and treatment for the misuse of substances, including the synthetic cannabinoid spice.Swift support will be offered to those in crisis, with the aim of keeping them from ending up on the streets in the first place. And trained helpers called navigators will provide inidual help to rough sleepers in accessing services and accommodation, backed by £10m in resources.Ministers are also expected to review legislation on homelessness and rough sleeping, including the Vagrancy Act, which dates back to 1824 and still makes it illegal to sleep rough or beg in England and Wales.

It will see teenagers choose to spend time teaching or working with charities, as well as the more traditional option of military preparation.Among the organisations supporting the call for a UK programme are the Association of Colleges, the charity Depaul UK, vInspired, the Wildlife Trusts and City Year UK, which co-ordinates opportunities for full-time volunteering within English schools. The group says that a pilot programme could show that such a scheme would have a major impact on “social mobility, integration, mental health, employability and public service provision”.“Full-time volunteers aged 18-30 already devote up to 35 hours a week for between three to 12 months to improve the lives of the most vulnerable in our society,” it writes. “Volunteering for charities, they support children to get better grades at school, help people sleeping rough, speed up the recovery of hospital patients and support environmental action.“Equally, youth fulltime social action is about preparing a young person to enter the labour market. The frontline work experience and careers advice they receive give them the skills and confidence to launch a successful career.”Former prime minister David Cameron championed the “big society” but some of his initiatives designed to encourage volunteering have run into difficulties. Last year, a Commons committee warned that the National Citizen Service, which backs shorter programmes designed to encourage personal and social development, may no longer justify the money spent on it unless costs could be brought down.The idea of a full-time social action programme for the young was examined earlier this year. However, a report by Steve Holliday, the former chief executive of National Grid, found that “more evidence” was needed before such a government-backed programme could be approved.Supporters of the idea of a national programme believe that government funding could allow groups to house volunteers and provide more generous support. However, there are unanswered questions about how to fund the scheme sufficiently to ensure that everyone has an opportunity to take part.Kevin Munday, chief executive of City Year UK, said: “We need 21st-century answers to 21st-century challenges. That’s why we are calling for a new type of national service, fit for the future.“We know from evidence at home and abroad that full-time social action can play a significant role in tackling issues such as educational inequality, homelessness, loneliness, the social care crisis and climate change. It also provides a platform to give our young people the skills and experience they need to shape and launch their careers.”Schemes for mandatory community service have been suggested in the past. In the wake of the 2011 riots, David Blunkett, the former home secretary, said such a service should become an “integral part of growing up in Britain, a rite of passage into adulthood, just as national service used to be for the 1950s generation”.A Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport spokeswoman said: “We have received the letter and will respond in due course.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b2b8291da73068e02eb7246c120505f35f5345a/0_427_7146_4288/master/7146.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c718d9f4c3dc15918ef3edb01776e1f0","title":"third of universal credit claimants face payment deductions","story":"One in three people on the government’s new welfare system are having their payments cut to cover debts, the Observer can reveal.In a sign of the troubling levels of indebtedness affecting some of the most impoverished communities, official figures show that hundreds of thousands of universal credit payments are being subject to deductions used to pay back arrears in rent, council tax and utility bills.Charities and campaigners warned that the deductions were driving people into poverty. Frank Field, the Labour chair of the Commons welfare select committee, said they were “fast becoming a main supply route to food banks”.Figures released by the Department for Work and Pensions under the Freedom of Information Act show that in May this year, 316,100 universal credit claims had deductions imposed on them by the government for reasons other than fraud penalties or jobcentre sanctions.Food bank workers said they were finding that many people were having amounts deducted to cover “advance payments”. These are a form of emergency loan given to claimants who have had to wait a long time for their first installment. Advances were expanded early this year in response to surging rent arrears among\u0026nbspclaimants.The increasing use of advance payments is one factor driving the surge in universal credit deductions. However, benefits can also be cut to repay rent, council tax and utility arrears, certain hardship payments and benefit overpayments.Field told the Observer: “This nationalised form of debt is fast becoming a main supply route to food banks. Too many people are left short of money under the present system. We need an alternative scheme like the one used by some of the utility companies who write off parts of the debt if they can get regular small repayments.”Abby Jitendra, policy and research manager at the Trussell Trust, Britain’s largest food bank provider, said deductions could be “the tipping point into crisis” for some. “Repaying an advance payment, for example, can be an unaffordable expense when taken from a payment that wasn’t enough to start with, pushing people further into debt at the time when support is most needed,” she said.Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: “Deductions from universal credit can make it harder for people to get by. People receiving universal credit are unlikely to have much slack in their budgets, so even small amounts can put a huge strain on their finances.“Building on last year’s improvements to universal credit, the government now needs to ensure deductions are made at a manageable rate and take a person’s ability to cover their expenses into account.”Charlotte Hughes, an anti-austerity campaigner who provides support and advice to benefit recipients, said deductions were unpredictable and often made without warning. “The first time somebody knows that money’s been taken out of their account is when they go to the bank,” she said. “It’s just a minefield.”“Living with that stress that you don’t know what money you’re going to get from week to week, from month to month, that makes you ill – and that’s before you can’t eat, and before you can’t look after your kids properly. It’s rampant.”A spokeswoman for the Department of Work and Pensions said: “We recognise the importance of safeguarding claimants who have incurred debt and there are protections in place for vulnerable claimants, but we also have a responsibility to the taxpayer to collect advances of benefits where\u0026nbsppossible.“With universal credit, people are offered a range of assistance, including personal budgeting support to help them manage their money.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f4b16752117a69830916e51fa5a4e4e6cf5cef9/112_195_3316_1990/master/3316.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bb3cc5fc789404aa6f65032c14033b05","title":"dina asher smith european championships","story":"Two down, one to go. On an evening where the westerlies carried the first hints of autumn Dina Asher-Smith lit up the Olympiastadion with a scalding display of power and poise to add the European Championships 200m title to the 100m gold from earlier in the week.The 22-year-old’s time of 21.89 not only smashed her own British record by 0.16 sec but it left the reigning world 200m champion, Dafne\u0026nbspSchippers, trailing in her wake. Now the recent history graduate is close to creating her own legacy by becoming the first Briton to win a treble of golds at the same major\u0026nbspchampionships.To complete the set she just needs her 4x100m teammates to get the baton round on Sunday night without undue stress or trauma and a golden history will be hers.“I have obliterated my own expectations,” Asher-Smith said after her 200m performance, understandably beaming from ear to ear. “I told myself loosely this year that I wanted to run a 10.8 for the 100m – I had a joke with my physio that if I ran a 10.85 I would\u0026nbspbuy myself a cute necklace that I have been eyeing up that is a bit expensive.“The other day I was like: ‘Oh no I might have to buy it and it is expensive.’ Coming into the 200m I didn’t have a time in my head because I didn’t know how tired I would be\u0026nbspand it is a bit cold. I just wanted to win.”But she did so much more than that. She knew that being drawn on the\u0026nbspoutside of Schippers in lane five made her a target for the Dutchwoman. So she made sure that she started like an adrenalised greyhound, tearing away from her blocks to establish a 10-metre lead in the opening half of the race.Schippers then finished like a train to take silver in 22.14 but Asher-Smith was long, long, long gone.“If I am honest I am still in a haze,” added Asher-Smith. “I was just thinking: ‘Get out there, you are a double world champion inside you, run, maintain form,’ all those coaching tips. I knew I had to go like a bat out of hell because she is coming for me\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspthere was no way she was\u0026nbspgoing to let me win this. I had the fear of God inside me.“It was over in a blur and I was just full of happiness and relief.”However, while Schippers praised her rival, calling her “world-class”, she also offered a word of warning. “She is running really good times but next year is a different year,” she said. “For a lot of people this is an off year, so in 2019 we’ll see how it goes.”Another Dutch athlete, Jamile Samuel, took bronze in 22.37 while Britain’s other finalists, Bianca Williams and Beth Dobbin, were sixth and seventh respectively.There were three other medals for Britain on the penultimate day of these championships including Shara Proctor winning bronze after an enthralling women’s long jump and two more in the 4x400m relay.When the smoke had cleared, Proctor’s best leap of 6.70m was just\u0026nbspfive centimetres behind the German gold medallist, Malaika Mihambo. However the Ukrainian Maryna Bekh produced a last round effort of 6.73m to leap above Proctor and take silver.“I came away with a medal but\u0026nbspI’m\u0026nbspnot happy with a bronze,” said Proctor.”Jazmin Sawyers was even more gutted after slipping out of the medals in the final round. “I’ve never been fourth, and it is as bad as they say,” she admitted.Britain’s third athlete in the final, Lorraine Ugen, who holds the world lead of 7.05m, could manage only 6.45m and finished ninth.There was a British silver medal in the men’s 4x400m after Martyn Rooney produced a storming last lap of 44.3sec to move his team from fourth to second. However, as Spain’s Bruno Hortelano tied up in the final 100m, Belgium’s Jonathan Borlee - one of three Borlees in the team - charged past him to take gold in 2min\u0026nbsp59.47sec.Britain’s quartet of Rabah Yousif, Dwayne Cowan, Matt Hudson-Smith and Rooney were just under a second\u0026nbspfurther back, with Spain taking the bronze.Hudson-Smith said: “I had the worst night’s sleep of my life. I got to the track and said: ‘Give me deep heat.’ But this man – Rooney – did the job. He’s the boss, isn’t he?”In the women’s 4x400m relay Britain’s team of Zoey Clarke, Anyika Onuora, Amy Allcock and Eilidh Doyle\u0026nbspearned bronze behind Poland and France after a brilliant final leg from the specialist hurdler Doyle.Britain now have 13 medals in these championships and will hope for at\u0026nbspleast three more on Sunday’s final day, with Laura Muir a piping hot favourite in the 1500m and both men’s and women’s 4x100m relay teams also expected to win gold."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ae5b92b05752bd2ad84edd1eb0b6deb4d4f0965/0_90_4537_2721/master/4537.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b6dbe8adedf0f7b7b02b5d97d7d0c5e4","title":"england india second test chris woakes","story":"The most timely of interventions from Chris Woakes kept England in charge of the second Test. The Warwickshire all-rounder purred to his maiden Test century in just 129 balls, which was rapturously received on the England balcony and everywhere else in the ground. Alongside Jonny Bairstow, Woakes demonstrated that it was possible for batsmen to prevail at Lord’s, after all their partnership of 189 enabled England to build a formidable lead – currently 250 – that surely ensures victory provided the weather cooperates.When Woakes first played for England in the Oval Test of 2013 against Australia he batted at six. Here he was at seven yet, on an unusually dry day, no one above him batted with more assurance. Given the complications surrounding the engine room of the England team it is extremely handy that Woakes should re-establish his credentials as an all-round international cricketer upon his return to the side. Three days ago the England set-up was agonising whether to make Moeen Ali or Woakes their 12th man and the damp weather probably clinched their preference for another pace bowler. Now there is no way Woakes can be omitted from this team whatever the conditions.When Woakes joined Bairstow there was a danger that England might squander their brilliant position: 131 for five already meant a lead of 24 but India were still in the game. By the time this pair was parted England were so far in front that Joe Root could start contemplating a weather-induced declaration. While Bairstow scurried away with increasing authority after an edgy start, Woakes purred from the start of his innings. At last – with the advent of Sam Curran and the restoration of Moeen – England may have the sort of selection problem they crave in their Test team.Batting was easier than on Friday, though never entirely straightforward. When England were bowling the ball was swinging treacherously, something which the Indian bowlers were unable to emulate on Saturday. But there was some uneven bounce and movement off the pitch for the pace bowlers, especially while the ball retained some hardness and the Indian pacemen some gas in their tank. Five batsmen fell before reaching 30 to demonstrate the challenges, after which run scoring became a breeze. Virat Kohli ran out of bowlers, especially when it became obvious that Kuldeep Yadav, a wish-fulfilment selection, was something of a liability.India stayed in the game throughout the first 35 overs, picking up wickets just as the England innings looked set to accelerate. It quickly became apparent that the Indian bowlers were not finding that late swing. Even so, Mohammed Shami conjured just enough from around the wicket for Keaton Jennings to be lbw and for England to waste a review. Then Alastair Cook, who had looked in fluent form, attracted another fine delivery, not from Ravi Ashwin this time but Ishant Sharma and he edged to the keeper. This is not just an unlucky streak, however at his very best Cook found a way to combat those good deliveries.So Ollie Pope did not have to wait long for his first Test knock. He clipped his first ball confidently to square leg but straight to the fielder his second sped in a similar direction but this time it went to the boundary. Pope timed the ball sweetly and looked composed but not for very long. On 28 he was struck on the pad by a delivery from Hardik Pandya. Pope is an Oliver unacquainted with reviewing the situation but after advice from a sympathetic Joe Root at the other end he asked for a consultation with the third umpire. Thus England had lost both their reviews inside 22 overs.Soon after Root himself was lbw to a ball from Shami that kept low. Jos Buttler, who has now graduated to being a specialist number six and second slip, flickered before he too fell to Shami. Buttler has developed a shuffle to the off-side as a trigger movement, which encourages him to aim through the onside. This is fine when he is in princely form, as he was at the start of the summer otherwise it is a risky method.Meanwhile, Bairstow busily accrued runs but not always from the middle of the bat. But the problem for Kohli was that he was running out of overs from his two pacemen. Pandya, only a semi-pro at this level, did his best, while Ravi Ashwin was accurate enough but unable to find the same amount of turn as at Edgbaston. Just occasionally Kuldeep, at a gentle pace found turn, but he was so inaccurate that Kohli could not trust him for long.The partnership prospered with very few alarms. Woakes reached his century with a pull shot to mid-wicket off Pandya and was warmly applauded by a full house, which was prepared to do the same for Bairstow. However, they were denied that opportunity. On 93 Bairstow drove away from his body and Dinesh Karthik behind the stumps ed to his right to hold a superb catch. But the sixth-wicket stand, the highest by England against India, had transformed the game.Out came Sam Curran and 37 more runs were added swiftly as the skies darkened, whereupon the umpires took the players from the field, even though the multimillion pound floodlights were burning brightly – a decision greeted with more enthusiasm by the Indian fielders than the batsmen or those who had parted with £110 to watch this contest from the stands."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a908178e849cca1408cbb7ece6cd7b4af966dd68/23_128_3467_2079/master/3467.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3a27cdc044ee6e4d04eec84034161b98","title":"grace reid diving gold european championships","story":"Tom Daley’s aquatic adventures of late have been restricted to his brave new world of baby bathtime and the paternal enrapture it can bring. Even on his soon-to-conclude leave of absence his benign influence endures. Grace Reid climbed the stairs on the final attempt of the very last round of the 3m springboard competition at the European Diving Championships in her native Edinburgh with either a medal or despair hanging in the balance. A voice of experience rang in her ears.She lay third after four rounds. Her British teammate Alicia Blagg headed the standings but could only watch and wait. Daley, who won the mixed synchro title in tandem with Reid at the 2016 Europeans in London, had given his frequent partner clear and solid advice. “Not to be afraid to lead from the front,” she revealed. And the Scot, unafraid and nerveless, delivered somersaults and then a twist in the tale to snatch dramatic gold.Midway through an Olympic cycle these are the moments that can shape the two years ahead. To learn to win, as the 22-year-old has accomplished both here and at April’s Commonwealth Games, has immense value. Eighth in the murky green waters of Rio 2016, Reid has soaked up lessons from working in tandem with Daley and his long-time coach, Jane Figueiredo, since relocating to London 18 months ago.In the past she was merely an aspirant. Now she is firmly an achiever. “Here I qualified in second. I’ve not been there before. But if Tom was here, he’d have told me: ‘This is good. You’re the one being chased so embrace it.’ And I really did that.”Blagg, who is currently based at the University of Miami, saw progress even in feeling victory slip painfully away. She said: “It was about performing. The medal was a bonus.” It made it three for the day for the hosts with world championship medallists Matty Lee and Lois Toulson claiming silver in the 10m mixed synchro behind Russia’s Nikita Shleikher and Iulia TimoshininaReid will return on Sunday to pursue a third medal of the week in the 3m synchro in partnership with Kat Torrance. Daley will doubtless watch and feel pride at his role in spawning a new force. Reid confirmed she was braver for his influence. “No medals are won playing safe, so I gave everything I had – and it came off.”Meanwhile Great Britain’s men’s quintet of Max Whitlock, Dom Cunningham, James Hall, Joe Fraser and Courtney Tulloch took silver in the team competition at the European Gymnastics Championships in Glasgow as Russia successfully defended their title.A slim chance of gold for the hosts was extinguished in their final round when Hall and Cunningham both suffered falls on the concluding high bars. And it allowed the Russians to secure victory on 257.260 points, almost four clear of GB with France taking bronze. “It’s a shame about the bar,” said Cunningham. “I’ve never done that in my life. I didn’t even know where I was when I fell off. It’s been weird but this is gymnastics.”Whitlock will attempt to regain his pommel title in Sunday’s inidual apparatus finals but will expect a ferocious challenge from the Northern Irish challenger Rhys McClenaghan. The 25-year-old Englishman was more solid here than in qualifying but he lacks the air of impregnability which has surrounded him for so long.“I wanted to go through the routines as best as I can,” he declared. “It has given me a lot of confidence to push my pommel routine as best I can. I look back at London 2012, as far back as that. And I had the mind-set of going all out and giving it my best shot. That’s what I have to do every single competition.”If not anxiety, there is an air of fallibility surrounding the double Olympic champion. McClenaghan bested him at the Commonwealths. Whitlock badly needs to respond. “The nerves are slightly different,” he admitted. “I put a lot of pressure on myself. That’s one thing I need to take off as much as I possibly can. I look at every competition and I want to do my best. My motivation is to retain titles.”Elsewhere Britain’s Kyle Evans and Kye Whyte claimed European gold and silver in the men’s BMX final in Glasgow with France’s world champion, Sylvain André, settling for third. “The top six in the world are all from Europe, so it’s never going to be easy,” Evans, 24, said. “I worked hard at home and it paid off.” Laura Smulders of the Netherlands won the women’s event.Iceland were the surprise maiden gold medallists of golf’s new European Team Championships, picking up a trio of late birdies to win the mixed foursomes event at Gleneagles on three under par, one shot ahead of the unheralded British quartet of Meghan Maclaren, Michele Thomson, Liam Johnston and Connor Syme.With the inidual silver medallist Jess Learmonth and Olympic champion Alistair Brownlee opting out, a makeshift GB lineup finished a lowly 12th in triathlon’s mixed relay in Motherwell with France earning the European title ahead of Switzerland and Belgium."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6c6e7302b04348b72a776ac6c949debc653151c/219_178_1883_1130/master/1883.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=739d8ecca70f1dc96b558a952a33e987","title":"us pga championship 2018 day three second third round live","story":"Big trouble for Brooks Koepka! His ball has nestled in the roots of a huge tree on the right of 15. He’s got no option but to take a penalty drop. His third goes long and left of the green ... and he’s shortsided coming up a bank! This could be a very different tournament in ten minutes or so. Meanwhile Jason Day joins the group at -8 with birdie at the par-five 17th.The leader is looking human again. Having just dropped his first shot of the day, Brooks Koepka sends a big slice into the trees down the right of 15. Gary Woodland splits the fairway, and suddenly the world looks a lot different than it did just one hour ago, when he was losing his mind in the sand at 10. Life is better for Adam Scott, too, who responded to that yip on 15 by nearly making hole in one at 16 ... and calmly making his birdie. For a while back there, Koepka looked as though he might run away with this tournament, but nothing’s certain in golf, is it?Stewart Cink pars the last for a superb round of 66. Five birdies, one bogey, and he’s -8. Then it’s Tiger’s turn. He’s got a 15-foot uphill putt for a final birdie that’ll take the roof off the nearby clubhouse. But it always stays high on the left. That’s a par, and a 66. He’s -8 too, having parred the last ten holes. That three-putt on 17 will be stinging right now. And suddenly the lead is only three, because Koepka’s playing partner Gary Woodland birdies 14 to get himself back to -9! He’s alone in second again. This is a magnificent response to that meltdown in the sand at 10. He looked a broken man back there. But he’s pulled himself together in the way that potential major champions do! Meanwhile on 16, Adam Scott nearly replicates Matt Wallace’s hole in one! Not quite, and after that appalling yip on 15, you wouldn’t give him the putt. But he should make it, to move to -9. Let’s see.Finally a mistake by Brooks Koepka. He takes an iron off the 14th tee, and pulls it into the rough on the left. Perhaps worried about the hazard down that side, he sends his second into the bunker to the right of the green. For once, a scramble for par is beyond him, and the lead is back to just four: he’s -12. Meanwhile Jon Rahm rakes a 30-footer into the cup across 16. It’s his third birdie of a blemish-free round, and perhaps he’s in the best frame of mind to challenge Koepka tomorrow?Adam Scott’s putter finally lets him down. He misses a tiddler at 15 - an overhit pull, a real rush of blood - and suddenly Brooks Koepka has a five-shot lead. A double-bogey six for Pat Perez at 15, meanwhile, the result of a poor bunker shot and a duffed chip. He’s -6.Tiger gives his eagle putt a good clatter. Too much. It wheechs through the right-to-left break and stays on the high side. He’s got a three-footer for birdie coming back, though. He’s going to move into second pla....aargh! He yips it! That’s his second three-putt today, and a place in the final group tomorrow - and with it, a chance to put some crowd and match-play pressure on the leader - is a little less likely right now. His partner Stewart Cink nearly holes out for eagle from a bunker, but is more than happy to tidy up for birdie. The 2009 Open champion is right in the thick of it now!Koepka pulls his tee shot into the thick stuff to the left of the par-three 13th. Another test for his scrambling skills. He flips out softly to six feet, about the best he could do. And in goes the par putt. Man’s a machine! Woodland looks revived by his birdie on 12, meanwhile, and clips his tee shot to eight feet! A lovely shot. But he doesn’t quite hit his birdie putt, and it dies off to the right. His shoulders slump again. That would have been a huge fillip. He stays at -8. Kisner slices into the bunker on the right, but does extremely well to whip his second to three feet. That’s a great up and down. He’s still -7.But here’s something! On the par-five 17th, Tiger lashes a long iron from 250 yards into the heart of the green. He’ll have a 20-foot look at eagle. Back on 13, Rickie Fowler’s tee shot goes over the back. His chip comes out hot and he can’t sink the putt coming back. He slips to -8, a second shot gone since the turn. At 14, birdie chances go begging for Adam Scott (-9) and Justin Thomas (-8). Pat Perez makes par as well, in ludicrous style, driving into thick rough on the right, hooking towards the hazard on the left, hacking out of it and a good 25 feet past the hole, then making the par saver. He walks off shaking his head. He remains at -8. Meanwhile a much-needed birdie for Gary Woodland at 12, but Kevin Kisner drops another stroke. They’re both -8 now. Nobody in the chasing pack can get their act together. Nobody’s making a move at Brooks Koepka. There’s a slight dip in energy around Bellerive as the early birdie blitzes have quietened. Not much in the way of drama. Koepka finds 12 in regulation and will have another uphill 20-footer for birdie. It shaves the left rim. Par. Bogey for Shane Lowry at 13.Koepka flips a wedge up onto the dancefloor. Soft hands. He’s given himself a chance to scramble par from six feet. And in it goes! What an up-and-down from a very awkward position! He remains four in the lead at -13. It’s all too easy right now. Kevin Kisner, who had also disappeared down the swale, can’t get up and down and he slips back to -8. On 16, Tiger nearly holes a 40-foot left-to-right slider, but that’s seven pars in a row. He’s still -8. And up on 18, Rory McIlroy signs for a 71. He’s -2.But is Brooks Koepka about to make a rare misstep? He sends his tee shot at 11 into thick stuff down the right, and his second is a flyer that disappears down a swale at the back. That’ll be a tough up and down. Adam Scott is one turn of the ball away from birdie at 13, but his 30-foot effort stops just short. He remains at -9.That was heartbreaking for Gary Woodland. Awful luck to find his ball in his old disturbed sand. But you can’t blame his caddie. Dealing with his player as he took his second bunker shot would have taken precedence over raking the first bunker. And if you go from sand trap to sand trap, and then back again, you really only have yourself to blame. It’s hard to see the 34-year-old from Kansas coming back from that. He’s yet to finish in the top ten at a major. Holding the 36-hole record at the PGA won’t be much of a consolation if he can’t at least make the top ten this weekend.Back to the travails of poor Gary Woodland on 10. He only just gets his ball out of the bunker. It hits the bank, thinks about toppling back in, but sticks there. He nearly chips in for six, but that’s a triple-bogey seven, an awful mess. He crashes out of second place, down to -7. Just a par for Brooks Koepka, meanwhile, as he doesn’t hit his birdie putt. But he’s suddenly in total control of the 100th PGA Championship!HOLE IN ONE FOR MATT WALLACE AT 16! He sends his tee shot straight at the flag. Two bounces, a shuffle and a roll, and it’s in! He’s won a couple of times on the European Tour this season, but he won’t have heard a reception like the one that greets him now! A wonderful moment for the 28-year-old from west London! He picks the ball out of the cup, kisses it, and throws it into the crowd. That’s a lovely touch, making a precious souvenir for someone. Oh, he’s -5 now by the way.Disaster for Gary Woodland on 10. He finds the front bunker, then hits a thin one over the green and into the sand at the back! And this is getting ugly, because he makes exactly the same mistake again, sending his ball back into the first bunker! And that bunker hasn’t been raked ... and his ball’s settled on the sand he’d disturbed before. Back with that in a moment, because ...Here’s another man who can’t afford many mistakes, the way Koepka is going: Rickie Fowler. And he makes a three-putt bogey at 10. He’s back to -9. Back down the hole, the leader crashes another drive into Position A, then finds the heart of the green. He’ll have an uphill look at birdie from 20 feet or so.Tiger sends his second at 14 to six feet, but pulls the birdie putt. He briefly considers burying the head of the putter into the ground, bringing it high into the air and then motioning downwards. But common sense wins the day. However, he knows full well that he can’t be giving up chances like that when Koepka is relentless. He stays at -8.Jordan Spieth followed up his triple at 12 with bogey at 13. He lands his second at 14 roughly 12 inches from the cup, and nearly spins it back in. He’ll kick that one in for birdie, and he’s back to -4. But what a collapse, after getting himself into position. He’s alongside Jimmy Walker on the leader board: the 2016 champion has birdied 15, 17 and 2.Brooks Koepka hits the turn in 30. He’s managed that after making yet another birdie, at 9, having split the fairway with a big drive and sending his second to ten feet. Gary Woodland meanwhile can’t make a par saver from the fringe, and all of a sudden there’s a three-shot gap at the top! Koepka’s hardly breaking sweat. His resting pulse must be about 12.Thomas can’t make his birdie effort on 10. He swipes his putter viciously through the air, a study in frustration. That was such a good escape from behind the tree, it really deserved more reward. I’m sure he’d have taken a par before hitting his second, though, something his caddie is almost certainly telling him right now. One of the shots of the day by Justin Thomas, behind a tree down the left of 10. He sets his ball way out right, hooking back to the green. His ball lands pin high, 12 feet from the flag. Bogey looked a distinct possibility there, especially as there’s a creek running across the front of the green. Now he’ll be looking at birdie. Belated news of Rickie Fowler, meanwhile, who birdied 8. After picking up a stroke at 6, the man who has the best cumulative score under par at this year’s majors - but nothing to show for it, yet - is -10.Brooks Koepka clips out of the trees at 8, then hits the flagstick with his third. He’ll tidy that up for birdie. He’s -12, one clear of Gary Woodland, who finds the green in two, lags a 45-footer to 18 inches, and makes his birdie. Just the par for Kevin Kisner, who remains at -9. Meanwhile par for Tiger at 12, his fourth in a row. Birdie for Shane Lowry at 9. And the Open champ Francesco Molinari follows birdies at 2 and 8 with his third of the day at 10. He’s -8.Pat Perez birdies 9, and he reaches the turn in 33. He’s -8. His playing partner Adam Scott nearly makes birdie too, but has to do with par and turns in 31. He’s -9. And Julian Suri, the 27-year-old New Yorker whose family were instrumental in bringing cricket to India, is going along very steadily indeed. Birdies at 6 and 8, and he’s currently -7 for the tournament after 10 holes of his third round. Not bad for someone making his debut in a Stateside major, though he did finish in the top 30 at Carnoustie, so maybe we shouldn’t be so surprised.Brandon Stone’s had an up-and-down afternoon so far. Bogeys at 2 and 6 birdies at 3, 5, 7 and now 8. He joins the group at -8. Brooks Koepka hooks his drive at the long par-five 8th into the trees on the left. And up on 12, Jordan Spieth - whose shot from the trees went out of bounds - ends up with a triple-bogey seven. He crashes down the leader board to -4, so much good work undone in an instant. The career-slam dream will almost certainly have to wait another year ... but then we thought he was out of this year’s Masters, and very nearly snatched that from under everyone’s nose.Eventually they deign to cut back to what’s going on in the 100th PGA Championship. It looks as though Spieth’s second caromed off a tree, off to the right, where it’s either lost or OB, it’s not clear. So he drops and sends his fourth shot out of the forest, across the fairway, and into thick rough on the other side of the hole. This could end up being very costly.Jordan Spieth is four shots off the lead. He’s chasing a career slam. And he’s driven deep into the trees at 12. Slamming out with a hybrid, trying to get through a small gap between two trunks, I’m not sure he’s escaped. But there’s no way of knowing, because 11 Sports immediately cut to an interview with two spectators dressed in tiger suits. Who thinks this sort of thing flies with viewers? Who wants it? Nobody asks for it, do they.I knew that would clear somebody’s pipes. Adam Scott nearly makes the week’s first eagle at 8 with a 40-foot rake. He’ll settle for birdie, and moves to -9. His compatriot Jason Day reaches the turn in 33, having made two big par-saving putts at 8 and 9. He hangs on in there at -7. On 7, the leader Brooks Koepka batters a monster drive down the track, but can’t get up and down from 80 yards for another birdie. And at 11, Woods wedges to 15 feet, but only gives his putt - dead on line - 14 feet’s worth of energy. Par.The early flood of birdies seems to have dribbled to a halt. It’s almost as though all these big names, having gotten themselves into contention, are slightly less willing to take swashbuckling risks for birdie. You’ll thank me for tempting fate when it all starts up again in a few minutes.Bogey for Dustin Johnson at 5, the result of sending his drive into rough down the left of the hole. He slips to -6. Justin Rose drops a shot at 9 he’s -5. Chris Kirk sheds a shot at 12 he’s -5. And on 10, there’s predictable bedlam as Tiger guides in a right-to-left curler to scramble his par ... while the reigning Players champ Webb Simpson holes out from a bunker to remain at -5. Both players punch the air as their ball disappears from view. Not feeling so good with himself: Rory McIlroy, who follows up those back-to-back birdies by making an awful balls of the 12th. He sends his drive into the trees, and eventually runs up a double-bogey six. He’s back to -1, and any hope of a late run from the pack is finally extinguished.Koepka does very well to splash out of the sand at 6 to four feet, and tidies up for his par. He should be joined at -11 by Woodland, who had found the front of the green but watches in stunned disbelief as his 20-foot putt curls all the way round the right-hand side of the cup and stops at the back, teetering on the edge but stubbornly refusing to fall. He remains at -10. Bogey for Pieters at 7, a short putt pushed right. And on 10, Tiger wedges to eight feet and will have a chance of saving his par.Tiger slices his drive at 10 into thick rough on the right. He’s forced to lay up, not willing to take on the creek running across the fairway just before the green. Trouble for Koepka on the par-three 6th, too: he pulls his tee shot into the bunker on the left. Stewart Cink hits the turn in 33 strokes after birdies at 7 and 8: the 2009 Open champion is -6. Gary Woodland’s second into 5 comes hot out of the rough, and though it stays on the back of the green, he’s faced with a 70-foot putt. A two-putt par is far from a gimme, but he lags it up wonderfully. He’s not in the zone at all this morning, but doing very well to keep his round from spiralling out of control. That’s vital, because one of his partners, Brooks Koepka, continues to sashay round Bellerive in a very calm fashion. A 20-footer rolled with great confidence into the centre of the cup gives him a third birdie in the first five holes. Meanwhile a first birdie of the day for Rickie Fowler, after sending his tee shot at the par-three 6th to six feet.Jon Rahm has been quiet today. A run of six pars to begin. But he picks up his first stroke of the day at 7 to move to -6. Shane Lowry rattles in a 20-footer on 6 to haul himself back up to -7. And a par for Tiger, who turns in 31. He allows himself a smile, then a hearty guffaw. One word of warning: he’s -10 for the front nine this week, but +2 for the back nine. Let’s see if he can buck that trend on the way home.Jordan Spieth trundles a 25-foot birdie putt into the cup on 9. That’s three in a row, and he hits the turn in 31. Another big birdie putt for Adam Scott, this time at 6. Pars for Gary Woodland and Brooks Koepka at 4, but a birdie for Kevin Kisner. And another birdie for Rory McIlroy, whose putter seems to have finally turned warm, this time at 11. This is an absurdly talented - and bunched-up - leader board ... Rory refuses to down tools, despite being well adrift of the real action. He arrows his approach at 10 straight at the flag, and makes the putt for birdie. He’s -2. But back on 8, Tiger makes it three birdies on the bounce. Bellerive have waited an awfully long time to see Tiger in action the St Louis crowd are whipping up a storm in celebration of his talent, making up for lost time. He’s -8. Thomas Pieters meanwhile rakes in a biggie on 5 for his first birdie of the day. He joins Tiger, JT, Rickie and Kevin Kisner in a tie for third at -8.Tiger is rolling back the years. He eases a wedge at 8 to six feet. He’ll have a chance for his fifth birdie of the round. A second birdie for Adam Scott, this time at 5, and he’s -7. Birdie putts skate past the hole for Justin Thomas and Charl Schwartzel, at 5 and 4 respectively. And Daniel Berger - a major winner one day, surely - follows birdies at 1 and 8 with another at 10. He’s creeping up the leaderboard in style, having shot a second-round 65. He’s -5.We can forget about Rory McIlroy. He’s just hit the turn in 37, having bogeyed 1, 4 and 7. Just the one birdie at 2. He’s -1. More bad news for Irish fans: Shane Lowry has bogeyed 4 to drop to -6. Meanwhile Kevin Kisner nearly drains a monster across 3 for birdie. Not quite. Gary Woodland makes bounceback birdie, though, reward for a tee shot sent ten feet from the flag. He’s got a share of the lead at -10 with his playing partner Koepka, who pars the par-three. And Jordan Spieth continues to rise: he follows birdie at 7 with another at 8: he’s -6.Make that three off the lead ... because seconds later, Brooks Koepka calmly rolls in his birdie chance on 2! A perfect start for the US Open champ! Kevin Kisner meanwhile hits a hot chip 25 feet past the hole, though in truth he couldn’t do much better from the position he’d found himself. A bogey. Charl Schwartzel nearly makes a slam-dunk hole-in-one at 3, and suddenly the leaderboard has a radically different look about it:It’s been an eventful start for Justin Rose. He opened with a birdie, handed the shot back at 4, but has now carded back-to-back birdies at 5 and 6. He’s -6. Rafa Cabrera Bello meanwhile has hared up the standings: birdie at 14, eagle at 17 and now birdie at 1. He’s -5. And another birdie for Tiger, at 7, after sending his second over the flag to eight feet! He’s now only two off the lead, Woodland having tapped in and slipped back to -9.Trouble for Kevin Kisner on 2. He’s sent his tee shot into thick stuff on the right. The next one goes through the green. He’s in cabbage, facing a huge bank, with a peninsula of rough jutting across the path to the flag. Good luck getting up and down from there. Meanwhile Gary Woodland is in thick rough, crossing the water he nearly found with his tee shot. And he finds the drink with his second. That was never clearing the hazard, a good ten yards short. He’s playing four from the dropzone ... and very nearly holes out! His wedge stops six feet past the hole, and spins back ... just not quite enough. He’ll limit the damage to bogey, though. A result given the two awful shots that went before. Brooks Koepka meanwhile is on the green in regulation, with a 15-foot chance for birdie.Gary Woodland very nearly hooks his tee shot at 2 into the water on the left. He’s extremely lucky to get away with that. One more bounce and that was wet. His 64-66 start is the best 36-hole start in PGA Championship history, but there’s no sign of that form yet today. Early days of course. Jordan Spieth meanwhile has just birdied 7 to rise to -5. The career-slam seeking Texan has looked slightly out of sorts this week ... by his own ludicrously high standards. He’s only five off the lead!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/72a3100ee4e9f254ec741088b0ecf1c3673dfe2f/303_20_5424_3254/master/5424.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ae6876a2b75f39e3a654e520e6b3fdb5","title":"edinburgh festival 2018 pictures hamilton lewis formula one blue peter maureen lipman","story":"Tape Face strikes again, TV cult and internet sensation Limmy uploads his videos, while Owen Roberts lets a six-year-old write his show for this year’s fringe.

He continued to churn out one video after another on his website, app, and Twitter, where he has not been banned. But, while Infowars is still operating, experts say its reach has been greatly reduced. “This has potentially a massive effect on the reach of Infowars and the political power of Alex Jones,” said Daniel Kreiss, a professor at the school of media and journalism at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. “This significantly limits Infowars’ visibility in the public sphere.”Jones is urging his followers to come straight to his website – “the one platform that they CAN’T ban”, he tweeted – and plugging his app’s rise to the number one “trending” app on the Google Play store.And he’s leaning increasingly on alternate platforms that have sprung up in reaction to mainstream sites’ prohibitions on content they view as hateful or offensive.There’s Gab.ai, a Twitter-style site that brands itself “the free speech social network” and claims 500,000 users, and Real.Video, a YouTube alternative whose founder said it saw 350 new channels created in one day after the Infowars bans.Mike Adams, who founded Real.Video after his own channel was banned by YouTube, urged supporters to boycott mainstream platforms.“It’s going to get much worse if we don’t stop them,” he said in a video on his site. “The tech giants have now declared war on America...This has become the civil rights issue of our time.”Despite their growth, these alternative sites cater to a niche audience whose size pales in comparison to the platforms that banished Infowars.“It’s really hard to imagine there being an alternate social media network that comes anywhere close to having the same scale and scope as a Facebook,” Kreiss said. “It is the de facto public sphere in a lot of ways. It is the one thing that everyone is on. People from all walks of life, all demographics, all ideological persuasions,” he said. “There is simply no alternative to that.”Jones’ channel on YouTube, which had 2.4 million subscribers, was one of the most recommended on the site, according to an analysis by researchers Jonas Keiser and Adrian Rauchfleisch. Once the page was gone, Fox News became the most recommended channel in far right and conspiracy circles, they found.Jared Holt, a researcher with Right Wing Watch at People for the American Way who has pushed to get Jones’ pages removed, said the bans will make the casual internet user far less likely to come upon Infowars.“Infowars has existed for decades and has built its own distribution networks, so for the most dedicated Infowars fans this is merely an annoyance,” he said. “But the greater effect this has is that Alex Jones and Infowars cannot distribute these kinds of vitriolic conspiracy theories and smears as easily to the general American public.”In videos posted since the removals, Jones has alternated between bravado and desperation.“I am not backing down,” he said in one video, though he acknowledged feeling “spiritual-level desperation” and seemed to see Trump as his only hope to regain his larger platform.“Come out before the midterms and make censorship the big issue,” Jones said in an appeal to Trump.“It’s the right thing to do, Mr President. It’s the truth,” he said. So far, Trump has not ridden to the rescue."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/174f976ae0212e5d394cab57c78115bd45ff1ec5/0_174_3500_2102/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fe22014aac5feb1ab73c37edd24fe992","title":"conservatives call for constitutional convention alec","story":"Lawmakers push for ‘constitutional convention’ to restrict federal government – and it’s not as far fetched as it soundsIt’s been more than 230 years since America’s last constitutional convention, but there is growing confidence in some conservative circles that the next one is right around the corner – and could spell disaster for entitlement programs like medicare and social security, as well court decisions like Roe v Wade.“I think we’re three or four years away,” said the former Oklahoma Senator Tom Coburn on Friday, speaking at the annual convention for American Legislative Exchange Council (Alec) – a powerful rightwing organization that links corporate lobbyists with state lawmakers from across the country.Coburn, a veteran Republican lawmaker, now works as a senior adviser for the advocacy group Convention of States, which seeks to use a little known clause in article V of the US constitution to call a constitutional convention for new amendments to dramatically restrict the power of the federal government. Coburn, who retired from the Senate in 2010, said that the American republic is “failing”, and that such a convention is the “only answer” to the problems the country faces today.“We’re in a battle for the future of our country,” Coburn told the assembly of mostly conservative state lawmakers meeting in New Orleans. “We’re either going to become a socialist, Marxist country like western Europe, or we’re going to be free. As far as me and my family and my guns, I’m going to be free.”Convention of States, with Alec’s support, is one of three prominent conservative groups pushing for a new constitutional convention. Under article V, if two-thirds of state legislatures so choose, they can force congress to convene such a meeting. On the agenda for Convention of States: an amendment to require a balanced budget, term limits for congress, repealing the federal income tax and giving states the power to veto any federal law, supreme court decision or executive order with a three-fifths vote from the states. “The only chance we have to restore this country, that is peaceful, is this convention,” said Jim Moyer, a Convention of States supporter and attendee at the Alec annual meeting.Their partnership with Alec makes success that more likely. No group in US history has been so successful at getting similar and sometimes nearly identical pieces of legislation passed in multiple states, often within a period of one or two legislative sessions. Unity among conservatives seeking an article V intervention is paramount. For the convention to be triggered, all 34 states have to ask for the same thing. Once they do though, critics argue the floodgates open. “Once you call a convention literally anybody can bring up anything,” said Jay Riestenberg, a spokesperson for the non-partisan watchdog group Common Cause. “We can bring up an amendment to overturn Roe v Wade or the Civil Rights Act,” Riestenberg added.Coburn and Dunway both bristled at the possibility of what is known as a “runaway convention”, where conventioneers go beyond their original mandate, perhaps so far as to write an entirely new constitution. This is technically what happened during the framing of the current constitution in 1787, when attendees were tasked with amending the Articles of Confederation, but wound up crafting something new entirely.Coburn cited the three-fourths barrier – three out of four states need to agree for any proposal made to become law – a firewall to concerns over “runaway”. “All it takes is 13 judiciary chairmen, in 13 states, to stop anything stupid that might come out of that,” Coburn said. “Nothing’s going to happen, I’ll stake my life on that.”The panelists broadly tabbed “liberals” as the opposition to their hopes, but the politics of an article V convention aren’t so cut and dry. Some of the most virulent opposition to the movement has arisen in the far right John Birch Society which argues that a convention could “rewrite our constitution and destroy its protection of our rights”.Conversely, some liberal groups have also pushed for an article V convention in response to the supreme court’s 2010 Citizens United ruling as a means to winnow back the influence of money in politics. A group called Wolf Pac leading that charge and has secured legislation in five of the 34 required states.Tom Buford, a Republican state senator from Kentucky, said he’s been to both of the “simulations” that Convention of States has staged – including one held in 2016 at Colonial Williamsburg complete with period costumes and wigs. “I support their thought, I’m OK with it, but I’m not the poster child,” Buford said. He thinks some of the proposals, like veto power over the supreme court go too far, and said that decades in state government have shown him the limitations of things like balanced budget amendments.“A balanced budget amendment is a nice idea, and it will make people feel happy if that amendment were to pass but it wont solve the problem,” Buford said. Kentucky (like every other state besides Vermont) has a balanced budget clause in its state constitution, but lawmakers routinely find ways around."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39874b701b6cf7d4ffa49232ad4f89fab2a6fc25/0_319_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a62f735c602e15e7871fdf4c18e7438a","title":"canada saudi arabia support us","story":"As Saudi officials lashed out at Canada this week, the US remained on the sidelines, signaling a blatant shift in the relationshipSoon after Donald Trump took office, it became clear that the longstanding relationship between the United States and its northern neighbour was about to change: there were terse renegotiations of Nafta, thousands of asylum seekers walking across the shared border and attacks on against Canada’s protectionist trade policies.But this week laid bare perhaps the most blatant shift in the relationship, as the United States said it would remain on the sidelines while Saudi officials lashed out at Canada over its call to release jailed civil rights activists.“It’s up for the government of Saudi Arabia and the Canadians to work this out,” state department spokesperson Heather Nauert said this week. “Both sides need to diplomatically resolve this together. We can’t do it for them.” Canada’s lonely stance was swiftly noticed north of the border. “We do not have a single friend in the whole entire world,” Rachel Curran, a policy director under former Canadian prime minister Stephen Harper, lamented on Twitter. The United Kingdom was similarly muted in its response, noted Bob Rae, a former leader of the federal Liberal party. “The Brits and the Trumpians run for cover and say ‘we’re friends with both the Saudis and the Canadians,’” Rae wrote on Twitter. “Thanks for the support for human rights, guys, and we’ll remember this one for sure.” The spat appeared to have been sparked last week when Canada’s foreign ministry expressed its concern over the arrest of Saudi civil society and women’s rights activists, in a tweet that echoed concerns previously voiced by the United Nations. Saudi Arabia swiftly shot back, expelling Canada’s ambassador and suspending new trade and investment with Ottawa, making plans to remove thousands of Saudi students and medical patients from Canada, and suspending the state airline’s flights to and from Canada, among other actions. Speaking to reporters in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia’s foreign minister urged Canada to “fix its big mistake” and warned that the kingdom was considering additional measures against Canada. Analysts and regional officials said the spat had little to do with Canada, instead characterising Riyadh’s actions as a broader signal to western governments that any criticism of its domestic policies is unacceptable. Several countries expressed support for Saudi Arabia, including Egypt and Russia. But Canada continued to stand alone, even as state-run media in the kingdom reported the beheading and “crucifixion” of a man convicted of killing a woman and carrying out other crimes. Justin Trudeau, Canada’s prime minister, said Canada was continuing to engage diplomatically and politically with Saudi Arabia. “We have respect for their importance in the world and recognise that they have made progress on a number of important issues,” he told reporters this week.He insisted, however, that his government would continue to press Saudi Arabia on its human rights record. “We will, at the same time, continue to speak clearly and firmly on issues of human rights at home and abroad wherever we see the need.”In this particular dispute, Canada did not need US help, said Thomas Juneau, a professor at the University of Ottawa. “Saudi Arabia-Canada relations are very limited, so there’s not a lot of damage being done to Canada right now,” he said. “But this should be a source of major anxiety: when a real crisis comes and we are alone, what do we do?”The week’s events have added impetus to a conversation that is slowly getting underway in Canada, Juneau said. “We are starting some serious soul-searching in the sense of what does it mean for Canada to have a US that is much more unilateral, much more dismissive of the rules and the norms and of its leadership role in the international order that it has played for 70 years?” These changes south of the border have clearly emboldened Saudi Arabia, Juneau argued, describing the kingdom’s recent actions in Yemen, Qatar and Lebanon as a pattern of aggressive, ambitious and reckless behaviour. He saw no immediate end to the row, particularly as neither side is suffering significant costs in the dispute. Saudi Arabia has shown little inclination in recent years to walk back from its reckless and impulsive behaviour, he said, while Canada’s federal government – facing an election in some 14 months and already under fire for signing off on the sale of more than 900 armoured vehicles to Riyadh – is loathe to be seen adopting any kind of conciliatory posture towards the conservative kingdom. While some in Canada had been disappointed to see the UK and Europe opt to publicly stay out of the diplomatic spat, Juneau described it as unsurprising. “When Saudi Arabia had comparable fights with Sweden and Germany in recent years, did Canada go out of its way to side with Sweden and Germany? No, not at all,” he said. “We stayed quiet because we had nothing to gain from getting involved. So on the European side, the calculation is the same.” Canada’s lonely stand for women’s rights in the kingdom did earn the support of some around the world this week saw the  and the New York Times publish editorials urging Europe and the US to stand with Canada. So did the Washington Post, going one step further by publishing their editorial in Arabic.Their call was echoed by a handful of prominent voices in the US, including Bernie Sanders. “It’s entirely legitimate for democratic governments to highlight human rights issues with undemocratic governments,” the US senator wrote on Twitter. “The US must be clear in condemning repression, especially when done by governments that receive our support.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4715c68f05c9e3c440ee1a16af87a908e094f4a8/0_82_5304_3183/master/5304.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c21d5d98a8f4a811005cc7873905c8b2","title":"erdogan urges turks to sell dollars and euros to support lira","story":"Turkey’s currency has plummeted as relations with the US have worsenedThe Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has repeated a call for Turks to sell dollars and euros to support the national currency, which has been in freefall over concerns about the economy and deteriorating ties with the US. On Saturday, Erdoğan urged Turks to help support the lira to win what he described as a “war of independence”.“If there are dollars under your pillow, take these out,” he told supporters in the north-eastern Turkish town of Ünye. “If there are euros, take these out … immediately give these to the banks and convert to Turkish lira and, by doing this, we fight this war of independence and the future. Because this is the language they understand.” A financial shockwave ripped through Turkey on Friday when its currency noseed over concerns about the country’s economic policies and a deepening row with the US. Washington and Ankara have been at odds over a wide range of topics – from erging interests in Syria to Turkey’s ambition to buy Russian defence systems, and the case of evangelical US pastor Andrew Brunson. Brunson is currently on trial in Turkey for espionage and terror-related charges linked to a failed coup attempt in the country two years ago. On Saturday, Erdoğan said it was a pity the US was choosing Brunson over its strategic Nato ally.He also said it was wrong of the US to try to bring Turkey into line with threats, a day after Trump doubled tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from Turkey.“I am once again calling on those in America: it is a pity that you choose a pastor over your strategic partner in Nato,” he said. After almost 20 months in a Turkish jail, a court moved Brunson to house arrest in July. Since then, Trump and his vice-president, Mike Pence, have repeatedly called for his release, while Ankara has said the decision is up to the courts.He added: “Our relations with Turkey are not good at this time!” In what appears to be a diplomatic riposte, Turkey later said Erdoğan had held a phone call with Russian president Vladimir Putin to discuss economic ties, suggesting it might gravitate further away from its Nato allies toward cooperation with Russia, whose relations with the west are at their most strained since the cold war."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6669e11b980fb4d382dc744200cb0d47c0f8e33d/0_207_4096_2458/master/4096.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e456c9b67d40955f3fecfc3b95b42424","title":"jerusalem wailing western wall crumbling stone exposes religious frctures","story":"Erosion is damaging the 2,000-year-old site – but restoration plans have been complicated by its sacred statusIt was an otherwise unremarkable occurrence – a lone stone, possibly weakened by erosion, cracked, slipped and plummeted to earth.But this stone was not unremarkable. It had been placed there centuries ago as part of a long stretch of limestone blocks in Jerusalem called the Western Wall – known also as the Wailing Wall – which includes remnants of the Temple Mount, the holiest prayer site for Jews.Roughly a metre thick, and weighing around 100kg, the slab crashed down in late July, narrowly avoiding a worshipper. It smashed into a wooden platform used by liberal-minded Jews who prefer a mixed-sex prayer space rather than the central plaza, where religious authorities require men and women to pray separately.Lying in the rubble and splintered wood, the stone has exposed cracks in the Jewish community, especially between the Orthodox, who run the area, and the more progressive branches. Public figures have suggested that the location of the fall was pertinent, possibly signifying ine intervention. After the incident, deputy Jerusalem mayor Dov Kalmanovich appeared to blame mixed-sex prayers, saying worshippers should “examine themselves”. Rabbi Shmuel Rabinowitz, the chief custodian of the Western Wall, said it was not his place to interpret signs but that the incident called for “personal introspection”.Others have questioned the stability of the 2,000-year-old structure. A 2014 study had found that parts of the wall were eroding, and Joe Uziel, an archaeologist at the Israel Antiquities Authority, said that a full survey was now being proposed, which would call for scaffolding.“We’re taking this as a sort of jumping forward point to say we need to do this for the entire complex of the Temple Mount walls,” he said.Such an endeavour would add further complications. The Western Wall is part of a site revered by Muslims, which they call al-Haram al-Sharif al-Aqsa mosque and the Dome of the Rock lie above it.The Waqf, a Jordan-funded Islamic body, administers Islam’s third holiest site under an extremely delicate status quo agreed with Israel. Work or excavations by either side are a sensitive issue, as they may be seen by the other as infringing on sacred land. In 1996, following the inauguration of Israeli-built tunnels alongside the Western Wall, riots broke out and dozens lost their lives.Fouad Hallak, a Jerusalem policy adviser at the negotiations affairs department of the Palestinian Liberation Organisation, said that Palestinians in and around the Old City area had long complained of damage to their houses “because the foundation is moving below us”.Asked whether the Waqf should be consulted on any surveys and conservation efforts, Rabbi Rabinowitz said: “The Western Wall belongs to the Jewish people … we don’t do anything secretly, but we don’t have to consult anybody.”Outside his office, in the blinding August sun, the main plaza was filled with a broad spectrum of Jews. Secular Israelis from Tel Aviv in T-shirts and sunglasses visited for the day while Orthodox Jews in black jackets and hats took their prayer books to the wall. Foreign tourists covered in sunscreen took selfies.All had come through security gates, where bags are X-rayed. From there, they entered the open square, formerly the Moroccan Quarter, which was flattened after Israeli forces occupied east Jerusalem in 1967.Many had come for bar mitzvahs, the Jewish coming-of-age ceremony: cheerful families followed 13-year-old boys. By the wall, the sexes separated, and the boys moved into the male-only area for their first reading of the Torah. Their sisters and mothers peeked over a wooden barrier to get a look, throwing small wrapped sweets in celebration.With Rabbi Rabinowitz in charge, the site remains under Orthodox tradition. On their side, women are not allowed to wear prayer shawls or read aloud from Torah scrolls.This practice has been challenged, most notably by the Women of the Wall, a group that has campaigned for equal rights in the plaza. In the past, they have flouted the rules, which has sparked protests and even arrests. Over the past couple of years, the issue has become one of the most contentious among diaspora Jewry, where there are large progressive populations.Issak, a 57-year-old Orthodox Jew, visits the wall once a month. Reform Jews, a progressive branch, should not push for mixed prayer in the plaza, he said. “The people who are bringing the whole discussion of Judaism to the Western Wall, they should stop it.” Another Orthodox worshipper said that not every Jewish denomination had the right to make demands.For Jews, the Western Wall is the holiest site where they can pray and is considered to be the last remnant of a retaining wall that surrounded a Biblical temple.For Muslims, the site is believed to be where Prophet Muhammed tied his horse at the end of his journey to Jerusalem.\u0026nbspThe entire complex above the wall, including the Dome of the Rock and the al-Aqsa Mosque, is called the Noble Sanctuary, or Haram al-Sharif, but referred to by Jews as the Temple Mount.\u0026nbspWhile Jews are allowed to visit the site under supervision, they are not permitted to pray openly and so worship below at the Western Wall.Until the Six Day War in 1967, in which Israel occupied and later annexed the Old City of Jerusalem, the area adjacent to the Western Wall was the Muslim Moroccan Quarter, which was razed by Israel to make space for the prayer plaza, which now serves as a synagogue.The Temple MountHaram al-Sharif complex has been a place of focused religious and political sensitivity. In 2000 a period of intense Israeli-Palestinian violence, known as the Second Intifada, began when Israeli politician Ariel Sharon made a provocative visit to the site.After decades of outrage over segregation, the Israeli government agreed in 2016 to open a mixed-sex space that connects to the plaza. But following pressure last year from ultra-Orthodox parties, it suspended the plan. For now, women and men can hold mixed services outside the plaza, at a section to the south where a temporary prayer space has been erected, and where the stone fell last month.Rabbi Sandra Kochmann, of the Masorti branch of Judaism, which is seen as traditional but not fundamentalist, stands looking down at the cracked floor where the stone fell. Since it crashed to earth, the prayer space close to the wall has been blocked off, and she has officiated at religious ceremonies on a platform further back.“We’ve had a lot of problems here in the past,” she says. Orthodox protesters have come down to the mixed area to disrupt her services by singing loudly in congregants’ faces.She rolls her eyes when asked about the debate on the significance, whether geological, political or even godly, of the crumbling wall: “The Orthodox say this is because of the Reform. The Reform say this is because of the Orthodox. Others say it’s the Waqf building on top that damaged the structure.” Her own explanation is simpler: “It’s a stone that fell.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/813ae2269770d066d884539bc475b2487030bb60/0_69_5555_3333/master/5555.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b13a4a9c6ab13e798522da75e004000","title":"knokke heist belgium rising sea levels environment tourism","story":"Proposed offshore island to protect a haunt of Sinatra and Dietrich would be its ruin, says long-time mayorIt is known affectionately as Belgium’s answer to St Tropez – a town once frequented by Frank Sinatra and Marlene Dietrich and which has inspired the pop art of Keith Haring and surrealism of René Magritte, who painted the walls of the town’s casino.But now the chic, if slightly faded, seaside resort of Knokke-Heist is, in the words of its mayor, Count Leopold Lippens, in a “fight for its life”. The Flemish government, in an attempt to limit the damage to the Belgian coast from rising sea levels, has announced plans for an artificial island of 40 hectares (99 acres) 1.2 kilometres from the sandy beach, to act as a bulwark against the waves. Belgium has, until now, been slow to respond to climate change and its coast has suffered severe damage during recent storms.Lippens, mayor since 1979, said the municipality’s tourism revenues of €700m a year would be halved should the plans be approved. “We have to beat this,” he said. The 77-year-old has hired specialist lawyers to fight his corner.The threat of rising waters is not unappreciated by the authorities in Knokke-Heist, a favourite hideout of the Belgian king, Philippe, and popular with artists since the Belgian painters James Ensor and Alfred Verwee captured its vistas on canvas in the early 19th century. The sea is expected to rise by 30cm by 2050 and 80cm by the end of the century. In 2016, Storm Dieter brought waves around two metres high crashing onto the front. About €17m was invested in a rebuilding programme, which included the replacement of 1.2m cubic metres of sand.Lippens says studies by the authorities in the Netherlands suggest better solutions. “It is the dredging companies who are pushing for the work to make the island because the Chinese have taken a lot of jobs away,” he said. “In Holland, where the land is much lower than in Belgium, they have studied all the systems, studied the islands, and it would be worse than just using more and more sand on the beaches. That is what they are doing and that is what we want.”Not everyone agrees. Cathy Coudyser, who sits for the Flemish nationalist party, the N-VA, in the Flemish parliament and on the city council, said Lippens, a member of the Christen-Democratisch en Vlaams party, was playing politics before an October election.She told the Belgian daily Het Nieuwsblad: “We have explained to Mayor Lippens the plan several times. Still, he continues to send wrong information to the world without blinking, including on the website of the municipality.“Doing nothing is not an option for Knokke,” she added. “The coast in Knokke is a weak zone, which is severely affected by a violent storm, probably with a lot of damage and heavy flooding.“Several other options have been studied, such as raising the sea dyke. But then the apartments would disappear behind a concrete wall. That seems to us a much worse solution.”The Flemish government has already released €8m for the island, which is part of its 2020-26 coastal management plans."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a578169cad46560454f74ce4ec3af57c37d12967/0_256_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0c2781d6cfc326504176f4de988194a5","title":"lombok earthquake leaves idyllic gili islands facing uncertain future","story":"Destruction forces visitors to flee beaches popular with ers and honeymoonersThe walls were swaying as Tori Taylor tried to feel her way across them in the dark after the 6.9-magnitude earthquake shook the island of Gili Trawangan, off Lombok in Indonesia, last Sunday.There had been another large tremor the week before, but this one felt larger.“It was unbelievable, crashing sounds, rumblings of the earth, falling tiles, smashing glass, spraying water, people screaming – absolutely terrifying,” the American, who runs a e resort, wrote in a diary she has kept of the disaster.On nearby Gili Meno, Andi Darmin huddled on the roof of his bungalow with his guests, including a couple and their eight-month-old baby. “Can you get a helicopter?” one of the European guests asked him. “I will pay whatever it costs.”Although they escaped the worst of the disaster, the Gilis – three idyllic islands popular with ers, party lovers and honeymooners – were plunged into emergency mode.On Gili Air, a western doctor and a few English nurses on holiday banded together to erect a makeshift medical tent in a field to treat the wounded, and instructed expats to collect painkillers and other supplies from tourists.On Gili Trawangan, the biggest of the three islands, where at least eight people died, doctors, e instructors and tourists set up a basic camp with oxygen and medical supplies and organised people into groups from minor injuries to the most severe. The bodies of the dead were laid out on the beach on sarongs before they were taken away to be cleaned for burial. Many people camped out overnight, too afraid to sleep indoors.Thousands of panicked tourists left the islands the following day, in some cases scrambling over each other to get a seat on one of the boats. Most headed straight for the international airport, where some slept on the floor as they waited for a flight out.The exodus leaves the mostly western-run tourist businesses facing an uncertain future. “When I look to the right there is no one, when I look to the left there is no one, just hundreds of bikes dumped at the port,” said Sander Buis, the Dutch owner of Oceans 5 Dive on Gili Air.“The weirdest part is that it is not just one part that is totally damaged. Some resorts are not in good shape. Others have no damage at all.”On Friday there was no running water on Gili Trawangan or Air, though there were plenty of supplies – in contrast to the more serious situation on the worse-hit main island of Lombok. Before electricity was reconnected, the owners on Air were clearing out all the island’s fridges and giving away the meat to local residents, who are sending it to their families in the north.Horses used to pull carts on the car-free island of Trawangan were being rounded up after running loose, and taken to the mainland. After reports of looting on Trawangan – there are no police on the Gili islands and it took days for the military to arrive – the security situation was improving.As aftershocks continue – there had been more than 450 by Friday – tourists are likely to stay clear of Lombok and the Gilis for now.Buis said he hoped things would start to feel more normal within six weeks. “Some resorts are not that damaged at all and some are,” he said. “So it is all about when the tourists are ready to come back.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"New route would link State by sea to Dutch and Belgian ports but bypass Calais, DunkirkMarching republicans and counterprotesting loyalists trade insults, but peace prevailsWarmer conditions expected after cooler weekThomas Woodgate faked his age to join the RAF in 1918 just a month before he diedDublin City Council makes 400 inspections regarding unauthorised signsMoldovan duo\u0026rsquos bail applications denied and both remanded to appear in court on FridayPSNI appeals for witnesses as man and woman arrestedPolice say Massey Fergusons were great sentimental valueOfficials warn of revenue loss and costs of customs checks on UK alcohol and cigarettesPlans in place to move homeless families to commuter towns during papal visitGuests share stories of the man who had made a \u0026lsquounique contribution to Irish culture\u0026rsquoCost of grant \u0026lsquoequivalent to \u0026euro25 per week increase\u0026rsquo in payments for people with disabilitiesMen are part of Eastern European crime gang, garda\u0026iacute have saidThe victim was in his late 60s and may have been visiting relatives in the areaBishop Alphonsus Cullinan said a Sunday World report he dismissed as \u0026lsquowholly incorrect\u0026rsquo was in fact \u0026lsquowholly factually correct\u0026rsquoTragedy as grandson of Nan Joyce killed in crash travelling down from Belfast to funeralNationwide campaign calls for end to racism on public transportNUIG study finds adults with low self-esteem use social media to fulfil attachment needsSurvivors claim each has questions to answer about known clerical child abusers"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3593602.1534018029!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit france to veto re routed trade plan between ireland and europe","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFrench concern at rerouting: At stake are jobs, millions of dollars’ worth of port revenues and possibly EU infrastructure funding.France will not accept a European Commission proposal to exclude French ports from a re-routed trade corridor between Ireland and mainland Europe after Brexit, the government has said.At the moment much of Ireland’s trade with the continent goes via Britain in trucks.

French ports such as Calais and Dunkirk would be bypassed.“France and Ireland maintain important trade channels, both overland via Britain and via direct maritime routes. The geographical proximity between Ireland and France creates an obvious connection to the single market,” wrote French minister for transport Elisabeth Borne to the EU’s transport commissioner on August 10th.“Surprisingly, the Commission proposal in no way takes this into account. This proposal therefore is not acceptable to France,” noted Ms Borne.At stake are jobs, millions of dollars’ worth of port revenues and possibly EU infrastructure funding.Ms Borne said that French ports had the necessary resources to ensure they could handle the likely increase in trade flows, hinting at concerns of congestion in ports such as Calais, France’s busiest passenger port. – ReutersDeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Eric LukeLooking up the main street of Omagh, Co Tyrone, it is easy to miss Market Street Arcade.A narrow alleyway roughly a metre wide and a few metres long, it was to this spot that many of the victims of the Omagh bomb were first brought.“We laid the first one here, then put them across in rows,” former police officer Richard Scott recalls.His voice catches and he pauses. “We continued on until this was completely full of bodies.”Only half an hour before, the street had been full of Saturday afternoon shoppers. A warning of a bomb at the courthouse meant that the other end of the street had been evacuated and members of the public were directed – unwittingly – towards the bottom of the town. A car containing a 1,000lb device had been left there by the Real IRA.At 3.10pm on August 15th, 1998, it exploded. The final death toll was 31 – 29 men, women and children, and unborn twins, of all ages, religions and backgrounds. It was the largest loss of life from any single atrocity of the Northern Ireland Troubles.Like many people that August afternoon, Kevin Skelton and his family had come into Omagh to buy school uniforms.He had left his wife, Mena, and their three teenage daughters shopping for school shoes.Skelton points to the street. “That’s the spot there, where the car was.”A glass obelisk engraved with a heart now stands in its place a plaque on the wall beside marks the “act of terror” which “killed thirty-one people, injured hundreds, and killed forever the lives of many”.Skelton was in the shop next door. “Bang. The bomb went off.”“I found Mena lying dead in the rubble. The first person to arrive was a fireman I knew, and once he lifted Mena’s arm and dropped it, I knew.”His immediate concern was his daughters. Fifteen-year-old Tracy had been knocked unconscious, but he later found her kneeling beside her mother.“I was digging, I thought she was lying underneath her mother. I was pulling things away and there were certain things you lifted you might find an arm and it not connected to anything. It was awful.“The smell of burning flesh, that’s something I have to live with, and the screaming. I can still hear it.”Ulsterbus district inspector Paddy McGowan arrived just minutes after the explosion. Running towards the site of the bomb, he met a group of children who he later learned were from Buncrana, Co Donegal. Three children from the town – James Barker, Oran Doherty and Sean McLaughlin – as well as a Spanish boy, Fernando Blasco Baselga, and his teacher Rocio Abad Ramos, who had been staying with them, would be among the dead.“They were all running, and crying, and blood was coming from some of them.“There were bodies everywhere, and the buildings were nearly all demolished. Everything was in complete turmoil.“People had started to cover up the bodies. There was a shop that sold bed linen and it had been blown out onto the street, and people were using duvet covers to cover them over.”Seeing one of his buses at the corner of Market Street, he waved the driver over and began helping the wounded onto the bus.“Those who were able to walk got on the bus, and others we carried them on. I didn’t realise it at the time, but some of them had actually lost limbs.”Scott had also heard the bomb go off. He and a colleague grabbed first aid kits from the police station, and then drove into the town centre.“For a strange moment it all went so quiet. I looked up and there was a window in one of the buildings and you could just see the window coming down as if in slow motion and crashing.“It went silent, and then everybody started to scream again because they thought it was another bomb going off.”Tyrone County Hospital was only a few minutes away from the town centre. The senior surgeon on call was Dr Domingos Pinto.“I opened the double doors to A\u0026ampE and it was absolute bedlam. It was like a battlefield. People were everywhere, even on the floor, or looking for their relatives.“I went in and the first thing I noticed was a child being resuscitated. It was a little baby. It died.“Another person, the nurse couldn’t feel a pulse. I went to her, and she had died.“I realised we were going to have casualties and I asked a nurse to clear a ward and make that a mortuary because I didn’t know how many people were going to come in, but we had to treat the dead with dignity.”The outpatient department was opened to treat the walking wounded, and doctors began assessing patients and arranging, where necessary, for them to be sent to other hospitals.Dr Pinto operated on patients until 10 o’clock that night below, in A\u0026ampE, was the hospital’s medical director, Dr Clive Russell.“Most of our job was triaging and deciding who needed to go and who needed to stay, and that went on for hours and hours.“I remember going out about 4 or 5 o’clock in the afternoon to the helipad and I could see three helicopters, one on the ground and two above, all waiting to take people away.”Following an appeal for help broadcast on television and radio, doctors, nurses and others had been arriving to offer their services.“We had the most amazing response,” says Dr Russell. “I remember walking down the corridor and being stopped by this man who asked could he help. It turned out he was a coastguard, and we really needed someone who was able to talk down helicopters he was fantastic.”Work was also beginning to identify the dead and injured. Dr Russell recalls a couple who kept asking him to look for a young girl.“I checked and checked and I said no, I hadn’t seen her, but she had been brought in dead, she was only 12 or 13, but we had set up a temporary mortuary and I didn’t know until much later that her remains were upstairs.”Among those who had come to the hospital to look for their loved ones was Michael Gallagher. He had last seen his son Aidan earlier that afternoon, when he had gone into town to buy a pair of jeans.All that night and into the next afternoon, families were brought to a temporary mortuary at the nearby army base to identify the dead. It was there that Michael Gallagher identified his son Aidan. “I had to go home and tell my wife and two girls that Aidan wasn’t coming home,” says his father.The Barker family, from Buncrana, were among the last to arrive James’s mother, Donna-Maria, had been at home when the police came to her door to say James was missing.“I remember going to see him and he was in this tiny room, and I remember wanting to put my arms round him and kiss him and an army guy put up his hands to stop me and I remember shouting, ‘you’re not going to stop me holding my son’.“He was draped in something green, it looked like a green curtain over him, and on his face was just a white handkerchief.“I took it off and I remember saying why did they not wash his face, because it was covered in blood, but his eyes, I remember thinking what beautiful emerald green eyes he had.“I knew he had green eyes but I never realised how beautiful they were.”In the 20 years since, nobody has been convicted of the murders at Omagh. Some relatives continue to campaign for justice others believe that they – and the town – have been let down by politicians and by all those who promised that Omagh would be looked after. Others – particularly those who were injured or who responded on the day – continue to deal with the trauma, both physical and mental, it inflicted on their lives. Yet others are hopeful and say that while their loved ones will never be forgotten, the town itself has moved on.In the week ahead, the focus in Omagh – and elsewhere – will be on remembrance. Services are to be held on Sunday, and on the 20th anniversary of the explosion on Wednesday smaller memorials are planned for, among others, Omagh hospital and Buncrana.Now living in England, James Barker’s family had moved to Buncrana to escape the Troubles. Among his mother’s memories are of a smiling boy who loved football – especially Chelsea FC – and who had been full of excitement at the thought of a trip to Omagh.“Four days before he was killed we were walking on the beach in Buncrana,” she says. “He was so happy.”"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Ellie Holman: \u0026lsquoThis situation has cost us . . . all of our savings, which is devastating to us\u0026rsquoIsraeli tanks fire at Hamas post after grenade reportedly thrown at its troops on the borderThe two were reportedly denied food, water and access to toilets while in custodyAttack on Thursday draws international condemnation and calls to end conflictIsraeli aircraft struck over 150 targets in Gaza on Wednesday night and ThursdayUS-backed, Saudi-led coalition hits bus in rebel-held north of war-torn countryChild among three killed in Israeli strikes in response to rocket attacks by HamasSyria\u0026rsquos first lady is reportedly being treated at a military hospital in DamascusOpposition chief Tzipi Livni apologises to Druze community for discriminatory lawTehran cuts imports of non-essential goods and introduces subsidies on food, medicineKingdom sells off Canadian assets after ambassador expelled over minister\u0026rsquos criticismAlmost two-thirds back Palestinian Authority\u0026rsquos rejection of US as mediator, poll revealsRe-imposed blanket sanctions to hit Iran\u0026rsquos access to dollars, gold and precious metalsCanada said it was \u0026lsquogravely concerned\u0026rsquo about the arrests of civil society and women\u0026rsquos rights activists in Saudi ArabiaSenior Saudi officials allow the Bin Ladens to tell their storyDespite outward show of social reforms, Saudi authorities are cracking down on dissentIncreasingly desperate Iranians open to any option that could ease economic quagmireLatest strike on refugee centre part of ongoing \u0026lsquosoft targets\u0026rsquo attacks by Islamic StateKing Salman clarifies rejection of Jared Kushner\u0026rsquos plan in wake of heir\u0026rsquos ambiguityAhed Tamimi calls for opposition to West Bank occupation after eight-month sentence"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3593588.1534013614!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"fbi widens inquiry into suicidal airline worker","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIt was unclear how the employee was able to taxi the plane on a runway and take off without authorization. Photograph: ReutersFederal authorities on Saturday were seeking to learn what drove an airline worker to steal an empty airplane from Seattle’s airport in a security scare that caused the scrambling of US fighter jets and ended when the plane crashed onto a sparsely populated island.A Horizon Air ground service agent got into a Bombardier Q400 turboprop aircraft on Friday night in a maintenance area at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport and took off, Horizon sister carrier Alaska Airline said.He flew for about one hour, often erratically, before crashing on Ketron Island in Puget Sound, about 40 km (25 miles) to the southwest.The 29-year-old man, who has not been named, was suicidal and appeared to have acted alone, according to the Pierce County Sheriff’s Department, which said the employee was believed to have been killed in the crash.“Doing stunts in air or lack of flying skills caused crash into Island,” said the Sheriff’s department on Twitter.In partial recordings of his conversations with air traffic controllers that were published online by Broadcastify, the man said he was sorry to disappoint people who cared about him and described himself as a “broken guy.”“Got a few screws loose, I guess,” he is heard saying in the recording. “Never really knew it until now.”The Federal Aviation Administration, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National Transportation Safety Board were investigating the incident.“Until the FBI has the opportunity to get better background on the person, find out what motive they had, it’s a little too early to make a determination on what the objective was,” said Debra Eckrote, the board’s western Pacific region chief.Two F-15 fighter jets took to the air from a base in Portland, Oregon, and were on the scene within minutes. The jets were armed but did not open fire, North American Aerospace Defense Command spokesman Cameron Hillier said by phone.Instead, the F-15 pilots and air traffic controllers tried to guide the plane west, away from populated areas, said Mr Hillier. No one was hurt on the ground, said authorities.It was unclear how the employee was able to taxi the plane on a runway and take off without authorisation.“We’re working to find out everything we possibly can about what happened,” said Brad Tilden, chief executive of Alaska Air Group.The Bombardier Q400 turboprop is designed for short-distance flights and can seat 76 passengers, Alaska Air said. – Reuters"},{"url":null,"title":"introducing telegraph new way get news","story":"Head of Digital PublishingMedia and Telecoms industryWe’ve made it even easier for you to get the news you want, when you want it. Introducing My , a new way to get the news.When you login to your  account you can now follow your favourite  writers and the subjects you’re most interested in to create a feed of news that’s just for you.Whether you want the wisdom of Charles Moore, want post-match insight from Paul Hayward or need straight-talking lifestyle advice from Bryony Gordon, the My Feed feature gives you a truly personalised experience of The .The first time you use My , we\u0027ll present a selection of popular subjects and writers to get you started.

It is thought the combination of the two ingredients kills more mosquitoes and reduces the number of infective bites. The study was the first clinical trial in the world to compare use of bed nets containing two active ingredients with the traditional net.As with therapies against diseases such as a tuberculosis, which use a combination of drugs in patients to help tackle antibiotic resistance, researchers say it is less likely for mosquitoes to become resistant to both chemicals in the combination bed nets.Malaria remains one of the world’s leading infectious killers. In 2016, the disease infected 216 million people across 91 countries, up five million from the previous year and killed 445,000 people, mostly children under the age of five.Some 80 per cent of malaria transmission occurs in Africa. Since 2000, there has been huge investment in malaria control on the continent which has halved the amount of malaria thanks mostly to distribution of insecticide-treated bed nets and spraying of homes with mosquito-killing products.However, in the last three years progress against the disease has slowed – with numbers of infected people now increasing in some areas. Resistance to insecticides is thought to be one of the key causes  behind the stalling progress.“We are now entering a crucial point in the future history of malaria control globally and we need to have some good products,” said Prof Lindsay. “It’s an important contribution to the future of malaria control in sub-Saharan Africa.”Although a mosquito net alone is able to protect against malaria transmission for iniduals, treated nets are crucial in the broader fight against the disease, as insecticides when effective help reduce the overall population of mosquitoes in a community – leading to much more significant declines in rates of malaria.“The critical thing with malaria control is to reduce the average life of a mosquito,” said Prof Lindsay.As well as reducing the rate of malaria, the researchers found that the new nets reduced anaemia rates among children sleeping under them by 52 per cent. Malaria anaemia which results from infection of red blood cells by malaria parasites is a major cause of mortality in children under two years old.The trial which was conducted by a team of scientists from the UK, Burkino Faso and Switzerland was limited to 40 rural areas in Burkino Faso. Going forward, the researchers say that the next step will be to expand the study to further countries in sub-Saharan Africa.Prof Lindsay is hopeful that following further successful trials the  World Health Organization will approve the new nets.Malaria still kills a child every two minutes so we need to keep working to find the best ways to stop this from happening. It is clear that conventional methods used for controlling malaria mosquitoes need to be improved and new additional tools developed, he said.“If we take our foot off the gas, malaria will come back to haunt us again,” he added.War on malaria | On the brink of a breakthrough?Bed nets are crucial in the fight against malaria and have come a long way since the first ones dipped in insecticide were used in Africa in the 1980s. Unlike modern long-lasting insecticidal nets, the insecticide in early nets was not able to withstand washing and had to be re-treated every six months – a logistical challenge in many rural areas.Dr James Tibenderana,  technical director at the Malaria Consortium who was not involved in the research said that resistance was a significant concern.“It’s quite worrying for us to find some of the insecticides are not as effective as they have been in the past,” he said.He said that pyrethroids are rare in that they can get into the yarn of the net effectively at a concentration that is both effective and safe  while being well-priced. “We will probably not get that ideal again so we will be dealing with new dynamics.” “We needed new nets four or five years ago so we are catching up. Whatever net we get now it’s going to take time to get it out there,” said Dr Tibenderana.Newsletter promotion - global health security - end of article Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security   \u0026#39Suicidal\u0026#39 mechanic steals plane from Seattle airport, is chased by F-15 jets and then crashes on islandDonald Trump dismisses former Apprentice star Omarosa as a \u0026#39lowlife\u0026#39 ahead of critical bookLife drawing can help teens overcome social media body confidence issues, says former Royal Society president Labour party\u0026#39s biggest union backers aim to force Jeremy Corbyn into global definition of anti-SemitismComment: In a country famous for its universities, why are the British so suspicious of success?Back us not Brussels on Iran, US ambassador tells Theresa May as he warns British businesses will lose tradeBurka row: Theresa May faces furious grassroots and donors backlash over \u0026#39malevolent\u0026#39 decision to discipline Boris JohnsonFemale veterans run for US Congress in record numbers to solve America\u0026#39s \u0026#39leadership crisis\u0026#39BBC scheme to fund new writing falls flat as celebrity ‘playwrights’ are panned at Edinburgh FringeChicken campaigner who became social media star attacked by vegans who say eating eggs is evil Allotments are a ‘way of life’ not a plot of land, says National Society as they battle long waiting listsNationalists and anti-racist protesters to square off by White House one year after Charlottesville violenceVeterans to be retrained as cyber warriors, under new partnership backed by the MoD DIY chains \u0026#39reviewing product ranges\u0026#39 as US court says groundskeeper\u0026#39s cancer was caused by weedkillerA fifth of 16-24 year olds spend more than seven hours a day online every day of the week, exclusive Ofcom figures revealComment: Why do distorted views on global warming and the Middle East go unchallenged by the BBC?Cambodian unease as Chinese casinos turn seaside paradise into  ‘Macau No 2’ Electric scooters face backlash from cities across the US after mayhem on the streetsNew all-female Swat team to protect Indian prime minister after intensive training in martial arts\u0026#39There will be no harvest\u0026#39 - Australian farmers face heartbreak of selling livestock amid worst drought in decadesWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/08/11/TELEMMGLPICT000134831334_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqnntzVh6i2V8vnWmVeYqabkaMYBMjspBErElm7j2lZzs.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"country famous universities british suspicious success","story":"Britain’s educational institutions are admired across the world, yet we feel uneasy about successSetting up home in a new country has its challenges, but one of the delights is discovering the eccentricities and quirks of its people, which may not be obvious to the natives themselves. After nearly two decades in Britain, there remain certain peculiarities that I find mystifying.

All three are now running for seats in the US Congress. The candidates are part of a new wave of female veterans who want to be on Capitol Hill after the 2018 mid-terms in November. Currently just four of the 535 sitting senators and congressmen are women who served in the military. But in this cycle no fewer than 32 have ran for office. The numbers are tilted towards the Democrats, with around two thirds of such candidates fighting against Donald Trump’s Republicans.  Maura Sullivan served for the US marines and was deployed in Iraq and Japan. Now she is seeking a seat in CongressExperts credit the opening up of frontline military roles to both genders and a surge in women deciding to enter politics as driving the apparent spike. Speaking to The , all three women - who are running as Democrats - suggest that a sense of duty mixed with deep concern over Mr Trump sits behind the trend. Ms Sullivan, 38, spent five years in the US Marine Corps, seeing deployments in Japan and the Iraqi city of Fallujah in 2005 - just two years after the invasion. She earned two medals for her service and later served as Barack Obama’s assistant secretary on veterans affairs. Maura Sullivan, a Democrat, hopes to get elected in New Hampshire 1st congressional district It was her concerns about the state of America after Mr Trump’s victory that convinced her to enter the political fray, seeking the congressional seat in New Hampshire’s 1st district. “Our country faces a crisis of leadership. We’re at an unprecedented moment,” she said. “I’ve fought for our country, put my life on the line for our country. But I’ve never seen a moment facing our country quite like now.”Ms Sullivan named “tenacity”, “unparalleled work ethic” and “determination” as strengths shared by female veterans who become political candidates, adding in a nod to her fighting days: “This is not the hardest thing that I have done.”For Ms Houlahan, 51, it was a sense of duty passed down from generations of family in the military that eventually convinced her to seek office.Her father and grandfather both had careers in the navy. She spent three years as an Air Force engineer at the end of the Cold War, helping design the system that sent alerts if a nuclear missile was on its way. “The threat was real”, Ms Houlahan recalled, adding that it still has not gone away. She went on to spend time growing startup companies and teaching chemistry before feeling the tug of public service once again in the days after Mr Trump’s November 2016 ascent to the White House. The US Capitol, which houses both the Senate and the House of RepresentativesHer father, who had served Democrat and Republican presidents alike in the military, was left in tears. Her daughter, who is gay, felt her own country had become unrecognisable. “It was the beginning of a process of asking myself what I can do to be helpful,” said Ms Houlahan, who decided to stand for the seat in Pennsylvania\u0027s 6th district. “My function in the world has always been behind the scenes. … I needed to change my mindset by putting myself on the frontline, becoming a bit more uncomfortable.  Chrissy Houlahan served as an engineer in the US Air Force for three years near the end of the Cold War Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University, produced the figures on women veteran candidates amd has tracked the trend. “It makes a lot of sense that these women, who have already committed their lives to service, would continue to think of ways they could serve their country once they left,” she said. “Running for office is the logical next thing to do. It’s certainly a path that we’ve seen men in this country take.” No fewer than 26 of America’s presidents - from George Washington and Abraham Lincoln to Dwight Eisenhower and both George Bushes - have served in the military, according to US Department of Veterans Affairs. That is more than half of the total.Chrissy Houlahan, 51, hopes to be elected in Pennsylvania\u0026#39s 6th congressional district in November 2018For Ms Keith, a 49-year-old former naval lawyer, having a military background could help women political candidates smash through the stereotypes that still hold sway today. She spent much of the 1990s as a naval judge advocate, defending sailors who were facing everything from expulsion to discrimination cases. Now running for Florida’s 18th district, she hopes her background can avoid the gendered slurs that Hillary Clinton, the former Democratic presidential candidate, faced in 2016. Pam Keith was a naval lawyer for much of the 1990s.

More than half admitted their devices interrupted face-to-face conversations with families and friends.Duty of Care campaign | Read more“I feel that age group are aware of their digital dependence and are making efforts and attempts to cut down,” said Tanya Goodin, founder of digital health consultancy Time to Log Off.“It is not just about it affecting relationships and productivity but also mental health. An Oxford University study last year showed self-reported mental wellbeing peaked for 15-year olds at four hours a day on screens. After that further screen time had a negative effect on their wellbeing.”For a generation born around the turn of the millennium when the first camera phone was launched and Sony Playstation 2 was taking the world by storm, smartphones are the main mode of accessing the internet.Even the oldest of the 16-24 year-olds were just 13 when the iPhone was launched. Now 95 per cent of that age group use their smartphone to go online, compared to 70 per cent of all adults and just 22 per cent of 65 to 74-year-olds.Young women appear to be more addicted to their smartphones than young men, with texting (53 per cent), logging on to social media sites (44 per cent) and browsing the web (34 per cent) the most popular activity while commuting.Duty of care puffWomen aged 16-24 years old on average spend a full hour longer each day on their phones than men of the same age, four hours a day compared to three by the men.For all adults, the proportion spending over 40 hours online has quadrupled, from 5 per cent to 19 per cent since the iPhone was launched in 2007. Among 16-24 year olds, it rises to 33 per cent. Three-quarters of the age group spend more than a day a week online.The young generation is more tolerant about using smartphones during activities with family or friends, with just 21 per cent saying it is unacceptable while watching TV with others, compared to 41 per cent of all adults. Half thought it was acceptable to check their phone for notifications during a meal compared with just 17 per cent of all adults.There are signs, however, of a nascent backlash among the young – just as there is a tandem drive by the government to get more older people online so they can more easily access services and care.Hold, a Norwegian social enterprise company, claims to have signed up 100,000 young Britons to an app which uses similar psychology to the social media giants by rewarding students for the time they stay off, rather than on, their phones. In Norway, 125,000 students use it.Changing trend of new media devicesThe rewards such as drinks, food or travel are provided by sponsors of the company, which has been backed with £250,000 by Brent Hoberman, who works with Princes William and Harry to counter cyber-bullying, and Henry Lane Fox, who was his co-founder at LastMinute.Com.Keita Eriawan, 20, a student at Hult international business school in London, said he downloaded the app because of his frustration that his habit of constantly checking his phone was distracting him from his studies.He said it helped him become aware of how much time he wasted: “I used to check my phone every five minutes for social media and football updates. That would be over eight to nine hours a day. Now I would say it’s about half that time.”By contrast, Martin Lock, chief executive of Silversurfers, said he expected a sharp increase in older people’s time on the internet in coming years as the government took more services online and more tech-savvy middle-aged users got older.Margie Savory, 69, a former TV producer from Bridport, admits she is addicted to her phone, using it to keep in contact with family and friends, and up to date with community news. “I use it to keep in touch, through Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram and Twitter,” she said.“We have a WhatsApp group with neighbours who are older than me where we can send each other pictures if we do something fun or are on holiday. We keep an eye on each other’s gardens when we are away.”The only downside, she admitted, was that her husband Chris, 56, “didn’t like it” when she used her phone when watching TV.Duty of Care Campaign\u0026#39Suicidal\u0026#39 mechanic steals plane from Seattle airport, is chased by F-15 jets and then crashes on islandDonald Trump dismisses former Apprentice star Omarosa as a \u0026#39lowlife\u0026#39 ahead of critical bookLife drawing can help teens overcome social media body confidence issues, says former Royal Society president Labour party\u0026#39s biggest union backers aim to force Jeremy Corbyn into global definition of anti-SemitismComment: In a country famous for its universities, why are the British so suspicious of success?Back us not Brussels on Iran, US ambassador tells Theresa May as he warns British businesses will lose tradeBurka row: Theresa May faces furious grassroots and donors backlash over \u0026#39malevolent\u0026#39 decision to discipline Boris JohnsonFemale veterans run for US Congress in record numbers to solve America\u0026#39s \u0026#39leadership crisis\u0026#39BBC scheme to fund new writing falls flat as celebrity ‘playwrights’ are panned at Edinburgh FringeChicken campaigner who became social media star attacked by vegans who say eating eggs is evil Allotments are a ‘way of life’ not a plot of land, says National Society as they battle long waiting listsNationalists and anti-racist protesters to square off by White House one year after Charlottesville violenceVeterans to be retrained as cyber warriors, under new partnership backed by the MoD DIY chains \u0026#39reviewing product ranges\u0026#39 as US court says groundskeeper\u0026#39s cancer was caused by weedkillerComment: Why do distorted views on global warming and the Middle East go unchallenged by the BBC?Cambodian unease as Chinese casinos turn seaside paradise into  ‘Macau No 2’ Electric scooters face backlash from cities across the US after mayhem on the streetsNew all-female Swat team to protect Indian prime minister after intensive training in martial arts\u0026#39There will be no harvest\u0026#39 -

Ed Troyer, who works at the sheriff’s office, described the man as “suicidal”. The White House said in a statement that Donald Trump, the US president, had been briefed on the incident and was “monitoring the situation”. It has raised fundamental questions about airline security at America’s major airports after the mechanic was able to board the plane, taxi onto the runway and take off without being stopped. Aviation experts questioned what the authorities would have been able to do if the pilot was determined to fly the plane into a city rather than do loop-the-loops.Some also asked whether there should be annual mental health checks for all those employed in the airline industry. Investigators are expected to want to obtain camera footage from the airport, which hosts more than 30 airlines with nonstop service to more than 90 domestic destination, to understand how the man was able to co-opt the plane in broad daylight. They are also expected to want to recover cockpit voice recorder, in case the pilot made any phone calls or spoke to himself during the flight. Chilling audio of the conversation between the pilot and the control tower, where airport officials were attempting to get him to land safely, emerged on Saturday. At one point someone in the control tower says: “Congratulations, you did that, now let’s turn around that airplane safely and not hurt anybody on the ground.”The pilot responds: “Alright. Oh damn it, I don’t know man? I don’t want to. I was kind of hoping that was going to be it, you know.”In another clip the pilot claims to have put fuel in the plane to to go check out the Olympics - the Olympic Mountains which lie about 100 miles (160 kilometers) away. But he expressed fears that the fuel was going quite a bit faster than I expected.In another section the man is heard saying: “This is probably like jail time for life, huh? I would hope it is for a guy like me.”Elsewhere, according to The Seattle Times, he says: I\u0027ve got a lot of people that care about me. It\u0027s going to disappoint them to hear that I did this.”I would like to apologise to each and every one of them. Just a broken guy, got a few screws loose, I guess. Never really knew it until now.Social media users captured footage of the aircraft doing a large loop-the-loop in a clear sky as the sun was setting. John Waldron, a witness, told CNN: “I thought they were practising for an air show to be perfectly honest. I had no idea at the time that the aircraft had been stolen from Sea-Tac. I had no idea what was going on at all, honestly.”Nick Junka, who said he had worked with the mechanic, said: “We have access to these planes all day long. We secure them.

But there is one area where the older woman is\u0026nbspthriving.\u0026nbspIn the week that Madonna turns 60, David Lister applauds the 60-something females who are gliding into pensionable age, with fan bases, voices, charisma and sexiness intactClick to followThe Independent OnlinePatti Smith, edgy and androgynous and still pulling in the crowds, performs at the Roundhouse at a Palestine charity eventIt’s a truism that older women have had their visibility problems. City boardrooms are short of women in general, and women over 60 are certainly thin on the ground. Most notably, broadcasting has been notoriously shy of giving older women screen time.It was less than\u0026nbsptwo years ago that the head of the regulator\u0026nbspOfcom\u0026nbspaccused the BBC of “not doing as good a job as it should be” in its treatment of older women, after many complaints from viewers about a lack of mature female presenters.The corporation had long faced criticism for its treatment of older women, and lost an age discrimination case brought by Countryfile presenter Miriam O’Reilly, who was sacked in 2009, to make way for younger presenters. \u0026nbspBut there is one area where the older woman is suddenly and somewhat unexpectedly thriving – rock music. Madonna celebrates her 60th birthday on Saturday. Kate Bush has just celebrated hers. In fact, they are the spring chickens. Suzi Quatro, 68, and Patti Smith, 71, are not just still rocking, they are still snarling. Cher at 72 pops up with a delightful cameo in the Mamma Mia!\u0026nbspmovie. The queen of soul, Aretha Franklin, is still recording at 76.\u0026nbspWho’d have thought it? Look back to the 1960s and there were precious few women at all in pop music, let alone older ones. In the UK, Sandie Shaw, Dusty Springfield, Marianne Faithfull and a handful of others carried the fight to the mass of male groups (the word boyband had yet to be invented).No one thought then about whether the stars would still be recording and performing in old age. Indeed the concept was unthinkable – for men as well as women, for stars as well as fans. When I put it to Paul McCartney that he must be surprised to be still going, he replied: “I do rub my eyes. I didn’t foresee it. In The Beatles we always said 10 years. But it kept on and kept on and it kept being good and we seemed to be the people who could do it. Now there is a great young generation of people who can also do it, but it tends to be that the people packing them in are the people who have the material, have hits, songs people know, and I think that’s important. I think they have stagecraft, they have an ability with an audience.”There’s no doubting that the likes of Madonna and Kate Bush have stagecraft in spades. Even in an industry that ostensibly prizes youthfulness and a certain amount of athleticism on stage, the female superstars, like the male, are now gliding into pensionable age, with fan bases, voices, charisma and downright sexiness still intact.\u0026nbspThough, when it comes to longevity, the women themselves didn’t always think it would be the case. Joni Mitchell once remarked, all too despondently: “Record companies want the look. And if you’re over 50, however well preserved, you just don’t have the look.”Maybe the look, or audience perception of the look, has changed. No one remotely cared that Kate Bush looked older than they remembered her (quelle surprise) when she made her stage comeback after 35 years in 2014. And tickets were inevitably like gold dust. I was there to note that she sounded the same, and she still exuded charisma and stage presence.She did a staggering run of 22 performances. Two things perhaps attested to the more mature Kate. The show was only part rock concert, it was also part theatre with video and dance, and even the odd comedy sketch starring her son. Also, she gave all her audiences an instruction on her website, which bore witness to the fact that she comes from an earlier generation than today’s performers. She wrote: “I very much want to have contact with you as an audience, not with iPhones, iPads or cameras.”Suzi, 68,\u0026nbspsays she\u0027ll \u0027retire when I go on stage, shake my ass and there is\u0026nbspsilence\u0027 (Getty)\u0026nbspEarlier this year I witnessed the return to live performance of Annie Lennox, at the age of 63. To raise funds for her charity she did a one-off show which was largely a chat show, interspersed with the odd song at the piano, going through her life and career. The self-deprecating humour was erting: “When I was studying at the Royal Academy of Music, I lived on £3 a week.” Pause. “Scottish people can do that.” Pause. “And we like it.”Perhaps she had stumbled across the format for the older star, a chat show setting interspersed with the odd song. Except, at the end that she knocked everyone there for six with a breathtaking 30 minute performance of Eurythmics and solo hits that showed she retained all her talent. She was the epitome of soul as she belted out Eurythmics anthems, sometimes crawling sensuously across the floor as she did so. The only surprise was that she had (lamentably) eschewed live performance for 10 years.For some female legends, the routine can be tiring. I was at Marianne Faithfull’s most recent London appearance, an intimate show at Ronnie Scott’s jazz club. Plagued by a variety of physical problems over the years, she had a walking stick and performed most of the show sitting down. It was nevertheless a beguiling evening. But notably at one point she actually pleaded with her fans to allow her to retire. “Please let me go,” she said, “I can’t go on for ever. I’m not Keith,” referring to her long-time friend Keith Richards of The Rolling Stones, definitely not one of life’s quitters.Madonna, too, is not one of life’s quitters. Her fitness routine keeps her more than show-ready, even for a show as heavy on breathless choreography as hers. But I think there is another clue to her longevity in what she said to the audience at one of her shows that I attended 15 years ago. Just before her final encore, she said in idiosyncratic style: “When I was a girl I always thought ‘grown-ups can f**k off’. But now I’m 45 years old, I have children of my own, and you know what, grown-ups can still f**k off!”As I say, it was a piece of philosophy delivered in her personal style. But it perhaps partly explains her longevity and continuing appeal. She retains the anarchic spirit she had when she burst on the scene. Female rock stars, just like their male counterparts, and possibly more so, have no intention of growing old gracefully. They haven’t just retained their vocal prowess and stage presence, they have retained the hint of adolescent rebelliousness that has always been an intrinsic part of rock’s appeal. And having met both Madonna and Suzi Quatro, I can attest that in both cases the aggressive, in yer face attitude is not just a stage technique.But rock-star rebelliousness is not the only reason that rock and pop’s biggest female stars go on and on or come back after long absences. Kate Bush was never keen on playing live and before her comeback had only done one tour of the country. But she was persuaded to perform again by her teenage son. As she had a song on one album about watching his clothes go round and round in the washing machine, it was clear that a request from him would, fortunately, carry weight.Victoria Beckham is, of course, far from the vintage of Bush, Madonna and the other older stars. But when the Spice Girls had their reunion tour, it’s interesting that she said the key reason she wanted to do it was that her children had seen Dad play football and knew all about his skills. Now was a chance for them “to see what Mummy did” before they were born.Performing for a global audience is important. But performing for the family clearly also is a factor in keeping the career going.Jonathan Morrish, a long-time senior executive at Sony record company, and now a music industry PR consultant, says: “Women generally live longer than men, so it should come as no surprise that so many as they get older seem to flourish creatively with their music and on stage. None of this is easy. I know from the many artists that I have worked with you need tenacity. So perhaps it’s the staying power they had to show at the beginning of their careers, perhaps a savvy emotional intelligence –\u0026nbspwhatever it is, I admire and welcome it. And applaud them.”\u0026nbspAnd even for those female rock and pop stars who have decided to call it a day, a new avenue has opened up: the stage musical. Right now in London, audiences can see Tina Turner on stage at one theatre, and The Supremes and all the other Motown stars at another. Or at least, one can enjoy their music and life stories, delivered by lookalikes and sound-alikes. It’s possible not just to go on into old age, but literally forever.Faithfull pleaded with a crowd at Ronnie Scotts: \u0027Please let me go. I\u0026nbspcan’t go on for ever. I’m not Keith\u0027 (Alamy)Meanwhile, there is a core of\u0026nbsp 60- and 70- something female rock stars, who thankfully show no signs of even thinking about stopping and relying on musicals to seal their immortality.No one puts it better than Suzi Quatro, celebrating 54 years in the business, who states: “I will retire when I go on stage, shake my ass and there is silence.”David Lister is the former arts editor of The IndependentEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":null,"title":"subscribe to the daily edition our newspaper for your tablet","story":"For full functionality of this site it is necessary to enable JavaScript...Please follow the instructions in the link below.Please upgrade your browser to improve your experience."},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/11/11/cabin-et-fever-2019161.jpg","title":"david cameron shepherds hut cornwall holiday home","story":"Created with Sketch.The former prime minister bought his first hut for\u0026nbsp£25,000\u0026nbsplast year to use as a writing roomClick to followThe Independent OnlineThe hut has green cladding and a black plastisol-coated metal roof, identical to his first hutDavid Cameron has purchased\u0026nbspa second\u0026nbspshepherd’s hut as part of renovations on his £2m Cornwall\u0026nbspholiday home.The former prime minister posed for publicity shots with his £25,000 garden retreat last year.He described the handcrafted cabin as “jolly nice looking”, and has now\u0026nbspbought another.\u0026nbspThe hut has green cladding and a black plastisol-coated metal roof, identical to the first.\u0026nbspMr Cameron, who is now the president of Alzheimer’s Research UK, bought his first shepherd’s hut to use as a writing room for his memoirs, while his children wanted to use it as a Wendy house.\u0026nbspThe luxurious\u0026nbsphuts, on black wheels, are made by Paul Bennett at Red Sky Shepherd’s Huts.World news in picturesThis frame grab taken from footage filmed by bystander John Wauldron on August 10, 2018 with his Galaxy S8 at Chambers Bay Park and Golf Course in University Place Washington, shows an empty passenger airplane, stolen from the Seattle-Tacoma airport, making an unlikely upside-down aerial loop, then flying low over Puget Sound before crashing into the sparsely populated Ketron Island in the northwestern US state of Washington. - An apparently suicidal mechanic stole an empty passenger plane from the Seattle-Tacoma airport. officials said was unrelated to terrorism.

Just under a third (28 per cent) said she should be replaced without a vote while 20 per cent said they did not know.But respondents were ided on whether the 2016 referendum result gave the prime minister a mandate to leave the EU without a deal, with 34 per cent believing it did and 36 per cent suggesting it did not.The new findings came as the People’s Vote campaign held a 700-strong rally at Bristol’s Colston Hall to demand a fresh referendum on the final Brexit deal.

This is politically significant.Rees-Mogg suggests a second Brexit referendum would be acceptable in clip from 2011“There is clearly the potential for a broadly based campaign this autumn for a people’s vote\u0026nbspshould the Brussels talks go badly.

Just 25 per cent said parliament should decide and 25 per cent said they did not know.Asked whether people agreed with the statement that “the negotiations are going badly at the moment”, a huge 74 per cent agreed to some extent, with just nine per cent disagreeing and 17 per cent saying they did not know.An even larger 83 per cent agreed with the statement that the “process of leaving the EU so far has been a mess”, with just six per cent disagreeing and ten per cent saying they did not know.Labour MP Chuka Umunna, a leading supporter of the People’s Vote campaign, said: “Whether people voted leave or remain two years ago, nobody voted for this chaotic Brexit that will damage our living standards and public services, and which is being thrust on the country by politicians in Westminster.“It is now clear that the people are starting to find their voice, and they demand a vote on the final Brexit deal as the only way out of this mess.”Some 68 per cent agreed that “problems in the negotiations with the EU make it likely that Britain will get a bad deal”, with 13 per cent disagreeing and 19 per cent saying they did not know.In an ominous sign for the prime minister, 64 per cent agreed with the statement “if we get a bad deal, it will mainly be the UK government’s fault”, with 23 per cent disagreeing and 14 per cent saying they did not know.In the case that negotiations are completed, 45 per cent backed a new referendum on the deal, while 34 per cent opposed it\u0026nbspand 22 per cent said they did not know.Brexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

People can come here for work but they need to have work to come to and that work needs to have been agreed and accepted that there isn\u0027t a person in the UK that could do that work and has the skills to do that work.

That\u0027s one of the great pull factors.Leaving the EU, we should not be offering for people to come over here just looking for work and to claim benefits.We need a living wage that does not require people to come over here and claim benefits to top up.The British Government has yet to publish its plans for a new post-Brexit migration system nearly two years after the EU referendum.Brexit news: IDS called on the Government to  (Image: )The lack of planning spurred the Home Affairs Committee to condemn the lack of a policy direction as \u0026ldquoregrettable and a \u0026ldquomissed opportunity.The report noted: \u0026ldquoContinued delays to the publication of the White Paper on Immigration and the Immigration Bill has meant there is little indication of what immigration policy will be.\u0026ldquoDespite the fact that the issue was subject to heated and isive debate during the referendum campaigns in 2016 the Government has not attempted to build consensus on immigration reform or consult the public over future migration policy in the two years since.The Committee has warned that migration policy \u0026ldquonow risks being caught up in a rushed and highly politicised debate in the run-up to the vote on the withdrawal agreement.The Chamber of British Commerce (CBI) has instead urged the Government to scrap blunt targets for immigration after Brexit, calling for a new freedom of movement system to be adopted.CBI deputy chief Josh Hardie said: This is no longer a theoretical debate, it\u0027s about the future of our nations.\u0026nbspFalse choices and sloganeering must be avoided at all costs. Openness and control must not be presented as opposites.\u0026nbspPublic attitudes towards migration and the impact it has on communities are far more nuanced.He added: Scrapping blunt targets, ensuring all who come to the UK contribute and using the immigration idend to support public services will add to public confidence.

Geologic processes generally proceed at a slow pace, and when viewed on the scale of a human lifetime, volcanic eruptions and destructive earthquakes happen rarely.\u0026ldquoNevertheless, the long history of volcanic activity in the Long Valley area indicates that future eruptions will occur.Geologists have found that after its creation in the massive eruption 760,000 years ago, clusters of smaller volcanic eruptions have occurred in the caldera at roughly 200,000-year intervals.\u0026nbsp                Yellowstone: experts confirm \u0027anomaly\u0027 - \u0027no need for concern\u0027 as v...Long Valley Caldera erupted spectacularly 767,000 years ago (Image: )About 100,000 years ago, the most recent of these eruptions formed the Mammoth Knolls, low hills just north of the Town of Mammoth Lakes.Mammoth Mountain, a young volcano on the rim of Long Valley Caldera, was created by a series of eruptions which occurred between 220,000 and 50,000 years ago.\u0026nbspVolcanoes in the Mono-Inyo Craters volcanic chain, which extends from just south of Mammoth Mountain to the north shore of Mono Lake in Mono County, California, have erupted frequently over the course of the last 40,000 years.\u0026nbspDuring the last 5,000 years, an eruption has occurred somewhere along this chain every 250 to 700 years.\u0026nbspThe nearby Inyo Craters and associated lava domes were the result of a series of small to moderate eruptions 550 to 600 years ago, while the most recent eruptions along the volcanic chain took place about 250 years ago at Paoha Island in Mono Lake.The fact sheet added: \u0026ldquoWhen an eruption does break out in the Long Valley area, its impact will depend on the location, size, and type of eruption, as well as the wind direction.\u0026ldquoAlso, an eruption during the winter months could melt heavy snow packs, generating mudflows and locally destructive flooding.David Rothery, Professor of Planetary Geosciences at the Open University, told Express: \u0026ldquoA major eruption in the next 100 years is extremely unlikely, but a there is a greater than 50 percent chance of major eruption in the next few hundred thousand years.The report, authored by Ashton F Flinders, David R Shelly, Philip B Dawson, David P Hill, Barbara Tripoli, and Yang Shen, states: \u0026ldquoDespite 40 years of erse investigations, the presence of large volumes of melt in Long Valley\u0026rsquos magma reservoir remain unresolved.\u0026ldquoHere we show, through full waveform seismic tomography, a mid-crustal zone of low shear-wave velocity.

But in those days — the late Seventies — it was rare and unrecognised.We lost touch a long time ago, but I thought of Sarah this week when I read that the number of teenage girls self-harming has doubled in the past 20 years.According to new NHS data, the number of hospital admissions for girls who have self-harmed has jumped from 7,327 in 1997 to 13,463 last year. For boys, the figures have stayed almost the same — from 2,236 then to 2,332 now.Worse, “self-poisoning” — as in taking an overdose — is rising for both genders and last month the Government released a green paper that said around 850,000 children and young people now have a diagnosable mental health condition.Experts say academic pressure is a contributory factor, so too social media.Kids have always had exams to cope with but in the old days jealous and bitter remarks were confined to the dark corners of secret conversations or, at worst, scrawled on a toilet wall.Now these brave warriors have a keyboard and pseudonym behind which they can troll you for everyone to see.By my age, you know the vitriol probably comes from a bitter, 53-year-old virgin who lives in his mother’s spare bedroom. But when you’re still finding your way in the world, that poisonous undermining can worm its way inside your head and chip away at the confidence that acts as an armour in life.One self-harmer told me the pain of cutting his skin provided a welcome distraction from the “washing machine” rotations of negative thoughts constantly disturbing his peace of mind.The majority of them can be helped if it is spotted early enough and the expert assistance they need is then easy to access. And therein lies the problem.In 2016, Theresa May said the mental health of children was to be one of her priorities as PM, but since then Brexit has taken over and little has changed.The Government’s strategy is to train more teachers to spot the signs, appoint 7,000 more specialists to child mental health units and cut the waiting time for non-critical cases to be seen.But even if it happens, it won’t be enough.Parents must also remain vigilant for any marked change in their child’s personality or behaviour and the big social media companies have the technology to stop the majority of trolls — so they should be forced to use it.If all of the above doesn’t happen, the NHS has another mental health time bomb coming which will cost the taxpayer a fortune and have an even greater cost to the mental well-being of the next generation.WHEN TV baker Paul Hollywood started dating a 23-year-old barmaid from his local pub, they were quick to point out that their relationship only started after his marriage to wife Alex ended.But Alex is reportedly not buying this explanation and is planning to name Summer Monteys-Fullam in her £10million divorce battle.Whatever the truth, it remains the case that many couples conveniently consider only full sexual intercourse as adultery.But of course, cosy chats, lingering touches and come-hither looks are all it takes for any man with a wandering eye to recognise that, should he wish to jump ship, there’s a shiny new model waiting in the wings to rev up his sex life.Hallelujah for the wonderfully pragmatic Emma Thompson who, when asked about her marriage to the dreamily handsome Greg Wise, replied that they have had plenty of rough times.The secret to a happy relationship, she says, is the realisation that there will be unhappy times and that, if you manage to amble through to the other side: “It’s always better.”She adds: “I think people in long, happy marriages tell a lot of fibs, like, ‘Yes, it’s been marvellous’, whereas I say, ‘Sometimes it has been awful’.”If a relationship is deeply unhappy for a sustained period then, of course, get the hell out.But in these Tinder times of endlessly sweeping left in search of the “perfect” mate (who doesn’t exist) it’s invaluable when someone high profile points out that, more often than not, sticking with the one you’ve got works out in the end.Altogether now, “Love is a decision, not just a feeling.”Daisy-May Demetres smile lights up a room.Just eight years old, she was born without her lower legs and now uses two prosthetic blades that allow her to live as full a life as possible.She attends mainstream school, loves PE and has just been given a modelling contract with high street brand River Island.Yet, because of her disability, her parents Alex and Claire admit to feeling a “profound sadness” the day she was born and asked themselves what they had done wrong. And when, as a toddler, Daisy-May had to endure a painful, eight-hour operation on her stumps, Alex admits he turned to alcohol and gambling in a bid to numb his feelings of hopelessness.But by the time she was four, Daisy-May had mastered her blades and was doing cartwheels and headstands.Alex, 35, from Birmingham, says: “I looked at her and thought, ‘If you can achieve so much, against all the odds, and still be cheerful, then I have no reason at all to be depressed’. I stopped gambling and drinking that day.”While no one would wish disability on their child, the Demetres’ story is a salutary lesson that, sometimes, what seems like insurmountable adversity through an adult’s eyes can, through a child’s simple acceptance and joie de vivre, enrich your life and give it deeper meaning.Following a cyber attack in Alaska, government officials have abandoned their computers and taken to using old-fashioned typewriters.Let joy be unconfined.I still have my original typewriter from my days as a junior reporter on the Solihull News and it was a loyal servant that never crashed, froze or ran out of battery. I may even request for it to be buried with me.It seems that my love for these machines is rivalled only by Tom Hanks (yes, that one) who has written a book of short stories about them and created an app called the Hanx Writer, which emulates the glorious click-clack sound as you type.Go on, try it. There’s no greater pleasure.No? Just me then...Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We’re losing more and more of our natural wildlife. Our open spaces diminish daily.And now the Government is being forced into building countless millions of homes. Why?We’re told we have a housing crisis. You might find this puzzling when you consider the birth rate in Britain has been dropping, not rising.The answer, of course, is immigration. We’ve been letting in half a million people every year for almost 15 years.The politicians try to tell you it’s nothing to do with our housing crisis — but they are lying. Lying to themselves and to you.One top academic expert, Oxford demographer David Coleman, reckons immigration is 85 per cent responsible for the rise in the UK’s population between 2000 and 2015.And the other figures you might find a bit chilling.Did you know, for example, that a whopping 28 per cent of all births in the UK are to foreign-born women? And the figure in London is a staggering 60 per cent.If you find an indigenous British person in London, say hello to him for me and wish him the best. He’s the last of a dying breed. White Brits are a minority in our capital.It’s not just that. The birth rate for British people is 1.75. The birth rate for immigrants is 2.06. That’s a very big difference.So not only do we let in half a million per year, but they have more kids and so doubly contribute to population growth and the need for new houses.Oh, and the need for lots of other very expensive stuff, such as schools, hospitals, welfare benefits and so on.We MUST call a halt to immigration. The overwhelming majority of the population thinks we need much tougher controls.And there are many people who think that immigration has not made the country any better, but actually made it worse.Cut the numbers coming in to 10,000 per year and our housing crisis would begin to lessen, given that 300,000 or so people emigrate every year.A net decrease in the population would massively reduce the need for new housing.Because unless we do that, the bulldozers will be moving in. The fields, hedges and woodland will be ripped up. The roads will be laid and the peace and quiet shattered.And this will not be a green and pleasant land for much longer.Katie Price has just managed to avoid being declared bankrupt.She’s been given three months to pay off a whole load of creditors, plus a whopping tax bill.Everyone seems shocked that she has apparently blown £45million.But that body needs a lot of upkeep. She spends thousands every month getting her nails done so they look really chavvy.And then there’s the periodic scaffolding required to keep those vast mammaries aloft – plus a bit of pointing and retiling.The surprise to me was how in the name of hell she managed to amass £45million, not how she managed to spend it.For doing WHAT exactly?A woman on a flight from Valencia to London apparently “bonded” with a “hot guy”.Now Jo Lia has launched a Facebook campaign to trace the poor bugger.She says he was called “Joe” and looked a bit like Jordan Henderson. Hmmm. But can he pass the ball sideways just as well? I bet she didn’t find that out. Anyway, above is a photo of Ms Lia.So Joe, mate – keep your head down and stay off social media for a while. If I had that loon sitting next to me on a plane I’d spend the entire flight in the khazi.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn appeared on the Iranian-run Press TV to cast doubt on Israel’s right to exist.He used to get paid handsomely for his appearances on a network run by a hostile government which enslaves its own people.Meanwhile, more Labour anti-Semites have been crawling out of the woodwork.Here’s a suggestion. Clearly Labour has no intention of kicking out its Jew-haters.So I would suggest everyone in the party who ISN’T anti-Semitic get the hell out right now.And leave the party to the racist, hard-left rabble who are currently running it.The broadcaster Sandi Toksvig says that people mistake her for Tom Cruise.It’s easy to see why, isn’t it? Spitting image.Oddly enough, people often mistake me for the model Chloe Ayling.I even had the police round when she went missing because someone reckoned they’d seen her in Thornaby. But it was just me, nipping out for some fags.Our former Foreign Secretary is in trouble for having said that Muslim women wearing the full burka look like postboxes, or bank robbers.But that’s pretty much what most think, isn’t it?Boris was against banning the burka. But increasingly I think we should follow most of our European friends and outlaw the ridiculous garment in public places.Almost half of British 18 to 24 year olds don’t know when World War One took place, according to a survey.And hardly any of them could name the prime minister – David Lloyd George – who led us to victory.But it’s not really their fault, is it? Truth is, they’re not taught stuff like this any more.The history curriculum has been pretty much stripped of things which shows Britain in a good light, or British people being the victims of aggression.Instead, they learn very dubious arguments about slavery and colonialism.It’s a dangerous thing. When you lose a sense of pride in your nation, you also start to lose respect for its authority and its laws.And you raise a generation of perpetually whining airheads who understand nothing of the sacrifices made by Britons in the past.YOU see? They take their dieting really seriously up here in the North East. Pizza, chicken and chips. My missus took this pic, above, in a Teesside café.She once spent two weeks trying to find a salad in Austria, with no luck.The BBC is about to spend more than two million quid on a propaganda campaign to make you pay its licence fee.This is as opposed to the rest of its budget, which is spent on a propaganda campaign to convince you that all immigration is good, Israel is evil and Brexit a catastrophe.Fewer and fewer people watch the BBC.The licence fee has become an absurdity – an unjust tax which growing numbers of people simply refuse to pay.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We’d never want authorities to have a free pass to snoop into our lives.But when cops are confident that the missing piece to a case can be found online, it is outrageous that web giants don’t work with them to investigate.They act as if they’re above the law.Let’s see about that.THE new Civil Society Strategy is better than its clunky name suggests.As a general rule, putting power in the hands of local people — rather than leaving it with far-off Whitehall civil servants — is usually a good idea.It is residents who know which roads need fixing, which bins need collecting, and which social care services are struggling.And for all the know-how of local councillors, too many are in safe seats and not solely motivated by serving their voters.Between plans for “citizen juries” and freeing up cash for community organisations, this should be a much-needed boost for local democracy — with the cash to back positive initiatives.The ironic thing is that it all sounds very familiar.It used to be called the Big Society.DAVID Jason reckons Del Boy would have been relaxed about Brexit.Of course he would.

After the British people voted to leave the European Union we were told “Brexit means Brexit” and that critical “red lines” would guide our negotiations with the EU. So far, so good.Fast forward to today and we live in a different world. The so-called Chequers Agreement crosses all those red lines.We are dancing the hokey cokey with the Customs Union and Single Market, which means restricting our freedom for new free trade agreements.These, of course, are critical to the national economic success of Brexit. European regulations will remain in force — with no input from the UK. So we stay under the rule of European courts and provide a back door for continued freedom of movement for EU nationals into Britain.Our laws and courts will not be supreme as Chequers would leave us being run by remote control from Brussels.To frighten us into submission we are spoon-fed a daily diet of tales of food shortages, soldiers in the streets and tailbacks from Dover to Land’s End.But the political graveyards are full of people who underestimated the good sense of the British people, the very people who want to be in command of their own destiny and who don’t want to be taken advantage of by the EU.And don’t forget that despite Project Fear in the referendum, the majority still voted to Leave and the fear-mongering was proven false.So false that the fear of recession and job losses was met by a growing economy, UK manufacturing output growing at its fastest rate in a decade, exports to the US in 2016 exceeding £100billion — more than twice as much as exports to any other country — and the fact that our economy is worth more than £2trillion and is the sixth largest in the world.Project Fear was proven false and so will this latest version of fear, which speaks volumes about what the Government thinks of voters — sheep to frighten into the right pen. But sheep we are not.I’ve spent the past few weeks meeting party activists, businesses and the public, supporters of Leave and Remain from across the country and the view is that Chequers will give us neither our economic nor political freedom.Their concerns are simple. There can be no halfway house, where Britain continues to be out of Europe in name but is still run by Europe.There can be no halfway house when it comes to rule-taking and law-making from the EU, and there is an overwhelming sense of frustration that Britain is being taken advantage of by the EU.And across the heartlands of the UK this matters, as these people are the ones who have been left behind and who are desperate to take back control of our laws, our borders and our money. There will also be long-term consequences if the largest democratic vote in British history is frustrated.We will face a crisis of democracy in which ordinary people will utterly lose their faith and trust in politics and in politicians. The implications for political parties at the polls when they fail to deliver is clear, the public will stop voting for them. We cannot ignore the people.The Conservative Party could throw away hard-won gains in pro-Leave constituencies across the North East and Midlands if we continue to compromise on the referendum and concede ground to Brussels.Across Europe we have seen political parties and governments do exactly that and the result is a wave of terrifying extreme forms of nationalism and populism. That is not the British way because when our governments deliver, they deliver for our country and our people.The time has come for our political leaders to believe in Britain and in the British people. They should abandon the weak-kneed approach and instead play to our strengths. Britain wants to secure a trade deal with the EU and seeks to establish a “strong and special partnership” with them.Talk of no deal really means no trade deal, and if the EU fails to reach a free trade agreement with Britain, in the long term we can thrive under World Trade Organisation rules. The UK exports to 111 countries under WTO rules and over the past 23 years this grew at a rate which was three times faster than those exporting to the major EU nations.We also know that the European Commission, thanks to the many political problems across the European Union, desperately needs British taxpayers to foot the “exit payment” of £39billion to balance its budget.And 1.2million EU jobs depend on selling goods to Britain, with London providing much-needed financing to EU businesses. Brexit will not be easy.There is hard work to do but we are up to the task. We are a free and independent country and will prosper if given a proper chance.But to let the British lion roar again the first step is to chuck Chequers.The Prime Minister assures us freedom of movement will end and that we’ll be able to do trade deals. Others, including former Cabinet ministers such as Ms Patel, believe otherwise.It is time for the Prime Minister to sell the Chequers deal directly to the country.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is expected nearly 100 could be killed in the attack.He hatched the plot in March and April after he was blocked from joining ISIS extremists in the Philippines.Ludlow, of Rochester, Kent, wanted to carry out a “multiple casualty vehicle-borne assault” in central London with the aim of killing more than 100 people.He had been due to stand trial but today admitted plotting an attack in the UK and funding ISIS abroad at the Old Bailey.A charge of attempting to join IS in the Philippines was left to lie on the file.He told police he was going to the Philippines as a sex tourist.The court heard Ludlow had sworn allegiance to ISIS as he prepared for the deadly massacre.He identified Oxford Street as an ideal target, writing: It is expected nearly 100 could be killed in the attack.Ludlow was arrested on April 18 by officers from Kents Counter Terrorism unit with his plans later found torn in pieces in a bin.Chilling notes included his plot to launch on Oxford Street using a van - noting the lack of safety barriers.Cops also seized a mobile containing photos taken on a trip to London in March while carrying out reconnaissance.They also found three videos where Ludlow - calling himself The Eagle spat hatred for unbelivers and ranted about his desire to establish Sharia law.He had established a Facebook page called Antique collections, for funding so that money could be transmitted elsewhere.The terror plotter transferred around £120 to a radicalised medic living in the Philippines.Prosecutor Mark Heywood said: The prosecutions case is that in February 2018, he tried to travel to Zamboanga in the Philippines.His intention was to join or lend support to Daesh or Islamic States organisation in that area.After that, his travel did not occur because it was prevented, so he engaged in preparing acts of terrorism in the UK.Ludlow will be sentenced on November 2. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Without sight of the report the family has no answer to these questions.He also said possible evidence over whether disciplinary proceedings were brought against police officers in Poland over Mr Spiers death should be heard at the inquest.Science fiction writer Monika Duvall, a friend who Mr Bates had reportedly been living with at the time of his death, was also asked to attend the inquest.Speaking afterwards, his mum Vanessa Bates said: I did not expect him to go to Poland and not come back.He should be here. He was very fit and healthy when I said goodbye to him. I miss him dreadfully.She added: I think when we get to the inquest we will know more about whether police procedures were or were not followed.I think it is going to be very difficult to get the Polish witnesses over here.Its been a long time coming, but Im just relieved that at last something is happening and there is a proper investigation and inquest.After Mr Spiers body was repatriated to the UK, doctors at a Margate hospital were unable to determine the cause of his death. An initial inquest in Canterbury opened in December 2016 when the court heard he vomited two litres of black fluid, but the inquest was adjourned last year.The court heard Mr Spiers had been on holiday was a friend in Cyprus before heading to Poland where he was speaking at a conference.Shortly before his death, Mr Spiers was said to have been probing into the lives of well-known figures in politics, business and entertainment.At the time his mum Vanessa said she feared the worst: I think Max had been digging in some dark places and somebody wanted him dead.Her theory was shared by many online, with other conspiracy theorists, UFO investigators and bloggers calling the circumstances of Mr Spiers death suspicious.At the time, Coroner Alan Blunsdon told the court he was still awaiting a report from Polish authorities, adding that the workload of Kent Police may delay forensic analysis of Mr Spiers phone and computer.Coroner Christopher Sutton Mattocks set the date of January 7 for the four-day inquest, which will be heard at the Archbishops Palace in Maidstone.He said: It is extremely important that when we start everybody is completely ready for this and we have all the information available."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000425530294.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"heatwave and world cup combine economy","story":"Higher household spending helped overcome a worrying fall in exports and a manufacturing recession.And business investment rose despite fears of a crash in confidence due to the Brussels deadlock.The ONS said growth hit 0.4 per cent in the three months to June – against 0.2 per cent in the previous three months.Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “The World Cup, the Royal Wedding and warm weather got consumers spending on beers and barbecues.“But higher energy bills and petrol prices, and a backdrop of weak wage growth, suggests the shackles are still on the UK economy.” Others warned growth was “anaemic”.The trade deficit widened from £4.7billion to £8.6billion in the three months to May on a notable fall in exports to non-EU nations.Chancellor Philip Hammond insisted the Government wasn’t complacent.He announced a £1billion business innovation fund to generate more high-tech jobs on a visit to Coventry.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the country was paying the price for Tory austerity.He stormed: “Councils are going bankrupt and the NHS is in permanent crisis while holidaymakers are being hit by the Pound.

That’s one of the great pull factors.“Leaving the EU, we should not be offering for people to come over here just looking for work and to claim benefits.“We need a living wage that does not require people to come over here and claim benefits to top up.”But CBI deputy director-general Josh Hardie rejected Mr Duncan Smith’s assessment.He said: “The suggestion that British businesses do not even bother to look at British workers to fill roles is wholly detached from reality and needlessly provocative to the thousands of firms across the UK facing labour and skills shortages.“Businesses are trying to have a balanced, honest debate about a new immigration system for the UK.“We need to build this model from facts, not fantasy.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Well, I was wrong about the messy divorce.Bam! This week Angelina claimed that Brad wasn’t paying her enough child support.Kapow! He hit back that he has coughed up over £7million since they first split over 18 months ago.Sock! Angelina then put the boot in by saying that most of the money was just a loan that she’s having to pay back with interest.Wham! He claims she wants to manipulate the media into branding him a deadbeat dad.It once again proves that no one knows what’s going on inside someone else’s marriage.It might look perfect bliss on the outside, but we have no idea what tense battles are being fought on a daily basis behind closed doors.Despite us all being spoon-fed stories of their perfect relationship over the years, and shown photos of their wedding when the children drew pictures on Angelina’s beautiful white dress, it appears that this relationship has been on the rocks for quite some time.Brad’s friends claim she is fired up with anger over the custody battle and doesn’t want the children to have any sort of relationship with their father.They have slammed her for going public instead of having the divorce hammered out in front of a private judge.Her friends counterclaim that he drank too much and was “rough” with one of the children, thought to be Maddox, the eldest, while they were on a private plane.He was cleared of any wrongdoing, but mud sticks and this was highly damaging as well as deeply distressing for Brad.These two extremely gifted, pampered, beautiful people might have met on a movie set and become infatuated with each other, but this is not a film.This is real life and there are six bewildered youngsters caught up in the eye of the storm.There’s the aforementioned Maddox, 17, then Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 12, and ten-year-old twins Vivienne and Knox.Shiloh and the twins are the biological children of Brad and Angelina, but they have all been brought up to think of themselves as full brothers and sisters, and just one big family.So it must now be extremely unsettling for them to see all the news reports about custody fights and money squabbles, and to have witnessed friends of their parents forced into taking sides.I have no idea whether the children witnessed any arguments or screaming matches between their parents, but there surely must have been an uncomfortable atmosphere at home in the months before the split.The poor, wee children actually have their own psychiatrists that Brad’s friends claim he pays for.And they have round-the-clock bodyguards available.As with so many splits, money has reared its ugly head, and despite their enormous wealth (it’s estimated that Brad is worth £202million and that Angelina has a personal fortune of £125million) it would appear that it’s all coming down to cold, hard cash.We are a long, long way from the heady Brangelina days when they were the world’s sexiest couple and couldn’t keep their hands off each other.Sadly, most white-hot affairs tend to fizzle out when domesticity kicks in and you need to change nappies and wipe snot from little faces.Even with a team of nannies, six children running around is probably one of the biggest passion killers of all time.So, it’s a real shame that Brad and Angelina couldn’t make it work, but sadder still that their dirty washing is being aired for all the world to see.But theirs is not the only love story to turn rancid . . .ROMEO and Juliet ended in tragedy at the end of Gone With The Wind, Rhett tells Scarlett that he doesn’t give a damn

guzzle.Apparently they nod wisely when we solemnly declare that we have but one small sherry on a Sunday night while watching Songs of Praise, and then they simply double whatever we say or put down a number that seems most likely.New info this week says that just 40 per cent of patients tell the truth to their GPs when it comes to how much they drink every week.Frankly, I’m astonished the figure is that high.Most of us play down our booze intake and exaggerate the amount of exercise we do, but even as we are telling such huge porkies, we all know in our hearts that our doctors aren’t the least bit fooled.We want them to think we are model citizens and that our bodies are temples, but in the long run we need to tell the truth so we can get a proper diagnosis and treatment.And always bear in mind you can’t kid a kidder.There are lots of doctors who overindulge and they know all the tricks and cover-ups.IT’S the final episode of The Handmaid’s Tale tomorrow night, and I will be watching from behind the sofa to find out the fate of our heroine June.She inhabits a world where women have no rights, and handmaids are ritually raped, mutilated and even killed.It’s not easy viewing, but Elisabeth Moss has been mesmerising throughout as June, whose first child was ripped from her arms, and whose newborn baby was also taken away from her.I’m bracing myself for an emotional rollercoaster and Miss Moss should clear her sideboard for a slew of awards.The Handmaid’s Tale, Sunday, Channel 4, 9pm.WHAT sad news to discover that Margot Kidder, who shone so very brightly as the feisty and fiercely intelligent Lois Lane in the original Superman movies, died by suicide.Margot’s death happened back in May, but it was revealed this week that she died as a rfesult of a “self-inflicted drug and alcohol overdose”.The 69-year-old suffered from depression and other mental health issues, which became worse after a car accident in 1990 left her wheelchair-bound for almost two years and facing mounting debts.She had a very tough time but she tried hard to sort out her life and cope with her illness.We should remember her in her heyday.I loved the fact she wasn’t a conventional glamour puss at a time when any actress playing the “love interest” in an action movie was usually a busty blonde doing little more than squeaking and waiting to be rescued.Lois Lane was a kick-ass reporter who adored Superman but also made fun of him during four movies between 1978 and 1987.Those films had real heart and soul and – if you ignore the rather wobbly special effects – are far more entertaining than many of the over-long, over-loud and rather self-important superhero movies of today.I’M no fan of his, but I don’t think Boris Johnson should be forced to apologise for likening woman who wear burkas to letter boxes.It’s his opinion.You very well might disagree, but getting him to say sorry won’t make him stop thinking such thoughts.He will just stop writing and uttering that particular view in public and instead will voice it in private.And that, in my opinion, is far more dangerous.GOT a story? RING The Sun on 0207 782 4104 or WHATSAPP on 07423720250

I didn’t know what was happening because everything was black.There’s so many power cuts in Donabate as it is so I thought it was that, but deep down I knew there was something wrong.So, I crawled my way out of the bedroom and my husband Paul is a taxi driver and thank God he came in [home] and he started screaming and he rang an ambulance.“My sight was gone, completely gone. The whole place was black. My eye was being pushed out by the parasite.Suzanne had been in the shower when the Acanthamoeba parasite crawled behind her contact lens.The organism is usually found in bodies of water such as lakes but also swims in domestic tap water, swimming pools, hot tubs, soil and air and affects contact lens wearers.Doctors managed to kill the nerves and clean them so thankfully Suzannes sight was saved.But she explained the pain was like a searing hot knife through my eye.Suzanne also claims the warm weather is to blame for the worms being in the water.The parasite is usually found in bodies of water (lakes, oceans and rivers) as well as domestic tap water, swimming pools, hot tubs, soil and air.Humans come into contact with them when we wash, swim and drink water but they can cause a serious eye disease if they infect the cornea.AK is most common in people who wear contact lenses, but anyone with a corneal injury could develop the infection.The mum said: It can only happen a contact lens wearer because the contact lens creates a vacuum in the eye.

Bearing in mind that those who self-harm are at much greater risk of suicide, this is not a problem to be taken lightly.For some young people the act of cutting, or otherwise inflicting pain on themselves, is a way of relieving — albeit temporarily — mental pain and torment by converting it into something more visible and tangible.It’s a way of relieving tension and an attempt to clarify a confusing mental swirl into something that is easier to understand in its simplicity. It’s also a way of punishing yourself.So why the sudden, huge, increase in girls taking this path?Psychiatrists commenting on the research blamed a combination of academic stresses and body-image issues triggered by the use of social media.There’s no doubt that social media, which barely existed ten years ago, has, along with all the good stuff, brought with it a whole new set of pressures.Women’s appearances have always been scrutinised, but that unique equation of the selfie generation plus Photoshop plus the sheer variety of ways to propel your image out into the world has created a series of impossible standards.It’s also created a whole generation that is convinced that everything is going brilliantly for everyone else.When teenagers look at their friend’s social media feeds they see apparently perfect lives, bodies, homes and jobs.And then they feel inadequate.There are other pressures: Pressure to do well in exams have amazing friendships and be brilliantly successful. And, for some people, the relief to those pressures is to hurt themselves, which is surely the saddest and one of the most difficult problems any parent can deal with.After all, it’s our natural instinct to protect our children from harm. But what can we do when the harm comes from within themselves?All teenage kids have intensely difficult phases. And the pressures at school can feel unbearable.If someone doesn’t like you, it feels like the end of the world. If you fail an exam you can feel doomed to failure. School feels like it will never end.Our job is to try to help our children get perspective.Despite the downsides of excessive social media being well documented, it seems that most young people would rather end up with mental health problems than give it up. So maybe they need a helping hand.We need to talk more to our kids about the reality of social media — and limit their time on it.And we need to coax them out of their screen-sized comfort zone.One of the best things kids can do is some volunteering.That way they can meet kids from different backgrounds and people with real problems — such as children born with disabilities who are still making the most of their life.Sport is also brilliant for getting kids to enjoy being part of something bigger than their bedroom, and for celebrating their bodies for what they can do rather than what they look like.The big question is, how can we get them to talk about their feelings, instead of engraving them into their skin until they draw blood?Be kind, patient but determined and, most importantly, we need to talk to our children, ask them how they are feeling — and listen to the answers without judgment.If they won’t talk to you, find someone else they can talk to, either a family friend or even a counsellor if you’re worried about self-harm.But the Government also needs to invest more money into care.Less than one per cent of the NHS budget is spent on children’s mental health, and most of that is on acute care rather than preventative or early intervention services.That needs to change.Most of all, we need to accept that there is a problem and find ways to address it. Because if we don’t, things are going to get much, much worse.SURELY only those with the hardest of hearts could complain about the affection shown by Zara and Mike Tindall, who are frequently photographed kissing, hugging and looking generally happy and totally loved-up.Given they have survived challenging personal losses and have two young children, it’s pretty much a miracle they are so happy.How could anyone wish them anything but well?DID you see the Kardashian and Jenner sisters at Kylie Jenner’s 21st birthday party?What is most striking – other than them all being drop-dead gorgeous, of course – is that they each have totally different body types.I guess what they DO have in common is an unlimited budget for personal trainers and chefs . . . plus the fact that looking this good is their full-time job.His crime was horrific and he deserved to be dealt with.His punishment was to be beheaded and his body crucified and displayed in Mecca.A beheading and crucifixion in this century?There are instances when I do believe that the death penalty is just, but this method is just barbaric.THE latest advice from fertility specialists to women who want to “delay motherhood” is for them to freeze their eggs in their early twenties.At the moment, the vast majority of women who go through the procedure do so in their late thirties – by which time they have little chance of success. But who is going to freeze their eggs in their twenties?I was fortunate to meet the right man in my twenties – and had children once I was married because I wanted to have a family.But plenty of women don’t meet the right partner that early in life, or simply don’t want to have children until they are older.One reason for that is that they want to have a career – and they know babies can seriously damage their chances of promotion or even a pay rise.But the solution is not for women to freeze their eggs.The real solution is a shift in the division of labour between mothers and fathers.So long as the children are not the sole responsibility of just one person in the family, things can work well.If both partners are equally involved, nobody has to totally compromise their life and put their career on hold.As things stand, no wonder women are putting off motherhood. But if more men pulled their weight, maybe women wouldn’t have to worry about freezing their eggs.WHEN you look at photos of the 200 travellers who have descended on the village of Long Ditton in Surrey, you can see why local police sparked fury by telling residents who want to evict them to have empathy instead.The police force tweeted: “Consider for a second how upsetting it would be, being uprooted every few days.”But the photos show piles of rubbish and damaged property.In one, a child is sitting on an adult’s lap while he drives a car around the village green. And I dread to think about the specifics of the toilet situation.What is needed is not empathy but police action.SOME high-profile, wealthy parents – such as Sting, Elton John and Simon Cowell – make a point of saying they won’t leave their fortunes to their children for fear it will ruin their lives.Location, Location, Location presenter Kirstie Allsopp has taken a different tack.She says she will leave her £16million fortune to her two sons . . . IF they get a job.I applaud the sentiment. But if you really want your children to develop a work ethic, rather than relying on inherited income, isn’t the key not to tell your kids – and the whole world – in a national newspaper?Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Egyptian floated the business on the stock market again nine years later, minus Harrods, which had been its most valuable asset.By the late 1990s, struggling to compete with the new out-of-town shopping outlets that had lured shoppers away from the traditional high street locations from which it traded, House of Fraser was labouring under heavy debts.The solution of John Coleman, its chief executive at the time, was to strike a deal in July 1999 that saw the freeholds of 15 of the group\u0027s stores sold and then leased back.Unfortunately, a store freehold can only be sold once and the sale-and-leaseback agreement tied House of Fraser into some onerous rental agreements, some of which went out 40 years.In the meantime, the group continued to be a consolidator in the sector, snapping up rivals such as Beatties, the Midlands department store operator and Jenners, based in Edinburgh.Some, like Jenners and Dickins \u0026 Jones, have retained their names but, along the way, other famous old brands owned by House of Fraser have been replaced with the latter brand.The last Army \u0026 Navy stores, for example, were rechristened House of Fraser in 2005 stores previously trading under the name Binns, largely in the North East of England, were nearly all rebranded by 2006 and DH Evans was rebranded as long ago as 2001. These rebrandings in many cases severed a link between the stores and communities in which they had traded for many years and confused older shoppers.The next chapter came when, in 2006, House of Fraser was bought by the Icelandic group Baugur. The latter went bust three years later, in the wake of the financial crisis and the collapse of Iceland\u0027s economy, with Baugur\u0027s shares being scattered among a group of Icelandic banks.By then House of Fraser was in the middle of a turnaround under John King, the former Matalan boss, who had joined in early 2007 and Don McCarthy, an experienced retailer who became chairman under Baugur.But in 2013, the business changed hands again, being bought by the Chinese retailer Sanpower for a remarkable \u0026#163480m. Mr McCarthy left almost immediately and the talented Mr King, who had been promised the chairmanship by the new owners, left at the beginning of 2015 when that pledge went unfulfilled.The Chinese have proved to be as poor owners of House of Fraser as Mr Fayed was. Promised investment has never materialised, experienced managers have left the business and the group was left in no fit state to face either the hurricanes buffeting the high street or the intensification of competition as both John Lewis and Debenhams sought to respond to changing consumer tastes."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/08/2048x1152/skynews-news-quiz_4385865.jpg?20180810130056 ","title":"the festival inbetweener embarrassment but in tents","story":"But director Iain Morris - who created and wrote Channel 4 hit The Inbetweeners - says that is something he welcomes.\"I\u0027m absolutely delighted - I\u0027m delighted people are still talking about The Inbetweeners and I love talking to people about it, and I love that people still want to see it,\" Morris told Sky News.\"I think I\u0027m the same as I was ten years ago, my sense of humour hasn\u0027t changed, what I find funny - torturing Joe Thomas for example - is pretty much the same, so there will be comparisons.\"Not that I\u0027m anywhere near his level, but Judd Apatow in America when you see his comedy films, same sort of people in them, same sort of sense of humour, same sorts of things happening, and I would love it to feel like it\u0027s a sort of continuation of an idea.\" Morris went on to explain that the film compliments his previous work.\"The Inbetweeners and The Festival are all part of the same cinematic universe,\" he said, before joking: \"It\u0027s going to be bigger than Marvel.\"Joe Thomas added that audiences may have certain expectations because of those familiar elements.\"Comedy is about trust I think, the stuff that I really love is in some cases 15, 20, 30 years old and I\u0027ll just go back to it because I still love it, and I think that having got that trust it\u0027s a bit about not losing that trust,\" Thomas said.\"I think this film is just made by people who are absolutely passionate about making something funny and just desperately want to make people laugh.\"It\u0027s a new gang, but I think having Iain and hopefully me is no bad thing.\"Thomas is no stranger to acting in scenes that leave audiences with their toes curling in embarrassment - and The Festival promises more of the same.Asked if he ever reads a script and thinks it\u0027s gone too far, Thomas says it\u0027s not happened yet.\"I think that train has sailed with my career, I\u0027m not going to play Lincoln anytime soon,\" Thomas laughed.\"I\u0027m quite committed I think and quite passionate about committing to the joke basically and wanting to do it to the full extent, so I\u0027ve never really thought I don\u0027t want to do that.Morris admitted that Thomas did go through a tough time while shooting.\"There was a two-week period, just because of the scheduling, it seemed to be every single day Joe was doing something terrible,\" Morris said.\"And even I - and I\u0027m pretty hardened against making Joe do things that are pretty horrible - even I was like \u0027it might be getting a bit much now\u0027\".

We need our police to be rested and ready every day, as their job can be physically exerting. It is unacceptable that so many are forced to take up second jobs to make ends meet.  They are overworked. Police numbers are at their lowest in 30 years, losing over 20,000 under this Government. We’ve seen the highest recorded crime rise in a decade, meaning that many officers are having to give up their days off. They are overstretched. I find it infuriating that the police regularly don’t have the time to investigate burglaries and they can’t dedicate meaningful time to deal with some serious crimes.

In order to rank more than 7,000 surgeries nationwide, we looked at weighted survey results in each of the seven key areas. Each surgery was given a rank for its performance in each area. Those category rankings were then added up to give an overall ranking. It turns out the best surgery in the country is the Brown Clee Medical Centre in Stottesdon in Shropshire. One hundred per cent of patients there said they were treated with care and concern, reception staff were helpful, and their overall experience was good. More than 99 per cent said the doctor listened to them properly, while more than 98 per cent were happy with appointment times on offer. Other surgeries to make the national top five included the Mill Stream Surgery in Oxfordshire, Hingham Surgery near Norwich, Martins Oak Surgery in Battle in East Sussex, and Firs Surgery in Birmingham. Surgeries which had fewer than 50 responses were excluded on the basis the sample was too small to draw reliable conclusions.

John May said the commercial was the turning point for him because although he was only 31, he thought he looked 50.  A selection of photos show the incredible change in his physique.  John, who also owns Sweeps barber shop in Walton, has appeared in several major advertising campaigns – but now is almost unrecognisable as he prepares to take part in his first bodybuilding competition. Now weighing around 11 stone, he is set to appear in the UK Bodybuilding Fitness Federation (BFF) North East Qualifier in Leeds next Sunday (August 19). At his heaviest, John was tipping the scales at 16 stone, and after the break-down of his relationship began feeling down and unhappy. But since January this year, John, from Liverpool, has transformed his life.  The 36-year-old first realised he needed to change around five years ago after seeing himself on a TV ad for Betfred bookies.  He told the Liverpool Echo : “I used to be into running marathons. Around 12 years ago I was running 50 miles a week, I loved it.   “But when I opened my barber shop my focus shifted and I was working all the time, I left the running to one side.  “Over time I started putting weight on. I went from 10 and a half stone to 16 stone. That was over five or six years.” John said time pressures at work meant he did not take proper breaks and would spend his shift eating sugary sweets. He said: “I would go to the shop and buy a big packet of Monster Munch, a chocolate bar and a bottle of coke. “Then I would be drinking Red Bull all day for energy and on the way home I could not be a**** cooking so I would probably stop at Pizza Hut or something.”  But after the Betfred commercial hit the airwaves, John began to realise things needed to change. He said: “It was that commercial. That was sort of the turning point for me. I was 31 and I looked about 50. “So I joined Slimming World and lost around two stone. But over the next few years my relationship with my baby\u0027s mum broke down and I was feeling a bit depressed.” John says there were further false starts, including training for a White Collar boxing event, as his weight yo-yoed up and down. His introduction to body-building came when a customer at Sweeps revealed he had “completely changed his life” through training.  John said: “He kind of inspired me. I wondered if I could do that. I asked him and he told me to go to Tierpro Gym in Waterloo.” John trained for a while before approaching the gym\u0027s owner and 2013 national body-building champio, Karl Tierney. He said: “I went to Karl and I said I want to do a show, do you reckon I could? He sort of looked at me and said \u0027anyone could do it, but you have got to work hard, forget everything you know, re-train your brain and the most important thing is consistency\u0027.” John says with Karl\u0027s help he learned to treat food differently and said he began to think of losing weight as “getting out of debt.” "},{"url":null,"title":"boy 10 who weighs 17","story":"NewsBoy, 10, who weighs 17 STONE feels like a \u0027slave\u0027 to his weight and fears food addiction may kill himKyon Fritz Marriott\u0027s mum claims the NHS has let him down as he can\u0027t get the help she claims will save his lifeShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByScarlet Howes22:00, 11 AUG 2018Updated22:27, 11 AUG 2018NewsKyon and his mother Nadine (Image: Stan Kujawa/Sunday Mirror)Get daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA boy aged just 10 who weighs 17 stone fears he faces death if he cannot beat his food addiction. Terrified Kyon Fritz Marriott, who is believed to be Britain’s most obese primary school child, said he feels like a “slave” to his weight and his out-of-control eating. He is afraid to go outside and is in the grip of such helpless cravings he routinely binges in his family’s bathroom on crisps and chocolate he has stolen from the kitchen. In an anguished plea the lad, who stands 5ft 1in and has a 47in waist, says: “I just want to be a normal 10-year-old. I just want help.” But his desperate mother accuses the NHS of letting him down and says shrinking funding means he won’t get the help he needs to save his life.  Mum Nadine wants Year 5 pupil Kyon to attend the nation’s only residential weight-loss camp, MoreLife. But despite widespread concern over soaring childhood obesity, Government cuts mean not a single child has been referred to the \u0026pound4,000 scheme on the NHS in over a year. Instead Kyon has been told to wait two years for surgery which will cost the NHS more than twice as much. Last night experts warned that the shocking case is a symptom of a “national health crisis”.  Nadine, 44, who claims Kyon has been taunted and tormented by other kids for years, said: “I am scared for my child. I am scared that if obesity doesn’t kill him, the bullies will. “I don’t understand why the NHS will fund expensive surgery but they won’t fund the psychological help he needs. Who knows what state he will be in by the time he is 12? “I live in fear that if his weight doesn’t destroy his health he will end up stabbed or beaten to death by the bullies who are making his life hell.” Kyon began piling on weight when he was only seven as a result of teasing at school. A vicious cycle of bullying and comfort eating followed.  He said: “People at school call me fat boy, burger boy or Homer Simpson. They kick and headbutt me. “I feel like a prisoner. I can’t go out and live a normal life.” Kyon’s plight comes after a report last month revealed that one in 25 British 10 and 11 year olds are grossly overweight. There are currently 2.5 million obese children in the UK. The treatment options offered to Kyon will raise serious questions over the way the health crisis is being dealt with by the authorities. Doctors say he will be offered a bariatric op, which costs the NHS up to \u0026pound10,000, after he turns 12.  But childhood obesity expert Dr Rangan Chatterjee, GP and star of BBC1’s Doctor In The House, said bariatric surgery does not tackle the root cause of obesity in kids. He said: “Surgery is like putting a band-aid over the problem. It may get Kyon’s weight down but it’s not helping him in the long term. “Any therapy needs to take a 360-degree approach to the problem and people need to be dealt with compassion. This is the biggest crisis our country is facing.”  MoreLife founder Professor Paul Gately claims state-funded places for ordinary kids have been wiped out altogether as the NHS battles a \u0026pound960million black hole. Paul, who has run the camp since 1999, said: “We have had kids all over Britain funded by local authorities and \u0026shyClinical Commissioning Groups in the past. But we have had no kids through our doors in the last year who have been approved for NHS funding. “Around 80 a year once had their fees paid for, initially by NHS Primary Care Trusts and then, when they were scrapped, by CCGs and local \u0026shyauthorities. But the money has run out.”  In 2014 Kyon went on an NHS nine-month dietary programme at a London clinic called the Mary Sheridan Centre and his weight stabilised. However four years later he was morbidly obese – 13st heavier than the average 10-year-old and too big for any school uniform. His mum admitted she feels guilty for serving portions of his favourite dinners too large for his age. She also conceded it is “really hard” to tell exactly how much food he consumes every day because he eats so much in secret. She told how he locks himself in the bathroom of their South London home for secret half-hour binges, hiding empty crisp packets and choc wrappers behind the sink and in his bathrobe pockets. Nadine, whose other son and daughter are normal weights, said: “When I first saw he had been stealing food, my heart broke. Now every time I hear the fridge door open I panic. “I constantly ask him what he’s doing. But I have to put my hands up as mum.” "},{"url":null,"title":"dad digs 6ft hole beach","story":"NewsDad who dug six-foot hole on beach for son is spoken to by safety officers after members of public brand it \"dangerous\"Members of the public alerted beach safety officials to the hole in Cleethorpes, North East LincolnshireShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByPeter Craig1=21:38, 11 AUG 2018Updated21:51, 11 AUG 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay nowGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA dad who dug a six-foot hole on a beach for his young son\u0027s bucket list had safety officers called on him.

We uncovered the figure after an undercover charity probe publicised an appalling trade in designer dogs by \u0026shyruthless foreign crooks. Vehicle-loads of tiny pups – many far younger than the ages on their paperwork – are transported here from Eastern Europe in heartbreaking states of distress. The trade is masterminded by \u0026shycriminals cashing in on the craze for pedigree pets seen on telly reality shows and for owners desperate to show off their cute pooches on Instagram. Most of the dogs were found abandoned at ports in sweltering lorries, drugged to sneak them past checkpoints. Many were too young to legally enter the country and few were vaccinated against serious diseases like rabies and tapeworm.  Dogs Trust campaigner Paula Boyden says the legislation designed to protect animals is failing adding: “Illegally importing puppies needs to end now. We urge the Government to increase the penalties.” We obtained figures from the Government’s Animal and Plant Health Agency under freedom of information laws. The figures show that in the two years to January, 1,117 illegal puppies were intercepted in the UK. A complete breakdown of where all the pups were seized was not available but well over half were found at two major ports in Kent – 377 at Dover and 360 at the Channel Tunnel entry point in \u0026shyFolkestone. It means on average almost two illegal puppies a day are being smuggled on to our shores. And the true total of dogs going through the trafficking pipeline is far higher, as many make it through - undetected or die somewhere along the horrendous journey. The evil trade is part of a Europe-wide organised crime racket netting bootleg breeders hundreds of thousands of pounds.  Gangs exploiting lax border controls are feeding demand for \u0026shyfashionable breeds such as French and English bulldogs, pugs, chow chows and dachshunds. So-called “handbag dogs” which are so tiny they can be carried around can be bought in Eastern Europe for as little as \u0026pound20 and sold for \u0026pound1,200 here – so even small-scale operators can make \u0026shythousands every week. Last year the canine welfare charity Dogs Trust spent six months probing one of the criminal networks. It discovered a web of crooked puppy farmers, vets and handlers in Lithuania and Poland were greedily exploiting the system. And it claimed four-week-old puppies with umbilical cords still attached had been subjected to a gruelling, 30-hour journey to the UK. Footage recorded by the charity’s investigators showed dogs kept in squalor, with poor hygiene standards and commonplace mistreatment of puppies and mothers alike. In the clips, the puppies are crammed into tiny cages which are then piled up and stuffed inside vans. One smuggler was recorded boasting how he nets 1000 euros, around \u0026pound890, for each dog sold. Under UK Pet Passport \u0026amp Import Regulations it is illegal to bring unvaccinated puppies under 12 weeks into the country. The rules do permit the importation of up to five dogs, provided they are at least 15 weeks old, microchipped and have proof of receiving rabies and tapeworm vaccinations.  However the footage shows that faking documents to dodge these rules is key to the smuggling operation. A handler in Poland is filmed boasting that dogs can be made to appear however old buyers want them to be. He adds: “If it’s two months, it can be made three. If it’s three, then four.” He holds up one puppy as a good prospect for smuggling because it has teeth, which would suggest it is older than it is. He says: “They took away five Yorkies from me at the English border because they were too young. “He looked into the papers, saw that it stated that the dog was four months old and it barely had teeth. In reality it was two months old.” Video taken in Lithuania shows a woman claiming to be a vet offering the investigator sedatives to silence the dogs. In subtitles translating what she is saying, she talks about waiting “for about half an hour or 40 minutes” and then advises: “When you are about to enter the checkpoints at the border inject the medication 10-15 minutes beforehand then wait a bit. It is a very strong sedative. The puppy will be able to hear everything but it won’t cry or make any noise. It will look like it’s sleeping.” She also offers the investigator medication to make the puppy “wake up” after clearing the checkpoint, urging: “Wrap it up and put somewhere it won’t be seen”. When asked about the risks of smuggling into the UK and if it happens often, she shrugs: “Everything happens.” The footage also appears to show a Lithuanian handler passing on falsified paperwork – and agreeing to supply the buyer with vaccinations to administer after arrival in Britain. A couple who adopted an English Bulldog found dumped in a bucket told how his traumatic start to life has left him with anxiety and behavioural issues. James and Charlotte Boult rehomed Snoop after he was smuggled into Dover from Hungary at 12 weeks old – three weeks below the minimum age required by law. Since his rescue, Snoop has had two surgeries to remove blinding ulcers from his eyes and received treatment from a behavioural therapist who believes his ordeal has given him severe anxiety. James and Charlotte already had a four-year-old bulldog called Buddy, who they bought from a reputable breeder. Then they decided to apply to adopt Snoop via the Dogs Trust Puppy Pilot scheme after watching a documentary about smuggling. James, a 32-year-old estate agent, said: “Puppy farming is crazy – really scary. Bulldogs are prone to health issues but more so when they’ve had poor breeding standards. These smugglers are exploiting Britain as a nation of dog lovers.” James and Charlotte, 33, of Milton Keynes, Bucks, soon found that Snoop had health problems which weren’t immediately obvious. James said: “He was tiny when he was found and we’ve got no idea what other trauma he might have suffered before we took him in. “He had two surgeries on his eyes in December and March, and vet bills aren’t cheap. “When he turned one he started to get a bit aggressive to Buddy, who is very social and chilled-out. “A behaviour specialist said a dog’s personality is formed in the first 61 days of life. When it starts to reach maturity those traits begin to come out. “But Snoop gets a lot of love and care and we are patient with him after his awful start. We hope he will learn to trust again in time.”"},{"url":null,"title":"emmy wanted this pride britain","story":"NewsPride of Britain winner Jake Coates says \u0027Emmy wanted this\u0027 after finding love six months after wife died of cancerEXCLUSIVE: In their first ever interview, Jake Coates and new girlfriend Jenna Elsby say the universe \u0027pulled\u0027 them together after a period of darkness in both of their livesShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByLucy Clarke-Billings19:37, 11 AUG 2018Updated23:23, 11 AUG 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay nowGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailPride of Britain winner Jake Coates stole the hearts of the nation by raising \u0026pound142,000 for charity with wife Emmy as she was dying of cancer. But just over a year after her death, he has hit back at claims he found love again too quickly, insisting: “Emmy wanted me to meet someone.” The 33-year-old artist is now living with Jenna Elsby, also 33, and her four-year-old son Charlie. It is a romance that sparked a backlash from his late wife’s grieving family and followers of her inspirational blog. Emmy’s sister Sophie publicly slammed her brother-in-law for “disrespecting” her sister, who she claimed would be “heartbroken”. But in their first interview, the new couple tell how they felt they were destined to be together.  Jake said: “It’s tough when you get messages from people close to you saying negative things. “But people deal with grief in different ways and those messages were coming from a place of hurt. “I will never personally say anything against Emmy’s family but I did feel let down. I think if I had come out and said I had a girlfriend then, now or even a year from now, it would have been a hard pill for some people to swallow. “Emmy wanted me to be happy. She wanted me to meet someone, she told me that.” The primary school teacher died aged 31 in June 2017, less than a year after their wedding and just 18 months after being diagnosed with thyroid cancer.  In February Jake announced he had abandoned plans to have their baby using her frozen embryos and a surrogate mother after two failed attempts. Three months before that he had accepted an award for Fundraiser of the Year on behalf of Emmy at the Daily Mirror’s Pride of Britain awards. He continues to raise money for the Royal Marsden Hospital, London, by running marathons and it was shortly after the awards that Jenna – a marketing expert and lifestyle writer – got in touch to offer her help. They soon discovered plenty in common. Jenna grew up in Chepstow, south Wales, near Jake in Monmouth. And when Jake worked as a doctor at the Royal North Shore Hospital in Sydney, Jenna lived just a short walk away with her Australian husband and young son.  “I knew of Jake through a mutual friend at school and I wanted to help so I got in touch and offered him my marketing services,” Jenna said. “I didn’t know much about his story because I’d been living abroad and then in my own merry hell going through a divorce with Charlie’s dad.” During Jenna’s separation from her husband, she lost a friend to suicide and a very close friend to cancer. “It’s something I lived through first hand,” Jenna says. “We were just in a really similar situation. “Bad stuff had happened and we were both a bit war beaten. “But we both have a really similar outlook on life which is it’s about the here and now and looking forward and creating happiness, whatever that means, every day.”  Jenna and Jake began messaging back and forth and arranged a business lunch in London just before Christmas. Jenna said: “We went into that business lunch with professional heads on but the conversations were informal from the get-go. Our pasts were linked. We came away feeling things maybe we shouldn’t have been feeling. “I felt like I’d known Jake my whole life. “Jake is not defined by his past in the same way I’m not defined by mine. There was an obvious connection between us and you have to open your heart to love again. In honour of those who can’t live a life, I know I have a responsibility to make every day count.” Jake said he felt an instant attraction to Jenna and for the first time he could see himself moving forward.  He said: “I absolutely had no intention of meeting anybody at that time. “It was the most unexpected thing. I was just trying to keep my head straight and focused and it was the last thing on my mind. “She walked out of Covent Garden Tube stop and she was all smiles. I fancied her a lot quite quickly. “I didn’t even know I was ready for another relationship until I met Jenna. No one was more surprised than me. “Jenna and Charlie played a huge part in helping me out of a dark place. They brought the sunshine back into my life again. “Towards the end of our first meeting – which ended up lasting about 10 hours – I actually leaned in for a kiss and she gave me a bit of a telling off.” Jenna added: “I liked him a lot. How can you not? He’s delicious. But in that moment I was shocked.”  The couple arranged a proper date and their relationship took off. In February, they jetted to Iceland on their first mini-break. And as Jenna beamed next to a suitcase on the train station platform, Jake snapped a picture, uploaded it to Instagram and made their relationship public. The caption read: “Who’s a lucky boy then?! Escaping again – this time for a few days of R\u0026ampR and a little bit of marathon training to the end of the world with his gorgeous little ragamuffin!” Instantly, hurtful comments came flooding in, slamming Jake and calling Jenna “evil”, a “rebound”, “ugly” and “shameful”.

The call girl, who works for one of Birmingham\u0027s largest escort agencies, earns thousands of pounds a week from her clients and offers everything from sex to just spending a bit of time with a client.   The woman, who asked to remain anonymous, charges \u0026pound160 an hour and can earn anything from \u0026pound3,000 to \u0026pound4,000 in a single week, offering the \u0027full girlfriend experience\u0027.   She told Birmingham Live that escorts are not pushed into the city\u0027s sex industry and said she enjoys her work, gaining thrills along with plenty of money.   She began escorting as a teenager when she became fed up of her job in retail. I was just curious, I wasn\u0027t pushed into it or anything - it was completely my choice, she said. I just wanted to try something new. But I ended up doing quite well so I quit my job in a shop and carried on doing it. She knew exactly what escorting was when she applied, having done extensive research into Birmingham\u0027s top three agencies, their reputation and prices. The manager met her for a drink and checked whether she had the \u0027right look\u0027 for the job before selling her to a client the very next day. When asked what drove her to lead such a controversial lifestyle, she said it is the thrill and the money. The escort, who describes herself as a white, blonde, barbie-looking thing also rubbished idea that escorts have sex with all their clients. Instead, she claimed only around 20 per cent of her customers demand intercourse with her. We could be going out for a meal, or just chilling at home - somebody has booked to take me to the Casino tonight, it can really vary. I remember my first job was a mature gentleman who paid for a basic service - we had wine and I stayed for an hour with him and kept him company. Luckily he was very nice and polite. It\u0027s not all having sex and stuff, it\u0027s more like company and chilling. Sometimes you\u0027re with people for a long time like ten hours, just chilling.  She added: Some of them do have wives, last night I saw a lot of people have arguments with their girlfriends, wives, they were in hotels and getting wrecked with escorts. But a lot of people know they don\u0027t have time for a wife, they\u0027re too busy making money. Property tycoons who own large apartment blocks make up some of her clients too, and around half of the men are single. Some have had wives in the past. I\u0027d say it\u0027s about 50/50 of them being single or married and or with children. The escort - who is single due to work being tiring and time consuming - said some men have a stronger connection with her than others. One regular client even confesses his love for her and promises her everything should she ever wish to quit.  Her job often takes her to places like the four-star Hyatt Hotel in the city or the homes of millionaires, but she said this is not where escorts spend every night. Last night I was at the Travelodge for an hour. Sometimes you go to tower blocks, sometimes you go to people who live in house shares - it\u0027s not always really posh nice houses. That doesn\u0027t bother me, as long as they\u0027re nice and clean. I\u0027ve got really nice regular clients who live in Handsworth in a house share. But equally, she has had clients who were rude, unclean and disrespectful - all of which leads to her refusing to give them their service. I\u0027ve seen really horrible people that were millionaires who I wouldn\u0027t want to see again because they\u0027re not nice. If I don\u0027t want to do anything, or if they\u0027re not clean, they\u0027re p***** me off or they\u0027re rude, I will give them a limited service if I still feel safe. If they haven\u0027t showered properly and that\u0027s annoyed me, I will make them get in the shower and also give them a limited service.  But if they are rude to her, she leaves the premises and calls one of the agencies\u0027 drivers - who she says are there for their protection too. She said she was once chased around a hotel by a client she refused to have sex with as he had an STI. I refused to do anything with him, I was running around the hotel. Nobody is safe from any trouble, she added. Certain clients will even ask for \u0027special requests\u0027 if they have fetishes they want to fulfill. We do see some crazy people that want crazy things that are just a bit unconventional. And if that\u0027s something that\u0027s a bit out of my comfort zone or I don\u0027t want to do, but I feel like I don\u0027t just want to do that for \u0026pound160 an hour, I can charge more. This can include taking graphic images of her, foot fetishes, purchasing her underwear or even asking to wear it themselves. I can charge an extra \u0026pound3,000 for these things if I want, otherwise it\u0027s not worth my time as it\u0027s not what I want to do. She works four or five days a week and will always do one night shift within those hours. But her hours and pay varies, especially when business is booming and she can easily pick up extra hours. The World Cup was crazy, or maybe just one week I\u0027ll have clients who tip a lot, she said.

Derek was fined \u0026pound1,500 and severely reprimanded by the Greyhound Board of Great Britain which ruled he gave the drugs deliberately to enhance Dinnington Lady’s performance. But Derek claims the hair cure must have got there by cross-contamination after he used it to treat a bald patch on another of his dogs.  And – showing a bandage on his knee – he claimed the painkiller may have accidentally mixed in with the dogs’ mince when he fed them after applying the gel for his own pain relief. Fighting back tears, he insisted: “I never gave her anything. She’s a great dog – they stitched me up just because I’m good at training dogs. I used the Regaine on one of my other dogs, Champ, to get the hair back on his legs. “It may have been passed over to Lady because they share a basket and are always close to each other. “The other stuff – the Voltarol – I put on my knee for joint pain. “I mix their raw mince with my hands every morning and I must have done it after putting the cream on.”  Greyhound bosses have cracked down on doping since a report showed owners were using class A drugs cocaine and amphetamine as well as prescription drugs to make dogs quicker. The sport is big business with punters betting around \u0026pound2.5billion a year on UK greyhound races. The Greyhound Board’s report on the race at Crayford, south east London, in February, said minoxidil “has a stimulating effect on the heart and can therefore affect a greyhound’s performance.”  It warned that the drug is known to have toxic effects on dogs. It said it “rejected Mr Ogden’s claim that the positive findings were due to inadvertent cross-contamination.” And it declared that “on the balance of probabilities, both substances were deliberately administered to influence performance.”  Even track boss Danny Rayment told investigators the dog “ran above expectation” despite it being her first race at a new stadium. Two months later Dinnington Lady won the Performance of the Month Award at Owlerton Stadium, Sheffield. Derek – who named the dog after his home village of Dinnington, Tyne and Wear, said he is so fed up he is quitting the sport. “I was really upset when they found me guilty and fined me,” he said. “It was a witch hunt. They didn’t accept anything. I’m not part of their clique. “There’s no way those things can make a dog run faster. It’s just daft. They’re not prescription drugs. “They fined me over \u0026pound2,000 which I’m paying at \u0026pound100 a month.

Carla Crozier and Selina Torbett both thought there would be no one to understand their daily struggle after each became pregnant by IVF – and got more than she bargained for. So when Selina spotted our story in the Sunday Mirror telling how Carla, 36, and builder husband Paul, 43, were expecting miracle quadruplets, she wasted no time in getting in touch. Carla already had daughter Darcie, now four, while Selina had three-year-old Myla. But after heartbreaking struggles to conceive, and long IVF journeys, both got pregnant again last year. And faced with the daunting prospect of raising four babies all at once, who better to turn to than someone going through the exact same experience?  Selina said: “When I saw your article about Carla, I’d just had a seven-week scan showing I was having quadruplets. “I was terrified and desperate to talk to someone else who had been in my position. “So I looked Carla up on Facebook and messaged her saying, ‘This might seem really weird, but I’m expecting quads too, can you help me?’.” And the bond the two women formed was instant. They started messaging each other every day – sharing tips and advice on coping with being \u0026shypregnant with four babies. Selina, 28, added: “When I was worried about something, I’d send Carla a message and she’d \u0026shyreassure me that was normal, it had been the same for her. “I don’t know what I would have done without her support.” Carla gave birth in March last year. At odds of 70 million-to-one, she had two pairs of twin girls – Isla, Demi, Alyse and Milla. Just four months later, Selina and her decorator partner Kev Ashe, 35, welcomed their four – identical triplets Roman, Arlo and Austin, and little Raeya, the only girl. With four babies and a toddler to look after, phoning each other became impossible for Carla and Selina.  But the two friends continued to message daily. Carla, from Grays, Essex, said: “There must be thousands of messages. “Messaging is easier because it’s impossible to find a time when we’re both free to talk. You rarely get a break. “I’ll be like, ‘They’re napping now, are you free?’ And Selina will say, ‘No, I’m just feeding them’. “And then later she’ll be free and I’ll be like, ‘No I’m feeding mine now’. “It’s been so nice to be able to have someone who actually understands what it’s like to have four babies. We haven’t known each other very long – but we have this really strong bond.” Selina, from Winchester, Hants, said: “I’ve been lucky because Carla has gone through everything first. I’ve been able to learn from her experiences. “In the beginning I wanted to know how she managed to feed all four babies at once. “Carla told me how she’d come up with the idea of rolling blankets to use as a bottle prop. “Then I was worried when mine weren’t sitting up at the right time, so I messaged Carla and she told me that it was fine, hers were the same. “We’ve been able to share tips on things like what high chairs and strollers to buy – although I normally come out best because Carla’s are a few months older, so she has gone before me.”  Carla added: “Yes, she can always make the better choice because I’m the one who has to trial everything out – her stroller is the better, lighter one, her van is the easier one to drive.” Selina, who recently returned to work as a nurse for one 15-hour shift a week, explained how vital the solidarity is. She said: “Because Carla’s the only one who truly understands what it’s like, I always turn to her when I want to vent. “In January I got asked to leave a cafe because they said my stroller was a fire hazard. “I was mortified. Everybody was looking at me and I felt like I’d done something wrong. “Other friends were like, ‘Well, why couldn’t you just leave the stroller outside?’ “But I messaged Carla and she understood. How can you leave a stroller outside and then carry in four babies?” This week the pair and their brood of 10 kids finally met for the first time to enjoy a day out at RHS Garden Wisley, near Woking in Surrey. Carla said: “It’s the first time we’ve met, but I feel I’ve known Selina for years. “It’s been just like meeting up with an old friend.” Little Darcie and Myla also quickly became the best of pals.

Alun Griffiths, 27, says he received a phone call from his partner in the UK shortly after touching down on the Spanish island.  My Mrs rang me saying \u0027where are you?\u0027, said Alun, who got a taxi to Magaluf after landing in Palma with friend Nigel Lewis. He added: And I said \u0027I\u0027m in Magaluf\u0027 and she said \u0027food\u0027s ready\u0027 and I said \u0027I\u0027m not joking, I won\u0027t be home for a few days\u0027. She wasn\u0027t best pleased.  Alun, from Merthyr Tydfil, Wales, had called in to the Gurnos Club on his way home from work on Tuesday, Wales Online reports.   He intended to simply have a few drinks with his friends - but he didn\u0027t end up getting home for another two days. He admitted he had woken up that day in a stupid mood. I was in work on Tuesday morning and I\u0027d woken up in a stupid mood when you just get a feeling you\u0027re going to do something stupid, he said. After work I went to the Gurnos Club and there was about 15 of us all talking about holidays. So I said \u0027anyone want to go on holiday now? Let\u0027s go up the airport and see where we can go anywhere in the world\u0027. Alun travelled to Cardiff Airport with Nigel, where they were told that they could book on to a flight that evening going to Palma. During the journey, they fell asleep - only to wake up in the Spanish resort.  After touching down in the city, they shared a taxi with some men outside the airport to nearby Magaluf. There\u0027s a Palma in Italy too so we didn\u0027t know if we were going to the one in Spain or Italy, Alun added. We fell asleep on the plane and woke up in Spain - thank God. With no hotel and no return flight home booked, the pair headed straight out until the early hours of the morning. They then continued to drink - but booked a hotel for that night. The first night we stopped drinking at 5.30am, Alun said.

False smiles and artificial passion dominated the punter\u0027s \u0026pound50 half-hour sessions inside the parlour previously exposed by Grimsby Live. The punter said parlour girls actively state we will do things your wife won\u0027t. He gave up after his marriage, but memories of fun in a parlour\u0027s bedrooms remain vivid. The man provides a unique perspective on Grimsby\u0027s sex industry and shared all about his visits to Top Notch Massage. He started using parlours in his 20s, and has been accompanied by mates, workplace colleagues, and even his dog in the years since. Now 40 and in charge of a major Grimsby firm, he likens paying for sex as just another business deal.  If they are good at their job, you don\u0027t last five minutes in there, he said. A working girl knows how to do it. All they want is to be done as quickly as possible. Candidly describing the nuts and bolts of the steamy encounters, he said: Some girls kiss, some don\u0027t. They kiss to their own discretion. If you\u0027re wearing a condom, it\u0027s ok. He added: They don\u0027t care about you and you don\u0027t care about them. It\u0027s a clinical exchange. They don\u0027t really want to be doing the job. And you\u0027re there because you\u0027ve had a few pints. The punter started visiting parlours in his twenties for a laugh.  And the parlour experience is one he still strongly recommends. He said: It\u0027s on blokes\u0027 bucket list, \u0027go see a parlour\u0027. He said: A lot of people won\u0027t admit to using them. There will be someone in your office using it. But they keep it secret. Our punter first encountered Top Notch\u0027s manager under the sheets of a Grimsby parlour three years ago when she was still a working girl. It is believed the woman, in her late 40s, moved away from the physical side of the industry to set up her own establishment on Garden Street two years ago. A Geordie, our punter said, she would act under the pretence that she managed a care home. The parlour visitor described the life-long working girl as outgoing and a shrewd operator who used her experience to build Top Notch into one of the region\u0027s busiest parlours. To be fair, the reason why Top Notch is dead busy is because it\u0027s probably one of the best ones, he said. She runs a very clean establishment.  Top Notch\u0027s website hosts a selection of women from all corners of the globe clutching whips and adopting a range of provocative positions. But the punter said most actually commute from the tropical reaches of Hull as part of an exchange of sex workers across the Humber. He said: The Grimsby lasses don\u0027t want to be seen working in Grimsby, so they go over to Hull and the Hull girls come here. He controversially described an odd and rum assortment of girls, ranging from the downright stunning to the ugly and haggard. There\u0027s some stunners, he said. Then there\u0027s the old thing. She\u0027s really scrapes the barrel. If you saw her you would think I\u0027m not paying \u0026pound50 for this. She\u0027s a mess. No disrespect. But the insider said Top Notch\u0027s glossy marketing conceal a world of struggles and addiction. He said very few girls genuinely enjoy the job: Some women are not cut out for it. They just can\u0027t do it. They usually last about two weeks. They try, but they can\u0027t manage. It takes a certain mentality to do it. You have to remember that the women who work in these types of places have got to have a certain outlook on life. To get into that line of work, you have got to have issues. He said: Imagine if you did that job, you really wouldn\u0027t want to do it would you? Put yourself in their position. What do you do if you get a smelly, old, fat 80-year-old through the door. You can\u0027t turn round and say no, can you?  He said he believed as many as half of Grimsby\u0027s parlour workers are dependent on drugs and are desperately vying to avoid being turfed out on to the streets, a harrowing life previously highlighted by Grimsby Live in a special feature on Grimsby\u0027s Red Light women. It\u0027s 50/50. Some of them are on drugs, some of them aren\u0027t. I have seen the needle marks, he said. And when the drugs take over, they end up working down Orwell Street. That\u0027s the next step. The owner won\u0027t employ them. She\u0027s not daft. She knows. They can get away with it for so long, but when they show the first signs they fall down to Orwell Street level.  But despite the harsh life of a working girl, the punter said he has never felt guilt. I don\u0027t care. It doesn\u0027t make me feel bad, he said. At the end of the day, it\u0027s serving a purpose. The Garden Street parlour supports a massively diverse client base - from high-flying businessmen to pensioners and those in the dole queue. A lot of business people do use it, he said. I know what they get up to at the weekend. You would never imagine they would do it. Then again, there\u0027s people on the dole who will treat themselves once a month.

Both clearly at ease with kids, the prospect of the newlyweds becoming parents in the near future has left royal fans extremely excited. But the wait could go on for a bit longer - because Meghan, 37, might be delaying getting pregnant for a very practical reason. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are due to embark on their first royal tour together this Autumn, including some long-haul trips.  They will visit Australia, Fiji, Tonga and New Zealand - with the trip coinciding with the 2018 Invictus Games in Sydney in October. Although the NHS says most women are able to travel safely while pregnant, morning sickness is very common in early pregnancy. It is typically at its worst during the first 12 weeks - with some women, including the Duchess of Cambridge, suffering from a severe form. During this period, mums-to-be can also suffer from extreme tiredness. These potential symptoms could prove difficult for Meghan if she was in the early stages of pregnancy during the highly-anticipated tour.  The risk of having a miscarriage is also higher in the first three months of pregnancy, regardless of whether you\u0027re travelling or not. And long-distance travel (more than four hours) carries a small risk of blood clots, or deep vein thrombosis, the NHS warns on its website.  According to The Sun, royals who are pregnant are advised to keep travelling abroad to a minimum for safety reasons.  Sarah Reynolds, a consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist at the Bedford Hospital NHS Trust, says: Travel during pregnancy is a concern for many women.  But if your pregnancy has no complications then there\u0027s no reason why you can\u0027t travel safely, as long as you take the right precautions. The royal tour will likely be packed with engagements, meaning Meghan may have decided to delay starting a family until after it\u0027s over. Prince William and wife Kate are also said to have waited to have a baby.  The couple were the first future monarchs in a staggering 200 years not to conceive in their first year of marriage, the  reports.  They did not announce they were expecting Prince George until 19 months after they tied the knot at Westminster Abbey in April 2011.  Royal author Gill Knappett said: “It is thought that William and Catherine, as newlyweds, may have delayed staring a family so that they could participate fully in the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee celebrations in 2012. “Part of William and Catherine’s commitment to the Queen in her Diamond Jubilee year involved the young couple touring Asia on behalf of Her Majesty in September 2012.” If Meghan and Harry, 33, do decide to start a family at some point in the future, there are some royal rules and protocol they\u0027ll have to follow.

The Duchess of Sussex reportedly wants time apart from dad Thomas after he gave a string of media interviews against Palace wishes. The pair have not spoken since Meghan wed Harry almost three months ago. Retired lighting engineer Thomas, 74, has bemoaned the state of his relationship with his daughter and made several public pleas for her to get in touch. But, despite crisis talks with royal officials, Meghan is not falling for her dad\u0027s \u0027crocodile tears\u0027 and is not ready to make contact. The Sun on Sunday quoted a source as saying: Meghan loves Thomas and does want to maintain a relationship with him in the long run. But at the moment she feels he needs a bit of space. She also wants to take a bit of time out. The source added that Meghan is hopeful that things will get better but it will take time. There is no quick fix. Meghan Markle\u0027s rise to royalty in pictures - from starry-eyed child to Duchess of Sussex  The friend told MailOnline : She said she just wishes her dad would \u0027stop blathering\u0027 to the press. That\u0027s the one birthday gift she wanted from her father.  According to the source close to the duchess: Meghan has no immediate plans to contact her father. Firstly, she\u0027s deeply hurt and secondly she can\u0027t trust him to keep their conversation private. The source added: She (Meghan) does not have a bad bone in her body, but she\u0027s not falling for her dad\u0027s crocodile tears. She\u0027s been down that road far too many times before. Thomas Markle recently said he feared he would never see any grandchildren that his daughter and Prince Harry might have.  Meghan has not spoken to her father for three months with Thomas unable to attend her wedding in May due to a heart problem which emerged days after it was revealed he had paid for staged paparazzi photos. Since then he has given several interviews with the press, revealing private conversations he had had with Prince Harry in a breach of royal protocol.  It had been thought Meghan would meet with her dad when she visits the United States later this year but nothing has been confirmed.  Meanwhile Meghan has also had to deal with her half-sister frequently badmouthing her in the media. Samantha Grant, who recently changed her surname to Markle, has given several interviews about the Duchess of Sussex since she married Prince Harry.

Olivia Golding, 24, would reportedly consume up to 15 balloons every weekend while her three-year-old son Parker visited his dad. She says the nitrous oxide (NOS) inside has left her with no feeling in most of her body after she contracted a Lichtheim\u0027s disease, also known as subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord. She is having to relearn how to walk and use her hands. Olivia first became aware of the problem last Friday, when she woke up unable to move and had to ask Parker to get her phone so she could call her help.  The car saleswoman from Bristol, told the Mail Online : About a month before I was doing a balloon and I got pins and needles in my neck and back. I started feeling numb in my body. But I never dreamt it was the balloons so I just carried on doing them. One day I was walking in the park with my son and taking him swimming, the next day I couldn\u0027t move. She was admitted to Bristol\u0027s Southmead Hospital, where tests revealed the top of her spinal cord was damaged. They asked me if I took NOS and I was like, \u0027Sure, I\u0027ve done a lot of them\u0027, she said. Olivia added: I cannot even put Parker\u0027s shoes on for him and it\u0027s the things like that [which] break my heart. My son wants me to play with him and I can\u0027t do that. I can\u0027t feel my legs, my whole body is twitching. Olivia has been using her recovery period to warn others about the dangers of NOS. Writing on Facebook, she said: I wanted to write this on social media to make awareness to all of my friends that also use balloons of what the balloon is actually doing to your body. If this just stops one person from doing them, I feel I would have succeeded in some way. I think we have all become almost expectant to the fact of seeing balloons being sold at festivals, on the streets and even in night clubs. Over the past month my body has slowly been becoming numb, deteriorating in front of me, getting to the point last week that I no longer could move my hands or even dress myself.  The nitrous oxide that is put into the balloon that we all crave for is actually starving your brain of oxygen and eating away at your nervous system - after having brain scans and MRI along with fluid taken from my spine I’ve now been diagnosed with my nervous system as damaged, I have no feeling in my body from my calves to my shoulders and cannot use my hands. The doctors are now going to focus on trying to reverse this but I wanted to make everyone aware that the 20 second high off that one balloon could cause you weeks in hospital teaching yourself to walk properly again. Please think of the consequences and raise awareness of nitrous oxide. In another post, she described how she is unable to move without assistance and is having to use a wheelchair to get around the hospital. My treatment has begun so now it’s a waiting game of the reversibility and the praying that it’s reversible, she added. The doctors have asked me to get the message out there about nitrous oxide and what they are doing to peoples bodies. I understand most people will look at this post and think ‘it won’t happen to me’ but I thought that when I was sat with my friends and going to festivals until I woke up last week unable to move. It’s really not worth it, so anyone, especially my friends, I’m begging you to stop as you do not want the feeling (or no feeling shall I say) of what me and my family are going through. Lichtheim\u0027s disease is thought to start when nitrous oxide starves the body of the vitamin B12 by stopping it being properly absorbed. The lack of vitamin B12 damages the fatty sheath protecting nerve fibres in the spinal cord which control movement and sensation. The condition is treated with vitamin B12 injections – which Olivia is receiving – and most people recover completely if this happens within a few weeks of symptoms starting. However, if treatment is delayed they may not recover from the movement problems caused by the irreversible damage to their nervous system. After a week in hospital, Olivia has managed to take 12 steps with help of physiotherapists. She is expected to spend a significant time in hospital with long term rehabilitation. It is illegal to supply or import NOS for human consumption, but the small silver canisters are still available in shops as they are legally used for whipping cream and as an anaesthetic.

Caroline Hirons 49, from London, weighed into the discussion during World Breastfeeding Week about whether breastfeeding is best for children or mums could just use formula, the Manchester Evening News reported. The beauty blogger raged on Twitter : I can’t believe it’s 2018 and we’re still discussing breast vs formula like it matters at the end of the day. Just feed your kid and get on with your day. They all grow up to eat Haribo and McDonalds anyway. Yes, even your kid, kale-blending Cynthia in the pilates pants.  Her tweet provoked a torrent of messages on social media from other mums and has been liked more than 27,000 times. Although many supported her view, others branded the blogger clueless for ignoring mums with babies in poorer countries. Nadia Cruickshank complained: Clueless statement by a privileged person living in a rich country. WBW is not about you. What about the mothers living in countries with no access to clean water \u0026amp cant sterilise bottles? What about the mothers who cant afford formula? Breast the safest for their babies \u0026amp FREE.   She added: You completely miss the message of ‘World Breastfeeding Week’. I suggest you check out the website and educate yourself. Formula is a privilege. But Ms Hirons defended her tweet, writing: I’m hardly ‘clueless’ about BF thanks. I’ve done it four times. And I’m clearly talking about women in the westernised world being made to feel guilty by forums because they are struggling with it. Nestle pushing formula into poorer countries is another matter altogether.   Caroline Basden also lashed out, writing: I can\u0027t believe it\u0027s 2018 and we\u0027re still judging other mums like this - mocking people\u0027s food tastes, clothing and names. Facts: There is a proven benefit to breastfeeding. It doesn\u0027t always work out. Those who want it should be enabled to seek support.   And @subo118 said: How disappointing. The benefits of breast milk for both mother and baby are too great to trivialise and dismiss like this. There are other ways to be supportive and inclusive. But other mums backed up Ms Hirons, saying pressure was poured on mums by society to breastfeed even when they couldn\u0027t do so. Twitter user @mrsmcgibble said: Yes this!! When I had my son 2010 I tried to breastfeed. I tried and tried and tried.   We just couldn\u0027t do it. I made the decision to change to formula. That level of guilt was unreal, then for my midwife to turn to me and say by giving up you are failing your son. Broke me. And @LoubyLou49 said she\u0027d done both with her twins - and could not see any difference in their health or development. She said: I had twins. One could breastfeed the other couldn’t. They’ve both grown up and are wonderful and utterly annoying in equal measure.  Mums told the Manchester Evening News how Ms Hirons\u0027 words had really resonated. Chantelle Kendrick, from Hyde, mum to three-year-old Max, said: The pressure to breastfeed was a contributing factor to my post natal depression, I spent 10 days struggling before giving up and felt like a huge failure. Even though my son\u0027s friends were all fed differently and I can see no difference in the kids, I still feel less of a person because I bottle fed. All the debate talk just resurfaces all those feelings and there’s too much emphasis on mums who breastfeed being \u0027super\u0027 mums - they seem to get a bigger pat on the back than bottle mums from my experience. It shouldn’t matter but there is a divide.  And Leanne Kirk, also from Hyde, added: Definitely boring now. Like you say some mums aren’t able to breast feed because of one reason or another so why make them feel bad?! Plus surely formula can’t be that bad for babies as they wouldn’t make it if it was! Do whatever is best for you. I tried at the beginning with my daughter and did it for about five weeks, it was horrific if I’m honest! Purely because she wasn’t getting enough and that was stressing her and me out so I stopped. I’m going to try again when my baby is born but if it doesn’t work then I’m not going to stress myself out about it. If it works, then great.

But after about a year things came to an end, and the newly-single heir to the throne was told to go out and find an appropriate future princess. Pressure was building on him to settle down, so he began a decade of dating in a bid to find someone his family, and the public, would approve of. It wasn\u0027t easy, and it\u0027s believed he dated more than 20 women before he finally found Diana Spencer. There were a host of interesting characters along the way, including Diana\u0027s older sister Lady Sarah Spencer.  Not much is known about their brief relationship in 1977, but it\u0027s understood it all ended after she did an interview with the Mirror\u0027s James Whittaker . James met Lady Sarah when she joined Prince Charles for a holiday in the Swiss ski resort Klosters. Recalling the event in 2011, James wrote: My mission improbable as a young journalist was to discover who Charles would marry and be first with the news. So when Sarah introduced me to Diana I should have taken more notice of the shy, gangly-16-year old. Sarah by contrast was a lively, lovely redhead and I was captivated.  Putting obvious obstacles aside – like she was totally out of my league and stepping out with the most eligible bachelor in the land – I chanced my arm. James suggested the pair meet for lunch when they got back to London, and she accepted. He said: Unfortunately another reporter overheard our exchange and also invited himself along, which added gooseberry to the menu. Sarah was disarmingly frank about her boyfriend and declared she would not marry Charles if he were the dustman or the King of England.  That was good news from where I was sitting and Sarah seemed delighted I was so keen to share it with the nation. But when Charles found out, he wasn\u0027t happy. He reportedly told said to Sarah: You have just done something incredibly stupid.  Despite the slightly awkward history, Sarah was said to completely approve of Charles and Diana\u0027s relationship.

Luckily, the RSPCA swooped in to show the \u0026shykindness humans are also capable of. And it is one of many remarkable rescues featured in a new documentary.  For the first time, cameras were given access all areas to three of the charity’s wildlife centres to see their incredible work. They followed the \u0026shytraumatised Canada goose to Stapeley Grange hospital in Cheshire, where it was down to vet Bev Panto to gently remove the arrow from its neck and save its life.

Saving him was no easy feat as rescuers had to avoid being gouged by his sharp antlers as they tried to free him from the tight spot. They eventually called in Derby Fire and Rescue to help lift him out. RSPCA welfare officer Steve Wickham said he “nursed a fair few cuts and bruises” after freeing the \u0026shydeer.

The schoolgirl today thanks our loyal readers for saving her when all hope seemed gone. Abi, 15, would have died if you had not got behind the fight to secure her the life-saving wonder drug being denied her by the NHS. Without the miracle medicine Abi’s one-in-a-million kidney \u0026shydisease would have made her body reject a donor organ and she was not expected to reach her 18th birthday. But remarkably she is now \u0026shyrecovering well after surgery at Leeds General Infirmary. From her hospital bed, Abi last night said: “I’ll never forget how precious this gift is.”  Abi got the call a donor match had been found when she was watching the British Transplant Games in Birmingham last week. Her family raced to Leeds General Infirmary where surgeons were waiting to perform life-saving surgery. Abi said: “I couldn’t believe it when we got the call after all this time. I was apprehensive but also relieved as I had waited so long. “I’m now watching Disney films and even managed to eat macaroni cheese and chocolate. “I want to say a big thank you to every single Sunday People reader who has supported me and my \u0026shyfamily over the past three years. “There are also over 500 \u0026shyincredible people who stepped forward willing to donate their kidney even though they have never met me. Thank you. Every single person gave me hope.  “I’m now looking forward to having a normal life.” Abi added: “To have received the call at the transplant games was really special. “I was surrounded by so many who have also been transplanted, but also living donors and those who so kindly donated their loved ones’ organs to allow others to live. “I’m so very grateful.” We first took up Abi’s case in May 2015 when her mum Jo and dad Andy, of Wakefield, West Yorks, were told a drug she needed was too expensive to \u0026shyprovide on the NHS. Her extremely rare condition DDD – dense \u0026shydeposit disease – was not common enough to be covered by NHS England’s drug-funding policy. But it was also not unusual enough to unlock cash set aside for exceptional cases. Without the \u0026pound137,000 a year treatment there was a high chance a transplant would fail because the auto-immune disease would attack her kidneys.  Sunday People readers were so moved by Abi’s plight that a staggering 200,000 petitioned the Government. X Factor supremo Simon Cowell and Queen guitarist Brian May threw their weight \u0026shybehind the campaign. And public law \u0026shyspecialist Yogi Amin, of Irwin Mitchell, prepared a High Court legal action after offering his services for free. Finally the NHS relented and agreed to fund the drug. The victory means that other \u0026shychildren in the same predicament as Abi will also now be given the \u0026pound137,000-a-year medicine. But then Abi had to find a donor. Her mother Jo, 47, was discovered to be a perfect match but could not \u0026shyundergo surgery because of a \u0026shymedical problem. Her father Andy, 49, was heartbroken after doctors said he wasn’t suitable for surgery either. Stuck on dialysis for 12 hours a day, Abi’s condition started to \u0026shydeteriorate and at Christmas her bones started leaking calcium \u0026shybecause of an excess in her failing kidneys.

Scope used “charity mugging” staff from LPS Promotions – run by businessman Roy Haydon – to stop people in the street and get them to sign up for direct debit charity donations. But Haydon also ran Elkador Finance which was fined \u0026pound315,000 for failing to prove people’s data was collected legally. Elkador went bust in March with \u0026pound330,271 debts and the fine – reduced to \u0026pound143,640 on appeal – is still unpaid. The two companies even share the same address. Last night the Charity Commission said it would investigate our discovery.  The deal was uncovered after a Sunday Mirror reader was stopped in the street by two chuggers for Scope. He checked their ID and discovered they actually worked for LPS. The source said: “I am a supporter of most charities. But I like to check that they’re real fundraisers. I was horrified and felt annoyed that they had tried to coerce me into giving money to them.  “I understand charities need to raise money. But it’s concerning to see that people like this can work in the charity sector speaking to the elderly and potentially vulnerable people. “I will not be donating to Scope while they are using marketing companies such as this to generate income.” Disability charity Scope’s latest accounts show it took almost \u0026pound16million in donations overall. Chief executive Mark Atkinson is paid \u0026pound129,000 a year – just \u0026pound21,000 less than the Prime Minister. Scope spokesman Philip Talbot said a fundraising firm it used had sub-contracted work to LPS without permission.  He said: “Like many other charities we use agencies to raise vital funds. “One of the organisations we use is Ultimate Marketing Services. We are bitterly disappointed that without our knowledge UMS hired LPS to fundraise on our behalf for just three weeks in July. “UMS should have obtained prior written permission from us to use any other agency. “LPS are no longer raising funds for Scope and will not do so in the future.

High street giants, who promised to cut packaging, have been shamed online by angry customers, while campaigners said the behaviour was “bonkers”. Shoppers say they are fed up of items turning up wrapped in plastic despite ticking the “no plastic bags” option. In many cases, the carriers contain just one item, such as a bag of crisps or carton of milk. Some are even placed in their own smaller bags so they don’t contaminate other food. The use of \u0026shythrowaway plastic by our biggest \u0026shysupermarkets has fallen by 86 per cent since the 5p carrier charge was \u0026shyintroduced in 2015.

But could you please stop giving me so much plastic? I pick loose fruit and veg on purpose to avoid too much plastic. “Could I just opt out of plastic bags?” One wrote on Twitter: “Tesco please, please stop sending our online shop out in plastic bags.

Seth Welch and his wife Tatiana Fusari, both 27, were both charged on Monday after their 10-month-old daughter Mary was found dead in her crib in Solon Township, Michigan, last week. An autopsy found she died of malnutrition and dehydration - and the couple are accused of failing to seek medical help despite knowing their baby was sick. But Welch maintains his innocence, insisting that there were no signs to suggest how unwell Mary was - and that she was a skinny girl.  In an interview from prison with news channel Wood-TV, Welch repeated claims that he cared for his children without the help of doctors because of his religious beliefs and said he was being persecuted for his faith. I believe I am being unfairly charged, being made an example of for my very strong faith, he said. Going to the doctor\u0027s office these days is just about as dangerous as not going. Welch also maintained his innocence, insisting that there were no signs to suggest how unwell Mary was and that she was a skinny girl. He said: This was a tragedy. This was not a crime. There was no ill will involved. There was truly no neglect involved. In the Bible, it says that good food is our medicine. We fed her. We were feeding her chicken, potatoes, apples, cheese. We were giving her the good stuff. She died. It\u0027s a tragedy… The Lord giveth, the Lord taketh. We did the best we could for Mary according to our faith.  Welch added: I don\u0027t fear the judgement of man because God knows how much I love that child. God knows the moments we shared together. An affidavit signed ahead of their court appearance last week said both parents had admitted they were aware of Mary Welch\u0027s skinny appearance and low weight for at least one month before she died. It added: Tatiana Fusari admitted during the interview that they failed to reach out for medical help with their daughter for fear of having her children removed by Child Protective Services, lack of faith and trust in the medical services and religious reasons. Welch insisted that Mary was found with a dirty nappy, showing clearly that she had received nourishment. Family court documents obtained by 24 Hour News 8 say there were dirty nappies in the bin in Mary\u0027s room, and that her mattress was wet and soiled and had a rip in it. According to the documents, Fusari returned home from work to discover her baby had died at around 10a.m on August 2. She said the last time her daughter had eaten was 2.30pm the previous day. Welch had been tending to Mary while his wife was away, and told investigators that Mary had gone to sleep at 2.30pm on August 1 and did not wake up. He said he checked on her by looking through a hole in the door but didn\u0027t go into her room because he didn\u0027t want to wake her. The documents say that after Fusari discovered Mary was dead, Welch waited an hour before calling police.

return to the defence if he’s recovered from the swollen knee that forced him to sit out the Pars clash and the recent Betfred Cup trip to Elgin.And if he’s come through training this week without any

Initially thought to be those of a notorious clan chief nicknamed the Old Fox, they were discovered to be those of a young woman plus four others.Previously, the mausoleum and burial ground drew in a few hundred people each year but last year numbers were between 2000 and 2500 - although it could be higher as not all visitors are recorded.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWhile the burial ground is owned by Highland Council, the 17th century building is owned by the voluntary-run Wardlaw Mausoleum Trust which faces a constant challenge regarding its maintenance.Trust member Erik Lundberg said it was a technically-challenging task to carry out appropriate upkeep and repairs to the building given its age and construction.There was a problem with persistent moisture, for example, caused by an adjoining burial area having a higher ground level than the mausoleum.\"The trust was set up in the early 1990s to take over the ownership and eventual restoration of the mausoleum and that was done in 1998,\" Mt Lundberg said.\"The only income the trust gets is from donations from visitors. When you don\u0026rsquot get as many visitors as you would like especially up until recent years, you don\u0026rsquot really have the funds to maintain the building as you would like.\"He explained that the building should undergo lime rendering to the outside and lime plastering to the inside plus coats of lime wash about every five years. But it is now 20 years since such work was carried out.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\"There should be a rolling programme of things to keep a building in good order especially if it is historical,\" he said.\"But with a lack of funds we have only been able to do simple things.

But there’s a lot of work that goes under the radar, like working off the ball and holding up play and things that are vital for the team.“It’s the final piece, whether it’s an assist or a goal, that does get noticed and I’m just trying as hard as I can to do it all. I’m hoping the goals will come and once I get the first one, I’m hoping I can get more.”Cosgrove is also looking forward to savouring the moment of netting his first competitive goal for the Dons. He added: “It will be massive for me because it’s my job to score. Part of it will feel normal, but getting your first goal for a club is always special.”Ahead of today’s game against Dundee, Cosgrove says the Dons have a point to prove after what he feels was a below-par performance in the 1-1 draw with 10-man Rangers on Sunday.He said: “We’re disappointed with the performance on Sunday. But we’ve come away with a point and it does feel like a good point given the circumstances. Last week was the weeks we want to be playing in. We had a tough game down at Turf Moor against Burnley and then there was no better game than Rangers to come back to at Pittodrie.“As tough as it was, we were massively looking forward to it and they are the games we want to be playing week in and week out.“Now, though, the main focus is on Dundee and we’re looking forward to getting going again because we’ve got a point to prove, performance-wise.“We’ve had a good week’s training, we’re feeling and looking sharp so hopefully we can take that into the game. There’s been excuses about tiredness on Sunday but, as a team and a club, the performance wasn’t up to standard at all.“The Rangers game was massively disappointing but the belief is still there within the squad that there’s a lot more to come. Everyone has blips but we’ll bounce back and get the performances we need.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/08/SKIPPY-SKATEBOARD-940x362.jpg ","title":"win skippy peanut butter skateboard with helmet and pads","story":"\t\t\t\t\tOne lucky winner will get their hands on one of these cool, branded skateboards with a safety helmet and pads thrown in PLUS two jars of SKIPPY® Peanut Butter and a branded silicone spatula with the whole prize worth £200.Five runners-up can win two jars of SKIPPY® Peanut Butter plus a branded silicone spatula.All you need to do to be in with a chance of winning is fill in this form below.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"aberdeens techfest celebrates 25th anniversary","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA science and technology festival which has inspired hundreds of thousands of youngsters for 25 years is poised to return to Aberdeen.TechFest aims to promote science, technology, engineering and maths (Stem) subjects.Along with interactive workshops, shows and presentations, people will get a chance to hear from former Olympic curler Jackie Lockhart.She will share stories from her career alongside manager of Curl Aberdeen and fellow champion curler Tom Brewster, who will provide technical insight into how the maintenance of ice can affect the outcome of a match.As part of its milestone year, in addition to a range of science topics on offer, there will also be a variety of events exploring the history and uses of silver.National Museums Scotland will also present key objects from its touring exhibition, with Behind The Scenes of Scotland’s Early Silver: From Conservation to Display on September 12.Sarah Chew, managing director of TechFest, said: “This is a really exciting year for TechFest as we celebrate 25 years of the festival and we are pleased to unveil such a diverse and fun-filled programme for our anniversary.“Over the years you can imagine how the event has changed.“If you look at the programme in 2001, we were following the possibility of water on Mars pretty closely.“And in that area, there has been massive discoveries and now we see in 2018 that life on Mars is much closer than we realised at the time.“There’s the story of a woman who is now a nursery manager and used to come to TechFest as a kid – and now she’s one of our presenters who helps us to be on the cutting edge.”Sarah added: “Once again we have some of the brightest minds and biggest personalities in the Stem sphere presenting, as well as musicians and sporting personalities who can demonstrate how Stem plays a role in their disciplines too.“A lot has changed since we first launched as a charity in 1995.“However, our ethos of inspiring, educating and entertaining people of all ages has remained the same and we can’t wait to welcome everyone.

These included a small play area, a communal seating area and raised beds in which vegetables could be grown.The Seaton Backies committee, Aberdeen City Council communities team and other partners met after the most recent consultation event in May, and it was decided that a play park would be reintroduced.Plans are now being tendered for installing the equipment.Councillor Ross Grant, who represents the Tillydrone, Seaton and Old Aberdeen ward, said: “This step is a significant one for the project and for the community as a whole. It’s a great step forward.“Before the Seaton Backies project began, it was a very unwelcoming space for people who wanted to use it.“The project is a great example of community vision and of a quality partnership between the administration and its constituents.”The Seaton Backies project was started by a group of mums, who wanted to make a difference in their neighbourhood and to ignite community spirit, while ensuring their children could have a safe place to play.The communal plot of land lay in the shadow of Seaton’s high-rise flats and was not viewed as a welcoming environment for use by families.Since launching, the committee has already had several spaces revamped and turned into new play areas.As well as the park, there are two new large spaces across two sites at the Backies that require further development.Councillors unanimously agreed to demolish more wash houses last year, which was expected to cost around £102,000.The Seaton communities team has appealed for as many residents as possible to take part in the scheme so they can get a more complete picture of what people would like.Anyone who wants to get involved, or would like to help make a difference in the Seaton area, is asked to contact Graham Donald, community development worker at Aberdeen City Council, on 01224 277928.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"city road to close","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA city road is to close for four days for resurfacing work to be carried out.Eday Road in Aberdeen will be shut between its junction with Rousay Drive to 10 miles east of its junction with Eday Walk, and from this point to the boundary between numbers 82 and 84 on the street from 6.30pm on August 27 until 10pm on August 31.The closures will be in place to protect public safety during carriageway resurfacing works.Access to properties will be maintained but no through traffic will be allowed to travel down the road.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"closures of roads for show","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA series of road closures will take place in a north-east town this weekend.Tarland Show, held annually in the Deeside village near Aboyne, will require a number of routes to be closed.Activities at this year’s event include a mountain bike race and truck show, with vintage and modern tractors competing.There is also afternoon entertainment on offer for all ages.

He said: “Investigations into the cause of recent offensive odours in Torry and the wider area are ongoing.“We are working with Aberdeen City Council to understand the source of the odours. SEPA is responsible for environmental compliance within SEPA-regulated sites.“Local SEPA officers will continue to work closely with all partner organisations to ensure odours are investigated and any impact on the local community is minimised.”The smell was reported to have been affecting businesses on Victoria Road, including popular pub Grampian Bar.Kim Main, manager of the bar, said: “I don’t believe that it’s the River Dee because the smell is only in Torry.

I am still receiving many justifiable complaints about the terrible condition of Mansefield Road in Port Ellen and the hospital road in Bowmore. With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains.

A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 27","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 11/07/18, 6:12 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe pages of the July 6 edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser contain too many stories of sadness and pain.

As ever, I will looking into every issue brought to my attention by local residents across my council ward.After travelling back to Islay I checked up on the state of road repairs across the island. Some progress has been made in many areas like the Hospital Road in Bowmore and Mansefield Road in Port Ellen. The potholes in Port Askaig that I had been telling our roads department about have been filled in.After calling and emailing around about the large and dangerous potholes at An Creagan Place in Port Charlotte, I have been informed that the road in this area is not the responsibility of Argyll and Bute Council. It belongs to ACHA, and since obtaining this information I spoke in person to the very helpful and hard-working staff at the Bowmore ACHA office and asked them to fill in these potholes.Aside from road concerns on Islay, quite a number of my fellow Ileachs have mentioned lack of bed spaces in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital. Being an island community obviously means that transferring more and more patients to the mainland is hardly ideal.The consensus from my constituents who I have been in contact with is that the number of beds in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital is not enough.

The Tories’ policy is set to cost around £4 million – yet boosting the wages of those receiving less than the real living wage would cost, at most, under £400,000.This smacks of utter hypocrisy from the Tories, after their comments of recent days regarding pay for forces personnel.What the Tories are choosing to overlook is the immense benefits service personnel have living in Scotland, like free prescriptions and university tuition fees for their children.  And it’s only those earning above £33k who pay a fraction more.If they are so concerned with equality – why aren’t they ensuring that all MoD staff are paid the living wage?Boosting the incomes of the lowest paid MoD staff could cost the Tories less than a tenth of what they are spending to top up higher incomes – yet once again, for people on lower incomes they are not prepared to lift a finger.The Tories’ double standards know no bounds – it’s one rule for the elite and another for the rest.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"inveraray golf club hold gents open","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 31/07/18, 5:52 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe 2018 Gents Open was held on Saturday July 28.Despite the heavy overnight rain the course held up well and was in great condition for the players.The competition was well contested in both the scratch and net categories.The net competition was won by Neil Armour with an impressive 71.

In the Bible for example: ‘I will…make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.’ But despite estimates that Earth contains roughly seven quintillion, 500 quadrillion grains of sand, world stocks are running dangerously low.Chemically, sand is mostly silicon dioxide, and is non-renewable.  It is essential for manufacturing bricks, plaster, glass, microchips, and above all concrete the most popular and versatile modern building material.  Concrete accounts for 75 per cent of our demand for sand with around 20 billion tons produced globally each year.  Even so, surely there’s an almost infinite sand supply from deserts.Unfortunately not.  Sand grains come in different shapes and sizes, and while desert sand has small, smooth grains, concrete requires large, coarse-grained sand.  This is generally mined from rivers, beaches and the sea bed.  And because international control of sand mining is well-nigh impossible, sand piracy is rife, causing huge ecological damage.Recently, 24 Indonesian islands were mined to extinction, with most of the sand used for land reclamation in Singapore, the world’s largest sand importer.Our dependence on concrete is not just for new builds.  Concrete’s life expectancy is just 50-60 years, after which so-called ‘concrete creep’ allows water seepage that corrodes supporting metal structures. So more concrete is required to repair or replace old buildings.Now engineers are coming up with ingenious ideas for repairing cracked concrete, including using bacteria and fungi that produce calcium carbonate.This could heal micro-cracks but the process will be years in development, while right now the US spend around $79 billion annually on bridge and highway maintenance and there are an estimated 188 million daily trips across ‘at risk’ bridges.Many UK bridges are similarly at risk, so do we have a solution? The short answer is ‘no’, but right now the race is on to find new, more durable building materials to replace the need for sand and in so-doing preserve marine ecosystems.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures 4","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/08/18, 11:35 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowReader Fiona McCuish provides this week\u0026#8217s photograph, which features the Crinan Basin in colourful glory despite driecht overcast weather.

Fraser Watt gave them the lead on 17 minutes and Lewis Montgomery added a second on 33 minutes.A second from Fraser Watt five minutes later made it 3-0 at the break.James Cameron pulled a goal back for Inverness on 54 minutes but most of the pressure was around the Inverness goal. Inveraray had plenty shots but didn’t hit the target as often as they would have liked.They did get a fourth goal though when Allan MacDonald scored on 64 minutes.Bute 5 Kilmory 0Bute stay in the title race after they beat Kilmory 5-0 on the island.Bute attacked from the start and a combination of dogged Kilmory defending and wastefulness in front of goal meant the hosts only had a good Steven Dunn finish on 30 minutes to show for their first half efforts.When referee Des McNulty pointed to the penalty spot on 54 minutes, Iain McDonald stepped up to slam the ball home.Robert Walker scored on 63 and 85 minutes, either side of a 70th minute Craig MacKay goal, to complete the 5-0 victory.Aberdour 0 Inveraray 1Inveraray\u0026#8217s second team moved off the bottom of the table after a \u0026#8216smash and grab\u0026#8217 job on fourth-placed Aberdour.The Royal Burgh side travelled with only 12 players. Despite having a hand injury, 16-year-old Gregor Mather returned between the sticks after missing the previous week’s defeat to Col Glen and he would go on to turn in a man-of-the-match performance. Coll Mackay and Calum MacDonald, both aged 15, started up front.Aberdour started the brighter, creating many chances, but a combination of wasteful shooting and superb goalkeeping prevented Lisa MacColl’s side taking the lead.Inveraray’s centre line grabbed a hold of the game towards the end of the first half, with wingers Campbell Watt and Steven Cameron adapting well to their unaccustomed roles.Aberdour dominated large chunks of the second half but struggled to break down the visitors.Inveraray, though, have Gregor Mather to thank for some heroic saves to keep the scoreline blank.Aberdour goalkeeper Tom Bowerman had a quiet afternoon until 89 minutes when he picked the ball out of the net. Young Calum MacDonald, the smallest player on the park, ran through several challenges to push the ball into the back of the net and give Inveraray the lead.There wasn’t much time for referee David Mitchell to add and his final whistle signalled an Inveraray victory.Photo: Stephen Lawson\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters week 31","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 03/08/18, 11:38 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,On behalf of local walkers I would like to thank the Forestry Commission for mowing the path between the Mealdarroch water tank track and The Kintyre Way.It is a beautiful forest walk and one of the least muddy in the area during the wet weather.Ann Thomas, TarbertThanks to the separatist\u0026#8217s tax hikes, Scotland has seen a 12 per cent rise in personal insolvencies.There were 3,208 bankruptcies and protected trust deeds from April to June this year, up from 2,869 in the same period last year.More and more Scots are struggling with debt yet the SNP has chosen to hammer families with higher income taxes.While taxes continue to rise in Scotland the revenue generated is being wasted \u0026#8211 a recent bullying claim probe into a police chief has wasted almost £100,000 of public money. The Scottish Police Authority disclosed the money spent on lawyers during the probe.Taxpayers have footed the legal fees of investigating the claims against former police chief Phil Gormley, who quit earlier this year amid multiple bullying allegations.The public was angry enough at how this case has been handled by the SNP Government and SPA, so it is even more frustrating to find out that tens of thousands were wasted on this fruitless task.It seems that the separatist\u0026#8217s wastefulness and incompetence which we have seen so much of in their mishandling of our economy also extends to their mismanagement of Police Scotland matters.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,With the Edinburgh Festivals about to start, can I remind your readers to helpfully inform visitors to our city that, unlike the made-up and damaging \u0026#8216tradition\u0026#8217 of rubbing Greyfriars Bobby\u0026#8217s nose, it is a genuine Edinburgh tradition to pause for a moment in the Royal Mile beside St Giles to lick the Heart of Midlothian.John Hein, EdinburghSir,I am writing to invite your readers to join me in hosting a World Tea Party this summer in support of working animal charity SPANA.Holding a Moroccan, Indian, British, Kenyan, or another world-themed party, is the perfect way to get together with friends and try out exciting and exotic new recipes, while also raising vital funds to help the world’s most hardworking animals.In many developing countries, working animals transport food, water, goods and people, and make it possible for millions of the poorest families to earn a small income. However, they often endure short, painful lives without the most basic requirements.This is where SPANA makes such a huge difference, ensuring animals have access to the free veterinary treatment they urgently need when they are sick or injured.Actors Dame Judi Dench and Joanna Lumley are throwing their support behind this year’s event, and we hope your readers will be inspired to take part and help transform the lives of working animals around the world.The SPANA World Tea Party fundraising pack, full of free recipes, is available from www.spana.org/teaparty or by calling 020 7831 3999.SPANA World Tea Party Host, Tom HorsfieldSir,It only takes one person to put a stop to the accidental loss of life to drowning.With recent headlines being filled with tragic stories of people losing their lives to drowning, Lesley Laird, Shadow Scottish Secretary and the Royal Life Saving Society UK (RLSS UK) urge the public to be that \u0026#8216one person\u0026#8217: take some simple precautions and get \u0026#8216water smart\u0026#8217, before cooling off this summer.For more information on the issue, the statistics involved and interview opportunities, please contact Claire Huggins on 0300 323 0096 or email clairehuggins@rlss.org.ukSenior Communications Executive, Claire HugginsSir,There are more people using Instagram for interiors inspiration than ever before, but 70 percent of Scottish Instagram users feel dissatisfied with their homes after looking at images of other people’s houses on social media, a study has found.Researchers who polled 1,500 UK adults using social media for inspiration with their homes, found that a whopping 66 percent of those are displeased with their home. They admit to feeling this way once a month or more after scrolling through other properties on Instagram, with 25-34-year-olds feeling dissatisfied most frequently.The findings describe people having an unrealistic idea of what their home should look like, spending time worrying about flaws which would be unnoticeable to others, whilst feeling pressure to maintain a certain appearance in their home and being self-conscious of it in front of visitors. This mindset has been described by Chartered Psychologist, Dr David Lewis, as ‘Home Dysmorphic Disorder’ (HDD).energypr representative, Beth ReynoldsSir,Researchers at the University of St Andrews have shown for the first time that some of the standard measures of memory in rodents and humans are likely based on the same cognitive process which could have implications for development of treatments for memory disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease.One of the most widely used memory tests for rodents is the novel object recognition test, in which animals explore two objects one of which is new and the other they have seen before.The results of new research showed that their participants object recognition scores were far more associated with their memory abilities than their preferences for newness.One of the research team, Dr James Ainge, of the School of Psychology and Neuroscience at St Andrews said: \u0026#8216This is important as it provides some of the first evidence that the standard memory tests in humans and rats are testing the same cognitive process. If we want to find a treatment or cure for disorders of memory like Alzheimer’s disease then we need to have a test of memory in animals that is analogous to human memory tests.\u0026#8217Steve Bargeton, St Andrews\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"soccer centre scores with support from ardrishaig community trust","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 04/08/18, 5:52 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowIn a fantastic boost for youth football in Mid Argyll, the Ardrishaig Community Trust and Lochgilphead Soccer Centre have jointly announce that Ardrishaig Community Trust will be the main sponsor of Lochgilphead Soccer Centre for the next three years.The funding package, worth £5,000 for each of the next three years, will make a huge contribution to the centre’s ambitious development plans – it already has more than 120 members, including around 40 from Ardrishaig.The development plan will see the Soccer Centre invest in new equipment, quality coaching to help the youngsters develop their football skills, participation in football festivals, and attend Scotland games, among other things.The funding will meet the cost of around 100 new football strips, all branded with Ardrishaig Community Trust, and will help ensure all Lochgilphead Red Star YFC teams are kitted out the same, from primary one to sevens (including the girls’ teams).The cost of kit to keep the coaches – who contribute the equivalent of around £15,000 a year in time – warm and dry throughout the year, will be part funded by the sponsorship. The coach kit will also bear Ardrishaig Community Trust’s logo.The funding will also see more than £2,000 per annum set aside to allow teams to take part in football festivals throughout Argyll and further afield, and also to pay for festivals to be held locally.This will allow local youngsters to benefit from the experience of playing in festivals against a wide range of teams from all over Scotland, and help to tackle remoteness and exclusion.As part of the funding agreement, the Soccer Centre will display a banner recognising the role of Ardrishaig Community Trust as its main sponsor.The player of the year award for each age group at the annual awards evening will be dedicated to the Ardrishaig Community Trust.And, finally, the Soccer Centre will look to encourage, support and participate in the work of Ardrishaig Community Trust.

Wages were 45p/hour and the telephone bill was £32.\u0026#8217Mrs Coats reflected on those early days: \u0026#8216I  could type, so I was asked to be the association secretary,\u0026#8217 she recalled modestly.The truth is, though, that her passion held Earra Gael together for decades with the help of many different volunteers in the shop.She continued: \u0026#8216Earra Gael is really a community. We have always had a good team. It was a lot of hard work, but very enjoyable.\u0026#8217One of the tasks shop staff were required to perform was to operate the weighbridge \u0026#8211 and this continued until 1987.There was more to running the association that selling pottery and weighing lorries, as Mrs Coats\u0026#8217 daughter Amanda remembers. \u0026#8216There was very little storage in the shop, so mum stored the stock at home.\u0026#8216Mum travelled all over to visit suppliers and she would set off on the bus in the morning and we never knew what she would come back with.\u0026#8217After running the shop for 20 years, Mrs Coats is taking a well-earned rest as Tarbert artist Wilma MacKenzie takes over the reins.Mrs Coats said: \u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s nice to feel it is going to continue, slightly differently perhaps, but it\u0026#8217s going to continue.\u0026#8217PICS:Sarah Coats pictured outside the shop in the 1970s. no_a31EarraGael02Mrs Coats with her friend, Tarbert artist Ann Thomas who was one of the original members of the association in 1973. 08_a30GiftShopSarah02Members and volunteers at Earra Gael today.

The ball made its way through to the unmarked Robert Walker who had the simple task of tapping the ball home to open the scoring with 15 minutes played.Bute’s centre line started to dominate play and John MacCallum set up Iain MacDonald who made it 2-0 five minutes before the break.Inveraray came out stronger in the second half, enjoying the bulk of play, but it was Bute who scored a third goal with Robert Walker netting with 15 minutes remaining.The goal seemed to spark life into the Inveraray team who went on to score two goals in a four-minute spell.Craig Taylor fired home an unstoppable shot on 79 minutes, and just a couple of minutes later captain John MacKenzie made it 3-2.The visitors almost snatched a draw at the death through a Steven Cameron shot which went just inches wide of goal.Taynuilt 2 Kilmory 3Alister MacArthur scored twice as Kilmory beat Taynuilt at the Taynuilt Sports Field.Taynuilt started strongly, but while they dominated play the Kilmory keeper didn’t have a save to make the home side missed chances.The second half was only three minutes old when Alister MacArthur, who individually has scored more goals than the whole Taynuilt team this season, showed the reason why by firing the ball past Reid in the Taynuilt goal.He repeated the feat five minutes later to give Kilmory a two goal cushion.This seemed to stir Taynuilt into action and David Campbell scored from the edge of the D on the hour to reduce the deficit.Taynuilt went all out for the equaliser but were caught out on 72 minutes when Sandy Leiper ran away from his marker and laid the ball off to Ally MacLennan to slip it passed Reid and restore Kilmory\u0026#8217s two-goal advantage.It was a crucial strike as the home side pulled a goal back just six minutes later after a well-worked corner between David Campbell and Jamie MacFarlane with the latter firing a shot passed the Kilmory keeper to make it 3-2.Taynuilt laid siege to the Kilmory goal for the remainder of the game but they lacked the composure to get an equaliser.Best for Kilmory were Jones, Cunningham, and MacArthur and man of the match, Leiper.Kilmory leapfrog Taynuilt in the league and unless Taynuilt can find someone to put the ball in the net, they are going to be in the relegation dog-fight.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"past times present fun in lochgilphead","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 10/08/18, 11:29 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowOrganisers reckon 450 people came along to enjoy a dip into the past.Lochgilphead Community Council\u0026#8217s annual Celtic and Pictish Festival is gathering momentum year on year as it grows into an event with a character all of its own.Morning shoppers on Argyll Street were treated to the unusual sight of Picts, Vikings and Romans parading to Lochgilphead front green to begin the festivities.

Contractors will move in tomorrow night (Saturday) in a bid to hold up the crumbling building. Works, which will take place while the line is shut, could take at least three nights to complete. In a private briefing note seen by the Ayrshire Post, council officials have outlined extensive repairs set to take place. South Ayrshire chief executive, Eileen Howat, says: The works - which can only be completed during the closure of the railway line - involve the use of a crane, lighting, cutting and drilling equipment to remove a number of unsafe materials from the roof of the building and the installation of a new exterior protective net system. Work is scheduled to start at 10pm tomorrow night with teams operating until 6am. It\u0027s understood scheduled services will not be affected. Ms Howat said contractors should complete their work within three nights but warned the findings of a trackside roof inspection could extend the process. She added: While our contractors will do everything they can to minimise any noise and disruption during this time, we do know some noise will be unavoidable. Residents in the area were informed by hand-delivered letters this afternoon. It follows the council swooping on the building earlier this summer after labelling the B Listed structure an immediate risk to public safety.

Furious Pat Spence, plagued by ill-health she says is caused by the whirring windmills, revealed Scottish Power has failed to hand over data they promised. Now Pat says: “They’re not getting their machines back until they do what they said they would. “I want a legally binding agreement stating they will supply me with the information.” The 74-year-old is at the centre of a bitter battle with Scottish Power Renewables who have been circling her home near Barrhill with hundreds of giant wind turbines. We’ve been charting Pat’s plight since last March.  The flautist and music publisher says bad vibrations makes her sick and sleep-deprived. And she says that the 19th century Dochroyle hill farm steading she has lived in for more than 30 years has changed from “dream home to torture chamber.” On one occasion she was forced into sleeping in her car in the village. The turbine blades fire infrasound waves towards her home and Pat says the alien rhythm interferes with her body’s natural rhythm. As a result she says she feels like it’s a cross between a heart attack and a panic attack and due to balance being connected to hearing, that’s what is making her sick. She simply wants the power company to buy her out. Her case has been backed by scientists and medics and she was visited again last week by retired GP and occupational physician Angela Shiells. Dr Shiells said: “I have an interest in the ill-effects of wind turbines and have been studying Pat’s case for a year.  “I have no doubt that her symptoms are related to the turbines surrounding her home.” Pat suspects the power firm have been unable to devise a method of analysis of low frequency sound despite international expert Professor Mariana Alves-Pereira being able to. She said: “Scottish Power say they would not allow the data to be released to me because Mariana would twist it. How dare they accuse her of such malpractice. All I want is my life back.” She fears large extensions are being planned for the Kilgallioch wind farm as well as the doubling in size of Arecleoch and Mark. A Scottish Power spokeswoman said: “We installed monitoring equipment in Ms Spence’s home over a year ago in response to a complaint made regarding noise. A specialist consultant is currently analysing the data on our behalf, in accordance with a protocol agreed with South Ayrshire Council and in relation to the concerns raised by Ms Spence. “This assessment and accompanying data will be shared with both South Ayrshire Council and Ms Spence in due course. “In the meantime we do require access to recover our specialist consultant’s equipment and hope Ms Spence will allow us to do so.” "},{"url":null,"title":"rolling back years troon class","story":"NewsRolling back the years for Troon class of \u002798Marr College pupils reunite for great hotel partyShare\u0026nbspByStephen Houston13:39, 8 AUG 2018Updated13:40, 8 AUG 2018NewsParty girls They loved catching up (Image: Lynda McFarlane)Get daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMore than 50 partying pupils rolled back the years to live life like it was 1998.

An inn sprang up here known as the Brighous Inn and it was at this site that the famous Linton markets were first held.\nRobert Burns would visit Linton where he had a friend named Graham, the innkeeper at the Brighous. Twice he came but didn\u0026rsquot find his friend at home, so he scratched these words on a window pane of the inn: \u0026ldquoHonest Graham, aye the same, never to be found at hame.\nThe old inn was considerably enlarged in 1862, becoming Medwyn House, the home of William Forbes, a great benefactor of the village, who spent large sums in draining and improving the land. A new turnpike road between Carlops and Dolphinton had been built in 1831, and, as a result, a way-side inn appeared on the east side of the road called Rutherford Castle Inn.\nThe owner, James Greig, considerably improved the property and transformed the inn, which faced west, into the present dwelling house which faces south and is approached by an avenue from the main road.\nA later owner, Andrew Webster, extended the planting and enclosed a mineral spring, \u0026ldquoHeaven Aqua, less than two miles from Carlops.\nNot all the fine local houses around West Linton survived. Coldcoat or Macbiehill was one. It had a long pedigree, being built about 1600, but was demolished about 1950.\nIt was owned by the Hamiltons of Coldcoat and Grange the last of the Hamiltons being Alexander who died in 1697. Before he died he managed to repair the house and in so doing contrived that there were exactly 15 sleeping places in the house, so that he might have it in his power to accommodate the whole of the 15 judges of the Court of Session without the necessity of putting two in one bed.\nThe Coldcoat estate was then acquired by William Montgomery of Magbiehill in Ayrshire, who transferred this name which later became Macbiehill. Three of this family are buried in a mausoleum on the estate.\nAnother house that did not survive was Broomlee House. It was originally the manor house of Broomlee estate until it was acquired by Sir William Fergusson and absorbed into Spitalhaugh estate. After his death it continued to be occupied by his three spinster daughters until after their deaths when it was demolished and became part of the grounds of Broomlee Camp.

The Bustler was called in to coordinate 17 other tugs in a successful action to re-float her.The outcome was to try to find more of the human side of the life and times of Bustler and its crew, especially as we knew that many of its 45 crew were Campbeltown and Kintyre natives.The objective I had in mind is a shorter document that might be of considerable interest to visitors and readers of the Courier.During the months since our visit, I have gathered a wealth of material from RN service records, family photos, official books, The Campbeltown Book, newsletters and my father’s curriculum vitae.I have also found that another Bustler model is on show in the National Museum in Edinburgh.Most of my father’s papers are with family in Australia. He died there in 1981 \u0026#8211 and the family have some that should be of interest, so I am arranging  to bring them over here.One book stands out: \u0026#8216The Tattie Lads,\u0026#8217  by Ian Dear, published by Bloomsbury in 2016, available from Amazon at £22.50 hardback, also on Kindle.It tells \u0026#8216the untold story of the Rescue Tug Service in two World Wars and its battles to save cargoes, ships and lives.\u0026#8217Chapter one tells the history and background of the Rescue Tug Service (RTS).Chapter two is simply named \u0026#8216Campbeltown.\u0026#8217 Its 40 pages tell how the town became the world centre for rescue tug boats in the First World War and reopened in the next war.The chapter charts the rise of the U-Boats and the threats from aircraft, the re-establishment of the Royal Naval base from six tugs in 1939 to 85 world-wide by the end of the war.Campbeltown became the national training base and was responsible for naval discipline, including pilfering, looting and even a minor mutiny.Incidents, some amusing and others not so give a flavour of what life was like in those days, especially the anecdotes of the actual rescues that were attended round the world.The rest of the book recounts the feats and some failures of the RTS worldwide and RTS’s eventual closure at the end of the war. The only  direct  reference to my father, Lt Archie Leckie, is at pages 153/4 while stationed at an outstation of RTS at St John’s, Newfoundland.In March 1942, he had strongly reported after a tricky rescue with a tanker there that his then tug, Tenacity, should have had a modern towing winch.Shortly afterwards he was promoted to Lieutenant-Commander and appointed maintenance officer, rescue tugs base at St John”s.There is also a photo of \u0026#8216Bustler\u0026#8217 towing a conundrum used to lay the fuel pipeline Pipe Line Under The Ocean (Pluto) to Cherbourg after the Normandy landings.My father was mentioned in despatches for this action. I have donated a copy of the book to the museum and Elaine has placed it beside the model.I think there should, be a much bigger project to tell this story.My sister and I have many happy childhood memories of Bustler, and have even sailed on her but there are gaps as we were children at the time.We were shielded from the dangers my father faced and, of course, he was unable to tell us where he was going.Another of our difficulties is that having left school and Campbeltown in 1953, we also lost touch with Kintyre people.We are interested in any written experiences, or details of any surviving sailors.Donald Leckie,North Berwick.donaldleckie7@gmailHMRT Bustler in Campbeltown museum.

The cyclists said: ‘We would like to thank everyone who has donated so far to this very worthwhile cause.’The group has currently raised approximately £3,000 and will keep the JustGiving page open until the end of August should anyone wish to donate – https://justgiving/fundraising/morag-macnicol\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"golf lottery results","story":"The next draw, for a jackpot of £700, will be on August 13.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letter pothole praise for acha","story":"I recently raised the need for pothole repairs with Argyll Community Housing Association (ACHA) and I am delighted with their swift response.They have filled the large potholes at An-Creagan Place in Port Charlotte.A huge thanks to ACHA\u0026#8217s hard working team for repairing the damage to this road.Councillor Alastair Redman,Islay.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll peloton expands kintyre time trial","story":"Numbers once again ballooned to 30 from the original 14, partly by an echelon from Mid Argyll and also by holiday makers staying in the area, who fancied their chances on MACC\u0026#8217s virtually pan flat closed road circuit.There were many new faces but also a number, such as the Kintyre Wheelers Cycling Club July winner, Dom Sharkey, missing while competing at other events.After gentle protests and to satisfy those who pace themselves against the phone app Strava, the race distance was lowered slightly to exactly 10 miles.Mechanic and time keeper, Ian Brodie, said: \u0026#8216Three cyclists rode the lap and a mean of their GPS recorded mileage was taken to decide on the start and finish point.\u0026#8217A funding bid is to be made by Kintyre Wheeters together with other Argyll cycling clubs for a chip timing kit. Until it is obtained it has been decided to report just the top three times at this event.In line with previous Kintyre Wheelers Cycling Club time trials there was a sighting lap with competitors split into two groups.This gives the riders a chance to learn the three lap route and spot any potential hazards such as corners and lines in the mainly concrete surfaces.Once the event started, to speed up starts slightly riders were gridded up using the standard system of the slowest starting first either in pairs or in threes.The fastest go last as the aim is to bring everyone to the finish at about the same time.The wind had been increasing slightly and riders had strong crosswinds during the trial.Craig Armour took the top spot finishing in 26 minutes dead. Visitor David Steel was two minutes behind on 28 minutes and there were eight riders in third place at about 29 minutes.One rider from Somerset, Frank Taylor, said: \u0026#8216I was born in Campbeltown but we moved away when I was seven.\u0026#8216I have been back every year since first with my parents and continued as an adult.\u0026#8216It is great to see the sporting opportunities available in Kintyre.\u0026#8217Mr Taylor said that he had ridden in many cycling club events but had never been to one so well organised.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"free tours roll out the cinemas red carpet","story":"Campbeltown Picture House is running free tours every Tuesday and Thursday in August, showcasing the revamped and expanded grade A listed building\u0026#8217s best features.Four volunteers are leading the tours, which begin at 10.30am and do not need to be booked, with those wishing to take part meeting at the cinema\u0026#8217s front desk.A Courier reporter joined 14 people of all ages \u0026#8211 and a dog \u0026#8211 on Tuesday\u0026#8217s tour, led by Geraldine Davey, and learned a few new things.The tour began by heading back outside to look at the exterior of the building, which was designed by Glasgow School of Art alumni and architect Albert Victor Gardner, at its original entrance.The tour continued into the cinema\u0026#8217s screen one, with its iconic two \u0026#8216wee hooses\u0026#8217 either side of the stage, one of which used to be a broom cupboard and the other allegedly the manager\u0026#8217s office.It was revealed that in 1960 it cost 3s to sit on the balcony and 1s 6d to sit in the stalls.People said that it was actually quite expensive at the time, with one commenting: \u0026#8216It cost a lot of pocket money to come to the cinema.\u0026#8217A few people tested the comfort of some of the 193 seats from French firm Quinette Gallay, with one gentleman who was reluctant to get up again commenting: \u0026#8216Just give me a shout when you\u0026#8217re leaving.\u0026#8217The tour continued upstairs to the balcony, where Mrs Davey pointed out the clouds painted on the roof, fitting in with the cinema\u0026#8217s \u0026#8216atmospheric\u0026#8217 status.\u0026#8216This is supposedly the closest we can get to the original,\u0026#8217 she said.She said that the cinema, once nicknamed the \u0026#8216flea pit\u0026#8217 due to its inferior stature compared to the Rex cinema, employed a pianist, Adam Ritchie Greig, when it first opened in 1913 to accompany the silent films.When \u0026#8216talkies\u0026#8217 started to become popular and his playing was no longer required, Mr Greig founded an orchestra which proved very popular for social events and functions.The tour continued into the new, second screen, which has 52 seats, with many comments on its intimate setting.The cinema operated continuously from when it first opened its doors until it closed in 2014, for three years, for £3.5 million of renovations.To find out even more take the next tours, on Tuesday August 14 and Thursday August 16, at 10.30am.Geraldine Davey, in the centre of the balcony of screen one, led her first tour of the cinema this week. 50_c32cinematours02\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"costa del dalintober hosts campbeltown community regatta","story":"An active regatta sub committee of Kintyre Seasports Project met monthly  and twice in the month prior to the event.There was assistance from Jason McCallum at Keeping it Local, Krisp Print, Margaret Wallace TSI, Explore Campbeltown, Explore Kintyre and David McQuilken at Springbank.Sid Gallagher said: \u0026#8216Helen Gilchrist was a super master of ceremonies on the day.\u0026#8216Jamie McLean and Kenny Blair were power houses behind the Dalintober Beach Group organisation and contribution.\u0026#8216Jamie manually cleared half a ton of seaweed off the beach at 8am on Saturday morning.\u0026#8216The four RNLI crew members in the D-class lifeboat were on the water from 11am to 4pm despite a call out at 4am that morning and Campbeltown Coastguard also supported the event.\u0026#8217Groups involved were: Dalintober Beach group, Campbeltown Sailing Club with Guy Nicol on rescue boat, Campbeltown Sea Cadet Unit, Campbeltown Dive Group,  Campbeltown Stand Up Paddle Board group, Kintyre Canoe Club, Grant Logan Windsurfing, Kintyre Youth Cafe, Police Scotland Youth Volunteers.Mr Gallagher added: \u0026#8216Campbeltown Sailing Club members Ian and Alison Paton and their two-year-old daughter Florence came up from York specially for the regatta.\u0026#8217\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"jimmy kerr open results","story":"Results: 1 A B Glendinning 85-18=67(BIH), 2 John Ramsay 86-19=67, 3 John Docherty 83-15=68 (BIH), 4 E White 81-13=68, 5 E Cappocci 76-6=70 (BIH).

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.

Mr Ramsay, who is from West Yorkshire, told the Courier: \"I think it is a disgrace that East Lothian has no contingency plan for shipwrecks despite being a fishing community.  \"I have been threatened and abused while staying at the beach at Prestonpans with my boat and when I managed to float it and asked for permission to move to Cockenzie Harbour I was refused by the MCA.  \"I\u0027ve lost everything, this was my home and I invested everything in it.

The announcement comes after another incident at the park saw goalposts broken and scorch marks left on the 3G and 2G pitches.  The park, which is home to various football teams, has been the victim of numerous attacks but the latest, earlier this month, led to calls on social media for security to be tightened up there.  Two summers ago the park was hit twice by vandals in two weeks, again during July, with the \u0026lsquopie hut\u0026rsquo broken into and items stolen, as well as damage caused to the pitches and surrounding area.

The plans went before by the council\u0026rsquos planning committee in March last year but members agreed to delay a decision while consideration was given towards improvements being carried out at the junction of the A199 and B1407.  But the developer opted to go straight to appeal and Christopher Warren, a reporter appointed by the Scottish Ministers, gave an indication that the plans would be approved towards the end of November last year.  Now he has issued a final decision, which allows 93 houses and 20 flats to be built on land beside Orchardfield.  Gerry More, managing director of Stewart Milne Homes Central Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoThe sensitively designed new homes planned for East Linton will have a mix of 19 individual home styles, with house prices set to appeal to a wide range of buyers, from first-time buyers through to growing families.  \u0026ldquoOur vision is to create a series of new communities in East Lothian that incorporate traditional values and features from historical East Lothian towns and villages.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos encouraging that this vision is being shared and supported by the local authority.  \u0026ldquoWith substantial investment planned for landscaping, design and placemaking, The Orchard in the market town of East Linton is set to be a prime example of Stewart Milne Homes\u0026rsquo innovative approach to creating unique, sustainable and aspirational communities.  Thirty-one objections were lodged with the council\u0026rsquos planning department ahead of councillors considering the plans last year.  Dunpender Community Council raised concerns that the development was \u0026ldquotoo large-scale and building so many new homes at once would \u0026ldquoput undue pressure on existing services and infrastructure both within East Linton and in the wider area.  Ward member Councillor Norman Hampshire, who is also the chairman of the council\u0026rsquos planning committee, said: \u0026ldquoObviously we as a council support the development \u0026ndash it is part of the Local Development Plan. However, we did have concerns regarding the entrance into East Linton and we had hoped to have made improvements to that entrance.  \u0026ldquoHowever, Stewart Milne Homes have now got consent.  \u0026ldquoWe can still try to negotiate with the company to see if improvements can be made to the entrance.  \u0026ldquoMy preference would be a roundabout, like we have on the eastern side of East Linton, but that might be difficult now they have got consent but we will still negotiate to try to make improvements for access in and out of East Linton.  \u0026ldquoIt is a fast road and cars come down that hill and try to make a left turn into East Linton.  The councillor added: \u0026ldquoI think there is potential for an accident blackspot.  Mr Hampshire described East Linton as \u0026ldquoa very attractive village and noted the development would fund an extension to its primary school.  Of the 93 houses, 64 would be detached, 16 semi-detached and 13 terraced.  In terms of size, two of the proposed 93 houses would contain two bedrooms, 33 would contain three bedrooms, 36 would contain four bedrooms and 22 would contain five bedrooms.  Eighty-five of the houses would be for sale, with 28 affordable housing units, which would be a mix of two different house types and one and two-bedroom flats."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8129137.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"map-highlights-alcohol-hotspots-of-east-lothian","story":"  The study by Alcohol Focus Scotland, alongside the Centre for Research on Environment, Society and Health, flagged up hotspots in Musselburgh, Haddington and North Berwick.

It also found that alcohol-related death rates were four times higher in neighbourhoods with the most outlets when compared to areas with the fewest in the county and crime rates were also two-and-a-half-times higher.

More than 620 entries were received from across the county, elsewhere in the UK and even as far afield as the USA and New Zealand.  Four flag designs\u0026nbsphave been shortlisted to go forward to a public vote.  The voting process is now open and runs until the end of this month, with final votes being accepted no later than 5pm on Friday, August 31.  The result will then be kept under wraps while the winning design is made into a flag, which will be launched around St Andrew\u0026rsquos Day.  Run jointly by East Lothian Council and the Scottish Flag Trust, in association with the Lord Lyon and the Courier, the competition was open to anyone and was free to enter.  The judging panel comprised the Lord Lieutenant of East Lothian, Michael Williams Lord Lyon Joseph Morrow East Lothian Council Provost John McMillan and chief executive Angela Leitch David Williamson, chairman of the Scottish Flag Trust and Courier editor Robbie Scott.  The four designs are below:  Design A    This saltire design on blue reflects the local birthplace of the\u0026nbspnational flag, with the cross in gold signifying the wealth of \u0026nbspEast Lothian\u0026rsquos farmlands and reputation as the granary of \u0026nbsp Scotland. The lion rampant is a traditional emblem of the county \u0026nbsp\u0026ndash it appears in many local coats of arms while King William the \u0026nbspLion was born in the royal palace in Haddington. The blue\u0026nbspstripes through the gold represent the rivers Esk and Tyne.  Design B    Using three horizontal bands in strong colours, this design\u0026nbsp depicts the key industries of the county \u0026ndash blue for the sea\u0026nbspand fishing, above yellow for the county\u0026rsquos beaches and\u0026nbsptourism, above green for the farming. And in the centre,\u0026nbspa fluttering saltire reflecting the birthplace of Scotland\u0026rsquos flag, within a map outline of East Lothian\u0026rsquos territory.  Design C    This design employs two distinctive curved bands of colour\u0026nbsp\u0026ndash the blue upper band representing the importance to East\u0026nbspLothian of the sea, and the lower green band representing\u0026nbspthe rolling countryside and the Lammermuirs. In the first quarter is a white saltire, one of which is like a beam of light,\u0026nbspto acknowledge the county being the birthplace of the national flag.  Design D    The centrepiece of this design is a gold lion rampant \u0026ndash a traditional emblem of East Lothian appearing on the council\u0026rsquos coat of arms and on the arms of many of the\u0026nbspcounty\u0026rsquos ancient families. It sits over a white saltire\u0026nbsprepresenting the local origins of Scotland\u0026rsquos flag. The field\u0026nbspof the flag comprises three horizontal bands \u0026ndash blue for the sea around the county\u0026rsquos coastline, yellow for its beaches, and green for its rich farmland.  Mr McMillan said: \u0026ldquoIt was a very difficult decision for the judges, having to choose four final designs from the huge number of high-quality submissions we received.  \u0026ldquoI hope that East Lothian residents will get involved again and let us know what their favourite design is.  \u0026ldquoHaving a distinctive new civic flag for East Lothian will allow individuals and groups across the county to express pride in their local community, to celebrate their heritage and help raise recognition and awareness of East Lothian nationwide.  \u0026ldquoI will be very excited to see the outcome of the public vote.  David Williamson, chairman of the Scottish Flag Trust, said: \u0026ldquoExperience elsewhere suggests that involving the public in choosing a civic flag is by far the best way to progress, and the hope is that the interest already shown in the East Lothian competition will continue into the voting stage.  \u0026ldquoVoting on the four shortlisted flag designs has been held back until after the main holiday period so that people don\u0026rsquot miss out on the chance to participate.  Lord Lyon Dr Joseph Morrow added: \u0026ldquoThere was a wealth of talent expressed in the entries which reflected very positively on the area.  \u0026ldquoI now look forward to the vote of the people and the taking of the ownership of a flag to be a symbol of pride in East Lothian.

A meeting of Cockenzie Community Forum yesterday evening (Wednesday), was told that the company was considering a number of sites with Prestonpans Community Councillor Calum Miller suggesting the former\u0026nbspCockenzie Power Station site could be\u0026nbspa possible home for it or\u0026nbsped that East Fortune Airfield could be a potential home for the company\u0026rsquos site.  Skyrora describes itself as a launch vehicle development company with aims to cater for the growing demand to send small satellites into space.  It is developing rockets which it hopes to launch from a UK spaceport.  The engine testing would not involve the launching of rockets but would require fuel to be stored on-site to fire up the engines.  The UK Space Agency announced it was investing millions of pounds in a site in Sutherland as the new home of the UK\u0026rsquos first spaceport for launching rockets.  Skyrora said it was looking for an engine test site within an hour of its Edinburgh offices to give it a local base.  Presenting the proposals to the forum yesterday evening, Prestonpans community councillor Calum Miller said that the engine testing would sound no louder than a jet engine to those within 500 metres and the benefits the site could bring would outweigh the \u0026ldquominor inconvenience.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe can bring top scientists and engineers into East Lothian, there is potential for localised manufacturing and supply of goods and services, to interest local schools in engineering, science and the next space race.  He added that the community council had not taken a view on the proposals and was looking for feedback.  Earlier this year it was revealed that Glasgow produced more space satellites than any other city outside of the USA.  Robin Hague, lead engineer with Skyrora, said that the company was designing a new Scottish launch vehicle and looking at a number of locations around Edinburgh, the Lothians and Fife to ground test its engines.  He said: \u0026ldquoEast Lothian has some excellent possibilities and we look forward to seeing if we can find a home there.  A council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoWe would always be interested in finding out more about projects which have the potential to grow the local economy and support jobs."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8153016.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"a-host-of-local-acts-to-perform-at-fringe-by-the-sea","story":"  An array of entertainment is on offer during the festival, which this year celebrates its 10th anniversary with a bumper 10-day programme of events.

But it showed that residents who both live and work in East Lothian earn 15 per cent less each week, taking their pay packets well below the national average.  East Lothian Council says the gap in pay reflects the nature of the county\u0026rsquos economy, with many jobs traditionally low paid such as part-time or seasonal roles.  But one community councillor said the problem was \u0026ldquolow ambition and called for East Lothian to learn to compete with Edinburgh rather than providing employees for the Scottish capital.  Calum Miller, who supports the ambitions of Prestonpans Community Council \u0026ndash of which he is a member \u0026ndash for a cruise terminal to be built at the former Cockenzie Power Station site, said: \u0026ldquoIncreasingly, East Lothian sees itself as an appendage to Edinburgh rather than an independent entity.  \u0026ldquoGraduates are almost expected to leave once qualified for a better paid job in Edinburgh or elsewhere. Workers who can\u0026rsquot move have their horizons limited to jobs in the social care sector, manual labour and/or part-time.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian needs to learn how to compete again with Edinburgh and pull employers here rather than push employees into the city.  \u0026ldquoTo do that, the infrastructure needs to take a big leap forward housing needs to be cheaper and more accessible, fibre broadband needs to enter houses and businesses directly, and East Lothian Council needs to allocate land for enterprise plus foster a hunger for new business.  The community council has produced a brochure outlining its vision for a Port of Prestonpans which it says would bring in new income and employment.  Mr Miller said it was just one of the new ideas which could benefit the county.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe Port of Prestonpans would not only transform the tourist potential of East Lothian, it would bring in new local companies that we haven\u0026rsquot even imagined.  The latest report from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) found workers who lived and worked in East Lothian have gross weekly earnings of \u0026pound517 on average \u0026ndash well below the \u0026pound595 for residents working outwith the county.  The number of households in the county which are classed as \u0026ldquoeconomically active is also above the national average, with over 81 per cent of residents employed in some way.  The number of men of working age living in the county who were not employed was considered too low to count by ONS.  East Lothian Council said it was looking at ways to develop the local economy.  A spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThis is an indication of high commuting rates out of East Lothian and the nature of the East Lothian economy \u0026ndash eg. rural, hospitality, part-time/seasonal \u0026ndash that tend to pay lower rates. The refreshed East Lothian Economic Development Strategy will outline the context of such differences and consider means of appropriate support for the local economy and workforce.  The average UK gross weekly wage in 2017 was \u0026pound552 while the Scottish average was \u0026pound547."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8157352.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"work-taking-place-at-blindwells-ahead-of-houses-being-built-there","story":"  Planning permission for homes at Blindwells, which is sandwiched between the A1 north of Tranent and the A198 south of Cockenzie, was granted in spring last year.

It is one of the few islands on the West Coast I don\u0026rsquot know, and for sure I will be back. It is a less-known treasure, I think.  I was camping with my family so our accommodation was pretty basic, but the kids absolutely loved it. As I write, we have just returned and I am in recovery mode from five nights under canvas.  We could afford it because my wife and I were stewards, two shifts each then we were able to access the festival. My main responsibility was the \u0026lsquobeach gate\u0026rsquo, a quieter access point which allowed festival-goers to visit the beach and return without needing to go through the main gate.  And so there I was, with a high-visibility vest and a walkie-talkie, checking people\u0026rsquos wrist bands as they left and entered. I met lots of wonderful people, but most of the time I was sitting on a mound of sand by the gate, admiring the stunning view of Ettrick Bay and the mountains of Arran in the distance.  It was a rare and wonderful time for reflection. The rest of the family were nearby but having a ball inside, so I was free to enjoy my thoughts.  There was a prehistoric standing stone circle close to the site of the festival which gave the same view I was enjoying. It made me realise that although I had vague idea of the general history of the area, I did not know the tales steeped in the landscape.  Story anchors our relationship with the land, and sitting in that beautiful and wild place made me want to make that connection there as well. I can simply enjoy a view, of course, but perhaps a burden storytellers carry is the need to pick the wisps of stories from the land wherever we go.  I thought of a possible connection with East Lothian in the travels of St Kenneth. He was a monk from Ireland and an associate of St Columba. He must have known this shore, perhaps he walked the sand of Ettrick Bay itself.  His name is embedded in many place names, both in Ireland and Scotland, and one of them is Cockenzie. The legend states that this name comes from the Gaelic Cul Cionnich, meaning Kenneth\u0026rsquos Cove.  He is said to have arrived in the small picturesque natural harbour, now called the Boat Shore, in the sixth century, and thus baptised the community with his name. The Boat Shore was for many years the harbour of what was to become the village of Cockenzie. For sure it seems the saint\u0026rsquos travels took him to the Forth valley so the legend may be rooted in a real event.  I love the Boat Shore at Cockenzie. I played there in my childhood, as so many have. Both high and low tide has it different pleasures there.  I reflected on the fact that perhaps the main difference between the Boat Shore and Ettrick Bay on Bute is not their varying size but the fact that Cockenzie is now \u0026lsquobuilt up\u0026rsquo.  Yet when I walked the shore from Port Seton to Cockenzie recently, the sea was no less dominant on my senses. In fact the remains of old salt pans, the survival of a fishing community and its traditions, the gable ends of houses facing defiantly at the sea all added to the experience.  Cockenzie is a place where the tiny threads of personal memories entwine with ancient stories and history of fishwives and fishermen, salt makers and coal miners, where the tracks of the past run literally at your feet. Yet there is still a vibrant local community, a living connection to the ancestral past. That makes the place extra special.  My thoughts were interrupted by a comment from a festival-goer: \u0026ldquoLook! That\u0026rsquos the sea, I mean the real sea, so cool. He and his friends left through the beach gate and headed down to the beach to take photos.  The comment made me realise something obvious. A real connection is the sea, and it also made me feel lucky that I live next to it.  It was on the Saturday night that the sea brought me new thoughts. The blue sky turned grey, then a dark, brooding black. The calm water began to boil with rage as it brought warm air from the south which had turned into a storm. We managed to get into our tent just in time.  Howling winds and torrential rain swept through the festival campsite like a reaper, ripping up tents. I double-pegged our tent with the help of my friend Chris Yule, and then we huddled inside as the winds did their worst. The kids were both excited and a little scared by it, but mostly excited!  The family slept as the storm howled in anger outside, the canvas walls of the tent bending this way and that. If we needed to evacuate, Chris had kindly offered the floor of his caravan as a refuge.  I lay there listening to the storm and was glad I was not at sea. My home town, Prestonpans, was born of such a storm when a pirate, possibly a Viking, was shipwrecked on the shoreline a thousand years ago. He stayed and founded the village, his name still echoed in Aldhammer House.  I stayed awake until the worst was over, then fell into sleep. In the morning, birds were singing and the sun shining. The campsite looked like a battlefield site collapsed tents and stuff blown everywhere, including a small tent blown into the hedge by us. But the festival site was repaired and a great final day had.  We took the longer, scenic route home, via Argyll\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquosecret coast\u0026rsquo, a deeply wooded and beautifully quiet part of the West Coast.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos great to be home, said my four-year-old as we arrived. It was, not least to have a shower and to eat something that wasn\u0026rsquot from a tin!  \u0026ldquoCan we go for a walk by the sea? I was asked first thing this morning.  \u0026ldquoAfter I have written my story, I replied.  \u0026ldquoWhat are you going to write about this time?  \u0026ldquoNot sure, let\u0026rsquos see what comes to my mind, I said.  And so now we will head to the Boat Shore, and the walk by the coast there.  I love living by the sea."},{"url":null,"title":"day-centre-welcomes-zambian-visitors","story":"  The centre received a visit from the country\u0026rsquos social welfare minister Emerine Kabanshi and Julien Mwape, director general of Zambia Agency for People with Disabilities (ZAPD), who are in Scotland to see firsthand a range of health and social care facilities.

The move comes just 16 months after a public consultation on similar plans in which three quarters of those who took part objected to the change, leading the council to scrap the proposal.  The council said the move was part of a review of its service provision however, it has been criticised for not taking the plan back to the community before making the decision.  Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, said: \u0026ldquoIt is extremely disappointing that East Lothian Council are pressing ahead with service changes in Prestonpans that were rejected last year.  \u0026ldquoPrestonpans Community Council and other local community organisations should have been consulted on these changes rather than being presented with a fait accompli and we would ask that the council assure the local community that they will consult fully on the future proposals for Aldhammer House.  The proposal to turn the library, which was built in 1905 through funds from Scottish philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, into a shared facility and move council services from their offices in the town\u0026rsquos Aldhammer House, was first put to the public in June 2016.  At the time the community council raised concerns that merging the services would take away people\u0026rsquos views of the library as a safe and neutral area.  And at a public meeting in the town Manja Porteus, then six, whose dad Tim is a professional storyteller and Courier columnist, appealed to the council to rethink its proposals and leave the library alone.  Following a public consultation, the council announced it had scrapped the plans in March last year, stating that \u0026ldquothe majority of respondents said they wanted the two services to remain in separate buildings and did not want to see any changes to the library building.  However, last week they said that a wide range of services would move into the library from August 27.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoAs more of our customers make use of online services and library staff are readily available to help people to go online, the council has reviewed its service provision and Aldhammer House will be developed to provide complementary services which give more support to the local community.  \u0026ldquoMeanwhile, Prestonpans Library will be developed as a joint library/area office as has been done in Dunbar, North Berwick and Tranent.  \u0026ldquoThis builds on the council\u0026rsquos work to strengthen our communities and support town centres such as Prestonpans with easy access to high-quality local facilities and services.  Aldhammer House will continue to be staffed by housing service staff, as well as keeping The Pantry Foodbank, Citizens Advice Bureau and local politicians\u0026rsquo surgeries. Capital Credit Union will also continue to operate part-time there. All other services will move to the library.  The changes were welcomed by some on social media, who said it had worked in other communities.  One person said: \u0026ldquoDoes it really matter where you pay your rent or fill in forms? If the council can\u0026rsquot afford it then they can\u0026rsquot afford it.  However, there was an angry response from others.  One woman said: \u0026ldquoThis is an outrage, what can we do? Are they determined to strip Prestonpans of everything?  A council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe changes being made differ from those proposed in 2016. Housing enquiries will continue to be dealt with at Aldhammer House, while payments for other services can be made at the library. This will in turn improve the range of services available at our improved library \u0026ndash and we are grateful for the positive feedback we have received on this from customers so far.  Tim Porteus, Prestonpans storyteller and Courier columnist, said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom disappointed.

The analysis, obtained by The Observer, suggested the development was driven by growing doubts about the case for Brexit among Labour voters in the north of England and Wales.  The findings will increase pressure on Jeremy Corbyn to reconsider Labour\u0026rsquos refusal to give its backing to a second referendum on EU membership  Even though polls regularly report a strong lead for Remain among Labour voters, a majority of the party\u0026rsquos constituencies backed Brexit in 2016, leaving party strategists wary of any suggestion that it might not deliver withdrawal.  The figures were produced by consumer analytics company Focaldata, drawing on two YouGov polls of a total of more than 15,000 people.  They found that 112 out of the 632 seats in England, Scotland and Wales had switched from Leave to Remain since the referendum. These included\u0026nbsp97 English seats, 14 in Wales and one in Scotland.  Under the Focaldata model, 341 constituencies now have a Remain majority, up from 229 in 2016.  The analysis, conducted for the Best for Britain campaign for a second referendum and the Hope Not Hate campaign against racism, puts Remain on 53% support, against 47% backing Leave.

He accused Iran of launching cyber attacks against Western democracies, sponsoring Hizbollah terrorists in Lebanon, arming militants in Yemen and publicly threatening to destroy Israel.  \u0026ldquoIt is clear that the danger from Iran did not diminish in the wake of the deal, he said. \u0026ldquoIt grew.  \u0026ldquoFar from becoming a more responsible member of the international community, as we had all hoped, Iran grew bolder.

Looking out, he would have seen Ben Tianavaig and, beyond, Raasay. What he could not have seen, nor imagined, was a future in which Runrig, the band for which he had just started to sing, would become the biggest in Scotland and have a lasting impact on Scottish culture. But the ingredients of that success were all around. Malcolm Jones \u0026ndash later the guitarist, but then still at school \u0026ndash lived down the street. The brothers Rory and Calum Macdonald, Runrig\u0026rsquos songwriting partnership, were on Fraser Crescent, around the corner so close that on summer nights, windows open to the island air, they could hear the fledgling rock star singing into the bathroom mirror, giving Elvis laldy.  \u0026ldquoThere was a dance every night in different villages around the island, Munro recalls. \u0026ldquoWe were playing five, six nights a week. Those drouthy whisky evenings at the Skye Gathering Hall, the Portree British Legion, Kyleakin Badminton Club were Runrig\u0026rsquos equivalent of the Beatles in Hamburg playing Proud Mary and Gay Gordons, learning their trade, earning their stripes. Never on a Sunday, of course the peace of the Sabbath was observed, a policy Runrig have maintained throughout a 45-year career which, soon now, will come to an end.  If Donnie Munro is in nostalgic mood, it is to a purpose. Having left Runrig in 1997 (to be replaced by the Canadian singer Bruce Guthro) he will be reunited with the band at the Last Dance, two farewell concerts in Stirling in August, in front of 45,000 fans. \u0026ldquoRunrig is a hard thing to let go, Calum Macdonald had told me when we met at his home in the Highlands. \u0026ldquoIt has been our life\u0026rsquos work, so there\u0026rsquos an emotional attachment. It was a difficult decision, but deep within us we know it is the right one. Let\u0026rsquos have a clean end and be positive about it. Bring the ship home to a safe harbour.  Driving around Scotland, meeting Runrig members past and present, there is time to listen deeply to their body of work, from 1978\u0026rsquos Play Gaelic through their 1987 smash The Cutter And The Clan (at the time, the fastest-selling LP ever released in Scotland) to their elegiac final album The Story. Their catalogue is sophisticated, complex, engaged with people, place, identity, faith. Little wonder their frustration at being pigeonholed as kitschy professional Scots. \u0026ldquoOur records still get put in the racks with the Scottish dance bands and pipe bands rather than between Run-DMC and the Rolling Stones where they should be, Calum sighed. \u0026ldquoThe national thing, it overwhelms you.  Here is a band whose contribution to Scottish culture has been immense, even historic. Their true place is among a lineage that stretches through Robert Burns, Billy Connolly and the historian John Prebble their internationally popular stories of Scotland and Scottishness have, arguably, had a shaping influence on the way we see ourselves and are seen by the world. In particular, as the first band to fuse the Gaelic language with rock, they remade an ancient tradition for a new age.  \u0026ldquoThey changed the face of music with their compositions in Gaelic, says Julie Fowlis. The 39-year-old singer-songwriter grew up with Runrig, as did many Hebrideans of her generation as a schoolgirl in North Uist, in 1990, she appeared in a video for the song Siol Ghoraidh. \u0026ldquoTheirs was an entirely new voice. It was brave and bold and from the heart. They took the language with them and kept it with them on their journey. We owe them a lot.  An old accordion. An older photograph. If the story of Runrig could be told in two objects, it would be these. Each has a totemic power.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a defining image of where I came from. A very peasant-looking photo, Calum Macdonald explained. \u0026ldquoI found it in a drawer in our house in Skye. It\u0026rsquos my grandmother and her friends round about. Black and white, torn in one corner, the picture shows a group of islanders stooking corn in the 1930s. He found it in 1975, in his early twenties, and it became a \u0026ldquopersonal talisman, inspiring the sort of songs he would go on to write rooted in the land, the language, personal and cultural history.  The Uist novelist Angus Peter Campbell has described the impact on the Hebrides of Runrig\u0026rsquos success: \u0026ldquoBy becoming international stars they have made the local universal and continue to give dignity to a scorned people and a scorned culture.  Is that how Calum saw it? That when they were on stage, or in the studio, they were representing not only themselves, but their folk? \u0026ldquoYes, absolutely. We were very aware of carrying that with us, and proud to do it.  Wasn\u0026rsquot it a burden? \u0026ldquoNo, an absolute privilege. But it was crucial that we weren\u0026rsquot doing it as a pressure group, or a political movement in any way, because that would weaken it. It had to be done naturally.  Rory Macdonald is 69, his brother\u0026rsquos senior by almost five years. Calum is Runrig\u0026rsquos chief lyricist, Rory, who plays bass, is the driving musical force. We spoke at his home on the Dornoch Firth before taking a turn on the sand. He seemed in good humour, even when asked about Loch Lomond. The band\u0026rsquos best known song, it has likely contributed a great deal to the perception of Runrig as couthy and sentimental. But no, he said, there were no regrets about covering it. \u0026ldquoExcept at weddings, quite often it\u0026rsquos the last song of the night. That\u0026rsquos my cue to go to the toilet. It\u0026rsquos not cool to dance to your own record.  Talk turned to his late father. Donald John Macdonald had served with the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders during the Second World War, later joining the police, before becoming a social worker. One of Runrig\u0026rsquos most beautiful songs, An Ubhal as \u0026Agraveirde, is about him. It became the first Gaelic song to make it into the UK top 20.  \u0026ldquoHe was a gregarious character, the life and soul, but like most of his generation he tried to shield what he\u0026rsquod experienced during the war, Rory said. \"There was pain. He saw his friend killed. He was standing in the turret of the tank, and thought he\u0026rsquod been shot because he was suddenly covered in blood. But it wasn\u0026rsquot his. His best pal died beside him.  This was Sandy MacIntyre. The tank crew had been ambushed in Normandy. Donald John, a sergeant, wrote to his friend\u0026rsquos parents to inform them of their loss, and kept in touch.  \u0026ldquoI remember going with my dad to visit Sandy\u0026rsquos folks in Greenock, when I was about nine, Rory recalled. \u0026ldquoThey were obviously poor, and just really nice people. A little kitchen-living room all the washing hanging off a pulley. Just as we were leaving, his mum said, \u0026lsquoWell, Sandy\u0026rsquos accordion\u0026rsquos still here, and we\u0026rsquod like to give it to your boy.\u0026rsquo They brought it down, in a black case, and gave it to me.  A beautful blue Hohner, here was a treasure and a passed torch. Keys that should have been pressed by their son, and perhaps his child in turn, would yield music under the fingers of Rory instead. Later, he would play it on the anti-war song The Everlasting Gun, but its greater significance is that it was his first instrument, setting him down the path to Runrig.  \u0026ldquoThat was massive, he nodded. \u0026ldquoOne of those moments in life that are key and that you always remember. I was aware not just of getting the accordion, but the love and kindness behind that.  Blood, then, watered the roots of Runrig. Blood spilled in France, blood passed between generations in the Hebrides. A sense of the tragic and a sense of tradition, both at the heart of the band\u0026rsquos music, symbolised by that family photograph found in a drawer, that instrument which found a new life.  Runrig\u0026rsquos pretty melodies sometimes come spiked with venom. The Everlasting Gun is one hell of an angry song. Perhaps because of the language barrier, it is little understood how important an emotion anger is in the band\u0026rsquos work. They are seen by many as soft-focus, shortbread-tin all kilt, no dirk. Listen, though, to Tir An Airm (a protest song against military bases) or Dance Called America (a rage against the Highland Clearances) or especially Fichead Bliadhna, which expresses Calum Macdonald\u0026rsquos frustration that he and his generation were taught nothing at school of the Clearances and other traumas of Gaeldom.  Although they have a politics, the band has, generally, avoided making statements of support for any one party. Internally, though, there has been discussion. \u0026ldquoFor most rock bands, it was sex, drugs and rock \u0026rsquon\u0026rsquo roll at the back of the tour bus, but Runrig were too busy debating Scotland\u0026rsquos constitutional question, said Pete Wishart, the band\u0026rsquos keyboard player from 1986 and 2001.  In common with the rest of the band, Wishart came from a Labour-supporting background, but his immersion in Runrig made him better understand and sympathise with issues, such as land ownership, which were part of the devolution agenda. \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom not saying I\u0026rsquom a nationalist, and I probably never will join the SNP, was his view in a 1991 interview. He is now the SNP MP for Perth and North Perthshire.  His political journey, he feels, is typical of Runrig\u0026rsquos influence on Scotland: a hugely popular band which seemed to foreground and explore Scottish identity, they were part of a wave of cultural nationalism which, quite without intent, seeded the ground for political nationalism.  \u0026ldquoI always felt that Runrig were the soundtrack to the emerging of the Scottish Parliament, Wishart told me. \u0026ldquoOur song Alba is essentially about that. It was no longer unfashionable to raise issues to do with the Gaelic culture or language. Scotland was learning to love and appreciate a sense of itself as confident and assertive. All the other political changes could never have happened without a feeling that what we have in Scotland is important and worth celebrating.  Tensions within the group arose not as a result of differences in ideology, but rather over the question of whether band members should be open about their party allegiances. Rory, in particular, was appalled by Donnie Munro\u0026rsquos decision, in the early 1990s, to declare his support for Labour: \u0026ldquoI didn\u0026rsquot want the music to be tainted by propaganda, or for a political party to be feeding off the name of the band. That hurt a wee bit.  Munro\u0026rsquos decision to leave the band hit Rory hard. \u0026ldquoI was devastated. It was almost like the break-up of a love affair, and for quite a while after that there was a frostiness. That\u0026rsquos human nature. But we\u0026rsquore grand now.  A long audition process was required to find a replacement: Bruce Guthro, a singer-songwriter from Nova Scotia. \u0026ldquoThe moment we heard him singing it felt right, Calum explained. \u0026ldquoBut he also came with a story. Emigration to Canada \u0026ndash that sense of exile and homesick yearning \u0026ndash had long been a Runrig theme. \u0026ldquoSo it was like we were taking something back from the diaspora. That was exciting.  It has become an accepted narrative that Munro left the band for politics, standing in the 1997 general election for the seat of Ross, Skye and Inverness West, and losing to Charles Kennedy. When we meet, he explains that it wasn\u0026rsquot quite that simple. He also missed his wife and children while on tour, and wondered how much more, creatively, he had to offer. \u0026ldquoBut I think, though I ceased to perform with Runrig, in my head I never really really left the band. I\u0026rsquove never been able nor wanted to separate myself from what we did collectively.  Munro is director of development, fundraising and the arts at Sabhal M\u0026ograver Ostaig, the Gaelic college on Skye it was established in 1973, the same year as Runrig, and Munro sees his work as an extension of what the band was doing \u0026ndash expressing ideas, being part of the regeneration of culture and community. At the farewell concerts, he will perform a couple of songs with the band, but will also open the show with a set which will include Runrig material.  \u0026ldquoI would have felt very disconnected not to have participated in the last shows, he says. \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos such a momentous thing for all us in lots of ways. It\u0026rsquos an opportunity to celebrate the connection with this audience. For many people, it\u0026rsquos not just a concert, it\u0026rsquos a piece of their personal history.  Lea Andrews will be there in Stirling, on the final night. How could she not be? For the 32 year old fan from Gateshead, the Last Dance is a last chance to express through her presence gratitude for what the band has meant all these years. Her parents split up when she was two her father had custody, but she wanted to live with her mother. Her stepfather and mother became fans of Runrig after seeing them live in Portree, and introduced the little girl to their music.  \u0026ldquoBecause I was pining after me mam so much, their music became synonymous with the feeling I had when I was with her, Lea recalls. She saw her mother every second weekend between times, on a Walkman, she would listen to Runrig. Every River, City of Lights, Always The Winner \u0026ndash these songs became both the soundtrack to separation, and lullabies containing the promise of reunion. \u0026ldquoThe sound of Donnie\u0026rsquos voice gave me such huge comfort, and that comfort has lasted throughout my life.  Could it have been any band that made Lea, as a child, feel soothed and understood? Was it just a fluke that it turned out to be Runrig? Arguably not. The music of Calum and Rory Macdonald, which so often touches on ideas of homesickness and homecoming, emerges from their childhood experience of separation.  \u0026ldquoA significant moment in our lives was when we left Uist and flitted to Skye, Rory recalled. He was 12 years old that summer, his brother seven. Their father had a new job on the much larger island. \u0026ldquoMy dad hired a small cargo boat from Scalpay. At about seven o\u0026rsquo clock that evening, we were all set to leave, and most of the village came down to see us off. As the boat was pulling away, all these people were on the pier waving to us. That experience is ingrained in Calum and I, and it has triggered a lot of songs.  Rory seemed moved by the recollection. When you close your eyes, I asked, can you see it? \u0026ldquoI can see it and feel it. It was visceral, hugely emotional. It gets you in the gut.  For people who don\u0026rsquot come from that island culture, this strength of feeling might be difficult to understand. After all, it\u0026rsquos not as if the family was leaving for a new life in America yet the Minch can be an Atlantic of the mind. \u0026ldquoYou were leaving a community that had enveloped you, Rory explained. \u0026ldquoOne where you knew everybody. You were aware of the love that was being imparted by these people coming down to the pier. All your friends. It was just overwhelming.  Would it be reasonable to suggest that the Macdonald brothers\u0026rsquo later empathy for those forced from their homes during the Clearances, and their ability to articulate that pain in song, goes back to this early experience of being uprooted? \u0026ldquoYes, we could identify with all that. It was a very intense experience.  In his foreword to Flower Of The West: The Runrig Songbook, the poet Aonghas MacNeacail notes that the Macdonalds grew up under the influence of two elemental landscapes: sea-scaped Uist and mountainous Skye the former, it could be argued, gives their music its melancholy, the latter its grandeur. Other early influences included the left-wing radicalism of the West Highland Free Press, the newspaper founded in Skye the year before Runrig formed, and the psalm-singing of the Free Presbyterian Church in which the Macdonalds were raised. One might also mention a gentleman known as Willie the Barber, whose shop by the pier in Portree doubled as the village\u0026rsquos record store as the 1960s worn on, the nascent rockers of Skye, chary of scissors, became more likely to visit the barber for the ecstatic records they were hearing on Radio Luxembourg. When Rory Macdonald heard Procul Harum\u0026rsquos Whiter Shade Of Pale for the first time, he rose from the family dinner table and went up, weeping, to his room.  The sea, the psalms, and socialism hard rock and soft island skies \u0026ndash all of these are part of Runrig, and Runrig is, forevermore, part of Scotland\u0026rsquos story. Only the Stirling concerts remain. On that final night, as they play each song, they will know it is for the last time. Alba no more. Skye no more. Loch Lomond no more.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos going to be hard, Rory said. \u0026ldquoI do just occasionally think, \u0026lsquoAre we doing the right thing?\u0026rsquo But no, I\u0026rsquom at peace with it. I hope the concerts will be celebratory. Maybe, at the end, a few tears will be shed \u0026hellip  Runrig: The Last Dance will be at City Park, Stirling, on August 17 \u0026amp 18"},{"url":null,"title":"call-for-inquiry-into-jobs-for-the-boys-university-principal-appointment","story":"  The move by the UCU Scotland lecturers union comes after Professor John Harper was made principal of Robert Gordon University, in Aberdeen.  Mr Harper was appointed after the former principal unexpectedly stepped down following a conflict of interest row.  In a letter to Mike Cantlay, chair of the Scottish Funding Council, the UCU said the appointment breached the code of good governance for Scottish higher education.  The letter, from Mary Senior, the union\u0026rsquos Scotland official, said: \u0026ldquoI want to raise with you our deep concerns about the apparent lack of any open appointment process.  \u0026ldquoWe are concerned that this seemingly overnight elevation of one of the  vice principals to the position on a permanent basis does not sit well with good governance nor with equal opportunities principles.  \u0026ldquoWe want to be proud of our universities, but misguided decisions like this one damage that reputation and do nothing to give staff and students confidence in those leading our institutions. We would ask for your views and intervention on this matter.  The Scottish Code of Good Higher Education Governance states that  governing bodies are expected to ensure that the appointment process for principals \u0026ldquoenables student, staff and trade union input to be taken into account.  Ms Senior said she was not aware of an open appointment process having been conducted with student, staff or trade union input.  And she said the importance of following the correct procedure was to introduce greater diversity into senior university management - which is dominated by white males.  She added: \u0026ldquoWe cannot see how automatically promoting one white male vice-principal, is open, transparent or fair in any sense.  \u0026ldquoIt denies a whole range of other individuals \u0026ndash women and men \u0026ndash the opportunity to apply for this highly paid, important leadership role.  However, Mike Fleming, chair of the university\u0026rsquos board of governors, denied there had been any breach of the code.  In a message to staff he said: \u0026ldquoI would like to reassure you that the appointment was in line with the university\u0026rsquos procedures and complies with the code of good governance.  \u0026ldquoThere was full involvement of the board in the appointment and the governors were unanimous in their decision to ask John to step up to the role of principal.  Mr Fleming said the board was aware that normal practice was to go through a competitive process, but added: \u0026ldquoGiven this exceptional set of circumstances the board is sure effective governance was best served on this occasion with the decisive action to appoint John.

C.banner had been planning to buy a 51% stake in House of Fraser and plough \u0026pound70 million into the ailing retailer.  The new deal appears to mean the scrapping of the previous restructuring plans and a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) under which House of Fraser had agreed with landlords to close half of stores, with 6,000 jobs under threat.  Richard Lim, of Retail Economics, said: \u0026ldquoThis is a hugely ambitious move for Sports Direct. The combination of both businesses will yield some vital cost-saving synergies while it\u0026rsquos likely that some of the struggling House of Fraser sites will be rebranded to Sports Direct. Nevertheless, this is a part of the industry that is under a huge amount of pressure.

Psychologists however have underlined the importance of the Halo Effect, whereby you unconsciously take one aspect of somebody as a proxy for their overall character so when women discover the older man to have seen When Harry Met Sally at least three times, they\u0026rsquore allure becomes immeasurable.  They sense themselves in the presence of a creature who can put his finger on the pulse of modern society as easily as he can the G Spot.  They will believe this man has learned cleverness. He will know implicitly, for example, that women very often say the opposite to what they actually think. And they will know he knows exactly the right time to lie delightfully (eg, \u0026ldquoYes, that dress goes perfectly with those shoes). And love him for it. Sexy or what?  READ MORE:\u0026nbspRed faces found to be more attractive  In a physical sense, men age exceptionally well, particularly if they can avoid steakbakes and afford hair transplants. Yes, cartilage degeneration is unavoidable, and morning knees ache but women see this as attractive, knowing the acher will no longer spend half the week on the five-a-sides pitch. More time to do couply stuff.!  The added bonus of advancing years is that men slow down their lager intake. Thus, dinner party dribbling is diminished. (Dribbling confined to sleep, and that little morning incontinence). Indeed, age and less drink means females can often hear meaningful sentences being constructed.  What age offers, paradoxically, is we men develop an even greater immaturity. The pressures of career pursuit and back-breaking finance having subsided, this frees up the older fella to reclaim his inner (That\u0026rsquoll Be The Day period) David Essex. And now, literally or figuratively, he can wear a leather jacket and silver earring, and spin a girl on the waltzers.  After all, isn\u0026rsquot this all a woman wants? And unattainablilty of course. At 50, men are often broken by failed romance, which makes them completely attainable, but somehow age allows our acting skills to emerge, a patina of confidence, to the point we can suggest the haughty indifference of youth.  There are more reasons why ladies are drawn to us. We know the words and chords to James Taylor\u0026rsquos You\u0026rsquove Got A Friend, we can quote lines from Tennyson and The Inbetweeners and we can salsa. If push comes to shove, we can also do the slosh, (learned while working during student holidays at the United Services Club in Johnstone).  The older man may even have a sports car by this age, which hints of attention-seeking tragedy. But this is in fact a bonus. Women will take such a sad figure to their bosom, for the same reason they love the man who no longer lives with his mum, yet still takes his wooly jumpers to be washed.  Yes, there are some older men who by50 have bought a bike and pulled on lycra. But by the time snow appears that nonsense usually melts.  So for most men who reach half a hundred, how can they not be adorable to women? We have a great countenance and a separate underwear drawer.  We can even laugh at surveys which suggest men are most attractive at 50.

Longer answer: because there is something worth noting in the study published in Science Advances, so step away from the lawnmower for now.\u0026nbsp  On a purely primitive level it is no surprise that men were attracted to younger women.  It\u0026rsquos the law of the jungle, Darwin, survival of the most fertile and all that.  The male of the species is genetically programmed to mate with the female that will give him the best chance of continuing his line.

As any student of anthropology knows, that only goes on today in the wilder reaches of the planet. Like Dundee, say.  Clearly, there is something more complex going on here that makes men more popular the closer they get to 50.  Pity, for instance. Choosing older males could be a selfless act on the part of the women to make men feel better about themselves.  Women do this all the time. Not just with men, but with other women, children, and small animals. No, no, we\u0026rsquoll say, you\u0026rsquore not losing your hair it\u0026rsquos just your forehead that\u0026rsquos receding.

Recent rallies have featured banners from the Western Isles and Shetland. In many cases participation involves considerable disruption: a very early departure, journeying by car, bus and even ferry, and an overnight stay. And many of the marchers are past the first flush of youth.  The main aim of the rallies is to be seen. The Unionist parties assert on a daily basis \u0026ndash presenting no evidence \u0026ndash that there\u0027s no appetite for another independence referendum. Even in the face of the recent rise in support for independence they continue to claim that everybody is happy with the status quo.  There are few opportunities to counteract this widely reported assertion. Political blogs are mostly read by those already committed to one or other camp. By door-knocking (and many participants at rallies including myself also do regular door-knocking) you reach perhaps 50 people in an evening (fewer in tenements) and engage half of these in conversation.  However when 50,000 march through a town cheerfully displaying their hope and optimism about an independent Scotland, many hundreds witness this and realise that the cause of self-government is gathering strength year on year. And when the rally goes unreported on the evening news, they maybe start wondering what else the BBC is hiding from us.  Mary McCabe,  25 Circus Drive, Glasgow.  FOR those of your readers who are Labour Party members, I urge them to use their vote in the forthcoming NEC elections to elect those in favour of electoral reform. If Labour puts PR in its manifesto, we will have a chance to change how this country is governed for ever.  I am sick of seeing our nation being conned on Brexit by Tory extremists and I believe they would never have gained the power they presently hold if we had PR. Labourites worry that a fairer voting system will deny radical proposals being implemented once in office, but in the UK that means extreme right-wing ideas can get through as well. Look at hard Brexit, the poll tax, council house sales, privatisation of public services, and so on.  Labour has spent two-thirds of the past 100 years at Westminster in opposition \u0026ndash electoral reform will remedy that. And we needn\u0026rsquot worry about coalitions \u0026ndash the Liberal Democrats didn\u0026rsquot influence Tory policy in the last Government one jot, as far as I can see. If Labour readers want PR, I advise them to go to tinyurl/labourpr to see a list of NEC candidates who support it.  Pete Gregson,  27 Riversdale Grove, Edinburgh.  AS a newly-arrived Corbynista in your fair land I\u0027m a wee bit disheartened to read so many Daily Mail-atyle anti-Corbyn views being expressed by supposedly left-wing SNP supporters on your Letters Page. Let me remind them that on the day of Jeremy Corbyn\u0027s election to the Labour leadership, Nicola Sturgeon declared: \"That man can\u0027t win an election. The only way to get rid of the Tories is through independence.\" Well, Mr Corbyn has proved his voter appeal and it would be a reckless man who would bet against him doing what Ms Sturgeon declared was beyond him. In light of this I don\u0027t think it\u0027s unreasonable for a life-long Leftie like me to ask my Scottish comrades to stop slagging off Mr Corbyn and just get on the team.  Sean Pigott,  Flat 2/L,  13 Wilson Street, Largs.  BY favouring children from designated \"deprived\" areas the SNP prevents the best qualified studying at a Scottish university. Worse, 65 per cent of applicants from poor families live outwith these areas and don\u0027t qualify. In 1973 I went to Edinburgh University from a Linlithgow council house, a joiner\u0027s son, on a grant.  Linlithgow Academy isn\u0027t, and never was, a deprived area so under this policy I would have missed out, as would my fellow alumni Alex Salmond (middle class, council house) and Kenny MacAskill (private house) who wouldn\u0027t have gained the degrees that launched them to the dizzy heights of nationalist politics.  Come to think of it, maybe it\u0027s not such a bad policy after all...  Allan Sutherland,  1 Willow Row, Stonehaven.  THE news that Edinburgh Conservative Councillor Ashley Graczyk may join the SNP is frankly astonishing (\"Former Tory councillor says that she now believes in independence\", The Herald, August 10).  Regrettable though it is, in Scotland in any election, often the principal determining factor in who we vote for is whether your preferred candidate supports or opposes nationalism. Had Ms Graczyk planned to defect to Labour or the Liberal Democrats, that would have been more understandable than joining the party whose overarching objective is to break up the UK.  If Ms Graczyk is so disenchanted with certain Tory UK policies that she cannot remain in the party and will not join another pro-UK party, it is imperative she resigns her seat. Her constituents voted for a Unionist candidate \u0026ndash any move to the SNP would be an utter betrayal.  Martin Redfern,  Woodcroft Road, Edinburgh.

Here is everything you need to know:  The Perseid meteor shower is caused by debris falling from the tail of Comet Swift-Tuttle when it comes into contact with the Earth\u0026rsquos atmosphere. The comet orbits the Sun every 133 years.  The meteors, mostly no bigger than a grain of sand, burn up as they hit the atmosphere at 58 kilometres (36 miles) per second to produce a shooting stream of light in the sky.  Peak temperatures can reach anywhere from 1,648 to 5,537C (3,000 to 10,000 Fahrenheit) as they speed across the sky.  The meteors are called Perseids because they seem to dart out of the constellation Perseus.  The peak time for Perseid watching will be Sunday night and before dawn on Monday, but the meteors may already be making an appearance.  Dr Robert Massey, from the Royal Astronomical Society, said: \u0026ldquoThe shower will be visible all over the UK, as long as the skies are clear.  \u0026ldquoUnlike a lot of celestial events, meteor showers are easy to watch and no special equipment is needed, although a reclining chair and a blanket make viewing much more comfortable.

Scottish Conservative MSP Peter Chapman this week challenged First Minister Nicola Sturgeon to tell farmers if she is in favour of the restrictions planned for the route and urged her to support overturning the ban.                                                    His comments came as Ms Sturgeon visited Turriff Show, Scotland’s second biggest agricultural event after the Royal Highland Show.                                                    Mr Chapman has written to Transport Scotland to seek clarity after local officials suggested that the bypass would be granted “special road” status, excluding agricultural vehicles.        The issue was highlighted by NFU Scotland during a round table discussion at the New Deer Show last month and farmers are concerned they will have difficulty transporting livestock, particularly those making the journey from Ellon to the other side of the city at Portlethen.Mr Chapman, who is also a farmer, said the situation also raises the question of increased greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural vehicles being forced to travel through the city.He said: “My view is that this road is not a motorway, it is a dual carriageway and therefore tractors should be permitted to travel along the route.“I have written to Transport Scotland, but I have yet to receive a response. I would urge Nicola Sturgeon to speak up on behalf of our local farmers so that common sense can prevail and this ill-thought ban is lifted.”                                                                                                        Local SNP MSP Gillian Martin said that a public consultation regarding the route had been carried out in 2007 although views can still be put to Transport Scotland.She added: “I believe the NFU Scotland did submit to that. It’s unclear whether a call for access to agricultural vehicles was included in their submission at that point. However it has been suggested at the Turriff Show by MSPs present that if individual farmers believe they will be severely disadvantaged by not being able to access the new road and continue to use only the existing road network, that they make that case to Transport Scotland.”                                                                    "},{"url":null,"title":"relief map celebrates bond between scotland and poland","story":"        November 11 this year will be a poignant date for many people here in Scotland.                For not only will it commemorate the centenary of the end of World War One, but it will also mark the centenary of the restoration of Poland’s sovereignty as the Second Polish Republic from the German, Austrian and Russian Empires.                                       \t      \t\tLabour of love...for Keith Burns, project manager from MAPA Scotland, the charity founded to restore the Great Polish Map of Scotland in 2010. Some eight years and \u0026#65533120,000 later, that goal has now been achieved.      \t                                                             The independence celebrations will be marked here in Scotland by Polish people across the country.                                                    And taking centre stage will be the Great Polish Map of Scotland.        In the summers of 1974 to 1979, this lasting legacy was created in the Borders to celebrate the links between Scotland and Poland.Although dating back to before 1576, it was in that year Royal Grants first recorded the relationship – with the King of Poland protecting the Scots “who supply us with all that is necessary”. Our friendship has remained firm ever since.The Great Polish Map of Scotland was mainly the work of a small group of Poles from the Jagiellonian University of Krakow, led by the map’s lead designer, Dr. Kazimierz Trafas.                                                                                                        But its creation was the brainchild of Krakow-born Jan Tomasik, a sergeant in the 1st (Polish) Armoured Division, who was stationed in Galashiels during the war and married a Scottish nurse in 1942 after being treated in the town’s Peel Hospital.He became a successful hotelier in Edinburgh after the war and added Barony Castle in Eddleston to his properties in 1968, where the map was conceived and created.He wanted to show hotel guests the landscape of Scotland and hoped the map would become a tourist magnet.Jan also wanted to show the coastline of the country Polish forces had been responsible for defending.                                                                                                        He is remembered as saying to hotel patrons: “I shall die but I shall leave my map as a gift to the Scottish people to thank them for the hospitality they showed the Poles when it was needed”.After the hotel closed in 1985 and ownership of Barony Castle passed from the Tomasik family, the map fell gradually into disrepair.But in 2010, Mapa Scotland was formed – a group of volunteers who were dedicated to restoring the map to its former gloryThanks to grants from the Heritage Lottery and European Leader Fund, along with fundraising, that goal has now been achieved.And it is hoped it will become both a visitor attraction and an educational resource for many generations to come.                                                                                                        With that in mind, a digital documentation team from Historic Environment Scotland spent five days on site, laser scanning the map to create a 3D model.The team then spent several months, working with Mapa Scotland and the Polish Cultural Festival Association, to create an interactive app highlighting Scotland’s Polish heritage.For Marta Pilarska, digital documentation intern with HES, the project proved to be a learning curve.She said: “I’m Polish and even I was discovering new connections between Poland and Scotland which I had never heard before. “It was a really interesting project to be involved with.“I knew the basics – the soldiers during the war years and that Bonnie Prince Charlie’s mother was Polish.“But I never knew that 40,000 Scots emigrated to Poland in the 1600s and that many towns and areas are still named after Scotland.“One of the quirkier facts we discovered was that a Polish folk dance, dating back to the 1600s, is actually based on a ceilidh dance.“I had no idea about any of that until this project.”Marta joined the HES team at an ideal time too – just one month before work started on the project.She added: “I was in the perfect place at the perfect time – a nice coincidence.“We hope people will enjoy finding out more about the two countries links and that teachers will also visit the map and use the digital app as a learning tool.”The Great Polish Map of Scotland measures some 50 metres by 40 metres and lies in an oval pit surrounded by a 142 metres long perimeter wall. Covering an area of 1590 square metres, it is understood to be the largest three-dimensional physical representation of a country and the largest outdoor relief map in the world.Visit https://sketchfab/HistoricEnvironment Scotland to explore the app.A labour of love for MAPA Scotland volunteers who restored landmarkA business meeting at Barony Castle Hotel in 1996 led Keith Burns to stumble across the Great Polish Map of Scotland, literally – it was so overgrown.But it wasn’t until 1999, when the engineer from East Linton retired, that the discovery started “nagging away” at him.In 2000, Keith and several friends started discussing what they could do to transform the landmark’s fortunes.And in 2010 they formed the charity MAPA Scotland, with the aim of raising enough funds to restore the map.Initially, they thought it would take two years and around £45,000 to rectify – but it proved a much larger undertaking.Keith, who was the project manager, explained: “We seriously understimated how long the work would take and how much it would all cost.“There were two reasons for that: firstly, we didn’t realise how much repair work the foundations of the map would require. They had been built with old tin cans from the hotel and they were crumbling away.“And secondly we had to get one or two specialist contractors to repair the pit wall and relay a lot of underground water supply pipes for the seabed.“The water supply had never worked it now does so we’ve actually upgraded the map.“But all of that took money and, to date, it has cost in excess of £120,000 to restore.”That funding was raised thanks to the Heritage Lottery and European Leader Funds, as well as major contributions from the Barony Castle Hotel, Borders Council, the Polish Consulate and the Scottish Polish Cultural Association, as well as generous public donations.However, 12 MAPA volunteers bore the brunt of the labour.Keith added: “We were all retired and could spend time on the project. It was hard work and involved a fair bit of travel but we’re delighted the map has now finally been restored.”Collection boxes around the site will help MAPA maintain the map for future generations.

While staying there in 1952 the Queen Mother saw Barrogill Castle, purchased it and renamed it the Castle of Mey.She restored it and stayed there regularly from 1955 until her death in 2002. The castle has been open to the public since then and attracts 25,000 visitors a year.After the Vyners sold their property it was run as a hotel from 1967 until 1974. When it then went on the market, the rock band Led Zeppelin looked at it with the aim of turning it into a recording studio although the plan did not come to fruition.Stuart \u0026ldquoWoody Wood from the Bay City Rollers also showed interest as a buyer but it was purchased by a clothes manufacturer before he sold it to the current owner\u0026rsquos family in the mid-1980s.The house \u0026ndash built between 1895 and 1908 \u0026ndash was also said to have been used as the backdrop for a horror film in the 1970s.The property is in need of refurbishment but could be developed as a hotel, as serviced apartments, as a bed-and-breakfast business or as a family home, according to the auctioneers.The 1800 acres of land is suitable \u0026ldquofor sport and grouse shooting, while the six lochs are said to be ideal for brown trout fishing. It also has planning approval for 10 timber lodges which could be built and rented out or leased to a holiday letting company, the auctioneers say.There is also approval for a new-build detached house.\u0026ldquoThe estate enjoys a spectacular setting on a peninsula of the most northerly coastline of the Scottish mainland, overlooking Dunnet Bay to the west and over the Pentland Firth and towards Orkney to the north, the promotional material says.Asked why the property is being sold at auction, the spokeswoman explained it can help maximise the price and \u0026ldquomake a more secure sale.She said: \u0026ldquoWhen the gavel falls the sale is legally binding.The auction of the estate is due to take place at St Vincent Street in Glasgow on August 16.Saturday 11 Aug 2018 11:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116893.jpg","title":"Decision on Premier Inn to be made in September","story":"A DECISION on a budget hotel chain\u0026rsquos bid to build a three-storey complex on vacant land in Thurso is expected to be made next month.The proposal for a Premier Inn was originally criticised by Caithness Chamber of Commerce, but an avalanche of comments online appears to suggest a majority of people in the area would be behind the move.A Highland Council spokeswoman said the application will come up for consideration in September.\u0026ldquoBut there is a lot of outstanding information our planners are awaiting from the agent, she added.The application is to be decided by the council, but notice is taken of objections submitted to the planning authority \u0026ndash both in document form and online.According to the Highland Council\u0026rsquos website, just two documents objecting to the building of the hotel had been submitted to planning by the end of last week and one organisation was backing it.One of the objections is from the chamber of commerce, which claimed that the hotel would have \u0026ldquoa significant negative impact on other businesses and the town centre. Another is from Sandra Gow, of Lybster, who stated that the plan would be detrimental to the \u0026ldquoexisting, privately owned hotels, B\u0026ampBs and self-caterers in the surrounding areas with the potential of closure to many small businesses during the winter months.The chamber, however, has since sought to clarify its stance, stating in a post on the planning department\u0026rsquos website that the original objection was \u0026ldquomade specifically on behalf of our members in the hospitality industry.Of the documented cases submitted to planning, the Caithness Disabled Access Panel has written in support of the hotel plan.It says it accepts the development could impact on other hotels, but adds: \u0026ldquoIt will be the only hotel in the county with completely disabled bedrooms and showers and adhering to the laws on discrimination.The organisation says it has had \u0026ldquonumerous complaints from visitors in the county on the lack of disabled rooms in the area.Since the chamber\u0026rsquos objection was first reported on July 13, social media users have voiced their feelings.Those posting online generally have fallen onto two sides \u0026ndash those in support of local hoteliers, and an opposition accusing them of self-interest.\u0026ldquoWe need more beds.

He will train youth leaders in the area to pass on the skills and techniques used in tossing the caber, tug-of-war and hammer-throwing.He said: \u0026ldquoThere are currently few routes into Highland Games for young people in Scotland. Many will never have experienced the enjoyment of participating in traditional Highland sports.

Campbell of Tayberry.It was the third successive year the horse, shown by Sarah Campbell, has come out on top, and this year, also narrowly lost out on the overall champion of the yard, instead taking the reserve title.Top of the sheep section was J.

Then, despite repeated promises over the last year, ministers failed to reach an agreement that would allow Road Equivalent Tariff to be introduced on external ferry routes serving Orkney and Shetland.“This has left people in Orkney angry and frustrated, not least as we see another tourism season come and go with no sign of the cheaper fares. Worse still, there has been no indication from the Scottish Government what steps it is taking to try to unlock this impasse.“The transport secretary must set out clearly what he has done and plans to do to reach a resolution. He must also reaffirm that any fare reductions will be backdated to the end of June this year as previously promised. The funding has been set aside and must benefit those using these lifeline services.“While Mr Matheson is new in post, he must treat this issue as a priority. He must know that the longer this shambles goes on, the worse it reflects on him and the government.”A Scottish Government spokesperson responded: “We remain committed to delivering reduced ferry fares to the Northern Isles and are currently undertaking further work on the issue. As a first step, we have cut fares on the Aberdeen to Lerwick and Kirkwall to Lerwick services by around 20 per cent for both passengers and cars.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

They were both originally earmarked for closure, but were later given temporary reprieves to see if customer numbers increase.The new report also warned that while \"online banking, Post Office banking and mobile bank vans go some way to providing alternatives\", there were concerns over cyber security, \"the fragile nature of Post Office contracts\", and accessibility of mobile banks.Zoe Laird, HIE\u0026rsquos regional head of communities infrastructure, said: \"Along with the findings of the Scottish Parliament Enquiry into bank closures this [study] will inform how public sector agencies and service providers respond.\"Saturday 11 Aug 2018 11:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The number of property viewings conducted by Galbraith in the Highlands has increased from 167 this time last year to 216 in 2018, a rise of 29 per cent.Increased demand has also seen the average time taken to sell property drop by 21 per cent since last year.Phiddy Robertson, who handles residential sales for Galbraith in Inverness, revealed that the average price of property sold from the firm\u0026rsquos Inverness office during the quarter rose 14.8 per cent from \u0026pound284,992 in the previous quarter to \u0026pound327,21\"The market has picked up significantly since 2015 and in 2018 the first six months show a steady increase in activity,\" she said.\"Demand for well-sited property remains high, with competition leading to more closing dates, most of which achieve significant premiums over the asking price, while there is also greater movement at the top end of the residential market.\"The region continues to be a draw for new residents moving in from outside the area.\"While prices are rising, the Highland area remains less expensive than many other parts of the UK and we see buyers from all over the country making the move here to enjoy a better quality of life,\" Ms Robertson added.The UK government House Price Index for May 2018 noted that the largest regional increase in sales by volume in Scotland was for the Highland region, where volumes increased by 3.9 per cent on the previous year.Currently on the market with Galbraith in Inverness are the following properties:The Galbraith letting department for Inverness also enjoyed a busy quarter.The number of relets agreed increased by 25 per cent compared with the previous quarter. Viewings also increased by five per cent for rental properties and the average time taken to find a tenant for a rental property was just six days.Sarah Hazzard, who manages lettings for Galbraith in Inverness, said: \"We find that both city-centre properties and well-presented cottages in rural areas are snapped up soon after becoming available.\"Landlords are able to increase the rents they charge between tenancies due to the very limited supply of rental property in Inverness-shire and the very strong demand from tenants. We offer a full service which takes the hassle away from the owner and gives them peace of mind that we will manage the whole lettings process, ensure the rent is paid, and find the best possible tenant.\"Saturday 11 Aug 2018 11:40 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

I said you can\u0026rsquot do that \u0026ndash no one has been notified about this. The guys just said they were acting on instructions.\"Hamish Mackenzie of Tarbat Community Council wrote to Highland Council chief executive Steve Barron back in June after receiving apologies in January from local authority community services staff for the lack of warning.They said the equipment was removed on health and safety grounds \u0026ndash a reason given in other similar instances across the region.However Mr Mackenzie says follow-up enquiries for details about land ownership and the legalities of the situation have not been responded to months later.\"The first choice is to get Highland Council to continue to maintain the park in accordance with the original agreement. People certainly feel short-changed by the council.\"People are also aware of things like threats to toilet provision and grass not being mowed. We seem to have an endless series of services being cut, often without any notice.\"He added: \"I understand budget pressures but we will fight when things are taken away without any warning, particularly when we see no justification for it.\"He said the developer of the Knockshortie Estate, Micky Austin was \"staggered\" to learn of the latest development having paid \u0026pound18,000 towards the cost of the playpark, which he had assumed would continue to be maintained and available to locals. He said: \"He is a public spirited person and has developed a nice estate. A play park lets children to get outside and away from gadgets and devices. It\u0026rsquos a great tragedy.\"\u0026nbspQuestion marks though remain for the community over the legality of the move. Many on the estate feel cheated that a facility which helped attract them in the first place has been stripped away \u0026ndash while others say Highland Council has \"played the health and safety card\" without justification.\u0026nbspThey are now left seeking answers and facing the prospect of potentially having to raise thousands to replace the facility.Tain and Easter Ross councillor Derek Loudon said: \"Highland Council officers have ordered a search of the Land Register and the Register of Sasines to clarify ownership. \"This will allow what is a very pro-active community to acquire or lease the land for a lottery or other funding bid. That is a prerequisite for any lottery bid. Let\u0026rsquos hope the community gets a quick turnaround and are able to buy the equipment needed and get it ready for next summer.\"Highland Council was approached for comment but had not responded as we went to press.Saturday 11 Aug 2018 11:40 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The writer and campaigner talks to Janet Christie about misogyny and movies ahead of her Edinburgh International Book Festival appearance                If there’s one word that sums up activist, former actor, director, author, model and singer, Rose McGowan, one of the first to publicly speak out against disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, now accused of sexual assault and harassment by more than 90 women, it’s ‘brave’. Brave, the title of her memoir and manifesto is a call to arms for us all to wake up to the misogyny of the entertainment industry and beyond, her bid to give voice to the victims of sexism and violence and to join her Rose Army of free thinkers striving to make things better and reclaim their lives.             Set for the Edinburgh International Book Festival, McGowan comes on the phone from London, excited about her appearance and keen to spread the word.            Raw and revealing, the book follows McGowan from a childhood growing up in the Children of God cult, to Hollywood and movies, through her relationships with rocker Marilyn Manson and director Robert Rodriguez, through her alleged attack by Weinstein and its aftermath, to her reawakening and speaking out. • READ MORE: Edinburgh Fringe 2018: The shows that were inspired by #MeTooArticulate and intelligent, she responds to questions without equivocation. This Rose is attractive and friendly, yet she has thorns.“It’s about getting braver in our lives by at least 10 per cent – I think that’s a do-able number. We sweep things under the rug because we’re too scared to confront them, but I’m here to tell you if you just go through it, if you look at the wound you can clean it, don’t let it fester, let it heal then you can have a free life. But if you continually cover the sore and pretend it’s not there, it will eat away at you. Bravery isn’t just you being brave out in the world, it’s also with yourself.” In Brave, McGowan says the alleged attack by Weinstein happened in his hotel suite at the 1997 Sundance Film Festival when she was invited there after a screening of her film Going All the Way. McGowan says he later contacted her but she rebuffed his advances and after accepting a payment of $100,000, which she says she took as an acknowledgment of what had taken place, she says she was blacklisted by Weinstein and her career sidelined.            She doesn’t name him in her book, she’s taken back control and won’t have “The Monster’s” name in it – today she calls him “that warthog from hell”. Of his refusal to acknowledge what she says happened, she says simply, “Of course. Which just makes you feel terrible. Every time his lawyers say ‘consensual’ it gives me a body flashback and makes me sick to my stomach, consensual my ass. Like I would ever let that warthog from hell touch me. I wish he would cease to exist. I just wish he was not on the planet anymore, just cease.”McGowan had always spoken about the alleged attack privately, but her battle against Hollywood became public when she discovered the power of Twitter in 2015. After receiving a casting note for an audition for an Adam Sandler film that suggested she wear a form fitting top, push up bra and show some cleavage, she rolled her eyes, posted it on Twitter and went to bed. In the morning she woke up to an internet storm of support, calling out Hollywood’s sexism.Did she think ‘oh brilliant’, or ‘oh no, what have I done?’She laughs, “Kind of both. At first I thought ‘oh no’, then I thought actually that’s brilliant, then I thought ‘oh no’ again. It’s very strange when things go viral and you’re in people’s heads, on their phones, it’s powerful and weird and nice being on the other side of it.”            Silenced in the world of Hollywood, the internet was an arena in which McGowan found her voice. “There was no way to speak out if someone was controlling the media and dominating it. But they can’t control the internet, you have your freedom and your access route.”So when Fox promoted the new X-Men film with an image of Jennifer Lawrence being strangled, she published online an open letter of objection, part of a backlash against the promotion that saw it withdrawn. Writing in her book she says, “I felt an obligation to be a voice for women, people who had suffered from violence.”• READ MORE: Chris McCall: Book Festival’s good-natured debate is antidote to TrumpBut why does McGowan think it’s on her to object, why does she have this strong sense of obligation?             “It sometimes feels like if I don’t, who else is going to? If not me, then who, and why not me? I have a special tool set. I’ve dealt with some of the big baddies and I’ve had a lot of hardship and I’ve battled through them and I’ve survived. And I know you can help others get to the other side. “I’ve always had a thing for justice, I don’t know what it is, I just don’t like seeing misjustice and I certainly don’t like predators.” McGowan spears Hollywood’s misogyny in Brave, pointing out that in 2016 only 23 per cent of speaking roles on screen were female, the majority in horror films. “And we know how they get treated,” she writes. Further, The Directors Guild of America is 96 per cent male, and has been since 1946, which McGowan argues means that for your entire life you have been fed a steady diet of largely male thought and bias about women. “Why is 96 per cent of our information, entertainment and philosophy coming from men?... Film and television is a white male’s playground and through their narrow vision comes the manipulated mirror you’re largely forced to see yourself in. If that’s not malewashing I don’t know what is.”With an online following calling out sexism, when people started talking about harassment by Trump in 2016, McGowan didn’t hesitate to join #whywomendontreport (their sexual assault) debate.  “Trump helped elucidate what sexism and racism are, filled it out in big burning block letters and people went ‘oh, that’s what this is’. Thanks Trump!” She laughs.McGowan says she is speaking up for people like her, the disenfranchised, the hurt, the lost, the lonely, the brave ones who choose to live their lives differently, see things differently and function in a society that doesn’t want them in their own way. “The Rose Army is an army of thought,” she says. “We stand for freedom of spirit and mind. We stand for dissent. We stand for equality and the right to have our lives be unencumbered by proscribed thoughts and traditional mores.” McGowan’s book festival appearance is tied to the theme of identity, and the idea of whether we choose our own identity or have one forced upon us.“I grew up in a really unusual way that led me to have my own identity and not be co-opted,” she says, “and then later as an actor I played multiple identities so identity has always been a really interesting idea for me.”Now 44, it was growing up among the Children of God in rural Tuscany in the Seventies that McGowan first learnt to retreat into her own head, rejecting the rules of the cult. Then later after the family escaped and returned to America, she was bounced among relatives, but found solace in reading, identifying with the persona of each book’s protagonist, a harbinger of her later career. “I used my training from books, absolutely, it’s the only acting training I’ve ever had,” she says. • READ MORE: Edinburgh Fringe 2018: 18 must-see shows picked by The Scotsman’s criticsIf McGowan’s childhood reads as traumatic, she also manages to convey the pleasure she and the pack of cult children took in their Tuscan playground, the rows of marching cypresses and olive groves, despite often being hungry, confused and scared. And it was growing up in a cult that made her alert to the mechanics of control when she arrived in the US, then later in Hollywood.“When I came out of the Children of God everybody was saying how weird it was, how I lived and grew up, and I just thought ‘well, it’s weird how you live, you’re living under the same kind of dictates, you’re just not aware of it’. Everything was the same except bigger and more diluted. I thought ‘if you think you’re free, you’re not’. I was really shocked to find how the same belief systems being utilised, but a more internalised version.”After leaving home at 15, she headed to LA where she was discovered standing on a street corner and offered a part on a film, Paul Shore’s 1992 comedy Encino Man. To the hungry and homeless McGowan, it was a means of survival. “I was a journeyman actor, it was not my love, it was just something I happened to be good at.”Success followed with The Doom Generation and she made her breakthrough in horror flick Scream, then headlined in Going All the Way, Devil in the Flesh and Jawbreaker, yet by the end of the 1990s, according to McGowan because she was being sidelined, the big film roles had dried up. Switching to TV she was a lead in supernatural series Charmed from 2001-6, then in a return to film starred in Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino’s double-feature film Grindhouse in 2007. Parts in Fifty Dead Men Walking, Conan and other films followed then in 2014 she realised an ambition and made her directorial debut with the critically acclaimed short film Dawn, which premiered at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival.Since Dawn McGowan’s time has been taken up with Brave and the creation of a multimedia album, Planet 9, released in January at the same time as the book.“I’m really excited about performing it at my first music festival in Norway in November,” she says. “Planet 9 is kind of the other side of the book, where you go once your brain has been changed. It’s a place I invented, then astronomers found a Planet 9 four years ago – I almost fell off my chair! So I started writing songs for this place, and music. It’s my sanity. My art projects are what has kept me sane, that and my therapy.”McGowan is also writing a second book, on the subject of trust, a behind the scenes story of her life as she set about telling her story, a time in which she says ex-Mossad agents hired by Weinstein to quash misconduct allegations, followed her. “What is trust, how do we do it? I had to learn how to trust, otherwise you’re never going to trust anybody again in your entire life.”Given her experiences, how many people does she trust in her life now?“I trust about seven people,” she says, “and then the rest of the world, I hope,” she laughs.Seven’s quite a lot, I tell her.“Yeah, I’m doing pretty good,” she laughs and reconsiders. “Maybe it’s about three or four.”Fighting the Hollywood machine would deplete your faith in human nature, not to mention your resources. Ask McGowan where she lives now, and she comes straight back with “Nowhere.“I don’t have a house. I sold it to pay legal bills, so now I just travel. I live in hotels, airbnbs, on friends’ couches. Fighting the machine is not cheap, and they’re trying to bankrupt me.” • READ MORE: Edinburgh book festival chief hits out at visa issues facing international writersAnother front in McGowan’s fight against misogyny comes in the shape of the face cream she has developed with her aunt. It sounds unlikely at first, why is she dabbling in face cream? Yet as she talks you see her logic. “I want to disrupt the beauty industry,” she says. This is the woman who back in 2015 cut off her “long, glossy Kardashian-esque hair. I thought I looked more like a blow-up sex doll… I had been turned into the ultimate fantasy f*** toy by the Hollywood machine. I was dying on the inside and embarrassed by what I looked like on the outside.” And shorn of her hair, the real McGowan came out fighting. “And everyone complains about unrealistic beauty standards, but nobody really looks at it from a class point of view. I think it’s deeply classist, that if you don’t want chemicals you have to pay $150. It’s all part of the bigger scheme, of the way they keep women down. You pay them less and charge them more.“I’ve found an amazing laboratory that’s not connected to the expensive companies, to make an amazing product, that’s natural, and unisex.”And because this is McGowan we’re talking about, it’s not just dewy skin she’s after, there’s a bigger goal. “Ten per cent of the income is going to a centre which will provide long-term care for victims of violence, and I want some day to start a spa staffed by domestic violence and human trafficking victims. When people’s finances and self-esteem have been torn apart, they have no idea how to operate in the world but we can set them up so they can train others. So it becomes kind of like a school, that’s the company I’m building,” she says.“I hope to keep changing the world and do good for others. And make great art.” And when she sees the lengths people have gone to to try and shut her up…...“they’re still going,” she says.But she’s still going too...“Yep.”...does she ever feel overwhelmed? “Sometimes I get overwhelmed... a little. But the only way to change things is to lift the blanket and shine a light on the darkness. My goal is to expose Hollywood for what it really is. I have a million more stories I could tell in this book, but I don’t have the energy to document all of the dickery.” She laughs, exasperated, but determined. “In the book I say I’m like a phoenix and with this book, I rose again.”• Rose McGowan with Afua Hirsch is at the Edinburgh International Book Festival on Monday, Baillie Gifford Main Theatre, 3:15pm, £12, (£10).

The economist John Maynard Keynes is often quoted as responding to a challenge over a shifted position by saying, “When the facts change, I change my mind.” There is some debate over whether Keynes ever actually uttered those words – or a variation of them – but regardless of their provenance, they contain a simple wisdom.            No matter how strongly we might hold a belief, when presented with evidence that it is wrong, we must be prepared to change our minds. Otherwise, how can we progress? Scientific discovery would cease, self-examination would become redundant, conmen would have countless barrels of fish to pop off.            In this, the new age of the ideologue, open minds seem more scarce than ever. Across the political spectrum, dogmatism is the in-thing to give ground, even in the face of overwhelming evidence that one is wrong, is unthinkable.The Labour Party is controlled entirely by ideologues. Leader Jeremy Corbyn and those closest to him, whether elected members, special advisers, or party officials, have remained true to beliefs cemented in their teens.Their belief in the efficacy of far-left politics is absolute. Some of those closest to the Leader of the Opposition are communists. As ideologies go, communism is one of the strictest, don’t you think?The Labour Party’s anti-Semitism crisis is an inevitable result of the leader’s ideology. If your lifelong position has been that the “imperialist West” is a force for bad, there is a danger that among your fellow travellers will be some who hold extreme views. Such entanglements have brought Corbyn to where he now stands, leader of a Labour Party that has lost the trust of most of British Jewry.             So rigid is Corbyn’s belief system that he has always been blind to the flaws of those he considers allies. In many instances he has embraced anti-Semites, prizing their opposition to the West over anything else.Prime Minister Theresa May is not, I think, a rigid ideologue. The Conservative Party, however, is being run by right-wing dogmatists. The pro-Brexit members of her parliamentary group hold sway. The PM has no option but to deliver an outcome that she doesn’t believe in but that is the only thing that matters to these colleagues.Last week, former foreign secretary and current unspeakable charlatan Boris Johnson wrote a newspaper column in which he stated that women wearing the burqa looked like letterboxes or bank robbers. It was a horrible example of Johnson thoughtlessly punching down.Regardless of whether Johnson’s words were a deliberate dog whistle to the far right or simply an example of a populist newspaper columnist trying, ineptly, to pep up his latest piece without considering the consequences, the reaction among those who share his pro-Brexit position has been informative.            The Prime Minister and the Conservative Party chairman may both have condemned Johnson’s language (only the latest, let’s not forget, in a line of nasty Johnsonian remarks that includes that time he wrote about “piccaninnies” with “watermelon smiles”) but from Brexiteers there is nothing but support. The real story here, they insist, is that Johnson is standing up for free-speech. And, anyway, he was defending the right to wear the burqa, so who’s the bad guy here?The free speech argument, whether cynically deployed or not, is compelling. Our own rights in this regard depend on the rights of others to say things we might find offensive. But there is also a fairly compelling case that Islamophobia infects the Tory right. If one’s political life has been dominated by the beliefs of an isolationist nature, it’s likely that among one’s comrades will be those whose views are unpalatable.Labour’s anti-Semitism and the Conservatives’ Islamophobia are the twin consequences of ideologues taking control.            The rise of the ideologue has collided with a new tribalism among voters. Referendums on both Scottish independence and membership of the European Union have created deep divisions among voters. Politicians may talk of people coming together but not one of them believes that to be happening.This tribalism means supporters of both Labour and the Conservatives devote much of their time to devising ever more contorted explanations for why their preferred politician isn’t a raging anti-Semite or Islamophobe (or an all forms of racism racist).They organise “twitterstorms” where they agree to switch off the BBC or demand the resignation of this traitor or that heretic, and they grow ever more certain of their righteousness.Last week a former challenger for the position of deputy leader of the SNP won a court’s backing for his assertion that his pro-independence position should be regarded as a “philosophical belief” and duly protected in law.Councillor Christopher McEleny hasn’t done much for those in his party who wish us to believe that theirs is a peculiarly civic nationalism. Rather, he stands now as an example of the nationalist who believes in independence at any cost, the nationalist who’d live in a cave to be free.Those who truly believe in Corbyn or Brexit do so with all of the passion with which McEleny believes in Scottish independence. Their faith cannot be shaken by facts. If anything, any challenge to their beliefs sees them doubling down. Political campaigners begin to identify as persecuted minorities.Ideologues and their devoted followers excuse themselves from difficult debate. Their “computer says no” rigidity means there’s rarely room for nuance and never space to believe a political opponent might be acting in good faith. We’re trapped in a political stand-off between tribes whose faith is unshakeable. The prospect of progress lies wounded in the corner.Someone – perhaps John Maynard Keynes – once said that when the facts changed, he changed his mind.These days, politics is dominated by people who, when the facts change, prefer find a new explanation for why those facts are wrong."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4780918.1533923697!/image/image.jpg","title":"leader comment house of fraser s fate now in mike ashley s hands","story":"        Market forces swept away House of Fraser, a giant of the high street, but Mike Ashley\u0026#8217s controversial Sport Direct empire will now try to put it back on its feet.                House of Fraser has a special place in the hearts of many Scots. It’s where your mum might have taken you shopping on that first big trip to the city centre as a child or the place where you bought your first party dress. It’s not just a shop, it’s part of many people’s lives.            But, as Woolworths discovered, nostalgia doesn’t count for much in terms of hard currency.

READ MORE: House of Fraser: Mike Ashley ‘to keep as many stores open as possible’While rival department store John Lewis moved quickly to create an effective online business, House of Fraser appears to have dawdled, only belatedly realising the extent of the transformation in buying habits.In addition, its 59 department stores contained hundreds of concessions, meaning that its own brand products – which could have been House of Fraser’s “unique selling point” – were overshadowed and overlooked. If ever a high street shop needed a strong reason to persuade people to actually visit the store, it is now. Next month, John Lewis plans to trial having personal stylists in-store and holding evening classes for precisely this reason.  A failure to recognise the need to innovate proved House of Fraser’s downfall, so one thing is certain after Mike Ashley’s Sports Direct bought it out of administration – change is coming. Ashley has talked about turning the chain into the “Harrods of the high street”, an ambitious plan that may test the public’s appetite for luxury. But experts also speculated that some stores could be turned into restaurants, bars, hotels and offices or be divided up into smaller shops.            Staff are likely to be nervous, even if their jobs are saved. In 2016, the Business, Innovation and Skills Committee said it had found evidence of “extremely disturbing” working practices at Sports Direct with staff penalised for taking a break to drink water or being ill and it also reported claims that workers were offered permanent contracts in exchange for sex.However, just as House of Fraser swallowed up stores like Arnotts, Binns and Jenners, Ashley’s business empire has now absorbed it. His task will be to leave the 1900s behind and find a 21st century business model.READ MORE: House of Fraser falls into administration"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4782546.1534003651!/image/image.jpg","title":"oap humiliated by tesco staff for being scottish wants apology not vouchers","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...

Aileen MacKellar, 65, popped into the supermarket to buy a pint of milk and a ready meal but was stopped at the till.            The cashier accused her of being banned from the store and when she asked why, she claims she was told: “Because you’re Scottish”.            It has since emerged another customer with a Scottish accent was escorted from the same store last month, after swearing at staff. Mrs McKeller, who is originally from Greenock, had originally demanded a public apology, saying the incident left her “utterly embarrassed and humiliated”.She has since been offered flowers, chocolates and restaurant vouchers by Tesco. Mrs Mackellar told the Norwich Evening News: “I didn’t want their flowers or their chocolate, I wanted to confront the two women who had humiliated me and ask them why they thought they could make me feel this way.• READ MORE: Scots grandmother ‘humiliated’ in English Tesco after being ‘thrown out for being Scottish’            “They tried to give me vouchers for a restaurant but I didn’t want them.

The manager told me I’d be welcome to go back into the store but I’ll never set foot in there again. I can hardly even go into other stores because I’m looking around at other people, worried that they’ll do something wrong and I’ll get the blame again.”She added: “If I was of an ethnic minority they would’ve had the police banging on their door, but because I’m Scottish no one seemed to care and they didn’t take it as seriously.”\u2028Mrs Mackellar’s daughter Ashleigh Smith, also said in the interview: “As soon as she walked into the meeting with the manager, my mum told him she didn’t want these chocolates or flowers they tried to give her.            “We left in a rush because mum was so upset and they asked me to take the restaurant vouchers for mum in case she was feeling better in the future.

It’s manufacture uses up valuable natural resources but this is a result of human exploitation. This begs the question, why are humans capable of natural behaviour and unnatural behaviour in what seems to be equal measure?  Is it normal and natural to drive cars, fly in ‘planes, build tower blocks, dig for coal, aim to fly to distant planet ? The list is endless. According to the experts, global warming and ice ages have occurred many times and certainly before life as we know it existed.  We are worried about what are threats to our welfare only because it is a seemingly an alien threat . Surely, if we are able to stand outside ourselves, we are now caught up in a “ normal” event. And in our short sighted stupidity we are adding to the dangers. But not causing them.I would venture to suggest that long after life has ceased on  this planet there will still be episodes of change which will also be natural and normal except there won’t be anyone around to grumble, fret or lead campaigns !!\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August. It is part of the Year of Young People activities.\nThe youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.\nYear of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to 26 years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, \u0026#8216What do you enjoy about Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What makes you proud of Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What is Shetland famous for?\u0026#8217.\u0026#8221\n Send any ideas, before Friday 6th July 2018, to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call (01595) 744490 or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.\n\u0026#8220This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People 2018.”\n\n\nAre they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be done\nI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of life or some other pointless title.\nOver the years art has very much lowered its standards significantly to make and justify it becoming more commercially viable\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called \u0026#8216 limited edition rubbish \u0026#8216.\nI would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.\nNo doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and life experience\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230..despite the fact everybody else looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.\nLove the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin (tin shed). Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions (£16?), Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain ( hoped for ) credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself (mainly in graphite but also in pastel and acrylic) doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate  (John Tulloch) and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! (I use the scientific meaning of parasite here).\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists ( or any other activity) when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.David Spence.   I’ll lend you a trowel to apply the “paint” provided that you are prepared to produce it \u0026#8230\u0026#8230.. on stage at Mareel perhaps. After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and if you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rubber duck wins first bergen lerwick leg of shetland race ","story":"Espen Børresen (left) and Morten Offendal celebrate their victory.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another.

A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way.

But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say. Just because he’s the best cyclist in the world does not mean he’s benefiting from a performance-enhancing drug.\n: : : : : : : :\nWith all the buzz of the World Cup an annual competition in southwest London has almost been forgotten about.\nYes, Wimbledon is in full flow once again and the British competitors are as usual struggling to make it into the second week.\nAndy Murray was probably sensible to withdraw, citing that he was not quite ready for five-set matches after his hip operation. There were signs at Queens and Eastbourne, however, that he may be able to scale the heights once more.\nThere is of course a capable replacement in Kyle Edmund, who is seeded having reached the Australian Open semi-finals earlier this year.\nEdmund’s half of the draw looks fairly open, and he could well still be involved come Monday. But of course anything can happen, and by the time you read this he could be gone. Let’s hope not.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 22 ","story":"After being tasked with compiling a feature to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the senior football inter-county, it was a pleasure to speak to several of those with first-hand knowledge of the history of the Milne Cup competition.\nGeordie Hunter goes the furthest back, having made his debut in the 1953 game. On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium) Benjamin Pavard (France), Raphaël Varane (France), Diego Godín (Uruguay), Ivan Strinic (Croatia) Ivan Perisic (Croatia), Luka Modric (Croatia), Jordan Henderson (England), Eden Hazard (Belgium) Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Edinson Cavani (Uruguay).\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed, if anyone could hear what was being said, were on the lengthy side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory.

In other areas customers have been left facing road and ferry journeys of more than 50 miles to get to a bank.\nIn 1989, there were more than 17,800 bank branches estimated to be operating in the UK. By the end of this year that number is expected to fall to fewer than 8000.\nSome projections have suggested it could drop to as low as 600 branches in five years\u0027 time.\nBetween 2015 and 2018, 48 bank closures have taken place or are under way in the HIE area including 22 in the Highlands. Some of these are the last banks in their communities.\nConsultants Indigo House Group said banking facilities need to be understood as core to community infrastructure.\nIt said access to cash remained fundamental to the viability of the small retail businesses that are prominent in rural areas. This is especially true in relation to tourism businesses where the loss of access to cash via local banks could have a detrimental effect on long term prospects.\nAlthough there are potential alternatives, including online or Post Office banking and mobile bank vans, the report warned that these options raised concerns over such issues as cybersecurity, the fragile nature of Post Office contracts and accessibility of mobile banks for less able people. Customers facing a shift from a local branch to a mobile bank also consider this a backward step.\nIn its recommendations, the report calls for a collaborative approach involving Scottish Government, HIE, local councils, community members and delivery partners, including the banks and Post Office.\nIt also wants recognition of the importance of cash to local economies and support over time for a sustainable transition to digitally based economies. This includes the creation of digital inclusion strategies to help businesses benefit fully from online banking.\nThe report also recommended a Post Office banking strategy that would include securing the long-term sustainability of contract Post Offices to support rural economies and infrastructure.\n\nSaturday 11 Aug 2018 11:41 PM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116804.jpg","title":"Beauty spot gets the all clear from SEPA","story":"Gavin Musgrove\n\u0026nbsp\nBadenoch and Strathspey\u0027s most popular bathing spot has been given the all-clear from blue-green algae which can make humans very ill and potentially be fatal to dogs.\nThe Scottish Environment Protection Team attended at Loch Morlich at Glenmore on Tuesday following reports of an outbreak at the beauty spot which is enjoyed by hundreds of thousands of people every year.\nSigns had been erected at key locations around the loch warning visitors of the potential presence of the algae.\nIt is understood that a concerned local vet raised the possibility of the algae being present after a dog took ill showing symptoms of having been in contact with blue algae following a visit to the beauty spot.\nA SEPA spokeswoman said: \"A member of our team went to Loch Morlich on Tuesday to take a sample of the algae and none could be found.

Having beaten Juniors twice already this season \u0026#8211 2-5 and 0-6 \u0026#8211 Jamie MacGregor will have faith that his team can make it a hat-trick of success and book their place in the final.\nIn their last semi-final outing, Mallaig defeated Sleat and Strath 10-8 in an incredible game to secure their place in the GF MacRae Cup Final. The blues, however, will be keen to avoid a repeat of their performance in the final which saw Kyleakin run out 4-1 winners in a disappointing and underwhelming showing by Mallaig.\n\n \u0026#8220Another tough game for us, but it’s the type of games we wanted to be involved in at the start of the season. We now have a great opportunity to make a second cup final this season.\n\u0026#8220The season, in general, has been a learning experience but a very enjoyable one. The lads have picked up a lot quite quickly and we have had some good wins this season especially on our travels. It’s good to be back playing at home especially in such a big game, especially after being away for so long\n\u0026nbsp\nWith four wins from their last five matches in all competitions, and 37 goals scored in the process, Juniors have really hit their stride and will approach their third meeting with Mallaig with great confidence.\nNow just four points point off leaders Sleat and Strath with one game in hand, Phil McCaherty will hope his team can transmit their impressive league form into today\u0026#8217s cup match against the only side who have beaten them domestically this season.\nWhile Juniors\u0026#8217 recent free-scoring display will have given Mallaig some food for thought in their preparations for the match, the Portree side must avoid the lapses in concentration which cost them in their heavy defeats at home against Mallaig in the league and Loch Ness in the Highland Amateur Cup.\n\nIt\u0026#8217s a tough task for us away to Mallaig who have beaten us twice already 5-2 and 6-0. We are going with the same squad (minus Angie MacPherson and Paul MacKinnon) that played GA United in last round, with Nick Flanagan added for goalkeeping duties to free up backup goalie Will Brown to his normal defensive duties. I am hoping that David Potter doesn\u0026#8217t get lost this week!\u0026#8221\n\nIt\u0026#8217s been a fantastic season so far for the Broadford-based side who are the current league leaders, joint top scorers, and have the meanest defence to boot.\nWith an average of 5.2 goals a game in the league, Sleat and Strath have developed a ruthlessness in front of goal and appeared to have a strong belief when they take to the pitch that they can beat any team whether it be at home or away. Their most recent win in which they turned a 3-0 lead at half-time into an emphatic 12-0 victory in last week\u0026#8217s quarter-final tie against much-improved Glenelg is evidence they have the weapons to transform a tight match into a comfortable victory.\nHaving put in impressive defensive displays against both Kyleakin and Portree Juniors in the league, DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s team have proven they can stand firm when required against tough opponents. That said, he will still be mindful of his side\u0026#8217s loss in their last semi-final encounter against Mallaig \u0026#8211 in what has been their only defeat so far this season \u0026#8211  and will be keen to avoid missing out on a second final.\n\n \u0026#8220It\u0026#8217s going to be a battle at our tight pitch. Key to the result will be our ability to defend set plays, which is not our strong point as we are a very small team. If we can keep Gordy (Mccarroll) and Innis (Thompson) quiet we will hopefully cause them problems with our pace.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\nWith Sleat and Strath having burst out of the blocks in the league and new boys Mallaig also making their mark, it is perhaps easy to overlook the fact that Kyleakin is not only very much in contention for the league title but have already won a piece of silverware this season with a convincing victory over Mallaig in the GF MacRae Cup.\nWith 22 goals in their last three matches, which included their 10-2 quarter-final win over Kyle, the reigning league champions know how to win games, and ultimately trophies. As well as being well-deserved, their 4-1 victory in the GF MacRae Cup Final against Mallaig was a superb example of game-management against difficult opponents on a big occasion.\nAlthough Kyleakin have put themselves in a good position to challenge on all fronts, they will have to address their inconsistency this season which has seen them held to draws recently by Glenelg and GA United.\nWith back-to-back matches coming up against Sleat and Strath in the cup, then the league, the reigning champions will look to draw on their past successes in the big games.\nBy Adam Gordon\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/david-mundell.jpg","title":"recruitment highlighted as a priority at first emergency services","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\nRepresentatives of all the emergency services on Skye held their first ever partnership meeting in Broadford last week to discuss how they can support each other.\nPictured (left to right) are Dave Philips from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, Nick Mort from the British Red Cross, Station Manager Mike Colliar from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, Sgt Andrew Shaw from Police Scotland, Neil Urquhart from Skye Mountain Rescue, Inspector Lynda Allan from Police Scotland, Area Service Manager Alan Knox of Scottish Ambulance Service.

That is a nonsense and the British government need to be called out on it. \n\"There is a big responsibility on Taoiseach Leo Vardakar and a responsibility on Michel Barnier and our partners in Europe to stand firm. \n\"The British government need to understand that they can\u0027t simply arrive in Ireland and set out a plan that is so destructive to our interests and expect that there won\u0027t be a mighty reaction to that,\" he said. \n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27423  ","story":"Sinn Féin leaders Mary Lou McDonald and Michelle O\u0026#039Neill.\n Michael McMonagle\n\nSinn Féin leaders will meet the EU\u0027s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier later today to make it clear that the issues of Ireland and the border need to resolved before the next EU summit in October. \nParty President Mary Lou McDonald TD and deputy leader Michelle O\u0027Neill MLA will meet Mr Barnier in Brussels later today at the headquarters of the EU Commission. \nAt today\u0027s meeting, the pair are expected to tell the EU negotiator that the backstop already agreed between the EU and the British government must be maintained and form part of the legal text of the Withdrawal Agreement. \nThat backstop would see the north remain in the customs union and elements of the single market and would avoid the imposition of a hard border on the island of Ireland. \nThe Sinn Féin leaders will also call on Michel Barnier to ensure the issues of the border and Ireland are resolved ahead of the next planned EU summit in October. \nOne way of doing this would be to hold a special EU summit in September to deal specifically with Irish issues, they are expected to tell he chief negotiator. \nToday\u0027s meeting will be the latest in a series of meetings between Sinn Féin and Michel Barnier both in Brussels and Ireland in recent months. \n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27424  ","story":"Mary Lou McDonald TD along with Dáil Health spokesperson Louise O’Reilly TD and Assembly spokesperson on Mental Health Órlaithí Flynn MLA in Dublin today.\n Callum Smyth\n\n“The voices of women must be heard when it comes to healthcare.

It is central to community life and is active across the local community, working collaboratively with other sporting codes and community and civic organisations.\nThere are eight Gaelic Athletic Clubs active within the local council boundaries, with a combined membership reaching into thousands.\nPromotion and use of the Irish Language has been historically strong in the area. The language has become even stronger in the last 30-40 years particularly.\nToday in terms of Irish medium education (IME), four Naíscoileana (preschools) flourish, and there are two gaelscoileanna (primary schools), and another English medium school with IME provision.\nThe demand for IME in South Antrim is growing.\n\nSo, many citizens in South Antrim possess an innate sense of their own Irishness. It really matters to them.\nLike everywhere else in Ireland the rich local heritage and history of townlands, place names, geography, and topography of South Antrim cannot be understood without reference to the Irish language.\nTo take two local examples: Cranfield has its origins in Creamh choill, the woodland of the wild garlic: Farranflugh is the anglicised version of Fearainn Fliuch, otherwise, the boggy or wet ground.\nBilingual signage captures that rich heritage by making it visible and providing an educational reference point for the local community and visitors.\nThe council’s ‘English only’ policy effectively air brushes out access to a heritage we all share regardless of political allegiance.\nThe English language is only a small part of who we are and where we have come from as a community.\nSome in the leadership of both the DUP and UUP have sought to weaponise the Irish language and to demonise those who support its use and visibility.\nThey have prosecuted their own version of a ‘project fear’ which deliberately misrepresents the campaign for Irish language rights as cultural warfare.\nThat type of exclusive and bigoted mind-set goes right to the crux of why the political institutions do not currently exist in Stormont.\nThe DUP wrecked power sharing and partnership in recent years as the culmination of their 20-year campaign opposing the GFA since 1998.\nThose presently in charge of the DUP don’t want to exercise proper power sharing with Sinn Féin and are opposed to a rights-based society. \nThat’s the message which comes from the leadership of the DUP, and as a result, why unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey have now adopted an ‘English only’ policy in an act of abject disrespect to their Irish neighbours.\nPolitical unionism in South Antrim has form in the history of exclusion.\nNever once in the history of local government in Antrim and Newtownabbey have unionists shared the position of Mayor or deputy mayor with a Sinn Féin councillor.\nIn the 2017 Westminster general election 18.1% of the electorate voted for Sinn Féin in South Antrim.\nThat section of the electorate is synonymous, albeit not exclusively, with those citizens who consider themselves to be Irish.\nAn additional 12.9% voted for other non-unionist political parties.\nImportantly some citizens who vote for the unionist parties consider themselves to be both Irish and British. Unionism is not a culturally homogeneous bloc.\nSo when the unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey vote to adopt an ‘English only’ policy that tells a substantial cross section of local rate payers that they are unequal and do not deserve to be treated with parity of esteem and respect.\nThe only conclusion is that those in charge of the local unionist parties are not committed to a shared future and inclusion, and instead want to make South Antrim a cold house for the Irish identity.\nAnd, that mind-set is a throwback to the days of the old apartheid, orange state in the north of Ireland.\nThe ‘English only’ policy in Antrim and Newtownabbey borough council is now the subject of a judicial review.\nLocal Irish language activists and rate payers have begun a campaign to overturn this disgraceful policy.\nI have been encouraging local people to register their objections with the Chief Executive.\n\nIf there is ever to be a shared and united future in the north that must also apply within Antrim and Newtownabbey council politically, culturally and in respect of every aspect of community and civic life.\nLocal councillors and council officers have an obligation to ensure the operation of this council is conducted in a legally compliant, fair, equal, inclusive, transparent and democratic matter.\nThey should be actively promoting and ensuring adherence to the principles of parity of esteem, mutual respect, equality, and anti-sectarianism enshrined in the GFA.\nThat is what the republican and nationalist electorate and other progressives and fair-minded people in South Antrim expect from those charged with administering local government.\nCitizens in Antrim and Newtownabbey pay high rates with the expectation of good quality council services.\nThey do not pay high rates to be treated with such abject disrespect.\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27429  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna\n\nSpeakers at today\u0026#039s march urged attendees to make their way to Belfast over the next week to celebrate Belfast Pride, who will host Ireland\u0026#039s biggest LGBT festival, with the annual parade held on Pride Day which is celebrated on August 4th.\nSinn Féin were among the thousand strong crowd of people who marched at the first ever Transgender Pride parade that took place in Dublin this afternoon.\n The march started outside Liberty Hall and made its way to Fairview Park, where Declan Flynn was murdered by a gang of five so-called “queer-bashing” teenagers in the early hours of September 10th, 1982.\nThe suspended sentences for his attackers triggered a long march towards equality in Irish society.

They want their elected representatives to engage in their public office duties with integrity and honesty. \n“What Ian Paisley did in accepting two lavish holidays to Sri Lanka and then lobbying on behalf of the Sri Lankan regime to thwart a UN investigation into serious human rights breaches and mass murder, isn\u0027t carrying out your duties with integrity.”\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a05.jpg","title":"65379  ","story":"    \nTHE 2018 MCE Insurance Ulster Grand Prix is less than a month away and anticipation is certainly building. \nFollowing a TT that saw Peter Hickman demolish the outright lap record to win a thrilling Senior TT finale ahead of Dean Harrison, the 7.4011 miles of Dundrod tarmac is the next meeting ground for these road-racing heavyweights. \nPeter, UGP Man of the Meeting in 2017 and now the world\u0027s fastest rider, secured podium finishes in four classes, three of which were as race winner.\nUlster Grand Prix Bike Week runs from August 5-11 and is gearing up to be the perfect climax to the international road-racing season.\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a04f1.jpg","title":"65380  ","story":"    \nANTRIM boxer Conor Cooke believes he has the world in his hands after he left his first professional opponent sprawled at his feet following a spectacular second round KO.\nBut at 31 he knows he has to act fast.

We can\u0027t forget their big sister Kaia who has kept us all smiling.\nThe family\u0027s agony began on June 8 last year when Caden, a pupil at St Brigid\u0027s Primary School, was diagnosed with aplastic anemia, a rare blood disease where bone marrow fails to produce sufficient blood cells.\nSabrina, who has taken time off from her job at Limavady Grammar School to care for Caden, recalled: Bruises started appearing all over his body and Caden was tired, so we knew something wasn\u0027t right.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ?

They know the Cadet movement is as much committed to building confidence and friendships as it is to building skills.\n\n“Our Banbridge Cadets embraced every opportunity brought to them at this year’s Summer Camp, held at Strensall, near York, with great good humour and seemingly boundless energy. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“Now, following a Summer packed with challenge and achievement, they’ll be turning their attention to their annual new membership campaign and I am sure they will all become highly persuasive recruiters as they invite local teenagers to come along and see what Cadet life has to offer.”\n\nIf you would like to find out more about what membership of the Army, Sea or Air Cadets can offer you or your children, contact 0800 730 730 or visit www.reservesandcadetsni.org.uk.

To cater for the individual needs of the every member of the community, the team can also provide guidance on the bank’s Post Office service, its telephone banking system and its Bank on Wheels.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThroughout the year Richard will be organising a series of events open to the public as well as delivering presentations for schools and community organisations about the importance of staying safe and secure when banking, good practice for identifying fraud and scams, using the Ulster Bank Anytime Banking app and transitioning from traditional to digital banking services.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nCommunity Banker Richard Gill explained: “I’m really looking forward to engaging with people right across Co. Down and being an active part of this community.\n\n“Being financially fit, aware of how to keep your money safe and secure, and feeling confident in using digital technologies are important skills, and the events I’m planning to run will reflect that.”\n\nRichard will host regular drop-in clinics in Rathfriland and Dromore and on call to help customers Monday to Friday, between 9am and 5pm.

Hayley was forced to medically retire before her 40th birthday.\n\n\"Everything was put down to post-natal depression,\" she said. \n\n\"Within a year I was suicidal and eventually the diagnosis changed to chronic depression.\n\n\"I did everything I could to try and get better but nothing worked.\n\n\"How many others are there like me?\"\n\nHayley complained of being exhausted all the time and eventually began falling asleep behind the wheel of her car.\n\n\"I would just nod off and have these really vivid dreams and when I woke up I was in the car,\" she recalled.\n\n\"I would arrive places and have no memory of how I got there - it was terrifying.\" \n\nHayley also became extremely paranoid which took its toll in work and at home.\n\n\"I second guessed everything because I believed everyone was out to get me,\" she said.\n\n\"I even thought I was being bullied in work.\n\n\"My family life suffered too and my children, especially the younger two, have certainly not had the best of me.\" \n\nBy 2010, as her health continued to deteriorate, Hayley began losing confidence in her ability to do her job and took an entire year off.\n\n\"I got to the point where I felt it was safer for everyone if I just wasn\u0027t there,\" she said.\n\nThe former clerk, who had given birth twice during her five years of study, transferred from ICU and began district nursing closer to home.\n\nHowever her symptoms worsened and she became overwhelmed by daytime sleepiness. \n\n\"Driving even short distances became a serious problem,\" she said.\n\n\"I would need to pull over two miles into the journey and nap for 20 minutes. \n\n\"I was losing things that eventually turned up in the freezer, including bank cards - it wasn\u0027t normal.\" \n\nThe distraught medic, who was struggling to breathe in her sleep, was left devastated when the results of overnight respiratory tests in 2014 failed to shed any light on the cause of her misery.\n\n\"I cried when they said everything was fine because I knew it wasn\u0027t and so did my husband,\" she said. \n\nIt was then that a consultant began to probe her about her \"crazy\" dream activity. \n\n\"I talked about my night terrors and how vivid they are. \n\n\"I told him about the black hand that strangles me in my sleep,\" she said.\n\n\"The hand, it\u0027s wrapped in a black leather glove, grabs my throat and squeezes until I can\u0027t breathe anymore.\"\n\nThe consultant recommended testing for narcolepsy and Hayley made arrangements to see a specialist in England.\n\nIt was then that she was diagnosed with the chronic sleep disorder.\n\nBut it was only after reading the harrowing story of a 23-year-old nursery assistant in England that Hayley realised there could be a link between the vaccine and the incurable sleep condition.\n\n\"I read the heartbreaking story about Katie Clack and how she struggled to deal with the terrible effects of narcolepsy,\" she explained.\n\n\"She ended up taking her own life but detailed her experience of trying to deal with the catastrophic side effects of the vaccine in a suicide note and I realised her symptoms were my symptoms.\" \n\nShe contacted the Southern Health and Social Care Trust which confirmed the vaccine she was given in 2009 contained Pandemrix. \n\n\"I cried and then I became very angry,\" she recalled. \n\n\"I try so hard not to be bitter, but it\u0027s difficult because I have lost everything. \n\n\"I\u0027m not the person I want to be.\"\n\nHayley said the toughest part of her arduous journey has been trying to get the Department of Health to recognise the link between her life-shattering illness and the flu jab.\n\n\"It has been a nightmare, but my medical notes are crystal clear,\" she said.\n\n\"I was not ill before I was given this vaccine.\"\n\nThe now permanently disabled mum, who even requires supervision to have a bath, said she feels \"betrayed\" by the health service.\n\n\"It wasn\u0027t my decision to take it, I was told it was part of the job,\" she said.\n\n\"But what really galls me is that no one ever outlined the risks, which I believe were well known, and no one will take responsibility.\n\n\"I have been completely abandoned.\"\n\nHayley, who continues to fund her own travel to England twice a year to see a specialist, said that the absence of a devolved government has compounded her ordeal.\n\n\"I just want recognition, but honesty is a rare thing,\" she added. \n\n\"Many questions need to be answered but not much can be done without a government in place.\n\n\"I know I was a good nurse, but where is my NHS now? Where is my government?\"\n\nThe Southern Trust and Department of Health said they would not comment on individual cases.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"75m rooftop running track plan for old belfast","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

There will also be shops and food and drink options on the site, which has been renamed \u0027The Sixth\u0027 in a reference to Belfast\u0027s  evening edition, \"the sixth late Tele\".\n\nWork is due to begin by the end of the year if the plans get the go-ahead.\n\nStephen Surphlis of Bel Tel LLP said: \"Offices and workspace are evolving and UK and international companies are looking to Belfast and the wealth of talent we have on tap from our universities and within our professional, creative and technology sectors.\n\n\"These firms are placing a premium on employee satisfaction and are seeking working environments that facilitate team interaction, innovation and creativity. \n\n\"Our plans for The Sixth emphasise quality, heritage-led design that makes a contribution to both user wellbeing, and the fabric of our city.\"\n\nArchitecture firm Allford Hall Monaghan Morris (AHMM), winner of the 2015 RIBA Stirling Prize for its work on Burntwood School in London, has been enlisted to work on the scheme.\n\nPaul Monaghan, founding director of AHMM, said: \"The Sixth is a bold project, focused on the experience of its users and mindful of the site\u0027s landmark status and importance as part of Belfast\u0027s built heritage. We have taken cues from the surrounding buildings and the city\u0027s lost Victorian arcades, and will restore features removed or lost from the original listed building.\n\n\"For example, we\u0027re planning to reinstate the building\u0027s main access onto Royal Avenue and reintroduce dormer windows removed from the original roofline.\n\n\"New features such as the roof-top running track, roof-top terraces and break-out spaces complement the building\u0027s focus on the user.\n\n\"A new public atrium space serves as walkway through the building, which alongside a range of ground floor retail and food and beverage offers will enliven the street level space around Royal Avenue and Donegall Street.\n\n\"The Sixth will contribute to the rapid regeneration of the area and with its close proximity to Ulster University, it will be at the centre of an emerging creative district serving the education, culture, media and technology sectors.\"\n\nCouncillor Aileen Graham, deputy chair of Belfast City Council\u0027s City growth and regeneration committee, said: \"The partnership is pleased to have submitted its full planning application for The Sixth. \n\n\"We\u0027ve made a commitment in the Belfast Agenda to growing our city\u0027s economy and positioning the city to compete internationally. Quality, innovative workspaces like The Sixth will attract the high-value jobs necessary to grow our economy and help our people reach their full potential. \n\n\"Not only will The Sixth boost the city centre\u0027s vibrancy as part of an emerging creative district, it\u0027s going to breathe new life into one of Belfast\u0027s most loved and iconic buildings.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"celtic fan sorry for airport confrontation with novo","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

However, in a second clip, taken outside the airport, Novo is seen approaching the man and asking him why he “disrespected” him, saying he had done nothing to deserve the abuse and that he “was not scared of him”.\n\nLast night the Celtic fan said he wanted to apologise unreservedly to Novo for his “indefensible behaviour”. He said: “I had been over to watch football and had returned on the same day and I was the worse for drink. That is not an excuse but it is true. I’ve let myself down.\n\n“Since the incident went viral, I’ve had an insight into the effects of abusive behaviour.

It\u0027s still unclear what the status of the CVA is following the takeover.\n\nWhen asked for clarity on the status of its anchor tenant, Victoria Square declined to comment, stating that it does not comment on individual brands within the centre.\n\nThere is also uncertainty for people left holding gift vouchers, with staff in Belfast informing some customers yesterday that they would not be accepting them \"until further notice\".\n\nShoppers were quick to air their frustration on social media, but some said they had been able to redeem their vouchers online.\n\nJohn French, chief executive of The Consumer Council, said: \"If a new company buys over the business, it will be at the new company\u0027s discretion whether to honour gift cards or vouchers.\n\n\"If you have a House of Fraser gift card/voucher, you might like to check with the person who gave you the gift card or voucher to see if it was purchased using a credit or Visa card.\n\n\"Such purchases have additional protection and a full refund may be provided by the card issuer.\"\n\nMike Ashley had been in competition with the owner of Edinburgh Woollen Mill, Philip Day, to buy out the chain.\n\nSources said he could soon begin the process of turning some House of Fraser stores into Sports Direct outlets and rebrand others under his upmarket Flannels outlet.\n\nHe described the transaction as a \"massive step forward\" for his firm, adding: \"This will benefit both House of Fraser and Flannels in the luxury sector.\n\n\"We will do our best to keep as many stores open as possible. It is vital that we restore the right level of ongoing relationships with the luxury brands.\n\n\"Our deal was conservative, consistent and simple.\n\n\"My ambition is to transform House of Fraser into Harrods of the High Street.\"\n\nLike so many retail names, House of Fraser has fallen victim to the rise in discount stores and the shift in consumer habits from physical purchase to online shopping.\n\nAodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, believes House of Fraser\u0027s problems should be a warning for action to prevent the demise of the high street.\n\nHe said: \"This is a critical period for the retail industry, caused by a perfect storm of pressures including rising costs and new technology changing how people shop.\n\n\"How much more news like this will it take before we have action to support retailers by cutting the inequitable and antiquated business rates bill?\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland chippies take carryouts to new heights","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Mallon of the Dolphin Takeaway in Dungannon will undertake The Kilimanjaro Chippy Challenge, serving up delights for hungry climbers at 15,255ft.\n\nArriving in Tanzania on September 1, the duo will climb the tallest free-standing mountain in the world, before setting up the highest pop-up fish and chip shop at the Barafu Camp.\n\nThey\u0027re aiming to raise much-needed funds for the Fishermen\u0027s Mission charity as a thank you to the trawler crews who keep their businesses supplied with the sea\u0027s bounty. \n\nAlan said he was proud to support the \"worthy\" charity, which helps those working in the fishing trade, the most dangerous occupation in the UK.\n\nHe said: \"Malachy and I have seen first-hand the great work the Fishermen\u0027s Mission carries out to support the fishermen who put their lives on the line to supply us with product. \n\n\"So I suppose the idea was born out of the need to raise awareness and much-needed funds for them. \n\n\"Malachy suggested the Kilimanjaro idea to me last year at the National Federation of Fish Friers Annual Ball and I instantly agreed to take up the challenge for this worthy cause. \n\n\"All of the donations we can get will make such a difference to those facing hardship.\"\n\nThe Kilimanjaro Chippy Challenge is the latest charity effort for Malachy, after he raised £9,000 by cycling 1,500 miles around the UK, visiting the winners of the Fish and Chip awards 2017.\n\nThe pair will climb for eight consecutive days, before cooking fish and chips and a few other favourites for the local orphanage before their record attempt. \n\nA percentage of the funds raised will be donated to the Fortune Kids and Education Foundation Orphanage Centre, which was opened in February 2016 and cares for children under five. \n\nWith the trip to Africa looming next month, Alan said they had stepped up their preparations.\n\n\"Although I live right in the heart of the Mournes, I had no previous climbing experience, but that has changed since last October,\" he said.\n\n\"I have been out trekking the mountains at least once a week for the last 10 months and this last month we have upped our training, sometimes covering five peaks and a distance of 25km a day.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland traffic alerts belfast road reopens after gas explosion","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC

Zeplin, Blaise, Maverick, Ace and Jupiter on the other hand, were some of the less common names given to baby boys in 2017.\n\nIn terms of girls’ names, Grace has once again taken second place in the top 10, whilst Olivia comes a close third. Roise climbed the greatest number of places to join the top 100 names for girls, moving from rank 151 in 2016 to rank 90 in 2017. Isla and Charlotte both joined the girl’s top 10 for the first time in 2017.\n\nCompared with boys, a greater number of girls’ names have held the top spot since the reporting of first names began in 1997.  Some of the less common names given to baby girls in 2017 were Lady, Divine, Rio, Star and Vogue.\n\nAlmost 1,000 new baby names were registered in 2017 that had not been registered since the reporting of baby names began in 1997. Blockbuster movies, popular television series, current celebrities and memorable places continue to appear to be influencing factors for some parents.\n\nOf those registrations containing details of the father, almost 500 boys were given their fathers’ name as a first or additional name.  However fewer than 100 girls were given their mothers’ name.\n\nMore generally, the statistics published today highlight that the popularity of baby names in 2017 (both boys and girls) varied, for example, by District Council, age of mother, country of birth of mother and month of registration.\n\nTop 10 baby names in Northern Ireland, 2017\n\n\nBoys:\n\n\nJames  – 243 Babies\n\nJack  – 226 Babies\n\nNoah  –  189 Babies\n\nCharlie  – 185 Babies\n\nJacob  – 180 Babies\n\nHarry  – 169 Babies\n\nThomas  – 158 Babies\n\nDaniel  – 147 Babies\n\nOliver  – 143 Babies\n\nLogan  – 125 Babies\n\nGirls:\n\nEmily  – 216 Babies\n\nGrace – 202 Babies\n\nOlivia  – 179 Babies\n\nIsla  – 153 Babies\n\nAnna  – 142 Babies\n\nSophie  – 132 Babies\n\nElla  – 128 Babies\n\nAmelia  – 127 Babies\n\nCharlotte  – 124 Babies\n\nSophia  – 121 Babies\n"},{"url":null,"title":"temporary morgues planned for popes visit to ireland","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

But outbreaks have occurred at Muslim, Christian and Hindu religious events, at sports events, and at large-scale open air festivals in the past. \n\n\"When they occur, they most commonly involve vaccine preventable diseases such as measles, influenza, mumps and hepatitis. \n\n\"Other reported outbreaks are mainly of gastrointestinal infections caused by a number of different pathogens,\" Dr O\u0027Riordan said. \n\n\"Given the nature of this historic papal visit, a large number of young children and elderly visitors are expected to attend the final mass, including many international visitors. \n\n\"In the current context of ongoing measles spread in Europe, it is highly advisable that all attendants, especially young children, ensure that they are up to date with their vaccinations,\" Dr O\u0027Riordan added.\n\nAccording to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the measles outbreak is continuing across Europe, with more than 30 deaths reported in 2018. \n\nThe Papal visit is expected to attract 15,000 overseas visitors and the final mass will draw a crowd of around 500,000 people. \n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) defines a mass gathering as \"a planned or spontaneous event where the number of people attending is sufficient to strain the planning and response resources of the community, state or nation hosting the event\". \n\nDr Jack Lambert, specialist in infectious diseases at the Mater Hospital, Dublin, said the reality is people risk contracting diseases during mass gatherings.\n\n\"There are real outbreaks, as with the Hajj in Saudi Arabia in the past… but most of the population in Ireland are protected against diseases like measles,\" Dr Lambert said. \"But, in saying that, if one person with measles is walking around 15,000 people and coughs, some individuals might get it.\" \n\nHe cautioned, however, that while infectious disease spread is not impossible during the Papal visit, it is \"highly unlikely\" and the risk is \"minimal\". \n\nPope Francis will attend the \u0027Festival of Families\u0027 in Croke Park on August 25 and a final mass in Phoenix Park on August 26. A significant policing plan has been put in place, along with major traffic diversions.\n\nIrish Rail will provide capacity for up to 250,000 journeys for those travelling to the Papal Mass. Extra bus and rail services will be provided by Translink for people travelling from Northern Ireland to Dublin for the visit.\n\nBuses will be run across both days by Translink, with additional services from Belfast, Banbridge, Newry and Londonderry for the Saturday. \n\nOn the Sunday, as well as the destinations listed, additional services will run from Larne, Dungannon, Downpatrick, Limavady, Dungiven, Magherafelt and Newtownards. Additional rail services will also run across both days.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"more than 100 seats have switched from leave to remain since","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

These included 97 English seats, 14 in Wales and one in Scotland.\n\nUnder the Focaldata model, 341 constituencies now have a Remain majority, up from 229 in 2016.\n\nThe analysis, conducted for the Best for Britain campaign for a second referendum and the Hope Not Hate campaign against racism, puts Remain on 53% support, against 47% backing Leave.\n\nLiberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable, who spoke at a rally of People’s Vote supporters in Bristol on Saturday, said: “Whether someone voted to leave or stay in the EU in 2016, nearly everyone is disillusioned by the mess the Conservatives have made of Brexit.\n\n“This research is yet more compelling evidence that the British people must be given the final say on any – or no – Brexit deal. The shallow argument against giving the people their say diminishes towards nothingness with every passing day.”\n\nSir Vince told the Bristol rally that opponents of Brexit must work together “as a team” across party divides in the drive for a second EU referendum.\n\nThe Lib Dem leader said it was clear the “centre of gravity” on Brexit is shifting in favour of a national poll on the final deal.\n\n\nPoliticians from all four major UK-wide parties - \n@vincecable\n, \n@sarahwollaston\n, \n@SDoughtyMP\n and \n@MollyMEP\n - standing together making the case for a \n#PeoplesVote\n. Country before party. \npic.twitter/NNUFY1VuPg\n\n— Francis Grove-White (@f_grovewhite) \nAugust 11, 2018\n\n\n\n\nSir Vince told the rally that since the 52%-48% victory for Leave in 2016, “the situation has changed, the facts have changed”.\n\n“We were all told the British Government was going to save vast amounts of money,” he said. “We now know that’s not the case: there’s the £40 billion divorce settlement, the economy’s slowing down, there’s less money for the NHS.\n\n“We were told it was simple – it’s actually proving unbelievably complicated.\n\n“Another thing that’s happened in the last two years is Trump. The whole premise of Britain embarking on some buccaneering free trading adventure around the world as a country independent of the EU has been completely negated by Trump’s protectionist agenda.

Keep fighting, keep campaigning and we will win at the end of this.”\n\nHe was joined by Conservative MP for Totnes Sarah Wollaston, who said: “To proceed with Brexit without a People’s Vote would be like a surgeon carrying out an amputation having sought their patient’s consent two years beforehand without either of them knowing whether they were going to lose a few toes or their whole leg.\n\n“Informed consent to Brexit can only happen once people know the final deal – if any – and have clear information about the risks as well as any benefits.”\n\n\nTo proceed with \n#Brexit\n without a \n#PeoplesVote\n would be like a surgeon carrying out an amputation having sought their patient’s consent 2 years beforehand without either of them knowing whether they were going to lose a few toes or their whole leg.\n— Sarah Wollaston MP (@sarahwollaston) \nAugust 11, 2018\n\n\n\n\nPro-Brexit Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg played down the significance of polls showing a shift of opinion to Remain.\n\n“Most of the polls said people would vote to remain in the EU in 2016, but when people got to the ballot booth they voted to leave,” he told Sky News.\n\n“The votes that matter are the votes cast in genuine elections. Opinion polls come up with a whole range of answers and they differ from day to day, but elections themselves are authoritative.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"pictured us baseball streaker from northern ireland reports","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

The area has been refurbished with a modern new monochrome-themed interior complete with beautiful Amelia Earhart artwork as a tribute to the famous first female aviator to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean. As well as comfortable new seating and tables, free internet access and free view television entertainment, access to complimentary refreshments and a serene view of the beautiful hills of Donegal.\n\nAirport Manager, Charlene Shongo, expressed her delight at the re-opening event: “We are absolutely thrilled that the Amelia Earhart Lounge has been restored, providing an additional space for our passengers to relax. The lounge is ideal for business and leisure customers seeking a quiet space and a little luxury in advance of their flight.\n\n“Access to the lounge is just £10pp and can be booked online on our website and includes complimentary tea/coffee and soft drink, newspapers and magazines and much, much more to enhance the overall airport experience.

He has also managed ‘pacers’ since the 2013 Walled City Marathon 2013 (organised to coincide with ‘City of Culture’ year and the first marathon held in Derry for almost 30 years).\n\n“On race day I will be managing a team of 12 ‘pacers’ said Paddy. “Indeed, our pacing team are experienced runners tasked with completing the course in a specific time – at 15-minute intervals between 1hr 30 and 2hrs 30 for this year’s Waterside Half Marathon.\n\n“Holding an even or steady pace throughout a race – as well as combating early adrenaline-fuelled enthusiasm by runners for a fast start – is just one part of the job” says Paddy.\n\n“The pacers are also personal motivators during the race itself. They will help runners along with shouts of encouragement and regular progress updates – and really can make the difference between a disappointing finish to a race and a resounding success.\n\n“Most marathons and half marathons have pacers nowadays” said Paddy. “And they are proving very popular! The Council and organisers of this year’s half marathon are keen to do what they can to improve the experience for runners. Indeed, last year’s participants couldn’t praise the pacers enough for the assistance they provided in helping them to achieve their personal bests (PBs).\n\n“The runners also paid tribute to ‘the craic’ they had with the pacers and for adding so much to the camaraderie of the race itself.”\n\nPaddy says that the pacers in this year’s Waterside Half Marathon will help people to run as evenly as possible or ‘hold an even mile pace’ as he calls it. “If your goal is to finish this year’s half marathon in 2 hours, running with a 2-hour pacer will help you to maintain an average pace of 9 minutes 9 seconds per mile” he said.\n\n“I can’t stress enough how important it is to have pacers at a race. We’re therefore looking forward again this year to help runners get their speed right.\n\n“Following a pacer is also one less thing to worry about – and can really take the pressure off a runner” Paddy says. “On race day there is a lot to think about – from getting there on time to managing hydration or fuel intake during the race. Therefore, runners have enough to be thinking about without also worrying about their pace!”\n\n“Following a pacer will allow you to get your head down, focus on the running and be guided to the finish line in your target time” said Paddy.\n\n“Pacing yourself sensibly during the course of the race – especially amid the excitement and adrenaline of the start – is key to ensuring that it is less of a struggle, particularly for a first-time or beginner” he said. “That’s not to say that it won’t still be a physical challenge – it will – but pacing yourself will help prevent people from struggling or having to stop.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push(function () {            var mapMpu = googletag.sizeMapping()                .addSize([100, 100], [[320, 50], [300, 250]])                .addSize([980, 200], [[300, 250]])                .build()            slot = googletag.defineSlot(\u0027/29764278/derrynow_article_mpu\u0027, [1, 1], \u0027div-gpt-mid-article\u0027)                .defineSizeMapping(mapMpu)                                                            .setTargeting(\u0027section\u0027, \u0027news\u0027)                                            .setTargeting(\u0027page\u0027, \u0027article\u0027)                                            .setTargeting(\u0027id\u0027, \u0027241829\u0027)                                                    .addService(googletag.pubads())            googletag.display(\u0027div-gpt-mid-article\u0027)            googletag.pubads().refresh([slot])        })    \n\n\n\n“The pacers and the group of runners following the pacer will also offer motivation – giving you something to cling on to or spur you on if you’re struggling to keep up – as they are all in the same boat and will be trying to achieve the same goal. This creates a camaraderie that just can’t be matched by running on your own” Paddy said.\n\n“People also ask ‘How do I pick the right half marathon pacer?’ Choosing which pacer to follow will depend a lot on your training. I would therefore recommend you set a realistic target time, particularly if this is your first half marathon.\n\n“I’d also advise beginners to err on the side of caution. If you want to have a positive experience, don’t set a goal that’s over-stretching yourself. Set a target time that’s challenging but achievable” he said.\n\n\nMeet the pacers\n\n\nDuring this year’s Waterside Half Marathon Paddy will manage 12 pacers in total – 3 pacers for 1hr 30 (Jason Scott, Rodney Agnew and Andy Gray), 2 for 1hr 45 (Darren Madden and Gary Moore), 3 for 2hrs (Gregory O’Brien, Shaun McLaughlin and Paddy McLaughlin), 2 for 2hrs 15 (Stuart Campbell and Andrea Cairns) and 2 for 2hrs 30 (Helena Doran and Claire Martin).\n\nPaddy explains the reason that there are 3 pacers (instead of two) for the 1hr 30 and 2hr finish times is because they’re the most popular in terms of runners who are hoping to achieve a target or beat their personal best (PB).\n\n“The 1hr 30 or ‘90-minute’ finish time is a big hurdle that a lot of runners want to get over.” he said. “The same can also be said of other runners who want to break the 2hr mark.\n\n“We therefore have 3 pacers running in 1hr 30 and 2hr finish times. During the course of the race one of the pacers may drop back a little from the pack to spur on runners who are struggling. Of the two who are left – particularly when it comes to the final stages of the race – one may decide to guide a group of runners to the finish line who are definitely feeling ok and really want to go ‘flat out’ to beat their PB – while the last / remaining pacer will stay with the original group of runners” said Paddy.\n\n“We really want to see as many runners as possible achieve their goals – and it is so rewarding to see them at the finish line having done just that” he said.\n\n“So if you\u0027re planning to take part in this year’s Waterside Half Marathon, I would urge you to join up with one of the pacers before the race begins on Sunday 2 September. Indeed, our team of pacers will be identified by ‘pacer vests’ and coloured balloons corresponding with the finish times. Runners who are taking part in the half marathon will also be encouraged to join the pacers via announcements at the start line on the morning of the race.” \n\nPaddy concluded: “You really will be great hands – and the entire pacing team is hoping to help even more runners this year achieve those all-important PBs!”\n\nEntries to the race close at midnight on Monday 13th August 2018 and you can register online now at \nwww.derrystrabane/whm\n - where you will also find further information on this year’s Waterside Half Marathon.\n\n\nPictured above: Last year\u0027s pacers in action preparing for the Waterside Half Marathon.\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.countytimes.co.uk//resources/images/8127758.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"newtown first look for residents at 32m new","story":"\nAt the Mid Wales Housing Association preview event at Cwrt Cei Coed, Newtown, ar\u0026ltspan class=truncate\u0026gt\u0026ltspan class=truncate-preview\u0026gte Ffion Jones, aged \u0026ltspan class=truncate-full-screen\u0026gtfive, and three-year-old Trystan Jones and Summer Jones, nine.\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\n\" data-thumb=\"/resources/images/8143330/?type=mc\u0026amphtype=0\" height=\"\"\n                                                                                                                        \nFirst look for residents at £3.2m new homes development in Newtown\n\nMid Wales Housing Association Preview Event at Cwrt Cei Coed, Newtown last Wedne\u0026ltspan class=truncate\u0026gt\u0026ltspan class=truncate-preview\u0026gtsday July 11, 2018.p\u0026ltspan class=truncate-full-screen\u0026gtictured from left, Nathan Pritchard, John Bowen, Dylan Pritchard, Lisa Davies, Madison Pritchard and Keira Davies.\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\n\" data-thumb=\"/resources/images/8143332/?type=mc\u0026amphtype=0\" \n\n                                                                                                                        \nFirst look for residents at £3.2m new homes development in Newtown\n\nMid Wales Housing Association Preview Event at Cwrt Cei Coed, Newtown last Wedne\u0026ltspan class=truncate\u0026gt\u0026ltspan class=truncate-preview\u0026gtsday July 11, 2018.p\u0026ltspan class=truncate-full-screen\u0026gtictured from left, Ffion Jones (5) and Trystan Jones (3) and Summer Jones (9)\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\n\" data-thumb=\"/resources/images/8143333/?type=mc\u0026amphtype=0\" \n\n                                                \n                            \n\n                            \nSkip to next image \u0026raquo\n                        \n                                            \n"},{"url":null,"title":"presteigne carnival 2018 sunshine and live music added to the fun at","story":"\nPIC 10: THE Primary School’s Royal Wedding float in all its glory during the P\u0026ltspan class=truncate\u0026gt\u0026ltspan class=truncate-preview\u0026gtresteigne Carnival d\u0026ltspan class=truncate-full-screen\u0026gtay parade.\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\n\" data-thumb=\"/resources/images/8143390/?type=mc\u0026amphtype=0\" height=\"\"\n                                                                                                                        \nPictures: Sunshine and live music added to the fun at Presteigne Carnival\n\nPIC 1: CARNIVAL Queen Sophie Preece after her crowning with attendants Phoebe Ka\u0026ltspan class=truncate\u0026gt\u0026ltspan class=truncate-preview\u0026gttsaitis, Menna Baynh\u0026ltspan class=truncate-full-screen\u0026gtam, Mair Thomas and Kameron Traylor.\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\n\" data-thumb=\"/resources/images/8143392/?type=mc\u0026amphtype=0\" \n\n                                                                                                                        \nPictures: Sunshine and live music added to the fun at Presteigne Carnival\n\nPIC 2: A BIG turnout by the Celtic Dragons Motorbike Club saw them joining the p\u0026ltspan class=truncate\u0026gt\u0026ltspan class=truncate-preview\u0026gtarade and staging a \u0026ltspan class=truncate-full-screen\u0026gtstatic display on the Carnival Field before going on to present The Woodchoppers Ball at their headquarters The Woodchoppers Arms in Knighton R\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\n\" data-thumb=\"/resources/images/8143393/?type=mc\u0026amphtype=0\" \n\n                                                                                                                        \nPictures: Sunshine and live music added to the fun at Presteigne Carnival\n\nPIC 3: PUPILS of Presteigne Primary School.
