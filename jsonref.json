Don\u0027t assume someone is mean. It\u0027s easy to demonize people.\u0027Earlier this week, Mr Musk suggested in emails to a BuzzFeed journalist that er Vernon Unsworth was a \u0027child rapist\u0027.Musk also claimed, without providing any evidence, that Mr Unsworth had moved to northern Thailand to take \u0027a child bride who was about 12 years old at the time.\u0027The Tesla CEO\u0027s attacks on  Mr Unsworth, whose efforts were considered crucial to the Thai operation, came after the British er criticized a well-publicized effort by Musk to lend a custom-built mini-submarine to the cave rescue effort.Mr Musk responded on Twitter with comments strongly implying that the Briton was a pedophile.

But because of the prices, the returns and the ratio I\u0027ve come out on top and made money from them, which they don\u0027t like.          Mr Sharpe, from Huntingdon in Cambridgeshire, claims he has had his accounts restricted with bet365.com, Ladbrokes, Coral and Paddy Power\u0027Now if I want a selection on the horses and I go for a horse that\u0027s 5-1 and I try and offer bet365 a tenner, the answer is no - maximum stake 33p.\u0027There\u0027s no point in me gambling with them anymore because it\u0027s for pennies and they won\u0027t shut you down completely because they want to show their shareholders that they have this many million users.\u0027Obviously it\u0027s their right to trade with whom they wish but as soon as you start winning, that\u0027s it.\u0027Mr Sharpe opened his account with bet365 closed in June this year, just five months after he opened it. He opened a Paddy Power account online in September only for it to be closed in December. With bet365, he has only won £1,500 over the last year with the single biggest pay-out being a £400 win after he placed £10 on a 33-1 horse.Yet the highest stake he can now place with the bookie is 33p.He believes he is being punished because the company has noticed that he frequently backs the early price for a horse to win before the odds have shortened.By routinely backing horses at 20-1 before the odds shorten, to say 5-1, means that even though he loses more times than he wins, he still makes money in the long-run.          Mr Sharpe is one of a number of punters across the country who have their accounts restricted by bookmakers like Ladbrokes, Coral and others to stop players \u0027who know what they\u0027re doingEstimates suggest that 50,000 of Britain\u0027s 8.5million gamblers have had their accounts restricted in similar ways. They include members of the House of Lords. The limiting of winning players is such a regular part of sports betting in Las Vegas that professional gamblers will intentionally place wagers at less-advantageous odds to stay off the radar.Operators say scrutinising winners is necessary to help prevent fraud - but critics argue that it is damaging the reputation of the gambling industry. It is now becoming increasingly prominent in the UK and is such a concern that the matter has been debated in Parliament.Mr Sharpe conducted a survey among 150 regular gamblers which found that more than half of them had had their accounts restricted by bet365, Paddy Power and Betfair          Mr Sharpe (pictured) had his bet365 account restricted in June after winning £1,000 over four months on greyhound racingAnother gambler, Will Tomassi, 39, from Farnham, Surrey, makes an average profit of between £3,500 a month on betting.He had his bet365 account restricted in June after winning £1,000 over four months on greyhound racing.Mr Tomassi, who works in sales for a medical company, said: \u0027I was going great guns but then they pulled the rug from under me which was extremely annoying.\u0027bet365 are really the only company who offer decent early prices on the dogs and I betted on \u0027match-ups\u0027 which was essentially picking one dog to beat another dog in the race.\u0027I started with a £2 beginning stake, which rose to £15 the more successful I became, but crucially I could roll over my winnings to a second or third race.\u0027So if I did get to a third bet, I could be betting as much as £60.\u0027Since the account was restricted, the most I can place on a bet in match-ups at any one time is £1 so it\u0027s more or less null and void.\u0027I can play a singles game and pick a winner but even then it\u0027s only for small change.\u0027The problem is that if you apply any kind of intelligence or any intent to try and work anything out, they cut you off straight away.\u0027Earlier this year All-Party Parliamentary Betting and Gaming Group held a seminar at the House of Lords to discuss account closures and restrictions by online bookmakers on successful punters.  Estimates suggest that around 50,000 of Britain\u0027s 8.5million gamblers have had their accounts restricted to maximum bets of 33p - or closed as a result of winning too may bets The group\u0027s chairman Philip Davies MP told MailOnline that at least one member of the Lords had had their account restricted but declined to name who.The group is urging the gambling industry to introduce a minimum bet rule – already in place at racecourse bookies – which would require a betting company to lay an advertised price to lose a specified sum, typically £500.Mr Davies said: \u0027I accept that it\u0027s impossible for bookmakers to let punters lay anything they want on because they\u0027d probably go bust in no time.\u0027But there\u0027s a big difference in that and restricting someone to bet only a few pence or a few pounds.\u0027This happens to a lot of people, I know of a member of the House of Lords who has had his account restricted, and I\u0027m sure the industry will say it\u0027s a very small proportion of punters\u0027The whole point of gambling, whichever side of the counter you\u0027re on, is that sometimes you\u0027ll win and sometimes you\u0027ll lose.\u0027That\u0027 the nature of it and I think too many gambling companies have become risk averse and if you want to be risk averse you shouldn\u0027t be in the gambling industry.\u0027Bookmakers have been far too restrictive in the past but credit where credit\u0027s due, they are starting to wake up and are slowly but surely moving in the right direction.\u0027bet365 has yet to make comment however a spokesman for Ladbrokes and Coral, which merged in November 2016, admitted that a small number of their accounts were restricted.A spokesman said: \u0027Over a million people bet regularly with Ladbrokes and Coral in our betting shops, online and via mobile apps, and over 99 per cent of bets are laid as requested.\u0027Only a small minority of our customers experience restrictions on certain bets for risk management purposes, as is the case with all bookmakers. We close very few accounts and a high proportion of these are for responsible gambling or anti-money laundering grounds or because they are duplicate accounts, rather than for trading reasons.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/07/17/05EF2233000007D0-6143751-image-a-78_1536336547059.jpg","title":"How Nike worth","story":"      Nike\u0027s 30th anniversary Just Do It advert features San Francisco 49er Colin KaepernickNikeFounded in 1964 as Blue Ribbon Sports, Nike started out as a distributor for the Japanese shoemaker Onitsuka Tiger, now known as Acics, before officially becoming Nike Inc in 1971. The company was founded by track-and-field coach Bill Bowerman and a middle-distance runner Phil Knight, from Portland.Business Insider reported that while Knight had planned to call the company Dimension 6, the name Nike was thought of by their first employee Jeff Johnson and comes from the Greek goddess of victory\u0027s name. 1971 was also the year that Bowerman had his first eureka moment while he was making waffles with his wife. Seeing the waffle iron sparked an idea for grooved patterns on the sole of trainers to help athletes grip the tracks while running and it was referred to as the Nike Waffle Trainer, patented in 1974.In addition to this, the iconic Nike swoosh logo was designed by Portland State student Carolyn Davidson for just $35, more than $200 in today’s currency, but she was later given stock that is now worth over $640,000.The Just Do It slogan was inspired by serial killer Gary Gilmore who had said ‘let’s do it’ before he was executed in 1977 by a firing squad. 11 years later, the first Just Do It campaign was launched, featuring Walt Stack, an 80-year-old runner.Nike was also the first company to use a Beatles song  in a TV commercial, their track Revolution featuring in the sporting giant’s 1987 ad for the Air Max shoes.            Colin Kaepernick kneels during the national anthem before an NFL game against the SeahawksNike adAs reported by Time, many have wondered how much Kaepernick’s deal with Nike could be worth, with some sports agents claiming it could be  millions of dollars a year, which would be a unique development considering he does not currently play for a team in the NFL.The Nike ad features the former player with a caption reading: ‘Believe in something, even if it means sacrificing everything. #JustDoIt.’ Despite having signed Colin in 2011, Nike had not used him in over two years and the company agreed to an eight-year extension of the deal with the league in March.Gino Fisanotti, Nike’s Vice President of Brand for North America said: \u0027We believe Colin is one of the most inspirational athletes of this generation. We wanted to energize its meaning and introduce Just Do It to a new generation of athletes,’ adding  the campaign was aimed at those who were between 15 and 17.The full advert, which features Kaepernick for 20 seconds, concludes with the quarterback saying: \u0027So don\u0027t just ask if your dreams are crazy, ask if they\u0027re crazy enough.\u0027 The caption at the end flashes: \u0027It\u0027s only crazy until you do it. Just do it.\u0027Nike boycottAfter the Nike advert was released, protesters on social media called for people to burn their Nike sneakers and boycott the retailer after choosing Kaepernick for its signature Just Do It campaign, with shares in the company initially plummeting.In addition to a number of social media users, actor James Woods joined the many who criticised Nike on Twitter, tweeting that he emailed his wealth manager asking him to sell all of his  shares.\u0027Please est my portfolio of all Nike stock in my personal account in and the plan. Henceforth never buy Nike stock for me again.\u0027 He followed up by tweeting out a meme mocking the Nike slogan, saying, \u0027Nike: Just Sold It.\u0027Nike stockDespite Nike stock having an uptick now, after the company released their 30th anniversary Just Do It campaign featuring Colin Kaepernick, shares fell by two percent to $79.01 but have since recovered to $81.13 per share as of approximately 11:26am EST on Friday, September 7.According to CNBC calculations, if one invested $1,000 in 2008, it would now be worth $6,131.47.While it is not clear whether Kaepernick’s inclusion in the advert would affect Nike’s stock in the long term, Managing Director of GlobalData Retail, said: ‘While Nike has been doing relatively well in a sports market that is under pressure, it cannot afford to make bad decisions.‘Anything which has the potential to damage market share, such as overtly political campaigns, should be avoided.’ However, Host of Mad Money Jim Cramer, pointed out that ‘if people think Colin Kaepernick is cool,’ then ‘it’s a win for Nike.’It is estimated that Nike generated $43 million in free advertising through media coverage when the campaign collaboration with Kaepernick was first revealed at the start of the week, despite the backlash.Nike worthAccording to Statista, Nike’s global net income in 2018 amounted to $1.9 billion, which is a significant drop from $4.2 billion last year and what seemed to be a steady growth from 2009 onwards.Forbes reported that Nike was the world\u0027s leading athletic apparel maker and has a brand value of $15.9 billion. In addition to this, it increased its revenue to $24 billion from $16 billion in five years.Nike\u0027s share of the footwear market rose from 14 per cent to 19 per cent during the same period and expanded its presence in international football, as well as professional and college sports.  Prince Harry has worn the same bracelet for 20 years and this is whyFortnite Monopoly: When is it released and how is it different from the traditional board game?Who is Joe Rogan?

I decided to put this into practice with patients referred to me by care homes, and I was astounded by the response of some of them.After only a few days of regular paracetamol, I was able stop all the anti-psychotic drugs prescribed for one lady. Paracetamol became my first-line treatment for agitation in elderly patients.But paracetamol isn’t the answer for everyone. Skilled nursing care is the missing factor in the tragic plight of so many dementia patients.Just because someone is unable to articulate how they are feeling or what is wrong, doesn’t mean they are not communicating.Non-verbal communication and subtle changes in demeanour can provide a wealth of information about the patient — but it takes experience and time spent with them to pick up on this.I was once called to see an elderly man with dementia in a nursing home. ‘I don’t know what it is, but I’m sure there’s a problem,’ his nurse said. He knelt down and gently took the man’s hand. ‘You can tell from his face. See . . .?’All I saw was an elderly man with his mouth wide open and expressionless eyes, utterly shut off from the world. Then his lip curled very slightly.‘There,’ the nurse said triumphantly. ‘He does that now and again when he’s hungry or thirsty, but he’s been doing it a lot for a few days now’.I wasn’t convinced, but realised the nurse knew his patient so well that he recognised minute, idiosyncratic changes in facial expression indicating a problem.However, after examining the patient I could find nothing wrong. The nurse continued to insist the opposite was true, so I arranged for the man to be admitted to hospital for a full investigation.He was subsequently diagnosed with a urinary tract infection that had spread to his kidneys — and which must have been causing him acute pain. But thanks to his relationship with an empathetic nurse he didn’t have to sit there and suffer for long.Sadly, this type of patientnurse relationship is all too rare in the modern NHS and even in many care homes because of staff shortages, high turnover and a pressured environment.As a result society’s most vulnerable must suffer in silence.    DUMBING DOWN JUST WON\u0027T WORKThe Academy of Medical Royal Colleges has had a brainwave! Patients would be more engaged in their treatment if they were written to in language that avoided medical terminology — rather than copied in on a letter to their GP — after a specialist consultation.I tried it a few years ago but it wasn’t a success. It doubled my workload because I still had to record everything formally in the medical notes rather than rely on a letter to cover everything adequately. Nor did my patients like it. Quite rightly, they seemed to prefer medical professionals communicating with each other about their health, rather than via them in a dumbed-down letter that risked missing key details.Medical terminology and jargon is a language that’s evolved to communicate precise, complex things in as clear and unambiguous way as possible to others who speak that language.Most patients realise receiving a copy of such a letter is a courtesy, but it isn’t intended to explain things to them. That should be done face to face by the doctor during the appointment, and the patient encouraged to ask questions or seek clarification.To me, this interaction is the bedrock of good doctor-patient relationships. Firing off patronising missives to our patients is no substitute.   OLD AGE, NEW TAX!The crisis in social care is not going away. Latest figures from the charity Age UK show 1,000 elderly people are admitted to hospital every day simply due to a lack of adequate social care.I know too well how patients can languish on medical wards, waiting for the social care to be put in place so they can return to their own homes, or for a care home place to be found.It is grossly unfair on patients and puts them at risk of infections and a general deterioration in health: increasingly immobile and lacking the mental stimulation of a non- hospital environment.It is also a shameful waste of much-needed NHS beds. Calling the old and frail ‘bed blockers’ is distasteful, but through no fault of their own that’s what they are. The Government’s social care green paper this autumn will set out plans for addressing this escalating crisis. But the harsh truth is ministers have few options. The system desperately needs more cash and I’m afraid tax-payers must cough up.The alternative is a social care system not fit for purpose, that compromises the efficient functioning of the NHS, denies many the medical care they need and lets down the elderly.I dislike the idea of extra tax, but I dislike even more the idea of inadequate care when I’m old and infirm.A social care tax — ring-fenced so it isn’t subsumed by other expenditure — would let us start building the sort of 21st-century care system expected of the world’s sixth largest economy.If we don’t, then as former Labour leader Neil Kinnock once said (albeit in a very different context): ‘I warn you not to grow old’   WHY DOES THE STIGMA OF HIV STILL LINGER?New cases of HIV are at their lowest level for nearly 20 years. This is in large part due to new therapies, including drugs that prevent someone who is HIV positive passing on the virus.It’s also thanks to PrEp (pre-exposure prophylaxis), a combination of two anti-HIV medicines that are taken daily and which protect someone who may be at high risk of exposure to HIV.It’s a truly seismic shift in the management of a disease that, when I started training to be a doctor in the late Nineties, was still considered a death sentence. Now, men and women infected with HIV and who have access to the best medication can expect to live as long as someone without the virus.Unfortunately, there has been no accompanying shift in public perception of the disease.We still make moral judgments about those who are HIV positive. We still regard infection as some sort of retribution for a debauched or hedonistic life.This contributes to the persistent stigma associated with HIV, and I believe it’s a factor in the significantly higher rates of mental health problems in HIV positive iniduals.For many newly-diagnosed, fear of being ostracised haunts them. So it’s no wonder rates of depression among the HIV positive are nearly ten times higher than in the general public.How sad that, despite incredible scientific advances that have enabled us to conquer HIV, we’ve reached the stage where it is society’s attitude rather than the virus itself that ensures HIV remains a feared diagnosis.  One in four student nurses quits before their course ends, according to new figures. Yet we face a shortfall of 40,000 nurses. It’s an absolute crisis. Nurses are frontline deliverers of care. Without enough, the NHS will collapse. This cannot continue. We can recruit more nurses from overseas — but we also need home-grown nurses, and there IS a simple solution. Abolish tuition fees for nursing degrees, and reinstate the student nurse grant. It would send a clear message that we value our nurses and are grateful for their vocation. If retention rates don’t improve, I fear we will live to regret it. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/08/01/4FDC063100000578-0-image-a-27_1536366423454.jpg","title":"Students need work holidays avoid trapped unpaid work","story":"    Students need to work during the holidays to avoid being trapped in a ‘cycle’ of unpaid internships as graduates, a watchdog chief warnsThose on non-vocational courses and people who have no industry contacts would particularly benefit from work experience, she said.Speaking yesterday at the National Graduate Recruitment Conference, Mrs Dandridge called on universities and employers to improve access to work placements and internships for undergraduates.Facebook is forced to apologize after REMOVING Burt...Three hapless Brits, a French beach at midnight and an...Share this articleShe said: ‘It cannot be right that so many students – especially those in courses with little vocational element and those without the right networks – have no access to good work placements andor holiday internships while they are studying. \u0027This means they are more likely to face a cycle of internships, too often unpaid, after they graduate before they are able to get lasting graduate employment.’ A report by social mobility charity the Sutton Trust earlier this year estimated 40 per cent of around 70,000 internships undertaken a year are unpaid. \u0027With living costs of more than £1,000 a month in London and £800 a month in Manchester, the trust warned this was pushing many ‘less advantaged’ people of out their dream careers.

The heartbreaking image was taken by German soldier Heinz Joest during a days leave for his birthday on 19 September 1941. The Warsaw ghetto was the most prominent German ghetto in Europe, created after the conquest of Poland in the autumn of 1940. 400,000 Jews were moved from their homes to live under strict surveillance, with an average of nine people in each room          Senator Alben W. Barkley, member of a committee investigating Nazi atrocities takes a look at a pile of bodies at Buchenwald concentration camp in Weimar, Germany on 24 April 1945.

The Holocaust was something that happened, and it happened in colour.  \u0027A colourised Holocaust picture can raise awareness that, although being seventy years old, the essence of evil will never evolve, that death doesn\u0027t need to be romanticised because of being in black and white.\u0027          American soldiers forced German civilians from the town of Volary to walk past the exhumed bodies of 30 Jewish women starved to death by SS troops during a 300-mile march from Helmbrechts concentration camp across Czechoslovakia. The women had been buried in shallow graves in Volary, and the bodies were exhumed by German civilians working under direction of medical personnel of the 5th Infantry Division, to rebury them in a local cemetery. The picture is dated May 1945  The prisoners on the left were held at a subcamps near the town of Ampfing and photographed on 4 May 1945 after being liberated by U.S. Third Army troops,. They were housed in barracks partially submerged in the ground with soil-covered roofs designed to camouflage the structures from Allied aerial reconnaissance. Pictured right are members of the 42nd Rainbow Division of the 7th US Army, who uncovered a wagon transporting people to the horrors of Dachau, 30 April 1945. The liberation was followed by the Dachau liberation reprisals, a series of incidents in which German prisoners of war were killed by American soldiersThe Holocaust was a genocide during World War Two in which Nazi Germany, aided by its collaborators, systematically murdered approximately six million European Jews, around two-thirds of the Jewish population of Europe, between 1941 and 1945.Jews were targeted for extermination as part of a larger event, involving the persecution and murder of other groups by the regime, including in particular the Roma, ethnic Poles, and \u0027incurably sick\u0027, as well as political opponents, homosexuals, Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses, and Soviet prisoners of war.Germany implemented the persecution in stages. Following Adolf Hitler\u0027s rise to power in 1933, the government passed laws to exclude Jews from civil society, most prominently the Nuremberg Laws in 1935. Starting in 1933, the Nazis built a network of concentration camps in Germany for political opponents and people deemed \u0027undesirable\u0027. After the invasion of Poland in 1939, the regime set up ghettos to segregate Jews. Over 42,000 camps, ghettos, and other detention sites were established.The deportation of Jews to the ghettos culminated in the policy of extermination the Nazis called the \u0027Final Solution to the Jewish Question\u0027, discussed by senior Nazi officials at the Wannsee Conference in Berlin in January 1942. As German forces captured territories in the East, all anti-Jewish measures were radicalised.           Pictured are a few of the thousands of wedding rings the Nazis removed from their victims to salvage the gold, in a cave near the Buchenwald concentration camp, Germany. U.S. troops found rings, watches, precious stones, eyeglasses, and gold fillings extracted from inmates on 5 May 1945          Prisioner no. 40472 of the Auschwitz concentration-extermination camp, identified as Michaø Liborski. Other sources point Liborskiís number as 20909, and tell us he was born in Czernice on 14 September 1914, and died on 15 April 1942, thus being younger than 28 years old when these pictures were taken by Wilhelm Brasse. Brasse was ordered by SS staff to photograph the prisoners for their files, taking up to 50,000 identity pictures between 1940 and 1945          Executions of Jews by German army mobile killing units, the Einsatzgruppen, after they had dug their own graves, near Ivangorod, Ukraine, 1942. This photo was mailed from the Eastern Front to Germany and intercepted at a Warsaw post office by a member of the Polish resistance collecting documentation on Nazi war crimesUnder the coordination of the SS, with directions from the highest leadership of the Nazi Party, killings were committed within Germany itself, throughout German-occupied Europe, and across all territories controlled by the Axis powers.Paramilitary units called Einsatzgruppen murdered around 1.3 million Jews in mass shootings between 1941 and 1945. By mid-1942, victims were being deported from the ghettos in sealed freight trains to extermination camps where, if they survived the journey, they were killed in gas chambers. The killing continued until the end of World War II in Europe in April-May 1945.\u0027These are a tiny sample of the brutality and death that the Nazi regime unleashed between 1939 and 1945,\u0027 added Joel.\u0027The images are hard, but they must be seen to understand what happened in those years so close to us.\u0027I tried to show each of the aspects of the Holocaust.

Don\u0027t assume someone is mean. It\u0027s easy to demonize people.\u0027Earlier this week, Mr Musk suggested in emails to a BuzzFeed journalist that er Vernon Unsworth was a \u0027child rapist\u0027.Musk also claimed, without providing any evidence, that Mr Unsworth had moved to northern Thailand to take \u0027a child bride who was about 12 years old at the time.\u0027The Tesla CEO\u0027s attacks on  Mr Unsworth, whose efforts were considered crucial to the Thai operation, came after the British er criticized a well-publicized effort by Musk to lend a custom-built mini-submarine to the cave rescue effort.Mr Musk responded on Twitter with comments strongly implying that the Briton was a pedophile. He then apologised for this, before repeating the claims this week.During the podcast, Musk was asked what percentage of his interactions with other people on Twitter was a good idea, with Rogan suggesting \u0027ten per cent\u0027.

He opened a Paddy Power account online in September only for it to be closed in December. With bet365, he has only won £1,500 over the last year with the single biggest pay-out being a £400 win after he placed £10 on a 33-1 horse.Yet the highest stake he can now place with the bookie is 33p.He believes he is being punished because the company has noticed that he frequently backs the early price for a horse to win before the odds have shortened.By routinely backing horses at 20-1 before the odds shorten, to say 5-1, means that even though he loses more times than he wins, he still makes money in the long-run.          Mr Sharpe is one of a number of punters across the country who have their accounts restricted by bookmakers like Ladbrokes, Coral and others to stop players \u0027who know what they\u0027re doingEstimates suggest that 50,000 of Britain\u0027s 8.5million gamblers have had their accounts restricted in similar ways. They include members of the House of Lords. The limiting of winning players is such a regular part of sports betting in Las Vegas that professional gamblers will intentionally place wagers at less-advantageous odds to stay off the radar.Operators say scrutinising winners is necessary to help prevent fraud - but critics argue that it is damaging the reputation of the gambling industry. It is now becoming increasingly prominent in the UK and is such a concern that the matter has been debated in Parliament.Mr Sharpe conducted a survey among 150 regular gamblers which found that more than half of them had had their accounts restricted by bet365, Paddy Power and Betfair          Mr Sharpe (pictured) had his bet365 account restricted in June after winning £1,000 over four months on greyhound racingAnother gambler, Will Tomassi, 39, from Farnham, Surrey, makes an average profit of between £3,500 a month on betting.He had his bet365 account restricted in June after winning £1,000 over four months on greyhound racing.Mr Tomassi, who works in sales for a medical company, said: \u0027I was going great guns but then they pulled the rug from under me which was extremely annoying.\u0027bet365 are really the only company who offer decent early prices on the dogs and I betted on \u0027match-ups\u0027 which was essentially picking one dog to beat another dog in the race.\u0027I started with a £2 beginning stake, which rose to £15 the more successful I became, but crucially I could roll over my winnings to a second or third race.\u0027So if I did get to a third bet, I could be betting as much as £60.\u0027Since the account was restricted, the most I can place on a bet in match-ups at any one time is £1 so it\u0027s more or less null and void.\u0027I can play a singles game and pick a winner but even then it\u0027s only for small change.\u0027The problem is that if you apply any kind of intelligence or any intent to try and work anything out, they cut you off straight away.\u0027Earlier this year All-Party Parliamentary Betting and Gaming Group held a seminar at the House of Lords to discuss account closures and restrictions by online bookmakers on successful punters.  Estimates suggest that around 50,000 of Britain\u0027s 8.5million gamblers have had their accounts restricted to maximum bets of 33p - or closed as a result of winning too may bets The group\u0027s chairman Philip Davies MP told MailOnline that at least one member of the Lords had had their account restricted but declined to name who.The group is urging the gambling industry to introduce a minimum bet rule – already in place at racecourse bookies – which would require a betting company to lay an advertised price to lose a specified sum, typically £500.Mr Davies said: \u0027I accept that it\u0027s impossible for bookmakers to let punters lay anything they want on because they\u0027d probably go bust in no time.\u0027But there\u0027s a big difference in that and restricting someone to bet only a few pence or a few pounds.\u0027This happens to a lot of people, I know of a member of the House of Lords who has had his account restricted, and I\u0027m sure the industry will say it\u0027s a very small proportion of punters\u0027The whole point of gambling, whichever side of the counter you\u0027re on, is that sometimes you\u0027ll win and sometimes you\u0027ll lose.\u0027That\u0027 the nature of it and I think too many gambling companies have become risk averse and if you want to be risk averse you shouldn\u0027t be in the gambling industry.\u0027Bookmakers have been far too restrictive in the past but credit where credit\u0027s due, they are starting to wake up and are slowly but surely moving in the right direction.\u0027bet365 has yet to make comment however a spokesman for Ladbrokes and Coral, which merged in November 2016, admitted that a small number of their accounts were restricted.A spokesman said: \u0027Over a million people bet regularly with Ladbrokes and Coral in our betting shops, online and via mobile apps, and over 99 per cent of bets are laid as requested.\u0027Only a small minority of our customers experience restrictions on certain bets for risk management purposes, as is the case with all bookmakers. We close very few accounts and a high proportion of these are for responsible gambling or anti-money laundering grounds or because they are duplicate accounts, rather than for trading reasons.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/07/15/4FD5D7F300000578-0-image-a-51_1536332162536.jpg","title":"Engineer sacked claiming women prefer raising children work","story":"    Manglin Pillay, head of Saice, who said that few women take up scientific professions because they are \u0027more predisposed for caring\u0027 has been sackedHe added that more men seek high-profile executive posts because of their \u0027appetite for work load and extreme performance requirements at that level.\u0027 Thomas Cook pays out £3,000 to holidaymaker who suffered...Share this articleThe former head of the company believed that \u0027type-A personalities who are disagreeable at times, and highly competitive - workaholics, with almost no family, social or hobby time.According to Mr Pillay \u0027The reason why women do not occupy these positions is that women choose to rather have the flexibility to dedicate themselves to more important enterprises, like family and raising children, than to be at the beck and call of shareholders\u0027.               Since his departure founder of WomEng, Hema Vallabh, has said that this sends a message that discrimination will no longer be toleratedHis departure has been welcomed by South Africa\u0027s Commission for Gender Equality, saying that it would help the fight against sexism.He was also slammed by South Africa\u0027s Science Minister, Mmamoloko Kubayi-Ngubane, who argued that the lack of support for women was the problem and not the attitudes, Fin24 reported. Mr Pillay issued an apology for \u0027antagonising and offending so many people, in August however this has not been enough to settle the controversy.Saice President Errol Kerst said that the response had been so large that the \u0027ramifications of the article\u0027 could not be ignored. Since his departure founder of WomEng, Hema Vallabh, has said that this sends a message that discrimination will no longer be tolerated.            His departure has been welcomed by South Africa\u0027s Commission for Gender Equality, saying that it would help the fight against sexism"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/08/00/4FD5858C00000578-0-image-a-1_1536363167656.jpg","title":"Mamas gesture Queen plans lavish 70th birthday party Charles Buckingham palace","story":"    The Queen has invited hundreds of family and friends for a private birthday party to celebrate Charles\u0027 70th birthday          A series of events are already being organised to publicly celebrate the milestone but it is his mother\u0027s gesture that will mean so much to Charles Palace insiders say the Queen will say a few fond but amusing words about her son and heir on the day, with even a 70-year-old future king appreciating a pat on the back from his mother.To mark the occasion, the Prince of Wales and his team have also co-operated with a major new BBC television documentary – a crew have been following the heir to the throne around for months – and two magazine profiles.\u0027Why in the name of Satan does our county need a Greggs?\u0027:...Woman of steel who finally buckled: How Boris Johnson\u0027s wife...Share this article ITV is broadcasting a one-off night of comedy and magic at the London Palladium, entitled We Are Most Amused And Amazed, with the proceeds going towards his Prince’s Trust charity.

I decided to put this into practice with patients referred to me by care homes, and I was astounded by the response of some of them.After only a few days of regular paracetamol, I was able stop all the anti-psychotic drugs prescribed for one lady. Paracetamol became my first-line treatment for agitation in elderly patients.But paracetamol isn’t the answer for everyone. Skilled nursing care is the missing factor in the tragic plight of so many dementia patients.Just because someone is unable to articulate how they are feeling or what is wrong, doesn’t mean they are not communicating.Non-verbal communication and subtle changes in demeanour can provide a wealth of information about the patient — but it takes experience and time spent with them to pick up on this.I was once called to see an elderly man with dementia in a nursing home. ‘I don’t know what it is, but I’m sure there’s a problem,’ his nurse said. He knelt down and gently took the man’s hand. ‘You can tell from his face. See . . .?’All I saw was an elderly man with his mouth wide open and expressionless eyes, utterly shut off from the world. Then his lip curled very slightly.‘There,’ the nurse said triumphantly. ‘He does that now and again when he’s hungry or thirsty, but he’s been doing it a lot for a few days now’.I wasn’t convinced, but realised the nurse knew his patient so well that he recognised minute, idiosyncratic changes in facial expression indicating a problem.However, after examining the patient I could find nothing wrong. The nurse continued to insist the opposite was true, so I arranged for the man to be admitted to hospital for a full investigation.He was subsequently diagnosed with a urinary tract infection that had spread to his kidneys — and which must have been causing him acute pain. But thanks to his relationship with an empathetic nurse he didn’t have to sit there and suffer for long.Sadly, this type of patientnurse relationship is all too rare in the modern NHS and even in many care homes because of staff shortages, high turnover and a pressured environment.As a result society’s most vulnerable must suffer in silence.    DUMBING DOWN JUST WON\u0027T WORKThe Academy of Medical Royal Colleges has had a brainwave! Patients would be more engaged in their treatment if they were written to in language that avoided medical terminology — rather than copied in on a letter to their GP — after a specialist consultation.I tried it a few years ago but it wasn’t a success. It doubled my workload because I still had to record everything formally in the medical notes rather than rely on a letter to cover everything adequately. Nor did my patients like it. Quite rightly, they seemed to prefer medical professionals communicating with each other about their health, rather than via them in a dumbed-down letter that risked missing key details.Medical terminology and jargon is a language that’s evolved to communicate precise, complex things in as clear and unambiguous way as possible to others who speak that language.Most patients realise receiving a copy of such a letter is a courtesy, but it isn’t intended to explain things to them. That should be done face to face by the doctor during the appointment, and the patient encouraged to ask questions or seek clarification.To me, this interaction is the bedrock of good doctor-patient relationships. Firing off patronising missives to our patients is no substitute.   OLD AGE, NEW TAX!The crisis in social care is not going away. Latest figures from the charity Age UK show 1,000 elderly people are admitted to hospital every day simply due to a lack of adequate social care.I know too well how patients can languish on medical wards, waiting for the social care to be put in place so they can return to their own homes, or for a care home place to be found.It is grossly unfair on patients and puts them at risk of infections and a general deterioration in health: increasingly immobile and lacking the mental stimulation of a non- hospital environment.It is also a shameful waste of much-needed NHS beds. Calling the old and frail ‘bed blockers’ is distasteful, but through no fault of their own that’s what they are. The Government’s social care green paper this autumn will set out plans for addressing this escalating crisis. But the harsh truth is ministers have few options. The system desperately needs more cash and I’m afraid tax-payers must cough up.The alternative is a social care system not fit for purpose, that compromises the efficient functioning of the NHS, denies many the medical care they need and lets down the elderly.I dislike the idea of extra tax, but I dislike even more the idea of inadequate care when I’m old and infirm.A social care tax — ring-fenced so it isn’t subsumed by other expenditure — would let us start building the sort of 21st-century care system expected of the world’s sixth largest economy.If we don’t, then as former Labour leader Neil Kinnock once said (albeit in a very different context): ‘I warn you not to grow old’   WHY DOES THE STIGMA OF HIV STILL LINGER?New cases of HIV are at their lowest level for nearly 20 years. This is in large part due to new therapies, including drugs that prevent someone who is HIV positive passing on the virus.It’s also thanks to PrEp (pre-exposure prophylaxis), a combination of two anti-HIV medicines that are taken daily and which protect someone who may be at high risk of exposure to HIV.It’s a truly seismic shift in the management of a disease that, when I started training to be a doctor in the late Nineties, was still considered a death sentence. Now, men and women infected with HIV and who have access to the best medication can expect to live as long as someone without the virus.Unfortunately, there has been no accompanying shift in public perception of the disease.We still make moral judgments about those who are HIV positive. We still regard infection as some sort of retribution for a debauched or hedonistic life.This contributes to the persistent stigma associated with HIV, and I believe it’s a factor in the significantly higher rates of mental health problems in HIV positive iniduals.For many newly-diagnosed, fear of being ostracised haunts them. So it’s no wonder rates of depression among the HIV positive are nearly ten times higher than in the general public.How sad that, despite incredible scientific advances that have enabled us to conquer HIV, we’ve reached the stage where it is society’s attitude rather than the virus itself that ensures HIV remains a feared diagnosis.  One in four student nurses quits before their course ends, according to new figures. Yet we face a shortfall of 40,000 nurses. It’s an absolute crisis. Nurses are frontline deliverers of care. Without enough, the NHS will collapse. This cannot continue. We can recruit more nurses from overseas — but we also need home-grown nurses, and there IS a simple solution. Abolish tuition fees for nursing degrees, and reinstate the student nurse grant. It would send a clear message that we value our nurses and are grateful for their vocation. If retention rates don’t improve, I fear we will live to regret it. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/08/01/4FDAE3C000000578-0-image-m-44_1536365437136.jpg","title":"BBC says Manmade climate change indisputable","story":"    The BBC says manmade climate change is so indisputable that it does not need to invite ‘deniers’ on to its shows for balanceMiss Unsworth’s email also directed staff to training materials stating that the broadcaster had too often failed to strike the right balance on climate change.‘Climate change has been a difficult subject for the BBC, and we get coverage of it wrong too often.

The heartbreaking image was taken by German soldier Heinz Joest during a days leave for his birthday on 19 September 1941. The Warsaw ghetto was the most prominent German ghetto in Europe, created after the conquest of Poland in the autumn of 1940. 400,000 Jews were moved from their homes to live under strict surveillance, with an average of nine people in each room          Senator Alben W.

The women had been buried in shallow graves in Volary, and the bodies were exhumed by German civilians working under direction of medical personnel of the 5th Infantry Division, to rebury them in a local cemetery. The picture is dated May 1945  The prisoners on the left were held at a subcamps near the town of Ampfing and photographed on 4 May 1945 after being liberated by U.S. Third Army troops,. They were housed in barracks partially submerged in the ground with soil-covered roofs designed to camouflage the structures from Allied aerial reconnaissance. Pictured right are members of the 42nd Rainbow Division of the 7th US Army, who uncovered a wagon transporting people to the horrors of Dachau, 30 April 1945. The liberation was followed by the Dachau liberation reprisals, a series of incidents in which German prisoners of war were killed by American soldiersThe Holocaust was a genocide during World War Two in which Nazi Germany, aided by its collaborators, systematically murdered approximately six million European Jews, around two-thirds of the Jewish population of Europe, between 1941 and 1945.Jews were targeted for extermination as part of a larger event, involving the persecution and murder of other groups by the regime, including in particular the Roma, ethnic Poles, and \u0027incurably sick\u0027, as well as political opponents, homosexuals, Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses, and Soviet prisoners of war.Germany implemented the persecution in stages. Following Adolf Hitler\u0027s rise to power in 1933, the government passed laws to exclude Jews from civil society, most prominently the Nuremberg Laws in 1935. Starting in 1933, the Nazis built a network of concentration camps in Germany for political opponents and people deemed \u0027undesirable\u0027. After the invasion of Poland in 1939, the regime set up ghettos to segregate Jews. Over 42,000 camps, ghettos, and other detention sites were established.The deportation of Jews to the ghettos culminated in the policy of extermination the Nazis called the \u0027Final Solution to the Jewish Question\u0027, discussed by senior Nazi officials at the Wannsee Conference in Berlin in January 1942. As German forces captured territories in the East, all anti-Jewish measures were radicalised.           Pictured are a few of the thousands of wedding rings the Nazis removed from their victims to salvage the gold, in a cave near the Buchenwald concentration camp, Germany. U.S. troops found rings, watches, precious stones, eyeglasses, and gold fillings extracted from inmates on 5 May 1945          Prisioner no. 40472 of the Auschwitz concentration-extermination camp, identified as Michaø Liborski. Other sources point Liborskiís number as 20909, and tell us he was born in Czernice on 14 September 1914, and died on 15 April 1942, thus being younger than 28 years old when these pictures were taken by Wilhelm Brasse. Brasse was ordered by SS staff to photograph the prisoners for their files, taking up to 50,000 identity pictures between 1940 and 1945          Executions of Jews by German army mobile killing units, the Einsatzgruppen, after they had dug their own graves, near Ivangorod, Ukraine, 1942. This photo was mailed from the Eastern Front to Germany and intercepted at a Warsaw post office by a member of the Polish resistance collecting documentation on Nazi war crimesUnder the coordination of the SS, with directions from the highest leadership of the Nazi Party, killings were committed within Germany itself, throughout German-occupied Europe, and across all territories controlled by the Axis powers.Paramilitary units called Einsatzgruppen murdered around 1.3 million Jews in mass shootings between 1941 and 1945. By mid-1942, victims were being deported from the ghettos in sealed freight trains to extermination camps where, if they survived the journey, they were killed in gas chambers. The killing continued until the end of World War II in Europe in April-May 1945.\u0027These are a tiny sample of the brutality and death that the Nazi regime unleashed between 1939 and 1945,\u0027 added Joel.\u0027The images are hard, but they must be seen to understand what happened in those years so close to us.\u0027I tried to show each of the aspects of the Holocaust.

Two contemporary art galleries on the same long south London road are opening new spaces this month. Both repurpose the legacy of Victorian civic benevolence. Both employ architects who relish the as-found: the chance qualities of craftsmanship and time, damage, weathering, the authority of things made for a specific use that persists even when they are applied to another.One is the Goldsmiths Centre for Contemporary Art, a new gallery attached to the art school that nurtured Young British Artists (as they once were). It will exhibit art from outside the school, so as to set up exchanges between students, teachers, the world of art and the general public. The £4.2m project occupies the functional rear of an 1895 public bath- and wash-house whose ornate front and former pool halls are already in use as studios the structure’s sturdy walls once carried the weight of water in cast-iron tanks above.It’s a zone of big pipes, intriguing laundry-handling machines and bricks both rough-surfaced and hygienically glazed. It is, externally, part of an unruly bunch of buildings in a part of London where the city’s usual patterns unravel: there are, gathered behind the lovely Wren-style former Deptford town hall, some 1940s concrete prefabs scheduled for removal, an emphatic glass studio block by the late Will Alsop, backs of terraces, in the middle distance a tower block reclad in pastel shades.Out of its three storeys, one of them a basement, 700 square metres of exhibition space are made, plus a cafe and some offices. The job has been done by Assemble, the young architectural collective, winner of the 2015 Turner prize, whose work until now has often been temporary and built by their own hands. This is their most substantial project to date.Assemble amplify and augment the location’s bricolage. If there’s a ravaged wall to be left, or a worn stair tread, or some orphaned equipment, or a stump of steel joist, it is. The interiors of the water tanks become dark metallic display spaces, uninsulated, with only the 20mm thickness of the iron case between you and the outdoors. Views are borrowed, one into the airy hall of the former pool, and another into what, once the prefabs go, will be a new public open space.Assemble then add something of themselves. Two pristine white-cube galleries are inserted on the top floor, with light coming from above through a delicate structure. Parts of the building are, in the way of their earlier projects, all their own work – some tiles in the cafe were cast only last week, in their workshop, and the light shades above are from the Granby workshop that Assemble helped set up in Liverpool. The height of the main water tank is increased by adding a timber structure, treated with a solution of vinegar and iron wool until it acquires an alchemical likeness to the dark metal. “I found the recipe on YouTube,” says Adam Willis, the Assemble member responsible.The building announces itself with a generous portico formed by propping one of the white-cube galleries on slender legs the gallery’s exterior is clad in a customised system of corrugated cement board, a material more often used on farm buildings, washed to the colour of verdigris. It forms part of loose assemblage of kindred volumes, such as the water tanks and boxy chimney, workaday but handsome.The whole is a wandering experience revolving around a double-height internal court that can be used for both exhibitions and events. You pass through a rich range of surfaces and volumes, with light coming from different directions – above, sideways – and in different ways. The rooms are ambiguous, given an outdoors-indoors feel by their hard materials, and poised between construction, art and furniture. “People get confused,” as Assemble’s Paloma Strelitz says, “as to what’s old, what’s new, what’s art and what’s not.”Two miles west, on the thoroughfare that changes from New Cross Road through a couple of other names to Peckham Road, the South London Gallery is opening an annexe across the road from its main premises. This occupies an 1867 fire station, later used as a sausage factory. It has been converted by 6a architects, who extended the gallery in 2010, and who can also claim to be godparents to Assemble, as 6a’s partner Tom Emerson was an influential teacher of the younger ones when they were still students. You can see a common sensibility. There’s a shared appreciation of the as-found – the brickwork is cleaned, but not so much as to lose its patina, and a fireplace is left hanging in the air, where a floor was removed to allow a hall for a new stair. Ornamental detail is skilfully restored by the contractors Lenguard. But 6a’s design is more direct than Assemble’s. They make one big and decisive move: the staircase, a refined version of a fire escape in white-painted steel, that unfolds upwards from the entrance towards the light. From here you reach a stack of cellular rooms, now used as galleries, an archive, education space, and studios for artists-in-residence that are gently modified versions of the original structure.The thought given to detail is exceptional. The radius of the handrails and the way they turn corners, the coffering of the structure under the flights and landings, the transparency of the latticed risers, the use of precast concrete for the treads so as to blunt the noise of footsteps – all combine to create subtle rhythms of practical elements and harmonies of delicacy and strength. There’s a beautiful moment at the bottom, where the stair meets brick paving whose diagonal grooves were originally designed to give grip to the hooves of the horses that pulled the fire engines. The repeating lines of the thin white balusters stand lightly on the similarly repeating lines of the dark bricks, one echoing the other.The wish, says Stephanie Macdonald of 6a, was to make it “immediately apparent and accessible”, in order to serve the gallery’s successful programme of embedding itself in its neighbourhood. The existence of the mother gallery across the road relieves the annexe of the need for a reception space, shop or cafe and care has been taken to minimise the paraphernalia of announcement that you usually get in such places. You can just walk straight in and see the art. Big doors can, if desired, open up the front ground level gallery directly to the pavement.Both works are objets trouvés. The South London Gallery’s addition started with a miraculous phone call to its director Margot Heller from an anonymous donor who owned the fire station and wanted to give it to the gallery. The Goldsmiths project began when Richard Noble, then head of its art department, saw the disused water tanks and thought they could help him realise his dream of opening a gallery. Their conception had the spirit of happenstance. In both projects, despite the highly deliberate and unspontaneous process of designing buildings, this spirit lives on."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5b1fc988c0f7909a93406299fa5d5db2d85025e/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3aa2121d9303f456d89135b9c24e0179","title":"goodwood revival festival in pictures","story":"The three-day classic car racing festival in West Sussex celebrates the mid-20th century heyday of the sport"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8092560af490fd6333887d31f3d0679b5e2cc2fe/65_517_2387_1432/master/2387.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d082e2e778d0cbfe4113ac4fc0475800","title":"photographer tony vaccaro in pictures","story":"The Pennsylvania-born photographer Michael A ‘Tony’ Vaccaro is best known for the powerful images he took in Europe during and after the second world war.

Oxford Circus underground station was evacuated, producing a crush of people as they made for the exits. Reports circulated of shots being fired, and photos and video appeared online of crowds fleeing the area, with heavily armed police officers heading in the opposite direction. Amid the panic, it was unclear where exactly the threat was emanating from, or whether there might be a number of attacks going on simultaneously, as had occurred in Paris two years earlier. Armed police stormed Selfridges department store, while shoppers were instructed to evacuate the building. Inside the shop at the time was the pop star Olly Murs, who tweeted to nearly 8 million followers: “Fuck everyone get out of Selfridge now gun shots!!” As shoppers in the store made for the exits, others were rushing in at the same time, producing a stampede.Smartphones and social media meant that this whole event was recorded, shared and discussed in real time. The police attempted to quell the panic using their own Twitter feed, but this was more than offset by the sense of alarm that was engulfing other observers. Far-right campaigner Tommy Robinson tweeted that this “looks like another jihad attack in London”. The Daily Mail unearthed an innocent tweet from 10 days earlier, which had described a “lorry stopped on a pavement in Oxford Street”, and used this as a basis on which to tweet “Gunshots fired” as armed police officers surrounded Oxford Circus station after “lorry ploughs into pedestrians”. The media were not so much reporting facts, as serving to synchronise attention and emotion across a watching public.Around an hour after the initial evacuation of Oxford Circus, the police put out a statement that “to date police have not located any trace of any suspects, evidence of shots fired or casualties”. It subsequently emerged that nine people required treatment in hospital for injuries sustained in the panic, but nothing more serious had yet been discovered. A few minutes later, the London Underground authority tweeted that stations had reopened and trains were running normally. There were no guns and no terrorists.What had caused this event? The police had received numerous calls from members of the public reporting gunshots on the underground and at street level, and had arrived within six minutes ready to respond. But the only violence that anyone had witnessed with their eyes was a scuffle on an overcrowded rush-hour platform, as two men bumped into each other, and a punch or two was thrown. While it remained unclear what had caused the impression of shots being fired, the scuffle had been enough to lead the surrounding crowd to retreat suddenly in fear, producing a wave of rapid movement that was then amplified as it spread along the busy platform and through the station. Given that there had been terrorist attacks in London earlier in the year and others reportedly foiled by the police, it is not hard to understand how panic might have spread in such confined spaces. Nobody would expect people to act in accordance with the facts in the heat of the moment, as a mass of bodies are hurtling and screaming around them. Where rapid response is essential, bodily instinct takes hold.Following the Oxford Circus incident, local shopkeepers demanded the installation of a “Tokyo-style” loudspeaker system in the surrounding streets to allow the police to communicate with entire crowds all at once. The idea gained little traction but did partly diagnose the problem. Where events are unfolding rapidly and emotions are riding high, there is a sudden absence of any authoritative perspective on reality. In the digital age, that vacuum of hard knowledge becomes rapidly filled by rumours, fantasy and guesswork, some of which is quickly twisted and exaggerated to suit a preferred narrative. Fear of violence can be just as disruptive a force as actual violence, and it can be difficult to quell once it is at large.Given sufficient speed, virality can generate fear and conflict out of thin air. Research recently published by Warwick University showed a correlation between anti-refugee hate crimes in Germany and levels of Facebook use, indicating the danger and paranoia that rapid peer-to-peer information transmission can manufacture. Facebook has also been implicated in ethnic violence in Sri Lanka, Myanmar and India, due to online rumours triggering physical mobilisations and confrontations.Events such as these distil something about the times in which we live, when speed of reaction often takes precedence over slower and more cautious assessments. As we become more attuned to “real time” media, we inevitably end up placing more trust in sensation and emotion than in evidence. Knowledge becomes more valued for its speed and impact than for its cold objectivity, and – as studies of Twitter content have confirmed – emotive falsehood often travels faster than fact. In situations of physical danger, where time is of the essence, rapid reaction makes sense. But the influence of “real time” data now extends well beyond matters of security. News, financial markets, friendships and work engage us in a constant flow of information, making it harder to stand back and construct a more reliable or consensual portrait of any of them. The threat lurking in this is that otherwise peaceful situations can come to feel dangerous, until eventually they really are.In the context of rising populism, and the accompanying syndromes denounced as “post-truth” and “tribalism”, it is common to blame political turbulence on voters giving vent to their feelings. But telling people to keep their emotions in check, and bow down before their more rational superiors, is scarcely an appealing or effective message. To criticise populists and their supporters in these terms is to avoid confronting the much larger question of why feeling might have become a more important navigational aid in the 21st century. Rather than criticise people for a lack of self-control, how might we understand the historical transition that has turned feeling into such a potent political force?This question returns us to some foundational philosophical issues. The modern world was founded on two fundamental distinctions, both inaugurated in the mid-17th century: between mind and body, and between war and peace. These binaries have been gradually weakening for more than 100 years. The rise of psychology and psychiatry in the late 19th century brought mind and body into closer proximity to each other, demonstrating how our thoughts are influenced by nervous impulses and feelings. The invention of aerial bombing in the early 20th century meant that war came to include techniques for terrifying and policing civilian populations.These two distinctions – between mind and body, and war and peace – now appear to have lost credibility altogether, with the result that we experience conflict intruding into everyday life with increasing regularity. Since the 1990s, rapid advances in neuroscience have elevated the brain over the mind as the main way by which we understand ourselves, demonstrating the importance of emotion and physiology to all decision making. Meanwhile, new forms of violence have emerged, in which states are attacked by non-state groups (such as Islamic State), interstate conflicts are fought using nonmilitary means (such as cyberwarfare), and the distinction between policing and military intervention becomes blurred. Our condition is one of nervous states, with iniduals and governments existing in a state of constant and heightened alertness, relying increasingly on feeling rather than fact.When we speak of feeling something, this can mean two different things. First, there is physical sensation, including pleasure and pain, which is crucial for navigating our environment. Our nervous system receives sensations from the outside world that are used to coordinate our bodies and instinctive movements. The brilliance of our neurological network is that it facilitates immediate response to new information, whether that be from our physical circumstances or our internal organs. The brain manages sensory impressions extremely rapidly, offering among other things a crucial defence against external threats. Inidual sensations may not count as knowledge or facts, but they are an indispensable form of data, which we rely on almost constantly.Second, there are feelings in the sense of emotions. These are experiences that we are capable of consciously reflecting on and articulating. We have a wide vocabulary for naming and expressing these feelings. We communicate them physically in our facial expressions and body language. They tell us important things about our relationships, lifestyles, desires and identities. Feelings of this sort present themselves to our conscious selves, such that we actually notice them, even if we can’t control them. Emotions can now be captured and algorithmically analysed (“sentiment analysis”) thanks to the behavioural data that digital technologies collect. And yet feelings of this sort are not welcome everywhere. In many contexts, an accusation of being “emotional” carries the implication that someone has lost objectivity and given way to irrational forces.Feelings are how we orient ourselves, while also providing a reminder of shared humanity. Our capacity to feel pain, empathy and love is fundamental to how and why we care about each other. But as examples such as the Oxford Circus panic demonstrate, survival instincts and nerves are not always reliable. The information feelings convey in the moment can conflict starkly with the facts that are subsequently established. The crucial quality of feelings – their immediacy – is also what makes them potentially misleading, spawning overreactions and fear. Unscrupulous politicians and businesses have long exploited our instincts and emotions to convince us to believe or buy things that, on more careful reflection, we needn’t have done. Real-time media, available via mobile technologies, exacerbate this potential, meaning that we spend more of our time immersed in a stream of images and sensations, with less time for reflection or dispassionate analysis. If politics and public debate have become more emotional, as so many observers have claimed, this is as much a reflection on the speed and relentlessness of current media technologies as anything else.During the 17th century, a number of European scholars produced ideas and institutions that aimed to regulate feelings, on the basis that they were untrustworthy and possibly dangerous. The French philosopher René Descartes treated physical sensations with great suspicion, in contrast to rational principles belonging to the mind. The English political theorist Thomas Hobbes argued that the central purpose of the state was to eradicate feelings of mutual fear and suspicion that could otherwise trigger violence. In the same era, pioneering communities of merchants and scientists introduced strict new rules for how their impressions should be recorded and spoken of, to avoid exaggeration and distortion, using numbers and public record-keeping. They would later become known as experts, and their ability to keep personal feelings separate from their observations was one of their distinguishing traits.This era produced the intellectual building blocks of the modern age. Contemporary notions of truth, scientific expertise, public administration, experimental evidence and progress are all legacies of the 17th century. The elevation of reason above feeling was hugely productive, indeed world-changing in its implications. And yet it wasn’t simply knowledge that was being sought it was also peace. To this day, much of the value of objectivity in public life, as manifest in statistics or news reports, is that it provides a basis for agreement among people who otherwise have little in common. A society that recognises the authority of facts must also establish certain professions and institutions that are beyond the fray of politics, sentiment or opinion.That 17th-century project has run aground, with the results we see around us today. Those very same professions on which the modern technocratic edifice was first built are now lumped together as a “liberal elite”. Experts and facts no longer seem capable of settling arguments to the extent that they once did, while trust in the media in particular is in free fall. Objective claims about the economy, society, the human body and even nature can no longer be so successfully insulated from emotions and identities, whether on the left or the right. Consequently, the governmental institutions of the EU and Washington, DC are widely viewed as centres of elite privilege, which serve themselves rather than the public.Events such as the “March for Science” which took place in March 2017 to defend science against political attacks showcase experts engaged in their own form of political mobilisation, appealing to public sentiment like any other movement. When technocrats do attempt to remain dispassionate, they run the risk of looking smug or aloof. This indicates that the politics of feeling is now unavoidable, whether one likes that or not.Some feelings have greater political potency than others. Feelings of nostalgia, resentment, anger and fear have disrupted the status quo. Populist uprisings, as manifest in the victories of Donald Trump, the Brexit campaign and nationalist surges across Europe, are cases of this, and have been widely criticised for their denigration of expertise and harnessing of emotional discontents. But these are symptoms of a problem and not a cause. Inidual leaders and campaigns will come and go, but the conditions that enabled them will endure. Rather than simply hurl more facts at these disturbances, we would do better to understand their underlying drivers. It’s no good simply declaring that experts are in possession of truth, and must therefore be obeyed. We need to understand why the ideal of expertise has lost credibility.The aspiration to “objectivity” is in particular trouble in the economic realm. But there are good reasons why this is so. Objective indicators of progress, such as GDP growth, conceal deep fractures within society. In the US, for example, half of the population has experienced no real income growth since the 1970s, making the very notion of economic “growth” a lie. Unemployment is falling across much of Europe and the US at the moment, but this much-celebrated fact conceals the rising number of people who are being eliminated (or absenting themselves) from the labour market for reasons of ill-health, exhaustion and addiction, or taking jobs that are far inferior to ones they held in the past.The resentment that has been directed against “liberal elites” living in major cities is not simply irrational but reflects some basic realities about how people experience inequality as a moral force, indeed a judgment. The economy isn’t just a domain for the satisfaction of objective needs and demands (as economists see it) but also one where we acquire status and self-respect. This is true the whole way across the income spectrum. Feelings of resentment or anger are not the preserve of some mythical white working class.Yet certain demographics clearly experience far greater cultural and emotional distance from “liberal elites” than others. As party politics becomes more professionalised, it becomes harder to see any marked difference between elected representatives and their expert advisers the state looks to many like a game being played by insiders.Feelings of disenfranchisement are not merely economic, but have acquired a bodily and existential dimension: people’s lives are being shaped by ergent health, life expectancy and encounters with physical and psychological pain. Pessimism emanates most strongly from bodies that are ageing faster and suffering more – further evidence that we cannot tidily separate how things appear to our minds from how they feel to our bodies.One could leave the story there, and simply lament the decline of modern reason, as if emotions have overwhelmed the citadel of truth like barbarians. The most vehement defenders of scientific rationality claim that alien forces – liars, demagogues, Kremlin trolls, “postmodernists” or the uneducated public – have been granted too much power, and need to be eliminated from politics all over again.In addition to its naivety regarding the roots of populism, this response ignores a second pivotal historical development that is no less important for shaping the modern world. The desire to harness emotions and physical instincts for political purposes also has a long history, producing its own centres of elite control, but with one crucial difference: it operates in the service of conflict rather than of peace. At the height of the Enlightenment, as reason appeared to be triumphing once and for all, the French Revolution demonstrated the immense military power that could be unleashed by popular sentiment.Modern warfare creates miasmas of emotion, information, misinformation, deception and secrecy. It mobilises infrastructure, civilian populations, industry and intelligence services in innovative ways. The rise of aerial warfare meant that problems of civilian morale and real-time decision making acquired greater urgency, producing new techniques for gauging and managing popular sentiment and sensing incoming threats. It was this paranoia that led to the invention of the digital computer and later the internet. During wartime, information becomes valued for its speed and impact as much as its public credibility. One of the principle justifications that the George W Bush administration gave for water-boarding was that information needed to be extracted from prisoners quickly, before it was too late. This is a whole new way of handling the question of truth, which often runs entirely counter to the original scientific ideal of reason and expertise.Recently this spirit of warfare has been fed into civilian life as the emphasis on “real time” knowledge has become a feature of the business world, of the financial sector and the big Silicon Valley companies. The speed of knowledge and decision making becomes crucial, and public agreement is sidelined in the process. Rather than trusting experts, on the basis that they are neutral and outside the fray, we have come to rely on services that are fast, but whose public status is unclear.The ideology of entrepreneurship is a contributory factor here. Since the 1970s, organisations have been exhorted to become more “agile” in the face of change, while business “disruptors” focus on seeking to exploit new knowledge and ideas before their rivals. Speed is of the essence. Among traders, whose skill lies in exploiting minuscule price movements, sometimes just fractions of a second before others. Marketing analysts aim at detecting trends as early as possible. These are exercises in feeling and sensing, rather than of reasoning. And yet nobody ever accused an advertising agency of being “post-truth”.The promise of expertise, first made in the 17th century, is to provide us with a version of reality that we can all agree on. The promise of digital computingis to maximise sensitivity to a changing environment. Timing becomes everything. Experts produce facts Google and Twitter offer trends. As the objective view of the world recedes, it is replaced by intuition as to which way things are heading now. This nervous state offers more emotional stimulation and sensitivity, but for the same reason it is unsettling and disruptive of peaceful situations. Meanwhile the question of who might be seeking to trigger specific feelings and why lurks in the background.The ultimate danger of this condition is the one identified by Hobbes in the 17th century. Telling people that they are secure is of limited value if they sense that they are in situations of danger. The spread of post-traumatic stress disorder (a syndrome first associated with war) is one example of how symptoms of combat are becoming features of civilian life. Symptoms arise due to threats that are constant and overpowering, which can just as easily mean school bullying or controlling relationships. Wherever one stands on debates surrounding “free speech”, “trigger warnings” or “safe spaces”, it is unarguable that the boundary between “civil” and “violent” conduct has become much harder to draw – an effect of neuroscientific progress as much as of identity politics. The sudden appearance of “weaponisation” as a concept (for instance that Facebook has been “weaponised” by political campaigns) shows that once-peaceful relations are being reconceived as violent. And as the metaphor of “war” spreads (as in the “war on drugs”, “culture war” or “information war”), so trust in the institutions that make up civil society deteriorates. For those intent on sabotage, this is entirely the point.When reason itself is in peril, there is an understandable instinct to try to revive or rescue something from the past. It has become a cliche to celebrate the rugged inidualism, cold rationality and truth-seeking courage of the scientific pioneers. But in our current age, when intelligence and calculation are performed faster and more accurately by machines than by people, an alternative ideal is needed. Perhaps the great virtue of the scientific method is not that it is smart (which is now an attribute of phones, cities and fridges) but that it is slow and careful. Maybe it is not more intelligence that we need right now, but less speed and more care, both in our thinking and our feeling. After all, emotions (including anger) can be eminently reasonable, if they are granted the time to be articulated and heard. Conversely, advanced intelligence can be entirely unreasonable, when it moves at such speed as to defy any possibility of dialogue.Democracies are being transformed by the power of feeling in ways that cannot be ignored or reversed. Separating rationality from emotion is no longer possible. This is our reality now. We can’t reverse history, and nor can we circumvent it this new era needs to be traversed with unusual judgment and care. Rather than denigrate the influence of feelings in politics today, we might need to get better at listening to and learning from them •• Nervous Statesis published by Cape on 20 September.

In his new book, Paris Echo, the narrative is shared between an American post-doctoral researcher and a Moroccan teenager.Does everyone have an alter ego?Not in any literal sense but I constantly think about different versions of myself, about how I might have been had I made one different choice at some moment in my life. You think about this more as you get older. And history might also have been so different had Napoleon not provoked the Prussians – he probably had a bad headache that morning.Compare your 17-year-old self with who you are now… is your character essentially the same?I don’t think so, no. Certain reflexes have become hard-wired, the circuits became embedded in my thirties. But I feel pretty different. As a young man, I was very, very, very shy, nervous and highly strung. Now I am none of those things. It’s as if I had used up a lifetime’s supply of nervous excitement and anxiety by the time I was 45. My children laugh at me because when asked if I’m excited about going on holiday, I say: “I don’t do excitement.”How much have you changed as a\u0026nbspwriter?There’s more air now, more room for the reader. I’m less dictatorial. I used to write as if to say: here’s something you don’t understand. No one has explained it before: this is exactly how it was. This is what you have got to get. I’m better at dialogue. It took me a long time to figure out what it was for: it’s to give information to the reader in a different form so their eye doesn’t get wearied by the paragraphs. I used to think it was about imitating the way people speak.The novel raises a question about how we digest history. Does not knowing about a place’s history blind you to it?You get more out of life if you understand where people and cities and you yourself have come from. It’s a lifelong journey. Most people do not get interested in their family history until middle age, especially if they come from a happy family. My interest is in how someone of my generation fits into European history. A lot of my books have been trying to puzzle that out.In this novel you write about a subject\u0026nbsprarely written about in fiction: French involvement in the deportation of Jews.Jews were put on the train to Auschwitz from Drancy in the northern outskirts of Paris. Drancy was initially under French control, but French cooperation with the Germans in the Holocaust was not formally admitted for 50 years. Younger French historians argue that, although the French cooperated in the deportation of 80,000 Jews, this was a low number compared with other occupied countries. They say they’ve come clean about it – there’s a bronze on the banks of the Seine, a small museum opposite Drancy, and President Chirac has publicly apologised for French complicity. What more do you want? That’s one way of looking at it. The other way of looking at it would be to ask: why did you find it so difficult? Wouldn’t it have been better for your mental health as a country if you’d been more candid 50 years earlier?How patriotic are you? I liked your distinction in the novel between French and British patriotism.I’m patriotic, to an extent. That’s a very British answer, isn’t it? I cheer the England football team like crazy, but am wary of Nigel Farage and that nonsense. I’m proud of British achievements in arts, science and discovery. But there’ll always be this slight reservation you won’t find in France because the so-called elite believes France to be unique with a mission to teach the world. This is not what the British intellectual class thinks about Britain. I’m not in any way sneering at the French, but it is a profound difference.If you could be born again as another nationality, which would you choose?I can think of lots I would not want to be. I wouldn’t want to live in China – it looks so smoggy. In Australia, you’d be thinking about coming to Europe, which would be unsettling. I’d be very happy to be French, although I’d miss having France as a neighbour. A great thing about being English is you have this other country, 18 miles away, which is so intriguingly and dramatically different. I don’t think French people feel the same way about England.What books are on your bedside table?Romain Gary’s novel The Kites and Forgotten Victory by Gary Sheffield, a history of the first world war.Does a novelist ever retire?I know writers in their 60s who have told me, candidly, that they are writing only to help pay the bills and no longer have any real zip or desire. But I always feel that the glorious thing is just beyond my reach…Like those girls on the metro?You can learn so much as you go along.

But on Friday unions representing cabin crew in Italy, Portugal, Belgium, Spain and the Netherlands threatened in a joint letter to extend the summer of industrial action into the autumn.Unions locked in a long-running battle with the airline said they would hold “the biggest strike action the company has ever seen” unless changes were made to their conditions. After a meeting in Rome, unions demanded that staff were given local contracts under local law rather than Irish contracts, which Ryanair uses across its European workforce.They said the strike would take place in the last week of September and that a decision on whether to go ahead would be made by 13 September.“We want to solve this. We don’t want to strike,” said Fernando Gandra, director at Portuguese union SNPVAC. He said the two Italian unions also had pilot members and that the unions would invite pilots and ground staff across Europe to join their cabin crew colleagues in the strike.“The board and management of Ryanair are committed to union recognition, and working constructively with our people and their unions to address their reasonable concerns, as long as this does not alter Ryanair’s low-cost model or our ability to offer low fares to our customers,” Ryanair’s chief people officer Eddie Wilson said in a statement on the Dublin fleet plans.The airline said it had informed 300 pilots and cabin crew in Dublin that their jobs were now safe."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21382daea48faee90773357bb6e8369358978745/0_137_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6d664f1dc1e04c0bcff3ab748034b47f","title":"its time to forget stereotypes realities singledom","story":"It costs more to fly solo. That’s according to the Good Housekeeping Institute, which last week released a study claiming single life can cost people up to £2,000 a year more. Even as someone who’s spent a good chunk of time single, and felt the occasional sting of shelling out more for hotels, it was hard not to raise an eyebrow at the figures: the extra costs of luxury gym memberships and Med cruises feel very much like a first-world problem.But part of me was still glad to see this undoubtedly superficial take. As a society, we barely discuss the realities and implications of singledom. In pop culture singledom is almost invariably represented as an easily fixed unhappy state, a step along the way to getting happily hitched. We know little about the long-term singles: how many relish their freedom and independence, and how many feel burdened with loneliness and hope to meet the love of their life? To what extent is singledom driving social infertility – not having children because you haven’t met Mr or Ms Right? And if so, what does it mean for an ageing society in which we expect family members to care for their older relatives?The single stereotypes abound. For men, it’s the dysfunctional fortysomething still living with his parents. For women, the callous career woman – who could forget former Australian prime minister Julia Gillard being accused of being “deliberately barren”? Or the crazy cat lady living alone, slowly losing her mind. There’s shame and stigma attached to fessing up to being either happily or unhappily single: would I have written this column a couple of years ago when I was on my own?Beyond the stereotypes come the pop dating theories. In Date-onomics, Jon Birger posits that a new gender imbalance is set to create more unsatisfied singletons. Studies show that we are likely to couple up with people who broadly resemble ourselves in terms of class and education. But men seem less keen to “marry up” and women to “marry down”. With female university graduates now outnumbering men in many countries – women in the UK are a third more likely to go to university than men – Birger suggests we may see more blue-collar men and more female graduates unable to find romance. Cue an industry of self-help books and coaching for professional women in their early 30s struggling to meet Mr Right.Pop theories aside, there’s been remarkably little robust research on singledom and social infertility. (There are endless pieces on the theme, but few identify just how many people are unable to find partners.)While the data may not be great, there are clues. For men, there’s a sharp socioeconomic gradient to being single. Men from disadvantaged backgrounds are twice as likely to live alone in their early 40s than those from rich families, which puts them at further financial disadvantage. Some of that is due to higher levels of relationship breakdown, but there is also a significant minority of men from disadvantaged backgrounds who find it difficult to meet a partner in the first place.For women, the trend runs the other way. University-educated women born in 1970 were almost twice as likely as women with low levels of education to be childless at the age of 42. As women have become more educated, the proportion of women remaining childless has increased from one in 10 of those born in 1946 to just under one in five of those born in 1970. Cue the Daily Mail stereotypes of career-driven women too selfish and picky to settle down and have\u0026nbspkids.So far, so in line with the pop theories. But what’s surprising is that social infertility – not having children because of a failure to meet the right partner – appears to be almost as big a problem for educated men as it is women.Love, family and relationships only feature in policy debates about how we live to the extent that they concern children’s lives. Our attitude has always been that – outside medical infertility – finding love and family life in the first place is an entirely private matter and if you don’t, well, so what.But social infertility exists, and we should be talking about it more, from whether there should be publicly funded fertility advice for women looking to conceive alone, to the realities of ageing without children, to whether we should be investing in research into how to extend women’s fertility s in the first place. To do so, though, we need to be able to have healthy conversations about singledom that\u0026nbspgo beyond the painful, shaming\u0026nbspstereotypes of the undateable, the unloveable and the “deliberately barren”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/723ff02fae5aeefcf7fc1ddfba7d5bc02be190e4/0_80_4909_2946/master/4909.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1206fd848e6fea42af4c1880e40658a8","title":"blair and cameron up brexit creek without a paddle cartoon","story":"Former prime ministers survey the damage their decisions have wrought"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a5c9fc6fa4a13ccd82ed9f015a5211959ef46e6/0_0_5158_3439/master/5158.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=8fd402c24ac9f92671928ba355e1e841 1320w","title":"american animals review deft treatment shambolic heist","story":"A heart-pounding heist movie and a bantering conversation between real\u0026nbsplife and fiction, the debut drama by documentary director Bart Layton (The Imposter) is a great deal sharper – and more slickly executed – than the lunkheaded criminal debacle on which it is based.The setting is Lexington, Kentucky, 2004. An art student at Transylvania University, Spencer Reinhard (Barry Keoghan) has not launched into the world of academia with the burst of glory that he had expected. His childhood friend Warren Lipka (Evan Peters), on an athletic scholarship at a neighbouring college, is similarly disillusioned. When Spencer mentions the ultra-valuable rare books housed in his college library – including a volume of John James Audubon’s The Birds of America and a copy of Darwin’s On the Origin Of Species – a half-baked plan to steal them gradually gathers momentum. In addition to the actors playing Spencer and Warren, and their two co-conspirators Eric (Jared Abrahamson) and Chas (Blake Jenner), the film also deftly juggles interviews with the real members of what must surely be one of the most clueless criminal gangs in history.With its knotty tangle of unreliable witnesses offering often wildly conflicting accounts, the regular potshots over the fourth wall and the punchy use of music, there are obvious parallels with the recent I, Tonya.

So why are we still stuck with polite social realism and sniggery classism?Billy Liar always was a great night out. “A brand new kind of escapist entertainment,” the trailer blared when the film was released in 1963. But the escape it most literally concerned – one in which a northern funeral clerk might jump on a train and make it as a London scriptwriter – wasn’t then so far fetched. Adapted from his own novel by Keith Waterhouse, it arrived in a Britain giddy on the Beatles and grammar school upstarts like Billy. Social mobility brought the film to life. While director John Schlesinger was solidly Hampstead, Waterhouse was a dropout from Osmondthorpe Council School, Leeds, and star Tom Courtenay the son of a Hull dockworker. As the box office boomed, a daydreamer might have conjured up a British film industry filled with working-class actors and writers, maybe even directors and producers, too.Of course – spoiler warning – Billy never caught the train. The apparent golden age of social mobility would quickly sputter out. And the idea of this class calling the shots in British cinema? Rarely more than fantasy. Now, the mood is darker. In 2018, it can be hard finding working-class talent exerting any influence in the creative space of British film.Even the actors are vanishing. “We have got a big problem,” Equity president Maureen Beattie said recently of the lack of opportunities for working-class performers. Actors including Maxine Peake and Lesley Manville appeared at the BFI this spring to publicly highlight the crisis. Drama has been cut from the classroom, young actors priced out of training, a glum contest among those who remain for dwindling roles as gang members and sex workers.But actors are just part of an ecosystem. They can only play roles created by writers for films made by directors. And the story of working- class screenwriters is another with a glorious future behind it – the postwar era that produced Waterhouse also witnessed the black precision of Harold Pinter and the singular vision of Shelagh Delaney, writer of A Taste of Honey, finder of wonder in back streets and bedsits. It’s worth pausing just to consider how unlikely it would now be for a major British film to be written by a young woman from Salford with no university education.Feel free to start counting. Of course, British directors from working-class backgrounds make high‑profile films. Just not many – and these success stories tend to come with caveats. Danny Boyle made his first feature, Shallow Grave, nearly 25 years ago. Steve McQueen will open the London film festival in October with his much-anticipated thriller Widows, but his route from the London suburb of Hanwell to the red carpet came via the art world, which, like theatre, is more meritocratic than British film. And then there is Lynne Ramsay. For a director in a landscape of limited chances, the reward can be whispering campaigns. Ramsay, whose mother was a cleaner in Glasgow, acquired a reputation as difficult and volatile and all the other codewords used for working-class women who have an opinion. Her last film, the astonishing crime drama You Were Never Really Here, was wildly praised. It was also only her fourth feature film in nearly two decades.Move through the ranks of the business – past the actors, writers and directors – and eventually you reach the producers, development executives, the heads of production companies and funding bodies. Here at last are the decision-makers who shape everything British you see on a cinema screen. Socio-economically, it is a group drawn from the same pool as so many of our MPs, lawyers and journalists.It was ever thus and the 1960s didn’t change it. Legally, class is not a “protected characteristic” in the labour market – but then film is mostly lawless anyway, filled with opaque hiring practices and internships for those whose bills are paid by other means. From script readers up, the result has been a highly specialised gatekeeper class taking charge of endless safety-first development streams. Presented with working-class experiences, its members might just as well be listening to Finnish. The issue is not only people having a fair shot at the top jobs in British film also at stake are the films that never get made.A defining feature of the 60s working-class moment was youth – Delaney co-wrote the screenplay for A Taste of Honey at 22. The tradition endured: Ramsay was 29 when she made her first feature Ratcatcher, Shane Meadows 23 at the time of his, Small Time. Now, the industry’s risk aversion would slow any young film-maker – but the particular discomfort with these kinds of voices means an extra long spell in limbo. Director Deborah Haywood was 47 before she made her debut feature, this summer’s brilliantly off-kilter portrait of smalltown England, Pin Cushion. Colin O’Toole, winner of the 2018 Bafta for best British short with the tightly wound Cowboy Dave, is already 40 with a string of other shorts behind him. Meadows, by the way, effectively left British film in favour of TV 10 years ago.While it felt reasonable to hope that iPhones and YouTube – or at least cheap cameras and Vimeo – would provide cinema with a new generation of ordinary hotshots, the reality has been patchy. Gifted young directors have appeared online, many either working class or dealing with working-class life – Cecile Emeke, Aaron Dunleavy, Kibwe Tavares, Emma Gilbertson. But a well‑signposted bridge has yet to open between online creativity (nimble, democratic) and British cinema (nervous, arthritic).In 2018, class definitions are works in progress, old touchstones such as university degrees less meaningful, race and gender recognised as central. But to get lower-class characters on to a big screen, the safest bet remains being Ken Loach. Thank God for him – few directors have his heft, or could have made a film as vital as I, Daniel Blake. Things only get tricky when the industry sees Loach as a ticked box, apparently believing working-class people exist in a state of gritty social realism the way children think Victorians lived in black and white.Loach has always been more subtle than that. But what are missing are emotionally complex films about people who just happen to work in call centres – one exception that proves the rule is Debbie Tucker Green’s Second Coming, about a working-class black family touched by metaphysics. Most working-class people are neither thugs nor saints but as mixed-up as the average executive – and the best films hold two thoughts at once. Billy Liar was an absurdist frolic with a brutal punchline Ramsay’s eponymous Morvern Callar a blank young raver from a Scottish supermarket who became the heart of a shimmering Spanish road movie.But it is hard to contain multitudes when working-class lives are treated as a niche. It also defies demographics. With class, the situation has never been one in which a small group of people have been shut out of British film rather, a small group of people have shut themselves inside it. The consequences ripple through everything from the sniggery classism of Matthew Vaughn’s Kingsman movies to the British Board of Film Classification awarding a 15 certificate to the recent documentary A Northern Soul (too many “fucks” in the wrong accent) to the very cinemas in which prestige British films typically play, the expanding boutique chains Everyman, Picturehouse and Curzon.Economically, short-term salvation lies in the middle-class pound that extends to wine and gourmet popcorn. But the exclusion of the young, skint and state educated from a mass market art form is a shame – and flatly suicidal in the age of Netflix. If the problem is vast, a mirror of the whole British class system, it is also deceptively simple. People like to see people like themselves on screen and be able to afford a ticket. The prize for the solution could be just as huge – a plausible future for a British industry now clinking glasses as the iceberg looms• The BFI’s Working Class Heroes season at the Southbank, London SE1, begins tonight. bfi.org.uk."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18e021c095f2ca5a07c2184b4f190febfd877b96/371_112_2894_1737/master/2894.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aecb6dc7b98f98fddd43f17d0c4f0f5d","title":"john terry set to join spartak moscow","story":"John Terry is set to complete a surprise move to Spartak Moscow after reportedly accepting a two-year deal with the Russian side.

The almost 20-year friendship has been strong, with Kesolei saying “every Palauan has a story” of interaction with Taiwan, whether travelling there for a holiday, education or medical treatment.But Taiwan’s allies are slowly being chipped away, as China puts the pressure on and seeks to penalise those that recognise self-ruled Taiwan, which Beijing considers a Chinese territory. El Salvador switched its allegiance last month, and Burkina Faso and the Dominican Republic severed ties with Taiwan earlier this year.Those countries that continue to recognise Taiwan – particularly the six Taiwanese allies located in the Pacific, where China is seeking to increase its influence – are feeling the pressure.In November 2017, the Chinese government ordered tour operators to stop selling package tours to Palau, with reports that doing so could lead to fines.Some insist Palau has always been a blacklisted destination but that until recently the Chinese government turned a blind eye.Evan Rees, Asia-Pacific analyst at Stratfor, says China uses such bans – as well as the granting and withholding of Approved Destination Status (ADS) to countries – as “part of a larger toolkit for compelling behaviour”.Last year, South Korea was the subject of such a travel ban, after a row over its deployment of a US missile defence system, which had a devastating impact on tourism to the country during the PyeongChang Winter Olympics. One Palauan-based Chinese businessman said the word “Palau” had also been blocked as an internet search term in China.The impact of the ban on Palau has been stark.The number of tourists from China has plummeted so dramatically that one airline flying charter flights between China and Palau stopped flights at the end of August, because “the Chinese government made Palau an illegal tour destination possibly and most likely due to lack of diplomatic status”.Palauan tour operators and government officials bridle at suggestions the ban has brought Palau to its knees – there were still 9,000 visitor arrivals in July – but occupancy rates at hotels have dropped and businesses are hurting.At Elilai restuarant, which is heavily promoted as the “best restaurant in Palau” on billboards all over the island, I am the sole diner in a restaurant that could comfortably accommodate 50.Waitress Donita Rose Cagaoan-Tipay is apologetic about the empty room, saying it was the result of a “ban from China”, though she says she doesn’t know much more about it than that.“I asked my friend who is a Chinese tour guide, he said Palau and China, the governments are having a fight,” she explains.The empty restaurants are a far cry from 2014 and 2015, when charter flights from China began landing every day each carrying hundreds of tourists.Leilani Reklai says the impact on the island was overwhelming. “Guys were running around town buying land, getting cash in suitcases and buying everything in sight,” says Reklai, who is the president of Palau’s tourism association.Reklai owned two boats that took tour groups to the Rock Islands, the most famous of Palau’s tourist attractions, which before the Chinese boom would go out four days a week during peak season.“But for almost one year my guys were going out seven days a week” she says.“Some people were saying ‘This is the Chinese strategy, this is what they do, they are going to pour a lot of money in here, and get you addicted like it’s Coke and then turn off the faucet’. But of course, money was louder so people weren’t listening,” says Reklai.At 70, Francis Toribiong has had almost every job in the tourism business. He says the dip hurt “everybody”. Toribiong has been forced to sell a 25-bed hostel but says he got off relatively lightly.“There are so many young men who went to the development bank and borrowed hundreds of thousands of dollars to buy boats,” he says. Now, demand has dropped so much that they are lucky if they are able to make enough to cover fuel and the loan repayments.Despite the pain, most people agree the boom was unsustainable.At its peak in 2015, 169,000 tourists arrived in Palau and the country’s power, water and sewage systems struggled to cope. There was huge inflation, and the price of food and rent skyrocketed.Kevin Mesebeluu, director of the bureau of tourism, says the China ban may be “a blessing in disguise”, giving Palau a chance to reevaluate its approach to tourism.“The president has been very clear about the direction,” he said. “High-value, low-impact sustainable tourism.”Indeed, the country was heading down this path before the ban came into effect. In 2015, Palau’s president, Tommy Remengesau, announced a reduction in the number of charter flights between China and Palau, in response to environmental and social concerns.Reklani thinks this decision, which came into effect gradually, means Palau escaped much more serious financial trouble. “We definitely got out in time, this pain we’re going through, it would have been so much worse,” she says.Since the China ban, Remengesau has reiterated his commitment to Taiwan, telling the Nikkei Asian Review that while China was an “important partner” Palau had “more in common with Taiwan”.A statement from his spokesperson was even more defiant, suggesting Palau would not bow to pressure: “Palau is a country of laws, it is a democracy and we make our own decisions.”However, there are others who would not mind seeing Palau switch diplomatic horses.“It’s about time that we focus our interests and views towards the People’s Republic of China,” said Senate president Hokkons Baules in July at the groundbreaking ceremony for a Chinese-backed resort, according to the Island Times.The China-Taiwan question is expected to be a key issue at the next presidential election in 2020. But the Taiwanese ambassador to Palau, Wallace Chow, says he is not worried about the relationship, saying it is “very solid”.Speaking to  during an event for 25 Taiwanese youth ambassadors who are spending several days in Palau as part of a “soft power” mission, Chow says it is this “down-to-earth, to the people, for the people” approach that will keep Palau onside.But Palauans may also be persuaded by the more than $10m in aid provided by Taiwan to the country each year, reminders of which are dotted around the island as signs announce that road or building projects are funded by Taiwanese grant money.“I’m very confident that the Palauan people know who is their true partner and which side their bread is buttered,” said Chow.Under the slowly moving fans, Kesolei says he does not expect a diplomatic switch anytime soon. “It’s part of our culture that we are very loyal to our friends,” he says.Palauans also like the image of themselves as a country that is standing up to a superpower."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7289c288ede69e2e8b85a37244a2db9406187502/0_545_4650_2790/master/4650.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=75a884829a07c5ae29ce8dc7ddf9b4ae","title":"should i limit the amount of time my child spends with their mobile phone","story":"Children and parents may not agree on how much screen time is acceptable, but some ground rules about usage and online security will make for a more harmonious householdIt’s an argument virtually every modern parent has had with their child: the battle to prise them away from the mobile phone they’re glued to. For children, a smartphone is a window to games, videos and constant interaction with their friends. But for parents, it can feel like a minefield, raising questions about whether their access should be restricted and how to keep them safe as they learn to navigate the digital world. But who’s in the right?First, it’s worth bearing in mind that screen time can be beneficial. Peter Twining, professor of education (futures) at the Open University, conducted research between 2015 and 2017 into mobile phone use among five- to 11-year-olds, and his findings about what children use phones to access may surprise parents who assume they’re just playing games. “We tend not to recognise the value of what they do on their mobile devices, but they often use them to extend an interest – for instance, if they’re interested in gymnastics, they’ll watch videos of routines and try to learn from them,” he says.This difference in understanding of children’s mobile phone usage may help to explain the substantial disparity in opinion between children and parents about how much screen time is acceptable. According to a survey of 1,000 adults and 1,000 children aged nine to 15 conducted by Tesco Mobile, the mean amount of screen time that adults thought appropriate for children was 1.75 hours, with children believing it to be 3.34 hours.But at least both parties do recognise that there should be limits. However, recent research suggests that instead of setting specific time limits for usage, such as a maximum of two hours per day, it’s actually the nature of the screen time that matters. For instance, passively flicking through social media posts is less beneficial than actively playing games, which can improve problem-solving skills and persistence. A study conducted by the University of Michigan on four to 11-year-olds found that “how children use the devices, not how much time they spend on them, is the strongest predictor of emotional or social problems connected with screen addiction.”Twining agrees, saying: “I’m less concerned about screen time than about the nature of the interactions around the screen. The screen should become a shared focal point for interaction within the family rather than an inidual activity. The screen shouldn’t be an alternative to socialising with your child, it should be an enhancement to it.”Some experts believe that rather than setting concrete limits to screen time, it may be more useful to establish general house rules about the context of phone use. “Many families find a unified screen time approach beneficial,” says chartered psychologist Dr Sarah Kuppen, author of Little Kids, Big Dilemmas: Your parenting problems solved by science.“A media plan sets limits on screen usage to ensure children access a wide range of daily activities. Restrictions sometimes include screen-free zones, screen-free times or device curfews. However, these should be adapted and updated over time.”According to Dr Linda Papadopoulos – a child psychologist and ambassador for Internet Matters, a not-for-profit organisation dedicated to children’s online security – these family guidelines are crucial. “You need to set a good example with your own device and any rules you create, be careful not to break them yourself. For instance, we never have our phones at the dinner table so we can all interact together offline.”Other suggestions from Papadopoulos include only letting children have their phones after their homework, and never allowing them to sleep with the device. She advises explaining the reasons behind these rules. “We know it’s a bad idea to use the phone just before bed because it causes sleep disturbance, so they need to get off it at least a couple of hours before. Equally, we know if a child is studying and their phone is pinging next to them, they won’t consolidate memory, so the chapter they’re reading will take twice as long to absorb. The more kids understand why you’re making these rules, the more they’ll live by them.“And if you still feel they’re using their phones too much, technology can actually help – there are apps where children are rewarded for taking time away from their tech.”Twining believes that parents know what’s appropriate, so they should trust their instincts. “They’re sometimes nervous about exercising it, but parents usually have really good common sense,” he says. “If children are on their phone all the time, clearly that’s too much – you want them to do other activities, too. The key is finding a balance.”Visit Tesco Mobile for more information and content on families and mobile"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5274848e4e0be4abbac76fb3a11e637550fbba17/0_22_6303_3783/master/6303.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=ba209473a0a9eb36611c48c4efc2b0e3 1240w","title":"knickers truth about trying open relationship","story":"Non-monogamy seems to be having a moment. Would it work for us?The first time my boyfriend, Sam, slept with someone else, I was intrigued. “What was it like?” I asked. He sighed: “Fine.” I had so many questions: where, who, what did she look like, but he refused to answer any more when I asked about her knickers. (“I’m just wondering if they were nice?” I said. “Like, standard M\u0026ampS or Rosie for Autograph M\u0026ampS?”).Sam and I have been together for almost a year now, and I don’t think he took me seriously when I first, briefly, mentioned that perhaps monogamy wasn’t for me (“I thought it was just one of your affectations,” he said). But as time has worn on, we’ve butted up against my resolve like rubber ducks against an iceberg. “I feel like you’re doing it because it’s…” he looks disgusted… “trendy.”Non-monogamy seems to be having a moment. An umbrella term, it encompasses the range of relationship configurations that can come about if you decide that “one for life” isn’t quite for you.“We’re finally rejecting old binaries,” says the comedian Rosie Wilby, author of Is Monogamy Dead? “As we think in a more sophisticated way about gender and gender identity, and about sexuality, it’s natural that we’ve also begun to question the structure of our relationships. All those conversations feed into one another.”I’ve never been a hardline monogamist. In my last (monogamous) relationship, I always contended that if my partner slept with someone else, it wouldn’t necessarily mean that it was, y’know, done. It seemed reductive to boil down the suppers, red-wine-stained kisses, whispered secrets, adventures and grievances and confidences we shared, the sheer everything of a relationship, to a shag. If our relationship existed on so many levels – friends, teammates, confidantes, lovers – then it couldn’t be undone by one act and that’s quite a noble thought, isn’t it?Polyamory has been getting a lot of press. It basically means having concurrent relationships with more than one person. You might have one primary, but everyone you choose to be with is more or less equal in your affections. My preferred configuration isn’t actually that radical: ethical non-monogamy is basically a good old-fashioned open relationship. There would only ever be two of us in it, but I’d like to trust that person so implicitly, and value them so wholeheartedly, that if they slept with someone else it wouldn’t damage us. I’d like for the other person to trust and value me just as much so that if I did the same, we’d be able to look at it for what it is: a banal act that is fun or weird or intimate or exciting, but ultimately not a threat to our harmony.“A sort of flexitarian approach to relationships,” I said to Sam. “You have a primary partner, and they’re the important one… ” He rolled his eyes, and I told him he was being too middle class about it. “Me just wanting a normal relationship, where you don’t sleep with other people? I’m not sure that’s quite Volvo territory,” he replied.Finally, he admitted to me: “Maybe because of the traditional expectations that are put on men, it’s more difficult for us to be open about it. There’s something a bit embarrassing about the woman you’re dating wanting to sleep with other people as if maybe you’re inadequate.”Earlier this year we’d reached something of an impasse, so I took Sam to a talk that Wilby was giving above a pub in London. Soon enough, we were packed in with 83 others – mainly slightly older couples and groups of female friends.“It’s quite a scary concept,” Wilby said. “Because we don’t like the idea of our partner being with someone else. But generally, it’s because we’ve been taught to believe this means that our partner will leave us. Of course,” she continued, “the key point of non-monogamy is that even though your partner might be with another lover, they’re actually coming back to you. And that extra joy and love and happiness might even fuel and rekindle the relationship they have with you. We’ve been conditioned to believe other people are a threat to our relationships, but what if they aren’t?”I soon put this to the test, when Sam failed to meet me one night as promised and instead went home with another woman. I felt perturbed: “But you said you might come and meet me.”He sighed. “Am I meant to apologise? You said it was fine as long as we’re honest.”I sat sulkily for a while. “Well as long as you had fun, Sam.”A little scab developed over the wound of not being chosen over a nameless woman in a shitty bar. Still, I eventually wriggled into a comfortable emotional spot about this one, too. “I’m totally fine about it now,” I said a few weeks later.The truth is, of course, that it’s incredibly tricky, and not something you can just foist on someone if they’re not keen. As Wilby points out, though: “Having the conversation, instead of just tacitly accepting monogamy as the only option, is really half the battle.” And we have had the conversation, over and over with each other, but also with others – incredulous friends who can’t quite believe that it’s “a thing”. We field the questions in turn: no, it’s not perfect yes, we do row sometimes yes, there are rules no, we don’t know how long it’ll last. But it is “a thing” – although, after almost a year together, not in the way that I thought it would be. Sam has slept with more people than I have. Despite pushing for it, when the opportunities have arisen I’ve found it oddly difficult to switch into the necessary head space. There’s still a faint feeling of betrayal and I wonder whether the deed will be worth the emotional cost. More often than not, I realise it won’t be. I’m not sure he feels it in quite the same way. And, yes, sometimes I get tense and irritable when we sit down to eat and he’s too tired to talk because he spent half the night with someone else.Still, I prefer it this way. We can be really, brutally honest with one another without the fear of damaging our relationship. As far as I’m concerned, hardline monogamy is a recipe for disappointment, because even if you manage it (according to a poll by YouGov about one in five of us has had an affair, and a third of us consider it), there will always be a part of you – that bit that has crushes on colleagues, and fantasises about handsome strangers – that your partner cannot share. There will always be secrets.To me, ethical non-monogamy isn’t about sex, or rather, not just about sex to me, it’s more about radical compassion – accepting that if you plan to spend a lifetime together, you or your partner or both of you will have those urges and fantasies, but, despite that, you’ll be there for each other. You’ll love each other, no matter who or what else comes along. Back in the pub, towards the end of Wilby’s talk, we learned about relationship anarchy a woman in the audience was trying it out. A relationship anarchist rejects any rules or constraints, they have multiple partners but no one is more important than another, and sexual, romantic or platonic relationships are all given equal weight. Basically, different partners respond to different needs. “If me and my best friend don’t fit sexually, but know that we’d make great co-parents, then why shouldn’t that be OK?” asked the woman. Six months on, I’m still quite taken with this idea.Maybe we should just burn them all down, these narrow streets that we’ve paved so that our desires move in straight lines. I have grieved, really grieved, over the loss of old relationships. I think of the heartbreak when Wilby says, “One of the key issues with the traditional format of exclusive, romantic relationships is that there’s an assumption that unless it lasts for ever, it is a failed relationship – when it might have been good for 10 or 20 years, when it might still be good, but for a change in one element.”Maybe it’s not committed relationships that non-monogamists are rejecting, but the idea that those relationships have to end when the romantic part does. And isn’t that desire – to keep those crucial people in your life – deeply romantic in its own way?Non-monogamy might not be the answer to any of this, but at least it’s asking the question."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/33e5b0e84b6546be167a48b955029f1ce8067eed/222_414_2600_1560/master/2600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=75bcb68da80d207ae84041bf452a729f","title":"the quiz female quixote electric lady","story":"From The Female Quixote to the Electric Lady, test your knowledge with the Weekend quiz1 In 1605, who said, “A desperate disease requires a dangerous remedy”?2 Charlotte Lennox’s The Female Quixote was the only novel reviewed by which literary giant?3 What is transported by the Nord Stream?4 Which Italian city is nicknamed “the learned”, “the fat” and “the red”?5 When did 18-year-olds first vote in a UK general election?6 Which creatures “defeated” the army in 1932 in Campion, Western Australia?7 Which baseball teams contest the Subway Series?8 The Morse bar is in which hotel?What links:9 Sun Hansa Sigma Sound Polar Electric Lady Black Ark?10 Woody Johnson, US Jean-Pierre Jouyet, France Peter Wittig, Germany?11 Pacific Rose Gala Envy Braeburn Jazz?12 Melilla and Ceuta Kaliningrad Büsingen Campione d’Italia?13 The Sea The Blue Train The Yellow Room Edwin Drood?14 Grosse Pointe Tokyo 18th-century Versailles California Civil War Virginia?15 Common veined giant Pacific mimic California two-spot seven-arm?1 Guy Fawkes.2 Samuel Johnson.3 Gas (pipeline from Russia to Germany).4 Bologna (for its university, food and politics).5 1970.6 Emus (so-called emu war).7 New York Mets and New York Yankees.8 The Randolph, Oxford.9 Recording studios: Memphis Berlin Philadelphia Stockholm New York Kingston.10 Ambassadors to the UK.11 Apple varieties developed in New Zealand.12 Exclaves: Spain Russia Germany Italy.13 The Mystery Of… novels: Bram Stoker Agatha Christie Gaston Leroux Charles Dickens.14 Sofia Coppola film settings: The Virgin Suicides Lost In Translation Marie Antoinette The Bling Ring The Beguiled.15 Species of octopus."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9bdf4cfe990eed8bfb7ffaf56e6512c9c98407fd/0_2505_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d91e9fa07d37d249771cb4ef5a147378","title":"vi albertine its a weakness to want to be adored","story":"The musician and writer, 63, on being in the Slits, the wisdom of older mothers and the genius of Vivienne WestwoodI’ve always felt a bit of a fraud looking like a normal English person when inside I’m a raging mixed up sort of mongrel from four different countries.

She would always point out inequality and did far more to make me a punk than those spotty boys I met afterwards in bands.

You constantly felt the pressure of other people you respected watching and criticising what you did.I could easily be a hermit. It’s an effort to leave the house. I’m a natural introvert everything that’s offered me I want to say no to. It’s almost easier to deal with an anonymous audience or readership than people I’m close to.

She was an extremely rigorous thinker and it mattered to us what she thought. I don’t think she is given enough credit for this, but she very much set the tone for what became known as punk.Being an older mother gave me a bit more wisdom. If I had done it younger, I might have been more stifling. I think you have to stand back and let your child grow into who they are. My mother filled me with adventurousness and anger and sometimes I wonder if I really was a rebel or whether she imposed it upon me.I feel horror at the thought of another relationship. In the west we force people to be teenagers all their lives. It’s horrible. My mind is beginning to clear of believing in romance and fairy-tale endings.

Stag dos and hen parties in Las Vegas or Ibiza or Amsterdam, glitzy foreign and “multi-day” weddings, multiple outfits to avoid being photographed in the same dress or suit ... some twenty- and thirtysomethings say they are wiping out their savings and building up debts as a result of attending costly events.Take the case of Georgina Childs. In the space of just four years, the PR consultant attended 15 hen dos and 21 weddings, all of which set her back a staggering £10,000.“When I first started going to weddings in 2014, I lived at home with my parents,” says Childs, who is 30. “So without having a bulky amount of London rent to pay, it was easier to pay out for weddings. I bought new outfits, stayed in nice B\u0026ampBs with my friends and was generous with my wedding gifts.“At the time, I don’t think I realised quite how many weddings I would attend in the next four years and how much I would spend.”One wedding in Lake Garda in northern Italy cost Childs more than £650 once she had shelled out for transport, accommodation and a dress, while a hen do in Granada in Spain set her back a similar amount.“Retrospectively, I couldn’t really afford it and shouldn’t have gone,” she admits. By the end of 2017, she had racked up £2,000 on a credit card and was forced to move back in with her parents.In hindsight she wishes she had been more frugal from the start. “I could perhaps have looked at using the money as a flat deposit or even for travelling the world. Having said that, I have many memories with many friends.”According to two surveys this year, from planning website Bridebook and Brides magazine, the cost of the average “full” wedding has hit £30,000. However, the price is also spiralling out of control for guests, with those attending the nuptials splashing out an average of £1,015, according to a recent survey from loan provider Provident.“New outfits, wedding presents, travel and often accommodation costs all mean that a busy wedding season can end up being extremely costly for guests,” says Jack Duckett, senior consumer lifestyles analyst at Mintel. “While in the past guests may have recycled wedding garments, the omnipresence of social media arguably adds pressure to create new looks for every wedding, for fear of being photographed in the same outfit at multiple events.”When Gemma Robinson’s brother-in-law chose to get married in Cyprus last year, she had no idea it would end up costing an eye-watering £8,000 and “wipe out” their savings.“We had to go for a week because of the way the flights worked out,” says Robinson, from Manchester. The costs piled up after her husband and son were asked to be groomsmen, and her daughter a flower girl.“I assumed they would pay for their outfits, but they didn’t, so that meant my husband’s suit cost £200, and because she wanted the little boys to wear matching Hugo Boss shirts, that cost £70, and then we had to pay for Sarah’s flower girl dress, which cost £70, plus shoes which were £30.”The couple had already splashed out on an expensive family trip to the US just the month before, which they had already paid for. “We had to use money we’d received for our own wedding to pay for it. We were absolutely skint from it.”Jade Beer, editor of Condé Nast Brides magazine and author of The Almost Wife, also says that weddings today are becoming increasingly extravagant – and expensive. “In 2018, they can easily extend over more than two days and have an itinerary of activities that guests need to dress for, and which may require them to travel to different locations for different events. This is a huge personal investment before they’ve even thought about buying the couple a gift.”Jenna Harrison has attended upwards of 30 weddings and 15 hen dos in locations such as Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia, New York and the Greek island of Mykonos over the past three years, costing her in the region of £30,000.She says there are additional costs because of the pressure to wear new outfits, which might cost about £250 each.“I mostly always buy something new to wear, partly because I work in fashion and partly because I don’t want to wear the same thing twice,” she says. “Often I will need two things because it’s become quite a trend to do something on the Friday night, too, like a drinks or welcome dinner, particularly for destination weddings.”With plenty of disposable income, Harrison says she has no regrets when it comes to spending such a large sum. “It would be nice to have extra money in the bank to put towards our new home but, truthfully, my husband and I love weddings so much. It’s money well spent in my mind.”But today, celebrating isn’t just tied to the nuptials themselves – many are encouraged to join extravagant hen and stag parties, which can cost guests an average of £164 each, according to Mintel.“The rising cost of stag and hen parties can be largely attributed to the increasing breadth of activities that groups look to include in their celebration, ranging from afternoon tea and wine tasting experiences to spa weekends away in foreign countries,” says Duckett.“This ties in with an overarching shift in consumer behaviour, which has seen people put greater emphasis on products and services that will offer unique experiences they will remember and that they can tell their friends about.”However, for some, spiralling wedding costs are just too much to bear. Chloe Minette, 22, from Bedford, admits she was forced to bow out of being maid of honour at her friend’s wedding after the costs kept creeping up. “She wanted to get married in Spain, but the bridesmaids had to pay to go over and were expected to be in Spain for a week. I started to panic as I’d just bought a house and couldn’t afford to go away for a week to Spain.”There was also talk of a hen do in Ibiza. “I texted her to explain calmly that financially I couldn’t do it ... we’ve not spoken since.”Like Minette, if you can’t afford the outlay, it’s best to be honest rather than getting yourself into debt. There are, of course, plenty of excuses you can use.“If you have children, blame them,” says Beer. “If you have a demanding boss, they can be your excuse. Dwindling holiday allowance, or having to attend solo due to a partner’s clashing diary requirements, are all acceptable.”If you aren’t going to attend, perhaps invite the couple to dinner post-honeymoon so they can tell you all about it, advises Beer.If you do decide to attend but are on a budget, you could cut costs by checking out Airbnbs, just staying over on the night of the wedding, and travelling together in a group.Kate Beavis, founder of the creative wedding blog Magpie Wedding, says guests can save money by creating their own gift or giving the gift of time – such as offering babysitting vouchers. “Some people may think this odd, but really, any good friend would understand and actually appreciate it. Don’t feel you have to buy a new outfit, either. Change the accessories or hat – or maybe you could borrow some.”When that invite lands on the doormat, Beer advises recipients to “press pause on any dramatic reactions until you’ve had time to process it all and decide what you’re in for – and what you’re not”.* Some names and places have been changed"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a1de7d5a3dfbefbe489543f089249ff90539854/0_0_4280_2567/master/4280.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e439a223903be9b666b8f507f37314ba","title":"in transit eight of the best audiobooks for long journeys","story":"That hefty tome you’ve been meaning to read for years?

Jack May selects the perfect titles to immerse yourself in as you clock up the miles(We know you’re not seriously thinking of cycling all that way. But just in case, a gentle reminder: as engrossing as these stories are, make sure you always pay full attention to the road)The complete Harry Potter by JK Rowling, read by Stephen Fry5 days 7 hrs 39 mins, equivalent to cycling from New York City to Miami BeachStephen Fry’s peerless narration of JK Rowling’s world-storming story about the boy magician, the Dark Lord, and the various mishaps, prophecies and extracurricular adventures at that very peculiar school Hogwarts, crowns this the king of the audiobook world. Perhaps your parents played it during long car journeys as a child, or you listened to it furtively in your bedroom way past your bedtime. Well, it’s even better as an adult. Sit back, relax and let Fry do the hard work for you.War and Peace by Leo Tolstoy, read by Frederick Davidson61 hrs 8 mins, equivalent to driving from Inverness to Tel AvivJames Norton caused a stir when he took over our screens in the BBC’s six-part adaptation of Tolstoy’s vast 19th-century novel about life among Russia’s aristocracy in the Napoleonic wars. Seeing as merely holding the book aloft is likely to do you an injury, it’s wise to find an audible alternative. Luckily, the late Frederick Davidson – the chain-smoking titan of the audiobook world, who narrated more than 700 titles – had a quick 61-hour flick-through to make your life easier.Sherlock Holmes: The Definitive Collection by Arthur Conan Doyle, read by Stephen Fry72 hrs 3 mins, equivalent to cycling from Monaco to MadridElementary, my dear Watson. Though, of course, Arthur Conan Doyle, Sherlock’s creator, never really wrote those words – it’s a misattribution. Or is it? Find out for yourself by listening to Stephen Fry reading the Victorian novels that birthed the most well-known detective in the English language (with apologies to Poirot and Marple).The Romanovs 1613-1918 by Simon Sebag Montefiore, read by Simon Russell Beale28 hrs 45 mins, equivalent to driving from London to TallinnRussia’s a big country, which means that any attempt to cover even a chunk of its history is going to take up a lot of book. Simon Sebag Montefiore’s look at the history of the Romanovs – the dynasty of tsars and tsarinas who ruled Russia and its empire from the 17th century up until the revolutions of 1917 and the death of Tsar Nicholas II in 1918 – was well reviewed, but is a heavy book to carry around and get through. Simon Russell Beale, the Bafta-winning actor who starred in films The Death of Stalin and Into the Woods, reads it all for you, which makes it much easier to sort your tsarinas from your Tatianas and your Alexanders from your, er, other Alexanders.Ulysses by James Joyce, read by Jim Norton and Marcella Riordan27 hrs 16 mins, equivalent to flying from London to WellingtonThis is probably one of those books you always thought you ought to manage if only you could summon the wherewithal. James Joyce’s bizarre, epic, rambling novel is a literary landmark. Saying you’ve read it is a sure-fire way to earn appreciative nods from any real-life writers at your friend’s dinner party – and they need never know that it was read to you in Jim Norton and Marcella Riordan’s dulcet tones.Bleak House by Charles Dickens, read by Miriam Margolyes43 hrs 12 mins, equivalent to flying from London to Los Angeles and back, twiceUnless you’ve got Miriam Margolyes (think Professor Sprout in Harry Potter and Mrs Mingott in The Age of Innocence) guiding you through Charles Dickens’s least-enticing-sounding novel, with its vast list of characters and occasionally impenetrable satire, the truly bleak part about ticking Bleak House off your should-really-read-that list will be all the paper cuts you get from turning those oh-so-many pages.James Bond: The Collection by various authors, read by various narrators12 days 22 hrs 58 mins, equivalent to driving from Tunis to Cape Town and backAlmost no other literary character has had such traction, such deep cultural penetration and such extensive remodelling as James Bond. Originally created by Ian Fleming and named after the author of a book on birds in the Caribbean, Bond has captured the imagination of writers, from Anthony Horowitz and John Gardner, to Kingsley Amis and Sebastian Faulks. This extraordinary, leviathan series – with readers including Bill Nighy, David Tennant, Rosamund Pike, Tom Hiddleston and Hugh Bonneville – encompasses almost all of them.Alexander Hamilton by Ron Chernow, read by Scott Brick35 hrs 58 mins, equivalent to cycling from Madrid to BarcelonaIt’s the musical that’s become a phenomenon: it’s been used to subtweet President Trump by the American Civil Liberties Union been poignantly performed in parts in front of Barack Obama in his last days of office and had its every line obsessed over by legions of fans across the world.

But that has changed since a local musician made it on to the Mercury music prize shortlist. Nadine Shah’s face has been plastered across the Sunderland Echo she jokes that, earlier today, some dog-walkers asked her to pose for a photo with their pets. In the pub this afternoon, her parents, Imtiaz and Heather, are finishing Sunday lunch and recounting how a friend’s son was asked in school to name the most famous person from the area. They’d fizzed with pride and amusement when he’d said it was their daughter.“Well, it’s not hard!” says Shah, setting down a gin and tonic.Her third album, Holiday Destination, is her first Mercury nomination, and has taken her from noirish piano balladeer to noirish breakthrough rocker on heavy indie-radio rotation. Her themes on this record have particularly resonated. Inspired – or rather crushed by – the unrelenting doom cycle of 2016, she covers the Syrian refugee crisis, Trump’s election, the EU referendum, the rise of nationalism and a “decline in empathy”. A news item in which holidaymakers were bemoaning the arrival of refugees in Greece inspired its acerbic title Stevie Wonder and Talking Heads inform its jerky, skeletal, metallic funk and bristling post-punk.Shah flew the nest at 17 to pursue a career as a jazz singer in London, but she has been recuperating back at her parents’ house after surgery to treat endometriosis. If she wins, she says, she’ll spend the Mercury money on “all my operations!” (she later makes it clear by text that she’d spoil her mum with it). The prize has always meant a lot to her, so much so that when she didn’t get shortlisted for her second album, 2015’s Fast Food, she sank a bottle of whisky. “It’s embarrassing to admit,” she says, of the Mercury, “but I’ve been obsessed with it since I was little, which is the opposite of what I teach kids. I always tell them, ‘These things don’t matter, look at me – I’m an idiot but I can pay my bills.’”She burst into tears when she found out she’d been shortlisted, but also felt disappointed at seeing established acts rather than newer, smaller names next to hers. She think Gwenno’s Le Kov also deserved a place, as well as Young Fathers’ Cocoa Sugar. “I was so happy to be nominated,” she explains, “and then artists like Noel Gallagher are on it. I was upset about that.”Holiday Destination certainly stands alone in its overt despair at the world. While the past year is said to have signalled a new dawn for the rock’n’roll protest record, Shah says this is bullshit. “There were hardly any – and that’s not me being arrogant, that’s me shouting for other people to make them.” She makes favourable mention of Maximo Park’s Risk to Exist and Everything Everything’s (also Mercury-nominated) A Fever Dream, but a lot of the so-called “political” artists are, she says, “predominantly white males making T-shirt politics” – all slogans and no substance. “It’s just a trend. There’s no thought process behind it and I don’t believe them at all.”At first, Shah was scared to make an album that tackled weighty injustices such as the refugee crisis, for fear she’d be the target of similar accusations. She has, however, always been socially conscious. Her first album, 2013’s Love Your Dum and Mad, dealt with the deaths of two former boyfriends, and she has become an ambassador for mental health charities like Calm. By the time she started writing Holiday Destination, her brother had been making documentaries on the refugee frontline for years, while other source material included Sean McAllister’s 2015 film A Syrian Love Story. It inspired her track Mother Fighter, which looked at conflict from a mother’s point of view she kept returning to the documentary when writing the lyrics to make sure she got the story right. “You have to make sure that you’re responsible and fact-checking what you’re saying,” she says.Holiday Destination could have been the grim musical equivalent of a BBC News 24 report. But she draws on her own experiences, too, of racism and feeling culturally adrift. Her father is Pakistani and her mother English with Norwegian heritage. Shah says: “I’ve never been white enough to be white, or brown enough to be brown. At Asian weddings, I’d get called ‘gora’” – a Pakistani slur sometimes used to describe a white person – “and in school I’d be called Paki.” On the single Out the Way she sings: “Where would you have me go  I’m second-generation, don’t you know,” because, she says, swirling her G\u0026ampT, “people were starting to say to me on social media: ‘Go back to where you come from’, and I was like: ‘What? Whitburn?’”During the making of the album, Shah was also getting to grips with turning 30 and getting out of “an abusive relationship” where she was “being tortured every day”. “It was really bad,” she says. “I was bullied for a long time, but it was great for lyric-writing.” She’s being sardonic, but she did find solace in singing from other perspectives than her own. “My personal life was so awful, it made me want to escape a lot and write about other people.” But despite such personal turmoil, she was keen to make songs that weren’t “dour and down in the dumps”. She and her longstanding collaborator and producer, Ben Hillier, looked to Fela Kuti’s Afrobeat sound for lively rhythms, and laced the album with eastern scales to subtly nod to the Middle East.Holiday Destination is, she says, as commercial-sounding as she’ll get, but she’s aware that she’s often preaching to the converted, a liberal echo chamber of Remainiacs who almost certainly listen to 6 Music. It’s why she would have happily sold on Holiday Destination to an artist with more profile. “I wish I’d written this album and given it to Adele, and she sang it – or Ed Sheeran, or Taylor Swift. They can speak to people I’ll never reach. Adele has more sway than most politicians. I think if she’d come out and said ‘Vote Remain’, we would still be within the EU.”Being one of the most visible Muslim women with a guitar, she constantly gets asked how she feels about the lack of women of colour in indie music, but it’s a subject she’ll never tire of. “I refuse to stop talking about being Asian. Some people think that’s me being opportunistic, like I’m playing the Asian card, but I feel a responsibility to speak out. Islamophobia is totally on the rise, it’s terrifying. My cousins, who have brown skin and are full Pakistani, they’re still getting shouted at in the street.”Part of her hoped Holiday Destination’s themes would be irrelevant by now. “That was the dream,” she says. “I wished that we’d have to scrap the album and write about something else, like my crap love life or my crap ovaries.” The crises she sings about are still ongoing – they’re “just not front-page news any more”. What’s changed the most in the past year since she released the album – aside from, say, becoming the first choice to support Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds – is the weight of responsibility that’s grown with it. “People ask my opinion on political subjects and look to me as a kind of oracle. That’s scary. I can’t go on Twitter drunk.”For now, Shah’s voice is a good start. Does she think she’ll win what amounts to the award for the album of the year? “I hope I fucking do!” she laughs. She also hopes that whatever happens, it will be fair.“Florence, Arctic Monkeys, Lily Allen, Wolf Alice – they don’t need it. Me, Sons of Kemet and King Krule need it the most.”The Mercury prize will be awarded on 20 September"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aed1830e5684a243323aebae68848e3b090b0ef8/0_44_1085_651/master/1085.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=79963ad396980c0964eeb4ce1a2f019b","title":"nicki minaj cardi b altercation new york fashion week party","story":"Confrontation reported at Harper’s Bazaar event where Cardi B was seen leaving with what appeared to be a bump on her headNicki Minaj and Cardi B were involved in an altercation on Friday night at a New York fashion week party, leaving the latter rapper with a mark on her head.Cardi B reportedly threw one of her shoes at Minaj.A person who witnessed the incident but asked for anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly said Minaj was finishing a conversation with someone when Cardi B tried to attack her, but Minaj’s security guards intervened.Video from the Harper’s Bazaar Icons party circulating on social media showed Cardi B lunging towards someone and being held back.

McDonnell– who has been working throughout the summer on election planning, with little break– says the ideas will be at the heart of Labour’s drive to deliver greater equality by forcing an “irreversible shift in wealth and power in favour of working people”.McDonnell intends to introduce the necessary legislation in his first year as chancellor. He will outline the proposals, which could mean workers receiving idends to boost their incomes, in a speech to the TUC conference in Manchester on Tuesday.He will be speaking ahead of what he believes will be a tumultuous six months in British politics, with the Tory government tearing itself apart and imploding over Brexit, probably triggering another general election. If and when that happens, he says Labour will be ready with the most leftwing manifesto in decades, building on the radical platform set out at the 2017 snap election. New ideas will be put forward to boost equality, strengthen communities and improve public services.“The opportunity is there for us. I think the government will fall apart in the next six months almost certainly,” he says. “When they come back in the autumn with whatever they think will be their Brexit deal, they will rip themselves apart, and my argument is that they should move on and let us get on with the negotiations, and if not, call a general election. They might try to stagger on but by the spring of next year they will fall apart.”The shadow chancellor managed only a few days away with his family on the Norfolk broads over the summer, a sign that the party machine has spent the break getting itself on to election high alert. Unsurprisingly, McDonnell is dismissive of Labour moderates, including Tony Blair, who argued on Friday that the electorate would recoil in horror if the choice at the ballot box were between a leftwing prospectus from Jeremy Corbyn and McDonnell and a rightwing, pro-Brexit Tory alternative fronted up by the likes of Boris Johnson. Instead, McDonnell argues that not only working people but many “middle-class people, and people with degrees” are yearning for radicalism and real change because they dislike the direction in which the country is going.“What we are getting back on the doorsteps and in some of our polling is that the basic fabric of society is falling apart from lack of investment … from eight years of hard austerity but no light at the end of the tunnel,” he says. Even the better-off see “grotesque unfairness within our society” and want that tackled with radical solutions, he adds.Extending dramatically employees’ ownership of firms is precisely the kind of idea that McDonnell believes will appeal widely, if not to company bosses. “What this will ensure is that in large companies, in addition to rewarding workers with wages, they will reward them with shares that will go into a pool that will allow them to have an ownership role.”He cites a report by the Institute for Public Policy Research, published last week, that floated ideas for giving millions of people “a greater stake and voice in their workplaces”, boosting productivity, morale and incentives. The IPPR said “the aim would be to give more people a share of capital and to spread economic power and control in the economy by expanding the decision rights of employees in the management of companies”.Among the models being examined are ones under which firms would have to put a percentage of profits into an employee fund that would build up over time, giving the workforce, through its rising share ownership, an increasing say in key decisions on how the companies were run and managed. While workers would not be able to cash in shares, they could be offered idends from the fund to boost their pay.It was Tony Benn in the early 1980s, McDonnell points out, who first talked about the need for an “irreversible shift” of power and wealth towards working people that Labour’s modern-day standard bearers of the left now hope to deliver.McDonnell accepts that the antisemitism row, which has raged throughout the summer, has damaged Labour. “Of course it has, yes. In terms of morale as well. Of course it has. But we will come through it,” he says. “It has been distressing, absolutely distressing. Over the last three months it has been really heartbreaking. The reason it has been distressing is because you always felt we were an anti-racist party, and that is what we stand for, and when you have the accusation thrown at you, it is really disheartening … But when you find there is some substance to that, it is even more disheartening, and we have to address that.”He says he hopes the decision by the national executive committee last week to adopt the full International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance  definition of antisemitism, along with all its examples, will help to rebuild trust with the Jewish community.That is not the only argument within the party that has soured the summer mood. As Labour prepares for its conference in Liverpool, a series of proposed rule changes backed by local party groups, including moves that would make it easier to deselect MPs, are causing renewed tension between the parliamentary party and pro-Corbyn, leftwing elements of the membership. Here, McDonnell seems to sense danger and clearly wants to avoid more bad feeling. He says the existing rules on how MPs are reselected are fine as they are, and suggests he would not back any change that would stoke arguments further.Then there is the party’s stance on Brexit, as pressure builds this weekend from union members for Labour to back a stronger pro-EU, pro-single market line, and also a “people’s vote” (another referendum). At last year’s conference, a major row was avoided because no vote of any substance was held. This year, McDonnell says, there will have to be debates on Brexit policy and on Labour’s attitude to another referendum.“There is bound to be a debate, and I would think a vote,” he says, on both issues.The people’s vote campaign, he notes, has been “constructive”. McDonnell is careful neither to rule in nor rule out another referendum. He wants to keep the party’s mind focused on the prize of winning power, delivering mass renationalisation, higher taxes for the better-off and now the empowerment of workers in the private sector.“What I have been arguing for is a general election,” he says. “The Tories have made a complete mess of Brexit negotiations. They are ripping themselves apart. They should move aside and let us get on with this, but if they don’t want to move aside, and if we can’t get a general election, I am saying keep all options open.”The roots of Labour’s plan to give workers a say in how their employer makes decisions lie in an idea put forward by the party’s 37 Co-operative party MPs.In essence, the scheme forces - or provides strong incentives for - all major employers to put some of their profits into an employee fund. This money would be allocated to staff in the form of shares and would build up over time.Unlike with the share schemes promoted by Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s, employees would not be able to cash them in or trade them. Instead, the shares would be held in a trust, and elected trustees would sit on important committees in the business.Their purpose would be like that of any shares: to allow shareholders to influence the direction of the organisation and its day-to-day behaviour.Ultimately, the Inclusive Ownership Fund would turn every business into a John Lewis-style workplace, with internal democratic structures giving employees greater influence.It’s unclear whether Labour would favour employees becoming board members in line with the shareholding they have accumulated, but that appears to be the direction of travel."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ba36513cf9d10a13e77c0ad38028fb1127d634b/0_263_4444_2667/master/4444.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=66ea9822573c0b4066246937dc40afac","title":"unions poll massive backing second eu brexit referendum","story":"Members of Britain’s three biggest trade unions now support a new referendum on Brexit by a margin of more than two to one, according to a bombshell poll that will cause political shockwaves on the eve of the party conference season.The survey of more than 2,700 members of Unite, Unison and the GMB by YouGov, for the People’s Vote campaign, also finds that a clear majority of members of the three unions now back staying in the EU, believing Brexit will be bad for jobs and living standards.The poll comes as union delegates gather in Manchester for the annual TUC conference, where Brexit will be debated on Monday, and two weeks before the Labour party conference in Liverpool, where delegates are expected to debate and vote on Brexit policy. They will also consider calls to keep open the option of a fresh referendum on any deal Theresa May may strike on the UK’s exit from the EU.In an interview with the Observer before the poll findings were released, shadow chancellor John McDonnell said his preferred option was still for voters to be offered a say on the government’s handling of Brexit – and any deal brought back from Brussels by May – in a general election. But he said that if Labour was unable to force one in the coming months, he wanted to “keep all options open”, including supporting a new referendum.McDonnell said he was sure there would be a full debate, and votes, on Brexit at the Labour conference. And he went out of his way to praise the People’s Vote campaign, which he said had been very “constructive” and had made clear that its attempts to influence Labour policy should not be seen “as an attack on Jeremy Corbyn or positioning around the leadership. It should be a constructive debate and that is right.”Last week Tim Roache, the GMB’s general secretary, announced that his union would back another referendum after consulting its 620,000 members. Roache, who will address a People’s Vote March for the Many on the opening day of Labour’s conference, said the country did not vote for a “no deal” Brexit or to damage the economy.“In trade union terms, if we negotiate a pay deal for our members we put that deal back to the members and they decide whether that’s acceptable or not.”The TUC is expected to adopt a new position on Brexit that will place an emphasis on jobs, rights at work and peace in Northern Ireland. Its executive council is also likely to back the possibility of another vote on Brexit.Shakira Martin, president of the National Union of Students, who will be speaking at the TUC, said: “What this poll shows is that rank-and-file members of the three largest trade unions in the country are now united in solidarity with young people and students in backing a People’s Vote on the final Brexit deal.“The campaign for a People’s Vote is a movement that reaches out across regions, party, age, race and class. As we seem to be moving closer to a no-deal scenario which would be disastrous for the country, the time has come to join our voices for a People’s Vote.”Writing in today’s Observer, Peter Kellner, the former president of YouGov, said the poll could mark a turning point. “It’s not that rank-and-file trade unionists are indulging in gesture politics or ideological breast-beating.‘They are worried about the impact of Brexit on jobs, taxes, living standards and the National Health Service. They fear that Brexit Britain would find it harder to sell products and services abroad.”Kellner says the methods used by YouGov are much the same as the company deployed when it correctly predicted Corbyn’s win in the race for the Labour leadership in 2015.Baroness Margaret Prosser, a Labour peer and former president of the TUC, said: “Trade unions always listen to members and that’s why we’re already beginning to see them move on this issue. But this poll is important because it shows we need to move further and faster in the next few weeks if we’re going to fight for the best interests of workers.“A People’s Vote is the last, best hope we have of preventing massive damage on jobs, public services and our most hard-pressed communities.”Conservative MP and former minister Guto Bebb, who quit as a defence minister in July in protest at Theresa May’s concessions to Tory Brexiters, yesterday added his voice to those backing another referendum.

Here’s how to get it rightCats are masters of being able to wind their owners around their little claws, and as a result they make us believe they are desperately in need of feeding when in fact, they’re not. Despite what we think, cats have no social aspect to eating. In other words, they don’t love us for it.Portion sizes should be followed according to the type of food you are feeding (most feeds have a guide for portion sizes on the pack, or offer a nutritional advice helpline) and according to the breed, build, age and activity level of your cat. A rough guide would be an urban outdoor cat that weighs about 4kg would need about 300kcal a day. If your cat is an indoor-only animal of about the same weight, this would reduce to 200kcal a day.The type of cat you have will affect what they need to eat to stay fit and healthy. Long-haired cats benefit from a different food to their shorter haired cousins, while bigger breeds such as Maine coons have a larger skeleton, so benefit from more joint support than others.The shape of the cat’s jaw can determine how and if they eat a kibble, which is why different breeds benefit from a specific shape. Cat jaws are designed to move up and down, not side to side, so they can tear at food rather than chew – and you’ll find cats eat in one of three different ways:Cats are very fussy about how food feels in their mouth and texture is very important to cats – more so, in fact, than taste, as they have relatively few taste buds compared with humans. They also need fresh drinking water at all times.SiameseThese animals are long, lean and athletic, and benefit from a diet to support muscle tone – one that has more protein and less fat. Their jaw is a specific triangular shape, so they need a kibble that works with their natural eating action, encouraging them to crunch their food.Bengal An athletic breed that benefits from a higher level of protein but also fat to fuel their activity. A diet that will help maintain its very distinctive coat is also desirable containing specific amino acids, vitamins and omega fats aimed specifically at skin and coat health.Maine coon Maine coon owners should have an awareness of the heart health issues associated with this large, heavy breed. Make sure its diet has the right energy density so that you’re not encouraging weight gain.Norwegian forest catLike other cats with longer coats, the Norwegian forest cat often needs a food that contains specific fibres such as psyllium, which help to naturally move hair swallowed during grooming through the digestive tract – as without the right care and nutrition, hairballs can be an issue.SphynxThese hairless cats are covered with a light down, but they can struggle to maintain their body temperature and so benefit from a food with a higher fat content to provide extra energy for their active metabolism. Keeping their skin healthy is also a priority. RagdollAnother long-haired cat with a broad jaw, these benefit from a pyramid-shaped kibble that is easy to grasp and encourage crunching. As with other heavier cats, they benefit from food with additional health nutrients, such as glucosamine and chondroitin to support joint health.Whatever the breed, Royal Canin offer a wide variety of wet and dry foods tailored to your cat’s inidual nutrition needs.

It featured the quarterback and the slogan: “Believe in something. Even if it means sacrificing everything. Just do it.”Kaepernick, 30, has been without a team since opting out of his San Francisco 49ers contract in March 2017. In 2016 he was an originator of protests by NFL players, targeting racial injustice and police brutality, which often involve kneeling during the pre-game playing of the national anthem.Donald Trump has made the protests a key part of his appeal to his base, arguing that the players are disrespecting the anthem, the US flag and the military.He also said Nike paid him “a lot of rent” in New York and admitted that the protests and the Nike ad were “in another way … what this country is all about, that you have certain freedoms to do things that other people think you shouldn’t do”.“But I personally am on a different side of it,” Trump said.In the following days, the president pursued the issue via Twitter. On Wednesday, he wrote: “Just like the NFL, whose ratings have gone WAY DOWN, Nike is getting absolutely killed with anger and boycotts. I wonder if they had any idea that it would be this way? As far as the NFL is concerned, I just find it hard to watch, and always will, until they stand for the FLAG!”On Friday, the morning after the full version of the Nike ad played during the Philadelphia Eagles v Atlanta Falcons NFL season opener, the president asked: “What was Nike thinking?”Edison Trends’ analysis suggested the company will be thinking its gambit has worked, allowing it to surf familiar controversy and create a “Trump bump” all of its own.“Nike’s 2018 late summer sales show much the same trend as last year’s,” the company wrote, “with order volume decreasing slightly going into late August. The similarity decreases coming out of Labor Day weekend, however, with sales seeing a bigger bump on Monday and Tuesday than in the past.”Edison Trends said its analysis was based on “anonymised and aggregated e-receipts from more than 3 million consumers”.The NFL has not resolved how to respond to or govern the protests, which were widely discussed again on Thursday after Eagles defensive end Michael Bennett sat down before the anthem had finished.In July, in an open letter to league owners, the NBA great and  sports columnist Kareem Abdul Jabbar wrote: “It’s been two years since Colin Kaepernick first took a knee to protest systemic racial injustice, especially police brutality, against people of color.“The worst thing about that isn’t that two years later we’re still debating whether players have the right to protest, it’s that not much has changed regarding what Kaepernick was protesting.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85e6de38e0676f0c4de2645437329b43745b48dc/274_7_3942_2366/master/3942.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cbbd43fd72bfac408eefd1a2aac94762","title":"richard hannon aircraft landing collision sir michael stoute haydock horse racing tips","story":"• Hannon plane hits another that had carried Sir Michael Stoute• Arc favourite Enable displays old brilliance at KemptonRichard Hannon was one of four passengers on a plane that skidded alarmingly along the sodden grass landing strip at Haydock on Saturday, crashing into another plane from which Ryan Moore and Sir Michael Stoute had recently emerged. No one was reported injured in the incident before racing but both planes were sufficiently damaged to ground them until repairs are made. The course was closed to further air\u0026nbsptraffic.“My brother was white as a sheet,” said Hannon, who added that he had not been scared himself. “I was more thinking, when is this thing going to stop moving so we can get the hell out.” But the Marlborough trainer was at pains to avoid pointing any fingers over the incident. “I’m not blaming anyone. We’ve never had any problems landing at Haydock before and I certainly don’t want them to stop us landing there in future.“I trust the people we fly with and this won’t put me off flying again we just have to fly around the country in this job.”A statement issued by the Jockey Club said: “The racecourse airfield is constantly maintained, was inspected before racing and passed in full working order, and has an operative based there. The previous plane landed reporting no issues whatsoever and indeed no pilot has apportioned any blame to the airstrip.” An investigation is to be carried out by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch.One consequence of the incident was that Frankie Dettori was prevented from flying in at a late stage to take the ride on James Garfield in the Sprint Cup at Haydock but, as that horse finished well beaten, he missed little. The big race fell to The Tin Man, with Oisin Murphy replacing Tom Queally in the saddle. Harry Angel faded out of the places after helping to force the pace. Dettori still had a satisfying day, thanks to the comfortable comeback success by Enable in Kempton’s September Stakes.Last year’s Arc winner had not seen a racecourse since her moment of glory in Paris, a knee injury in the spring having been the biggest problem.

The previous leader, Jesús Herrada (Cofidis), fell out of contention during the 171km stage which took in five categorised climbs.Earlier in the day, there had been a six-man breakaway which included Team Sky’s Michal Kwiatkowski, with the lead on the peloton at around three minutes and 43 seconds heading into the final 75km. As it was reeled in, Steven Kruijswijk (LottoNL-Jumbo) made a late move but could not sustain the pace before Yates timed his attack to perfection on the steep slopes.As the Movistar due of Valverde and Quintana waited for López to make his move, Yates (Mitchelton-Scott) struck, riding clear and holding off the Astana rider’s late charge to seal a statement victory.Sunday looks set to be one of the race’s toughest days, with the riders travelling 178.2km and crossing four climbs to another mountain finish at the Lakes of Covadonga."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8cbf06fa84e680ffdfaf8d9d45afb72bcc36b94/89_39_1618_971/master/1618.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3e32e8af56ace1572474788c647bb2ff","title":"wasps exeter premiership match report","story":"• Wasps 31-42 Exeter• Flanker suffers suspected broken cheekbone on Wasps debutBrad Shields was taken to hospital on Saturday night with a suspected broken cheekbone on his Premiership debut for Wasps, putting his participation in England’s autumn internationals in jeopardy.The New Zealand-born flanker was taken off early in the second half of Exeter’s thrilling victory with blood streaming from his face after a clash of heads with the Chiefs’ scrum-half Stu Townsend. It means the 27-year-old marquee signing from the Hurricanes is a doubt for England’s training camp this month and, if a fracture is confirmed, he would face a battle to prove his fitness before the November series.After a whirlwind summer in which he won his first two caps against South Africa – but missed out on a third because of a bout of food poisoning that also required hospital treatment – it could be the worst possible start to his career in England. “Brad took a nasty knock to his cheekbone, so he has gone to hospital to get it checked out. It doesn’t look great,” said the Wasps director of rugby, Dai Young, who now has 10 frontline players on the injury list with Nathan Hughes also hobbling off with a tight hamstring.“The very nature of sending him to hospital would suggest it is not looking great. We don’t seem to get much luck when it comes to injuries. It will be a real blow for him and us if he is out for a number of weeks. Nathan came off with a tight hamstring. Fingers crossed he hasn’t pulled it or torn it – he doesn’t feel like he has.”Truth be told it is hardly surprising that, in a contest as breathless as this, not all stay the pace. In the week when the Premiership chief executive, Mark McCafferty, predicted the organisation could become a billion-pound business, this thrilling match showcased the best and the worst of England’s domestic league.It featured 10 tries – two each for Sam Simmonds and Henry Slade – a compelling contrast in styles and a grandstand finish Don Armand’s last-gasp try eventually put paid to hopes of a Wasps comeback after Dan Robson’s 70th-minute score and the introduction of their All Black debutant Lima Sopoaga from the bench had given them renewed purpose. And inevitably, the concerning injury bulletin for Eddie Jones.If it was not safe until the final stages, there can be few complaints with Exeter’s victory. It is now 12 tries in two big wins against Leicester and Wasps for the Chiefs, who again look the best equipped to challenge Saracens’ dominance come May.By half-time it was three tries apiece – Exeter’s possession game has its critics but there is no doubting it is effective while Wasps’ ability to strike on the counter made this such a compelling contest. To demonstrate, with half an hour on the clock Exeter had missed more tackles (12) than they had made (10).Wasps struck first, Elliot Daly creating the opening try out of nothing with a glorious dummy – paid for in full by Ollie Devoto – before the England flyer stepped inside, pinned back his ears and made for the posts. The visitors were level when the Argentina wing Santiago Cordero finished off a well-worked move on the right while Wasps’ second try was just as opportune as the first. Christian Wade won the restart after Cordero’s try and while Billy Searle’s grubber was deflected, it popped up perfectly for Josh Bassett to finish.Then came the Exeter squeeze. With Matt Kvesic again to the fore – he won two key turnovers in the first half – the Chiefs blasted over with a driven lineout, finished by Simmonds, before Slade ghosted past Shields to put Exeter ahead for the first time. A long-range penalty from Searle and a close-range finish from Hughes – not long after he had been walloped into next week by Armand – edged Wasps 24-21 ahead at the interval, however.With Shields making way, Exeter’s start to the second half was ominous and Simmonds was again pushed over before Slade picked off a Searle pass and stayed ahead of Daly in a long-range chase to put the Chiefs 11 points ahead. Cue the introduction of Sopoaga and a frantic final quarter. Wasps were back to within four when Robson burrowed over under the posts but with the rain getting heavier and the ball increasingly greasy, Exeter just about kept the hosts at bay before Armand’s final word."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f5c67a1a2ba025a64360ba3d914b1b7d238e73c/0_248_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=01364e8e1fb81ba8bb5868707c4cf427","title":"nfl stadium food 2018","story":"With the National Football League season kicking off this week, here’s a sampling of what the fans will be eating in the stands"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc3f8f8e4fe5970de9c941cbc1efcc6e2f1c3f09/188_134_3868_2321/master/3868.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c13de06b7afa1717f8210a31a3f0b3be","title":"england v india fifth test day two live","story":"A tip top day for England. Especially considering where they started, on 198-7 and limping. But Jos Buttler did it again, as he has throughout the summer when the hosts have been in strife, stroking them smashing his way to 89 before he was the last wicket to fall with the score on a perfectly acceptable 332. After the early Broad breakthrough, the visitors took it to the England attack but Curran then Anderson (who was superb) broke open the middle order in the final session before Stokes penetrated the lower order by the close. The big moment came when he located Kohli’s edge with 20 minutes left on the clock, one short of his half-century. With that went any realistic chance of a first innings lead for the tourists. And with that, I’ll bid you farewell. I hope you all have a lovely Saturday evening watching Swanny on Strictly. Tanya Aldred will be with you tomorrow morning and I’ll take the baton in the afternoon. Until then, g’night! 51st over: India 174-6 (Vihari 25, Jadeja 8) Vihari takes one from the first ball, so it’ll be Jadeja doing the heavy lifting here to close the day here. And he does it well, clipping neatly down to the rope before seeing off the last couple without trouble. Stumps! 50th over: India 169-6 (Vihari 24, Jadeja 4) It is spin to replace Curran but from Moeen rather than Rash. Vihari nearly gifts him his wicket, too! He loaded up to hit the cover off the ball from a delivery that pitched and turned and nearly hit his stumps. He’s a lucky man - that would have been a disaster. There are Four leg byes off Jadeja’s pads to finish, which means Vihari will be facing the final over of the day from Stokes.49th over: India 164-6 (Vihari 23, Jadeja 4) Stokes also finds the edge of the new man Jadeja but it doesn’t go to hand, instead running away for four to get him off the mark.“If the film thing is still going, has anyone suggested Life of Brian Withington?” asks Kim Thonger. “I am informed however that he’s not the Messiah, but simply a very naughty boy.” That he is. Stokes gets another! Pant didn’t need to be playing at that, pitching on the fifth stump line and tailing away with a bit of gentle reverse swing from round the wicket. The regulation edge ends up in Joe Root’s hands at second slip for his second snaffle in a hurry. India are now in huge strife with another couple of overs due before the close.48th over: India 154-5 (Vihari 23, Pant 1) Curran gets another, Vihari gets off strike first ball, Pant gets off the mark from the second then the man on debut defends the rest. Nothing much going on here. Suuuuurely some spin at this time of the day? 47th over: India 154-5 (Vihari 22, Pant 0) A tricky period for the new man Pant, a dasher by nature. Kohli will be gutted with that, not for falling one short of a milestone but for getting so close to stumps at the very moment the run of play had turned back in their favour after a torrid time in the middle of this final session. If Kohli was there in the morning, India are eyeing off a first innings lead. Now, they are scrapping to stay within touching distance - especially if the hosts can pluck another off this evening. Pant does the right thing and keeps his bat dead and straight to the rest of Stokes’ over.At least we know what Boris was doing on his phone instead of watching the cricket.Stokes gets the big one! A delivery that Kohli thought was coming back at him off the seam shaped nicely away instead. The edge well taken by the captain at second slip.46th over: India 154-4 (Kohli 49, Vihari 22) The first ball of the new Curran over is short and misdirected, tucked away with ease by Vihari who is growing in confidence. After exchanging singles, it is the man on debut later in the set beaten by a ball well outside the off-stump. There is an appeal for caught behind that the cordon like but not enough to review. Much better to finish, Vihari driving beautifully down the ground for his most convincing shot so far. After all that drama on zero, he’s now into the 20s with 20 minutes remaining this evening. Can England find something?45th over: India 144-4 (Kohli 48, Vihari 13) SIX RUNS, VIHARI! Didn’t see that coming, did you? Stokes banged it in and the young man took him on, top-edging over fine leg. He goes again, and it hangs in the air for a long time... but Rashid can’t drag in the catch despite making a full-stretch e. In turn, the ball spills into the rope for four more. 25 runs in the last two overs. He has First Class form, that’s for sure.44th over: India 133-4 (Kohli 48, Vihari 2) Well, Broad is off but it isn’t Rashid coming on - it’s Curran. Kohli, after struggling against the young man earlier, is in a different frame of mind 90 minutes later, taking ten runs from his first three balls, punctuated by a superb flick from off-stump that finishes at the midwicket boundary. Hips don’t lie, Shakira taught us. Virat is issuing a reminder that wrists don’t, either. He does it again to finish the over, albeit to the sweeper who is now out there. That makes 14 off the over.43rd over: India 119-4 (Kohli 34, Vihari 2) Kohli is pulling for the second time in two overs, albeit just for a single this time around. Stokes is getting the ball moving around but can’t draw a false stroke out of Vihari, who has now faced 29 balls. Rashid now? Surely. It’s becoming a bit of a farce how little he gets given a go. “The splendidly named Rob Wolf Petersen poses a philosophical question for the ages regarding the quantum state of the hypothetical BroadWatson lbw conundrum,” says Brian “Howling Dog” Withington “In the posited scenario I suspect that the delicious indeterminacy might be preserved even after observation (by DRS). Quark, strangeness and charm indeed. Well played, sir.”42nd over: India 118-4 (Kohli 33, Vihari 2) Broad continues and immediately gives Kohli a shorter ball, which he happily climbs into, pulling to the rope. He’s into the 30s, and after some rough early moments, he’s all set now. A leg bye from the second ball gets Vihari back on strike, who looks better this time around in his defensive posture.41st over: India 113-4 (Kohli 29, Vihari 2) We have light rain at The Oval as Stokes comes on to replace Anderson at the conclusion of his superb spell, a stint that included winning the scalps of Pujara and Rahane in the space of two overs. Just the Kohli single here, from the first ball, with Vihari battling his way through the remainder of the set. Umbrellas are now up in some parts of the ground but that’s a bit much if you ask me. 40th over: India 112-4 (Kohli 28, Vihari 2) Geez, we still have 17 overs to go. In reality, that will be about 13 as play must conclude at 6:30pm. After finishing inside the extra half an hour yesterday we’re back to normal programming - losing overs - today. Broad to Kohli to begin here and he takes a single around the corner first ball. Not a bad result as it gives him another pop at Vihari, who he’s working over well. Sure enough, he has him struggling again, hitting his inside edge, but that’s enough to get him off strike. We are 40 overs into the innings and still no sign of Adil Rashid. Poor bloke.39th over: India 109-4 (Kohli 26, Vihari 1) Anderson does go again and he does find Kohli’s edge - but of the leading variety and it doesn’t find the cover fielder. He gets off strike from the next ball, clipping a straighter ball to midwicket. I’m now in the camp of those who believe that Jimmy will never dismiss Virat again. What a stoush it has been.“Afternoon @collinsadam,” tweets Rob Wolf Petersen, “Idly wondering what would happen if Stuart Broad hit Shane Watson on the pad and it was reviewed. Would we enter a quantum realm in which the batsman was simultaneously out and not out?”I’m picturing the final scene in the Black Mirror ep ‘Hang the DJ’. (Bloody great ep)38th over: India 108-4 (Kohli 25, Vihari 1) Whoa, that’s some sort of interrogation before getting off the mark in Test cricket! Vihari is given out by Umpire Wilson on the field but immediately sends it upstairs. He was right to do so: the ball is clearing the stumps by half a foot. To what extent was the ump’s failure to give him out on the field in Broad’s previous over responsible for the second error? Anyway, the number six then nearly runs himself out scampering to the danger end taking a quick single. A direct hit and he was gone! Well, at least he’s got a run to his name. 37th over: India 106-4 (Kohli 24, Vihari 0) Anderson to Kohli: this remains the main game. But the Indian master is in better shape now, defending well then adding two to his score through midwicket. That might be Jimmy’s last over for the time being.36th over: India 104-4 (Kohli 23, Vihari 0) A cloud of smoke moves across The Oval from the western side of the ground at the start of the over but it is gone in a hurry. Back in the middle, Vihari is extremely lucky to survive a Broad lbw shout after he was hit on the back pad and the appeal was turned down. Despite having both reviews up their sleeve, Root elects not to go upstairs. Had he? Three reds: it would have been overturned. The next ball, the man on debut - still yet to get off the mark - nearly lost his off-stump when leaving a ball that was seaming back aggressively. Whoa.“Experienced a bittersweet frisson as Alastair nonchalantly snaffled another catch at first slip off an exultant Jimmy,” emails Brian Withington. “Can’t believe their partnership is almost over - how many times have we read caught Cook, bowled Anderson? Let’s hope for one or two more before the match is done. Sniff. Still more unbelievably, how on earth was Broad persuaded not to take that LBW upstairs?!”Might it be that Broad’s enthusiasm has counted against him? Notoriously, he is the least reliable narrator going around when it comes to using the DRS. Root would know that.35th over: India 103-4 (Kohli 22, Vihari 0) The young man on debut, Hanuma Vihari, has one ball to deal with from Anderson after the drinks break and he defends off his pads. Some nearing-the-end-of-day stats from the guns at CricViz. Outstanding! Angling in, seaming away - it’s an Anderson masterclass. Cook makes no mistake at first slip, pouching the chance just above his waist. Two wickets in six balls for Jimmy has quickly changed complexion of this session. And with that, drinks are called.34th over: India 102-3 (Kohli 21, Rahane 0) I wouldn’t be surprised if they get Stokes on soon with Rahane out there given how often he’s picked him up this summer. Isn’t this a joyous part of a five-Test series, that these storylines - Anderson v Kohli, Stokes v Rahane - have a chance to fully mature? More! More! It’s nearly a moot point as far as the all-rounder is concerned when Broad gets a ball to jag back at Rahane, beating him on the inside edge and going within an inch of collecting the off-stump! Phew. “Greetings Adam.” Hi, Gregor Salsa. “Since it’s the last test of the series, I have to write this. Especially since Mac Millings (over 113) did the album title I’ve been thinking of all series (Yo! Bumrah’s The Show). Sam Curran reminds me of Henery the Chicken Hawk from Looney Tunes Foghorn Leghorn. He’s young, he’s not the biggest, but he’s determined.” I’ll shoulder arms at the reference (not my bag) but your character assessment is spot on.Jimmy finds the edge of Pujara! It is against the trend of play from the number three, prodding at an away swinger than he did not need to offer a shot at. YJB does the rest with the gloves and Anderson lets out a mighty roar. For his next trick: doing the same with Kohli for the first time in the series. Don’t go anywhere. 32nd over: India 101-2 (Pujara 37, Kohli 20) Pujara is the other man with a plan out there right now: not to take any risks while this game is hot. He looks at his happiest in this watchful mode. But after five dots - one ball away from a third maiden on the spin - he turns a ball from middle stump almost all the way to the boundary for three. Lovely.31st over: India 98-2 (Pujara 34, Kohli 20) Anderson v Kohli - this is proper box-office stuff one champion to another. Jimmy starts wide, Virat leaving then leaving again. He moves onto the stumps, or near enough to have him use his bat to defend. The pattern then repeats. Kohli will know that this is part of Anderson’s grand plan, to be executed over several overs if necessary. This is captivating cricket. Back to back maidens. “Even as you readers start responding to Mr Collins with witty responses,” begins, err, Boris? “I would like to defend myself. I know I have been the face of the campaign that has led Britain to one of its worst political crisis, and I do not help my image by sleeping and texting at the site of an utterly compelling Test match. Even as you laugh your arses off at the hilarious suggestions which will now greet you, I present to you the real reason for my actions -- I have fallen asleep after working on my hair throughout the night (it’s worth the effort, yes, because it looks amazing also, to those asking, I did indeed sleep on my chair to conserve my well-done hairstyle). I was using the phone merely to inform my hair stylist that I would go over to the clinic at once to work on my hair once more, because the windy and overcast conditions have helped neither England nor me -- my hair is a mess once more. If this continues any more, I will stop attending cricket matches (including the local ones, I’ll get votes in other ways), and will need to shave off my very real hair so that I can put on the wig President Trump informed me he uses during a late night conversation. Thanks and Regards, Boris Johnson (nah really just Abhijato Sensarma).” You’ll make a diligent method actor yet.30th over: India 98-2 (Pujara 34, Kohli 20) Broad is also back for another spell from the pavilion end, replacing Moeen, which makes a lot of sense for mine. But he’s sending them down at Pujara rather than Kohli, who defends throughout. Maiden. “Thinking over the series it’s heartening to note how many different England players have made a game-shaping contribution,” emails Tom Bowtell. “Cook here, Jennings in 2nd innings at Rose Bowl, Moeen at Rose Bowl, Root at Edgbaston, Bairstow at Edgbaston, Stokes with ball at Edgbaston, Woakes at Lord’s, Buttler, Woakes, Broad, Jimmy in several places. Just need a 5-fer from Rashid this afternoon...”29th over: India 98-2 (Pujara 34, Kohli 20) KOHLI SURVIVES A REVIEW! Anderson, replacing Curran, is convinced he has the captain leg before and goes upstairs immediately when his appeal is turned down by Umpire Dharmasena. The inswinger was hitting the stumps but it was umpires’ call on impact. So England retain their review, but that’s cold comfort given how close they were. Amazingly, the England superstar is yet to dismiss Kohli in this series. Of course, the champion batsman hits back, fllicking a misdirected delivery to the midwicket boundary. That’ll hurt. Oh here we go: at the end of the over it is all action, the umpires bringing the captains together. Aggers on TMS is speculating, based on the body language of the chat, that Jimmy may have said something unpleasant. All kicking off!28th over: India 94-2 (Pujara 34, Kohli 16) Moeen does get another go and it doesn’t work, conceding nine runs with both batsmen finding the boundary, which bookends the set. The captain put away the long hop then to begn then number three drove beautifully down the ground to finish. 27th over: India 85-2 (Pujara 30, Kohli 11) Curran beats Kohli! That’s twice in two overs. But the Indian star responds as you would expect, picking up two runs through cover then claying a perfect drive through that same region to the rope. Once again he keeps the strike, helping the left-armer’s yorker to fine leg for one.26th over: India 78-2 (Pujara 30, Kohli 4) Pujara has brought his first-dig form from Southampton with him to London, looking very good against Moeen, from whom he collects a couple to fine leg then another past short leg - all along the carpet. Kohli keeps the strike with one to midwicket to finish. Time for Adil Rashid before the captain is set? 25th over: India 74-2 (Pujara 27, Kohli 3) Beaten! Curran draws a false stroke from Kohli with the first ball of his new over, coming within centimetres of removing the Indian numero uno. He collects a couple through midwicket later in the over before seeing off the rest defensively. It’s already a nice little contest between these two. 24th over: India 72-2 (Pujara 27, Kohli 1) Close call! After Pujara takes a single, Moeen gets a crack at Kohli and sneaks an off-break past the inside edge. The appeal is turned down but Moeen likes it enough to talk DRS with Root before deciding to play it safe. Kohli then turns the final ball around the corner to get off the mark.“The cricketing brotherhoodsisterhood is an unsually inclusive one in that it’s just niche enough that everyone can feel a part of it,” continues Robert Wilson. “So some OBO bod comes up with a great zinger or quip, we feel partial authorship. Gideon Haigh writes something sparkling and unforgettable, most of us feel like taking a bow. That’s cricket people. This is us. And never more than today. After a tricky and stressful week, the richly human cricket-ground reaction to BoJo really made my day. That’s a Venn Diagram which I will always want to a part of.” Very well said, mate.23rd over: India 70-2 (Pujara 26, Kohli 0) We know it is Virat Kohli is walking out from the roar that goes around The Oval from Indian fans. The brilliant Bharat Army, sitting to my right, are immediately into song as well. The touring skipper is keeps it simple to begin, defending the dangerous Curran with a nice, straight blade. What a beauty! Sam Curran has sorted Rahul out with a delivery that pitched on about leg, beat the outside edge then clipped off stump! That goes straight to the young left armer’s highlights reel. What a summer he is having.22nd over: India 70-1 (Rahul 37, Pujara 26) Three singles, all off the legs, as the Indian pair get to work against Moeen. Nothing silly this time around. 21st over: India 67-1 (Rahul 35, Pujara 25) Curran to Pujara, who is looking better by the over. In the middle of the over the game is stopped to ask one of my colleagues sitting outside on the other side of the sightscreen to get out of the way. I’m looking forward to finding out who that was. Pujara then picks up a couple off his legs then two more down the ground. Nice. 20th over: India 63-1 (Rahul 35, Pujara 21) Moeen continues his spell, which was handy before tea. Pujara is defending then attempting to drive straight for runs but the spinner does well, fielding in his follow through. A boundary does come at the end of the over but could easily have been the end of Rahul, who got down low to sweep before the delivery left Moeen’s hand. Missing with the shot with this bat, the ball also just avoided leg stump and then the gloves of YJB. Four byes.

So how does it work and when will it be here?The story that broke earlier last month that Google would again cooperate with Chinese authorities to run a censored version of its search engine, something the tech giant has neither confirmed nor denied, had ironic timing. The same day, a group of 800 web builders and others – among them Tim Berners-Lee, who created the world wide web – were meeting in San Francisco to discuss a grand idea to circumvent internet gatekeepers like Google and Facebook. The event they had gathered for was the Decentralised Web Summit, held from 31 July to 2\u0026nbspAugust, and hosted by the Internet Archive. The proponents of the so-called decentralised web – or DWeb – want a new, better web where the entire planet’s population can communicate without having to rely on big companies that amass our data for profit and make it easier for governments to conduct surveillance. And its proponents have got projects and apps that are beginning to function, funding that is flowing and social momentum behind them. In light of the Snowden revelations and Cambridge Analytica scandal, public\u0026nbspconcerns around spying and privacy have grown. And more people have heard about the DWeb thanks to the television comedy Silicon Valley, whose main character recently pivoted his startup to try and build this “new internet”.What is the decentralised web? It is supposed to be like the web you know but without relying on centralised operators. In the early days of the world wide web, which came into existence in 1989, you connected directly with your friends through desktop computers that talked to each other. But from the early 2000s, with the advent of Web 2.0, we began to communicate with each other and share information through centralised services provided by big companies such as Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Amazon. It is now on Facebook’s platform, in its so called “walled garden”, that you talk to your friends. “Our laptops have become just screens. They cannot do anything useful without the cloud,” says Muneeb Ali, co-founder of Blockstack, a platform for building decentralised apps. The DWeb is about re-decentralising things – so we aren’t reliant on these intermediaries to connect us. Instead users keep control of their data and connect and interact and exchange messages directly with others in their network.Why do we need an\u0026nbspalternative? With the current web, all that user data concentrated in the hands of a few creates risk that our data will be hacked. It also makes it easier for governments to conduct surveillance and impose censorship. And if any of these centralised entities shuts down, your data and connections are lost. Then there are privacy concerns stemming from the business models of many of the companies, which use the private information we provide freely to target us with ads. “The services are kind of creepy in how much they know about you,” says Brewster Kahle, the founder of the Internet Archive. The DWeb, say proponents, is about giving people a choice: the same services, but decentralised and not creepy. It promises control and privacy, and things can’t all of a sudden disappear because someone decides they should. On the DWeb, it would be harder for the Chinese government to block a site it didn’t like, because the information can come from other places.Is this something to do with that word “blockchain”? Blockchain technology is the secure, encrypted technology that\u0026nbspcryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and Ether run off. It provides a decentralised public digital ledger of transactions, which tracks ownership securely in an environment without trust. While the first applications of blockchain technology were for digital currency transactions, that same technology is now finding application in the development of the DWeb including recording the movement of data, registering unique user names and even data storage. There are also cryptocurrencies themselves being deployed to help create the DWeb. For example, Protocol Labs launched\u0026nbspFilecoin in August last year having raised $205m for the project. The idea is to incentivise the creation of a decentralised data\u0026nbspstorage network by creating an open market in data storage. If you have spare capacity, you can store others’ data and earn Filecoin. If you\u0026nbspwant your extra data stored, you\u0026nbspcan find someone on the network and pay them in Filecoin. The deals get recorded on a blockchain.How will my everyday experience of using the\u0026nbspweb change? If it is done right, say enthusiasts, either you won’t notice or it will be better. One thing that is likely to change is that you will pay for more stuff directly – think micropayments based on cryptocurrency – because the business model of advertising to us based on our data won’t work well in the DWeb. Want to listen to songs someone has recorded and put on a decentralised website? Drop a coin in the cryptocurrency box in exchange for a decryption key and you can listen. Another difference is that most passwords could disappear. One of the first things you will need to use the DWeb is your own unique, secure identity, says Blockstack’s Ali. You will have one really long and unrecoverable password known only to you but which works\u0026nbspeverywhere on the DWeb and with which you will be able to connect to any decentralised app. Lose your unique password, though, and you lose access to everything.Any downsides? What might go wrong? Without the big online intermediaries to exercise their central control, there is the potential for online harassment and hate speech to increase.“Censorship – both by good people and bad – is going to be harder,” says Kahle. And if information is stored in a decentralised way, how do you ever truly get rid of information you no longer want to have online? That could be a concern for the European “right to be forgotten”.The same tech that can protect users in the DWeb from central surveillance might also offer a shield to criminals, for example distributors of child abuse images. If\u0026nbspthe DWeb is allowing people to store files and data totally encrypted,\u0026nbspso nobody can see them, it means they can store or share images they shouldn’t be. Though, says Sander Pick, co-founder of Textile, that’s not a problem unique\u0026nbspto the DWeb, with purveyors of child abuse images using various encryption techniques and\u0026nbspanonymous networks to hide on\u0026nbspthe web we have today.What challenges does the DWeb face? What’s holding things back? First, it is technically more difficult to build a decentralised web because everything isn’t in one place. Then there’s getting people to use it. “Right now humanity lives at Facebook,” says Mitchell Baker, chairwoman of the Mozilla Foundation. A killer app, a thing that everyone wants, could help here – but there isn’t one yet. Though that is neither surprising nor a failure given how early it still is, adds Baker. Many of the apps that do exist are clunky and difficult to use user experience needs to improve.The DWeb movement also needs to focus on its true advantages – the things centralised systems can’t do, says Juan Benet, founder of Protocol Labs. And one of those is speed. Because of the way the DWeb\u0026nbspworks\u0026nbspdifferently from the current web, it should intrinsically be faster, but there is a long way to go on that, he says. There are also big issues about governance that need to be ironed out, says Primavera De Filippi, who studies the legal and organisational challenges of decentralised technologies at the National Centre for Scientific Research in Paris and the Berkman Klein Center for Internet \u0026amp Society at Harvard University. How does the decentralised web all come together when no one is in charge? And how do you make sure things don’t just become centralised again, the system repeating itself, particularly when there are companies that want\u0026nbspto make money?How big online companies push back also remains to be seen. “There are going to be a lot of forces for the\u0026nbspstatus quo,” says Kahle. The DWeb is new and burgeoning, but\u0026nbspit\u0026nbspalso isn’t inevitable."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42fe1f1422d0565fb3f23c345cc8af89cb5c91e4/0_1167_3840_2303/master/3840.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=017bb6a6a522b94e9e41bd10fab1f818","title":"youtube stars burnout fun bleak stressed","story":"Why are so many YouTubers finding themselves stressed, lonely and exhausted?When Matt Lees became a full-time YouTuber, he felt as if he had won the lottery. As a young, ambitious writer, director and presenter, he was able to create low-budget, high-impact films that could reach a worldwide audience, in a way that would have been impossible without the blessing of television’s gatekeepers just a few years earlier. In February 2013, he had his first viral hit, an abridged version of Sony’s announcement of its PlayStation 4 video game console, dubbed with a cheerily acerbic commentary. Within days the video had been watched millions of times. “It hardly seems viral at all, by today’s standards,” Lees says, yet it was one of the most viewed videos on YouTube that month. The boost to Lees’ ego was nothing compared with the effect it had on his career. When YouTube’s algorithm notices this sort of success, it starts directing viewers to the uploader’s other videos, earning the channel more subscribers and, via the snippety advertisements that play before each one, higher income. Overnight, Lees had what seemed like the first shoots of a sustainable career.Excitement soon gave way to anxiety. Even in 2013, Lees was aware that his success depended not so much on smash hits as on day-by-day reliability. “It’s not enough to simply create great things,” he says. “The audience expect consistency. They expect frequency. Without these, it’s incredibly easy to slip off the radar and lose favour with the algorithm that gave you your wings.” By the end of the year Lees had grown his channel from 1,000 subscribers to 90,000, and caught the attention of one of his influences, Charlie Brooker, who invited Lees to collaborate on writing a Channel 4 special. For a month Lees worked 20-hour days, iding his time between the TV script work and, ever conscious that missing a day’s upload could cause his videos to tumble down the search rankings, his YouTube channel.At the end of the month he was pale, gaunt and tired in a way that, he recalls, seemed “impervious to rest”. His work, he noticed, had become increasingly rushed and harsh in tone. Yet the angry, provocative quality of his videos seemed only to be making them more popular. “Divisive content is the king of online media today, and YouTube heavily boosts anything that riles people up,” he says. “It’s one of the most toxic things: the point at which you’re breaking down is the point at which the algorithm loves you the most.”Lees began to feel a knock-on effect on his health. “Human brains really aren’t designed to be interacting with hundreds of people every day,” he says. “When you’ve got thousands of people giving you direct feedback on your work, you really get the sense that something in your mind just snaps. We just aren’t built to handle empathy and sympathy on that scale.” Lees developed a thyroid problem, and began to experience more frequent and persistent stretches of depression. “What started out as being the most fun job imaginable quickly slid into something that felt deeply bleak and lonely,” he says.For years, YouTubers have believed that they are loved most by their audience when they project a chirpy, grateful image. But what happens when the mask slips? This year there has been a wave of videos by prominent YouTubers talking about their burnout, chronic fatigue and depression. “This is all I ever wanted,” said Elle Mills, a 20-year-old Filipino-Canadian YouTuber in a (monetised) video entitled Burnt Out At 19, posted in May. “And why the fuck am I so unfucking unhappy? It doesn’t make any sense. You know what I mean? Because, like, this is literally my fucking dream. And I’m fucking so un-fucking-happy.”Mills had gained a lot of attention (and 3.6m views) for a slick and cleverly edited five-minute video she posted last November in which she came out as bisexual to her friends, family and followers (many of whom had been asking about her sexuality in the comments). She went on to be featured on the cover of Diva magazine, and won a Shorty award for “breakout YouTuber”. But six months later she posted the Burnt Out video, explaining how her schoolgirl ambition of becoming a YouTuber had led her to bigger and bigger audiences, but that “it’s not what I expected. I’m always stressed. My anxiety and depression keep getting worse. I’m waiting to hit my breaking point.”The same month Rubén “El Rubius” Gundersen, a 28-year-old Spaniard who is currently the world’s third most popular YouTuber, with more than 30 million subscribers, talked about how he felt as if he was heading for a breakdown, and had, as a result, decided to take a break. They are the latest in a string of high-profile YouTubers, including Erik Phillips (better known as M3RKMUS1C, with 4 million subscribers) and Benjamin Vestergaard (Crainer, with 2.8 million), to have announced hiatuses from the channel, or described their struggles with exhaustion.The anxieties are tied up with the relentless nature of their work. Tyler Blevins, AKA Ninja, makes an estimated $500,000 (£384,000) every month via live broadcasts of him playing the video game Fortnite on Twitch, a service for livestreaming video games that is owned by Amazon. Most of Blevins’ revenue comes from Twitch subscribers or viewers who provide one-off donations (often in the hope that he will thank them by name “on air”). Blevins recently took to Twitter to complain that he didn’t feel he could stop streaming. “Wanna know the struggles of streaming over other jobs?” he wrote, perhaps ill-advisedly for someone with such a stratospheric income. “I left for less than 48 hours and lost 40,000 subscribers on Twitch. I’ll be back today… grinding again.”There was little sympathy on Twitter for the millionaire. But the pressure he described is felt at every level of success, from the titans of the content landscape all the way down to the people with channels with just a few thousand subscribers, all of whom feel they must be constantly creating, always available and responding to their fans. “Constant releases build audience loyalty,” says Austin Hourigan, who runs ShoddyCast, a YouTube channel with 1.2 million subscribers. “The more loyalty you build, the more likely your viewers are to come back, which gives you the closest thing to a financial safety net in what is otherwise a capricious space.”When a YouTuber passes the 1 million subscribers mark, they are presented with a gold plaque to mark the event. Many of these plaques can be seen on shelves and walls in the background of presenters’ rooms. In this way, the size of viewership and quantity of uploads become the main markers of value.Professional YouTubers speak in tones at once reverential and resentful of the power of “the Algorithm” (it’s seen as a near-sentient entity, not only by creators, but also by YouTube’s own engineers). Created by the high priests of Silicon Valley, who continually tweak its characteristics, this is the programming code on which the fate of every YouTuber depends. It decides which videos to pluck from the Niagara of content that splashes on to YouTube every hour (400 hours’ worth every 60 seconds, according to Google) to deliver as “recommended viewing” to the service’s billions of users.Every time you log on to YouTube you are presented with videos chosen by the algorithm. The idea is that a clip particularly well suited to your tastes will inspire you to click the Subscribe button – which, hopefully, will bring you back to watch a new episode tomorrow. The viewer feels that YouTube understands what he or she likes, while advertisers are reassured that the video in front of which their five-second commercial will run will reach an appropriately targeted audience.When your income is dependent on the number of people who watch your videos each week, this code can decide what, or even whether, you eat. And, 13 years into YouTube’s existence, many believe it has come to sit at the core of a growing mental health crisis among video creators.In April this year there was a particularly extreme example, when 38-year-old Nasim Najafi Aghdam entered YouTube’s Californian campus and opened fire on employees with a 9mm pistol, wounding three before she killed herself. A video Aghdam uploaded prior to the attack suggested that it was driven by her belief that the company’s algorithm had passed over her videos in March she posted on Instagram, “All my YouTube channels got filtered by YouTube so my videos hardly get views.”Algorithm-led content curation makes creators feel disposable, challenging them to churn out videos in the knowledge that there are younger, fresher people waiting in the wings to replace them. For YouTubers who use their daily lives as raw material for their videos, there is added pressure, as the traditional barriers between personal and professional life are irreparably eroded.At a recent party at a conference for YouTubers and streamers, Hourigan was standing with a group of YouTubers when he quipped: “I think every YouTube career should come with a coupon for a free therapist.” Everybody laughed, he recalls, but “in a sad way”.“By the way,” he adds, “I’m medicated and have a therapist.”Katherine Lo is a researcher into online communities at the University of California, Irvine. For her, it’s not simply the frequency and consistency of content creation that lead to burnout, but the specific nature of the work required to keep audiences engaged, which includes being active on social media, interacting with fans, and other roles beyond writing, presenting and editing. “This kind of labour is often invisible but very taxing and a major contributor to occupational stress,” Lo explains. “In many cases it can contribute to PTSD, especially when creators are subject to harassment, threats to their safety and privacy, or ongoing toxicity in their community.”She recently developed a list of occupational factors that contribute to mental health risks for creators. It includes the exhaustion that comes from performing “familiarity” with the audience, the stress of reading comments, the financial anxiety associated with managing sponsorships and donations, and the pressure of managing reputation and professional ties in the YouTuber community, where recommendations are key to getting fans.Those who work on larger channels, which have enough money to employ a staff and spread the pressure, are not immune to these risks. Belinda Zoller joined the team behind the Extra Credits YouTube channel in 2016. The channel publishes weekly lessons in video game design and world history, using cheery animations. It has close to 1.6 million subscribers Zoller works as a moderator, responding to comments. Moderation is one of the most gruelling jobs in the web’s emergent economy, and while Zoller does not work in front of the camera, her role puts her in the firing line for anonymous abuse and bad-faith interaction. Within months she was exhausted. “There is a lot of emotional labour involved in my work,” she says. “I empathise with the root of people’s concerns and criticisms, even if I disagree with some of them.”Zoller views YouTube as her primary “office space” – a shift that, she says, has “very much negatively impacted my mental health”. No matter how much she enjoys helping to run a popular channel, the platform itself is steeped in negativity. Moderating comments in order to maintain a clean and safe online space is like weeding a garden: every time a root is pulled up, another three nose through the soil in its place. Zoller believes that, far from wanting to deal with the negativity, YouTube actively encourages it via the design of the algorithm. “People tend not to discuss content unless they have very strong opinions about it, and most of the time those strong opinions favour disagreement,” she explains. “So the algorithm favours clickbait and controversial content over meaningfully nuanced and positive content.”For Lo, video-based social media platforms are catastrophically failing those who sustain their business. “YouTube fails to protect creators from the extremely common occupational hazards of being doxxed, stalked, harassed and threatened online,” she says. (Doxxing is the revealing of someone’s identity or other personal information.) “They claim no responsibility for the wellbeing of their creators or the communities they create.”Asked about Lo’s comments, a spokeswoman for YouTube replies: “Harassment is abhorrent and wrong. YouTube has policies against harassment and bullying, as indicated in our community guidelines. We review flagged content quickly, and remove inappropriate videos according to our policies.” In order to avoid burnout, it encourages creators to “take breaks, enjoy weekends, nights and vacations just like any job”. “Of course,” the spokeswoman adds, “we always hope creators are discussing their struggles openly with others in the YouTube community.”As part of its Creator Academy, a vast online “school” covering everything from how to “enhance your channel’s search and discovery potential” to how to “make deals with brands”, YouTube recently commissioned a series of videos designed to teach its partners how to avoid fatigue. (Few of the people I speak to who run YouTube channels are aware of the resource.) The video on burnout has been viewed just over 32,000 times. It’s written and presented by 34-year-old Kati Morton. A licensed therapist based in Los Angeles, Morton has been posting videos to YouTube for eight years. As such, she is well placed to understand both the problem and the potential solution.In 2010, when she started her channel, Morton was working as a therapist with a private practice. YouTube was her way to reach a wider audience with tips and information that she believed could help them. Three years ago, her success on the platform enabled her to become a full-time YouTuber, but learning to personally manage the pressures she had warned about has been challenging. “I am no better than anyone else,” she says. “I’ve got tired, stressed about everything. It was a journey to get to the place where I felt able to tell my audience that I would be taking a vacation.”That holiday, a two-week break last Christmas, was the first Morton had taken since going full-time in 2015. “Maybe I took a long weekend the summer before, for our anniversary?” she says. “No. Wait. I worked then, too.”Every time Morton posts a new video she is expected to be in the comments, responding to questions and suggestions, before starting work on the next. “I have trouble with boundaries,” she says. “I always feel like I should be working, or that they’re counting on me.”Like all YouTubers, Morton also feels the financial pressure of the system, which typically pays between £1.50 and £3 for every 1,000 views. “The reward for your work is liable to change at any time,” she says. “Your views can go down for a variety of reasons, and when that happens, you earn less.” For this reason, even with close to half a million subscribers, Morton feels unable to employ anyone to help her with the workload.YouTube recommends that creators who are struggling “enlist support”. Morton argues that, for the majority, it is an impossible expense. “If I had someone supporting me it would make all the difference,” she says. “But I’d need my daily views to double before I’d feel comfortable doing that. Could you imagine having to fire someone because my views went down? That would be awful.”For her, the solution comes back to the algorithm. “YouTube rewards people who produce daily,” she says. “They made the algorithm, so they have the power to remake it. If they set different criteria, it would help. We are human beings. We need some time for ourselves.”Matt Lees is furious at what he sees as YouTube’s lacklustre approach to support and advice. “Encouraging creators to ‘take a break’ is pretty laughable from a system that actively promotes quantity over quality,” he says. “There’s no sense of responsibility for the culture that YouTube has created.” For Katherine Lo, the capacity to maintain a healthy worklife balance while being successful on YouTube and Twitch is a “barely possible” dream. “ They offer highly precarious work, where the promise of robust success – where one has a reliable, sustainable income – is only enjoyed by a small percentage of creators. Trying to reduce frequency of content and establish worklife balance merely adds even more risk.”The demands of the YouTuber life suit younger creators – and the largest demographic on the site is those in their 20s (when once teenagers may have dreamed of becoming pop stars, now they dream of becoming YouTubers). Many find it possible to keep creating at a high enough rate, if only for a few years. “At that age you absolutely can,” Lees says. “You’ve got the energy and focus to work incredibly long hours, you’ve got very few responsibilities to take your attention away from work, and – perhaps most importantly – you’ve likely still got a solid social circle, friendships that aren’t difficult to maintain.” But, as every casualty of childhood stardom demonstrates, early success carries with it tremendous risk.“The journey to creative stardom used to take more time – learning the ropes and developing a thick skin, and having a team of advisers and trusted friends,” says Chris O’Sullivan, from the UK charity the Mental Health Foundation. “Today, you can become a superstar online with one viral video – at any age or stage and from any location. Without support and guidance, the potential to be burned by the exposure is great.”As time goes on, and life grows more complicated, the sense of isolation, anxiety and weariness is exacerbated.“I spent my 20s working ceaselessly, feeling invincible and boundless,” Lees says. “And honestly, I was. Right up until the point where I wasn’t.”• Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure the discussion remains on the topics raised by the article.Commenting on this piece?

Was discovered in 1991 in the Ötztal Alps alongside a mummified man whom scientists dubbed Ötzi the Iceman. The man and the remains of the backpack, which would have consisted of a cloth or animal skin bag on a wooden frame, date back to between 3400 and 3100BC.An expedition set out in 1519 led by Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan, who was aiming to discover a western spice route. Unfortunately, he died in the Philippines in 1521, and Juan Sebastián Elcano took over. After three years, the voyage proved the world was not only round but also a lot larger than previously thought. Of the 240-man expedition, Elcano and 17 crew were the only ones to make it all the way around, returning to Spain in 1522.In the 1950s and 60s, young people seeking spirituality, freedom and cheap marijuana began travelling overland from Europethrough Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan to India and Nepal, and sometimes Thailand. They packed light and kept costs low by hitchhiking and taking buses. This “hippy trail” came to an end in 1979, when the Iranian revolution and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan closed the route. But Asia is still the most popular place for first-timers.In 1972, Maureen and Tony Wheeler travelled overland from London to Australia.

Now it’s getting in on the act with jokes about its new projectIf you pass through the great hall of Denver airport in Colorado this weekend, you won’t fail to notice the huge amount of building work going on there. Or at least … it looks like building work.Large posters, placed on hoardings around the terminal, cast doubt on what’s really going on. One reads: “Construction? Or cover up?” and features Illuminati insignia on a yellow hard hat. Another shows a reptile head poking out of a suit and asks: “What are we doing?” It offers three potential answers, one of which is: “Remodelling the lizard people’s lair.”The posters seem like some of the wackier outbursts of conspiracy theorist and Trump fanatic Alex Jones, hinting that the airport is part of some kind of satanic plot. In fact, they’ve been put there by the airport as part of a new advertising campaign, which plays up the fact that ever since it was opened in its current iteration in 1995, Denver international airport (DIA) has, for some reason, been the subject of conspiracy theories.There is, to give the tinfoil hat crowd their due, lots that is fishy about DIA. The dedication stone, created for the airport’s opening, bears the logo of the Freemasons and was paid for by two Freemason grand lodges in Colorado, as well as something called the “New World Airport Commission”, an organisation about which there is almost no information. It has led conspiracy theorists to argue that their airport is the headquarters for a secretive new world order linked to the masons or the Illuminati.There are also unusual murals in the airport, painted by the artist Leo Tanguma, which depict creepy images of manmade environmental destruction and genocide. They have been seized upon by conspiracy theorists, although they often neglect to mention that they are part of a four-part series, and the final two murals depict all of humanity coming together to live in harmony and peace.Other theories that have been touted include suggestions that the runways were arranged in the shape of a swastika and that unusual markings on the airport floor are satanic symbols. Another is the huge bunkers under the airport, allegedly created for an automated luggage system that malfunctioned when the airport opened, are in fact an underground lair for the “lizard people”.The theories have been passed around on conspiracy forums and YouTube for years, and were also the subject of an episode of Jesse Ventura’s Tru TV show Conspiracy Theory. In 2008, the airport got a new chief executive, Kim Day, who embraced the suspicion surrounding the airport. Day’s approach included an exhibition about the airport’s suspicious history, art exhibits that used Illuminati imagery, a conspiracy costume party and even a competition to win a trip underneath the airport, to examine its mysterious underground facilities.Now the airport is at it again: with construction taking place in the great hall, they’re playing up suggestions that something unearthly is going on. As well as the posters, there’s also a new web page called Den Files which includes bonus conspiracy theories like “the date of the airport’s dedication is March 19, 1994. And if you add those numbers together (1+9+1+9+9+4), you get 33 ­– the highest level one can achieve in Freemasonry.”Indeed, across YouTube, Google and social media, a majority of results in a search for Denver airport conspiracy theories contain content made by or in conjunction with the airport itself suggesting that while the conspiracy world may have moved on to other things, bosses are keen on the idea that there is more to DIA than being America’s fifth-busiest airport …"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fcf71fac517d9afd107aa38529aaf2715c0c182d/0_156_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d43f0a912d9cfb78eef2b2f1d372e49","title":"barack obama california rally democrats midterms house","story":"Former president to speak at Anaheim convention center as party operatives focus on seven key seatsBarack Obama’s dramatic foray into the midterm election season rolls into California on Saturday, as the former president headlines a rally to stir the Democratic party faithful and boost candidates in seven congressional races seen as key to winning control of the House of Representatives in November.Having seized the limelight at the University of Illinois on Friday with an electric speech denouncing the isiveness and resentment of Trump-era politics, Obama will address an invitation-only audience at the Anaheim convention center, a stone’s throw from Disneyland in the vast suburbs between Los Angeles and San Diego.It is a part of the Golden State that is rapidly ransforming from rock-ribbed Republican to solid Democratic blue thanks to demographic shifts and a marked local distaste for the Trump brand of conservative politics.Four of the congressional candidates who will share the stage with the former president are fighting for Republican-held seats less than an hour’s drive away. All seven are competing in districts that favored Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump in the 2016 election.In contrast to Friday’s event in Illinois, when Obama was addressing students and urging them to make themselves heard at the ballot box, the California rally will be aimed primarily at Democratic operatives and their key supporters. Despite some clamor for tickets after the event was announced two days ago, the event is closed to the public.The former president remains broadly popular in California and has just had a street named after him in an up-and-coming, historically African American section of Los Angeles. While he visited frequently, both as a candidate and as president – Los Angeles in particular grew to fear the “Obamajams” his motorcade would invariably create on the freeways – he usually came for fundraisers and never held a major public rally because electoral logic tended to draw his attention elsewhere.As Obama said in Illinois, though: “This moment really is different. The stakes really are higher.” And California, for once, is front and centre in the struggle to turn the House back to Democratic control for the first time in eight years.The two most powerful incumbent Republicans in the contested districts – Darrell Issa, a former House oversight committee chair, and Ed Royce, chair of the foreign affairs committee – are retiring. Their seats are seen as particularly ripe for the taking.Also seen as particularly vulnerable is Dana Rohrabacher, known for his close ties to Russia, who was recently featured in Sacha Baron Cohen’s TV show Who Is America? speaking in favor of arming schoolchildren. Rohrabacher’s opponent, Harley Rouda, took the opportunity to paint Rohrabacher as both gullible and extreme. Rohrabacher countered that the show was nothing but a “sick fraud”.Democratic operatives believe they’ll need to win at least four of the seven seats if they are to stand a chance of reaching the net gain of 23 seats they need to take control of the House. Winning all seven appears eminently possible, and in a particularly good showing might extend that to three or four more seats in California currently scored as leaning Republican.What haunts party leaders, though, is the historically poor showing of rank-and-file Democrats in midterm elections. While they are seeing evidence of far greater motivation than usual among their supporters, as well as a surge of new candidates for office, they will be looking to Obama and other Democratic stars to keep the faithful laser-focused on the task at hand – and reach out to disaffected Republicans and independents while they are at it.Obama’s message in Illinois seemed designed to straddle the twin aims of motivating the base and appealing to a saner, more inclusive, less isive style of politics. He is expecting to carry that message over as his campaign tour continues, first in California and then in Ohio."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da6ddcf61bb9e48fb6e90dff54a34f683d99b0b4/0_40_3072_1843/master/3072.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=96dccb4e5ee5bd7905b219fc94182b6f","title":"italy matteo salvini joins steve bannon european populist group movement","story":"Interior minister pledges support to the Movement after meeting in RomeMatteo Salvini, Italy’s interior minister and populist leader, has met Steve Bannon and joined the anti-European establishment group, the Movement, founded by Donald Trump’s former chief strategist.“He is in!” tweeted Mischaël Modrikamen, the Belgian politician and co-founder of the People’s party, who is also a member of Bannon’s group which unites Euroscepticand populist forces.According to Italian media, Bannon has suggested the upcoming European elections in 2019 could open the way for new populist movements to fight the influence of the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the French president, Emmanuel Macron.The meeting in Rome on Friday follows recent talks between Salvini and the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, another leader of European populism who shares an anti-migration stance.After their meeting, on 28 August, Salvini and Orbán claimed they were “walking down the same path” after discussing the formation of a common anti-migration front to oppose the policies of Macron.Bannon is not new to European politics, being close to Nigel Farage, the former Ukip leader, who has credited him with boosting the successful British campaign to leave the EU. The former White House strategist, who is a Catholic with ties to conservatives in the Vatican, had travelled to Rome in March to support Salvini before the Italian elections. Salvini, the leader of the rightwing party the League, governs in coalition with the anti-establishment Five Star Movement.On Wednesday, Bannon met another far-right Italian leader in Venice: Giorgia Meloni, the founder of the Brothers of Italy party who is close to Salvini and the former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi.“Italy has become a laboratory of European populism,’’ said Massimiliano Panarari, a politics professor at Luiss School of Government in Rome.“The country risks moving away not only from Europe, but also from western democracies.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/902b64c2d236ad008541e575fd2400c0d8b7c705/1327_1477_3704_2223/master/3704.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a370e8eceeab6fbc2dee6370a8ced7c","title":"sandi toksvig reveals 60 qi pay gap from stephen fry","story":"BBC quiz host tells Women’s Equality party her pay is equal to panellist Alan DaviesThe QI presenter Sandi Toksvig has revealed she is paid less than half of what former host Stephen Fry received for fronting the popular BBC quiz show.The comedian, who also presents Channel 4’s The Great British Bake Off, was speaking to delegates at the Women’s Equality party conference on Saturday when she answered a question about her pay in an economics session.According to Mayer, the news was greeted with a “huge gasp” from the audience in Kettering. “People just did not know,” Mayer said. “Sandi has always been clear that this is not about her pay, but she had to answer the question given that the issue of equal pay is at the centre of our party’s policy.”Fry once claimed he was paid more to front the general knowledge quiz than the £245,000 Jeremy Paxman received for presenting University Challenge.Speaking after the event, Toksvig said: “I love QI and the brilliant team who produce it. John Lloyd and the team champion women on the show. I was asked a question at the Women’s Equality party conference that I felt I had to answer, because the issues with equal pay and the gender pay gap cut right across the media and all industries and all areas of life.“Until now I had held back from talking about this because this is not about me. However, the lack of transparency around pay is a big part of the problem and I hope that being open, I can support women across the country whose work is undervalued.”Toksvig has previously told the Radio Times: “If you are doing the same job it seems a bit absurd if you’re not paid the same.”The Danish-born writer has also argued, however, that her pay on the show is not an issue. In an interview on BBC 5 Live in October 2016 she said: “I wasn’t concerned about that because it is done through an agent and I am paid by an independent production company that makes the show, and not the BBC anyway.”Toksvig added that only women were asked about pay because they were generally the ones being underpaid. She said she suspected Miles Jupp would not have been asked if he was getting the same pay as her for taking over the hosting of the News Quiz, a job she did for BBC Radio 4 for nine years.Earlier this year Toksvig was reported to have claimed she was paid more than her three co-stars on The Great British Bake Off, despite Paul Hollywood’s alleged £1.2m contract.Not everyone was surprised by Toksvig’s revelation.

But the centre-left and centre-right have never governed together, and all other parties have maintained a strict cordon sanitaire around the populists, who – although purged of their most openly racist and neo-fascist elements over the past decade – had their early roots in Sweden’s Nazi movement.With far-right, anti-immigration, nation-first and populist parties making advances across Europe and now in government in Italy, Austria, Norway and Finland, the election, in a country long seen as a model of political stability, is being closely watched as the latest test of anti-establishment sentiment on the continent.In a campaign dominated by immigration, integration, crime, healthcare and education, the Sweden Democrats have rarely strayed from their core message: that the 400,000 asylum seekers Sweden has welcomed since 2012 – the most, per head of the population, of any European country – are straining the country’s generous welfare state to breaking point.But recent research by Stockholm university found that, as elsewhere in Europe, both the Eurosceptic, anti-immigration party’s politicians and its voters fall into categories whose employment and overall economic situations have worsened after the 2008 financial crisis.In the leaders’ final debate this week, the party’s leader, Jimmie Åkesson, said: “Why is it so difficult for these migrants to get a job? That is because they’re not Swedish. They can’t adjust to Sweden.”Löfven has suggested he could be open to some form of cross-bloc arrangement with two smaller centre-right opposition parties, the Centre and Liberal parties.Although polls suggest that up to a third of Moderate party voters would back the inclusion of the far-right party in a new government, the Moderate leader Ulf Kristersson has also refused to contemplate any tie-up, however informal, with the populists, who have said they will work with anyone but would demand policy concessions, particularly on immigration."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b94b94e4f47864a4fe5b5bd6425feed9aad1178/0_241_3487_2094/master/3487.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1dac974a2f13967bb26dd879d097a2ae","title":"the us midterm elections are set to be the year of the woman","story":"New analysis by NBC News predicts more than 100 women may be elected.

And they haven’t just been running – they’ve been winning, too.

It seems like every brand these days is keen to flaunt their (often faux) feminist credentials in their ads. The latest example of brands treating feminism as some kind of trend is Harvey Nichols, a posh department store in London. Remember when Johnnie Walker switched its name to Jane Walker earlier this year? Well, Harvey Nichols decided to nick their idea and are rebranding as Holly Nichols for September. Because, feminism. Not only is this stunt derivative but it makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. Harvey Nichols was co-founded Anne Harvey and James Nichols. So the rebrand to Holly Nichols erases a real woman from the store’s history and replaces her with a fictional woman.

Give a 16-year-old a job packing shelves in Tesco, you make sure he can pack shelves.”The only things Mr Quinn and others in central Belfast were sure of was that British prime minister Theresa May had blundered in appointing Bradley and that Bradley had blundered in admitting her obliviousness.In an interview with House magazine, a weekly publication for the Houses of Parliament, Ms Bradley said that when appointed Northern Ireland secretary in January she did not know nationalists did not vote for unionists and that unionists did not vote for nationalists.“I freely admit that when I started this job, I didn’t understand some of the deep-seated and deep-rooted issues that there are in Northern Ireland,” she said. “I didn’t understand things like when elections are fought, for example, in Northern Ireland - people who are nationalists don’t vote for unionist parties and vice versa.”The former culture secretary also admitted being “slightly scared” of a place that has enjoyed relative peace and stability since the 1998 Belfast Agreement.A Downing Street spokesperson said Ms May retained confidence in Ms Bradley and that the minister was “working incredibly hard” to restore devolved government. The Irish Government, too, called her a smart and experienced politician.But Sinn Féin’s former Stormont finance minister Máirtín Ó Muilleoir said Ms Bradley’s comments were a “sorry reminder” of where the country was on the priority list of the British government.People in Belfast, nationalist and unionist, expressed astonishment that Ms Bradley was put in charge at an exceptionally sensitive time, with Brexit and the breakdown in Stormont’s power-sharing government putting the Belfast Agreement under strain.“It’s ridiculous that she could know nothing about it and still get the job. Usually you have to show knowledge to get a job. I did,” said Leona Orr (24) a child care worker from Clogher Valley.Henry McCarthy (76) a retired community worker, said: “I was absolutely horrified that she could be in a position where she was so terribly ignorant of a situation in which so many people were killed, it just baffles me.”Among those who died in the Troubles was Airey Neave, a Tory MP blown up by a republican terrorist bomb at Westminster in 1979, yet Ms Bradley had risen through the party ranks with no clue about Northern Ireland, said Mr McCarthy. “To come here without even primitive knowledge reflects very badly on the prime minister and the Conservative party.”Stephanie Lyons (41) a civil servant, said she was not surprised. “A lot of English people don’t know how things are here. But you would expect more from a politician,” she said.Tom Neill (72) a former soldier, echoed a widespread view that Ms Bradley’s comments showed indifference to Northern Ireland. “The government in Westminster doesn’t give a damn about us.”Several of those interviewed confessed their own ignorance about Bradley - they had no idea who she was until hearing about her startlingly frank interview. “Not heard of her till today, to be honest,” said Michael Reynolds (73) a retired driving instructor.This week the Northern Ireland secretary had won some plaudits for slashing the pay of members of the paralysed Stormont assembly, a long overdue move, according to many voters.In the interview with House magazine Ms Bradley (47) said of Northern Ireland’s partisan politics: “That’s a very different world from the world I came from where in Staffordshire Moorlands I was fighting a Labour-held seat as a Conservative politician and I was trying to put forward why you would want to switch from voting Labour to voting Conservative.“That is so incredibly different and it’s when you realise that, and you see that, that you can then start to understand some of the things that the politicians say and some of the rhetoric.”The Troubles had shaped her view of Northern Ireland and she had no idea how wonderful and vibrant the region was, she said.“I was slightly scared of Northern Ireland because of my impression and images from 20 years ago. That is not the place that it is today,” she said.Several shoppers on Castle Street wondered if there was calculation, a hidden tactic, behind her apparent naivety. “Politicians are trained to lie,” said Johns Gibbs. “Maybe it’s like, ‘I’m stupid, forgive me’.”– "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3623091.1536426889!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"irexit freedom to prosper to field candidates in european elections","story":"“Irexit Freedom” a new Irish Eurosceptic political party calling for Ireland to leave the European Union has been launched in Dublin .

We were a free country for a short period after we left the last political union we were in, which was the British Empire.He said: “The relative advantages of being in the EU have decreased and now that we are a net contributor of €400 million a year to old, drunk men who make our laws I think we’re crazy to stay in.”About 350 people attended the conference, many having travelled long distances. Among those who spoke was Prof Ray Kinsella of the UCD Smurfit Business School, who said “official Ireland” had “made the EU the custodian of our national interests”.“It is important to recognise the founding visions of Europe and what it has accomplished but what is clear to me is that there have been structural and operational difficulties which have grown in recent years.” He said there were growing asymmetries of power and growing inequalities and there was now a “compelling case for an Irish exit”.“Europe has changed fundamentally and we need to recognise that, so have we . . . In my view Britain is leaving not Europe but what Europe has become. The growth of populism reflects the pain, the deep-seated pain that austerity has imposed on the people of Europe.Ben Scallon (21), co-founder of Civil Right Media, said the biggest threat to “our freedoms” was the “EU super state”.Describing the EU as “ultra left” and “Marxist” he said Marxism was a “murderous totalitarian ideology” which had “inflicted terrible suffering” on the smaller states in Europe.In its political programme the Irexit Freedom to Prosper party says exit from the EU will “permit the Irish people to take back control” over a range of issues including lawmaking, human rights, borders and immigration policy, currency and foreign and security policy.It sets out 12 principles, including to “support all efforts to strengthen the Irishness of Ireland, in particular its language and distinctive cultural and historical traditions”, and to promote a “society of liberty with a free and erse media which supports free speech, freedom of association and freedom of religion”.Among those attending was Richard Behal (70) from Killarney who said he had “consistently opposed membership of the EEC and now EU since 1972” and he had come to listen to what was being said.Ann Watkin had travelled with her mother from Co Westmeath. “We have come to listen. We can’t trust the press to tell us what is happening so we have come to listen for ourselves”.Pat Buchanan from Dublin said he “would have some concerns about the EU” and was also worried about the manner in which Irish officials were “insulting Britain” in Brexit negotiations."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3621893.1536332600!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"karen bradley routs rival imbeciles with ladybird guide to the north","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWhere am I?: Karen Bradley on her first visit to Northern Ireland as secretary of state, in January. Photograph: Charles McQuillanGettyFor me, I think that quote may be the equivalent of the death blow in Kill Bill. Do you know the one? You get hit just with fingertips, “and then he lets you walk away. But once you’ve taken five steps, your heart explodes in your body, and you fall to the floor, dead.” So with the Northern Ireland secretary’s hot take on Northern Ireland. My mechanism might be shot for good after reading it. I may well be typing my last five steps here.Clearly, it is not simply the initial imbecility of having no clue about the central facts of Northern Irish politics and history, even though you were 28 (twenty-eight) when the Belfast Agreement was signed. It is also the second imbecility of thinking you should ever mention that in public, much less as delightedly, as Karen did. “It’s when you realise that,” burbled the secretary of state, “that you can then start to understand some of the things that the politicians say and some of the rhetoric.”Ideally, you would start understanding these things some decades before you were the cabinet minister with operational responsibility for arguably the most sensitive region of the United Kingdom. Instead, Karen’s breezy My Learning Curve speech casts high office as a remedial scheme for the unreachable outliers of Family Fortunes survey respondents. “We asked 100 people what they imagined were the Ladybird-level facts about Northern Ireland.”Karen’s answer is the type of WTF-ery that allows even Vernon Kay (Vernon Kay) to mug to camera with the practised eyebrow-raise that says: Where do they find these quarterwits? It was previously thought that any challenge to Andrea Leadsom’s position as stupidest Downing Street minister would have to hail from the mineral or at least vegetable kingdoms. But this is quite sensational from Karen. Theresa May’s decision to appoint her to this government of all the talentless underscores exactly where the UK stands. If you hadn’t already swallowed the red pill, you may safely consider Karen’s interview as your dose. No going back now. The answer to the question “How low is the bar?” is: the bar is in another hemisphere. The bar is orbiting Jupiter. There is no bar.Darker portents attend Karen’s predecessor as the British cabinet minster most wantonly and insouciantly unsuited to their job. It’s been a mixed week for Boris Johnson. On the downside for us, Boris has been explicitly backed for the leadership by the cruelly miscast kingmaker Jacob Rees-Mogg. On the upside, Johnson’s statement announcing his orce from his wife, Marina Wheeler, tees up a series of malarial Love Actually plot lines for when he later – or sooner – gets the keys to 10 Downing Street. (And if you’re still doubting the heart-exploding inevitability of that scenario, you must have been watching the global upsets of the past two years on tape delay. Everything that can go wrong does. Buy shares in distilleries today.)As for the coveted endorsement from someone Boris would unquestionably have pitied mercilessly at school (they missed being Eton contemporaries by a year), it came in a radio interview on LBC. “Two years ago, in the Conservative Party leadership campaign, I supported Boris Johnson, because I thought he would deliver Brexit extraordinarily well,” Rees-Mogg intoned, suggesting he has inherited all his father’s gifts of prophecy. “I haven’t seen anything that would cause me to change my mind on that.” Not anything?! Should have gone to MonocleSavers.Yet Boris is undeniably back. He has never been more back. Perhaps the most striking feature of the immediate period is how people decisively written off as wrong’uns in the very recent past are emerging again as comparatively attractive prospects. Two years ago, Michael Gove had been deservedly downgraded to a mere Brutus emoji now he’s apparently a leadership contender once more.Perhaps the preposterous inadequates of the past do all seem like elder statespeople now. Others appear so inspired by their accelerated rehabilitation that they are trying to pull off something similar instantly. Take David Davis, who announced this week that he would attend a Leave Means Leave rally in Bolton “as a matter of principle, to ensure Brexit is delivered”.What can you say? Until about 10 minutes ago, David had spent two years as the cabinet minister literally in charge of delivering it. This is like setting fire to a building, running away, then standing outside telling the emergency services how you’d be handling the rescue differently.Expect plenty more auditions for the role of Captain Hindsight in the weeks and months ahead.

He was said to be in a stable condition.Monkeypox is a rare viral infection, similar to smallpox but not as deadly. It is usually mild and self-limiting with most people recovering within a few weeks, but severe illness and death can occur.It does not spread easily between humans but can be transmitted via close contact. PHE has contacted 50 people it considers to be at risk, including those sitting closest to the patient on the flight from Abuja to Heathrow on Sunday September 2.A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence said “all necessary steps” were being taken but that no other personnel had developed symptoms.The initial symptoms of monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion.In humans, the signs and symptoms of monkeypox are similar to those of smallpox, but usually milderA painful rash with open sores can develop, often beginning on the face, then spreading to other parts of the body.The rash changes and goes through different stages before finally forming a scab, which later falls off. If the disease infects the eye it can lead to scarring of the cornea and, in some cases, blindness.Dr Michael Jacobs, clinical director of infection at the Royal Free said: “Monkeypox is, in most cases, a mild condition which will resolve on its own and have no long-term effects on a person’s health. Most people recover within several weeks.Countries reporting monkeypox cases in humans and animals“It is a rare disease caused by monkeypox virus, and has been reported mainly in central and west African countries.“It does not spread easily between people and the risk of transmission to the wider public is very low. We are using strict isolation procedures in hospital to protect our staff and patients.” Dr Nick Phin, deputy director of the national infection service at PHE said:“It is important to emphasise that monkeypox does not spread easily between people and the overall risk to the general public is very low.“Public Health England is following up those who have had close contact with the patient to offer advice and to monitor them as necessary.“PHE and the NHS have well established and robust infection control procedures for dealing with cases of imported infectious disease and these will be strictly followed to minimise the risk of transmission.”Monkeypox was first observed in the 1960s in monkeys brought to Europe from Africa, with the first human case diagnosed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 1970.Nigeria is experiencing a particularly virulent outbreak with 89 people infected and six deaths since 2017.Scientists are still unsure if the disease is transmitted by monkeys or via rodents.Please review our commenting policyStrictly Come Dancing 2018 launch show: will Anton Du Beke finally get a decent partner?Comeback for clutter as Britons rediscover the joy of collectingChildren as young as four will learn dangers of online sex abuse as police chiefs accuse social media giants of failing to protect young peopleLondon firm \u0026#39helped North Korea evade UN sanctions\u0026#39 on coal salesExperts hunt for missing mourning rings of eccentric philosopher Jeremy BenthamComment: Don\u0026#39t replace inheritance tax – just get rid of it altogetherComment: There\u0026#39s nothing immoral about democracies having nuclear arsenals – and being prepared to use themItaly could still leave EU, senior government adviser saysNew York ballet in turmoil after sexual harrassment claims, but \u0026#39the surface has barely been scratched\u0026#39\u0026#39Pest of Zorro\u0026#39 threatens to cut swathe through UK elm treesComment: In the new politically correct religion, being male is the original sin and forgiveness is impossibleDown but not out: super chef Alain Ducasse loses Eiffel Tower but opens \u0026#39floating restaraunt\u0026#39 at its feetThe Strictly Curse: a history of how one Saturday night TV show wreaked domestic havocSchools ordered to immediately remove bunsen burner gauze mats amid fears of exposure to asbestosWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/09/08/TELEMMGLPICT000171376993_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"london firm helped north korea evade un sanctions coal sales","story":"This file photo taken on November 21, 2017 shows a general view of North Korean coal piled up on a dockside at the port in RasonA London-based firm is being investigated by the British authorities on suspicion of indirectly aiding North Korea\u0027s nuclear weapons programme, after it allegedly evaded UN sanctions on the dictatorship, The  can reveal.Amet Ventures Ltd, which is registered at a St Paul’s address in central London, is suspected of helping to facilitate the sale of North Korean coal through Russian ports to beat UN sanctions.The case illustrates how Kim Jong-un\u0027s secretive regime is now suspected of using an increasingly complex network of falsified documents, foreign traders and ship-to-ship transfers to bypass tough UN economic sanctions, such as the ban on coal sales.“The UK is aware of the allegations...To continue reading this articleStart your free trial of PremiumAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekAccess one Premium article per weekRegister for freeAlready have an account?

Now a new book collects photography and stories from the communityClick to followThe IndependentThe community designed a flag, appointed ministers of state – including actor David Rappaport as foreign minister – made their own postage stamps and issued visas for visitorsThere was a lot of talk, in the wake of the Brexit referendum, suggesting that London should stage its own exit from the United Kingdom, declare independence, and ask to rejoin the EU as a nation state.Ignoring for now the fact that not everyone – though\u0026nbspit might seem that way to London – outside the capital voted to leave the EU, it seemed a satisfying, though jokey, postscript to the Brexit vote. Indeed, more than 180,000 Londoners signed an online petition calling for the mayor, Sadiq\u0026nbspKhan, to “declare London independent, and apply to join the EU –\u0026nbspincluding membership of the Schengen zone”.But what a lot of the signatories might not have realised was that there was indeed a precedent for London seceding from the UK. Or at least, one street of the capital.\u0026nbspWelcome to the Free Independent Republic of Frestonia. Or, what’s left of it, which these days amounts to the Frestonian Gallery, keeping the name and spirit alive of one of the most curious episodes in London’s history. It\u0026nbspbegan on Halloween\u0026nbsp1977, when the residents of Freston Road in Notting Dale, West London, which was largely comprised of squats and communes, declared independence.Threatened with eviction, the squatters said they were no longer part of the UK and appealed to the United Nations to send in peacekeeping forces to prevent Greater London Council turfing them out of the homes they had claimed. They designed a flag, appointed ministers of state, and even made their own postage stamps and issued visas for visitors.The short-lived story of the Free Independent Republic of Frestonia has now been documented in a new book of photographs by one of its residents, the photographer Tony Sleep, who was resident on Freston Road from 1974.\u0026nbspSleep describes the Frestonia experiment as “part publicity stunt, part theatrical protest”, and adds that while it wasn’t a serious attempt to break away from the UK, there was never any need to, because what became Frestonia “was already on a different planet”.He writes in the lavish book: “Frestonia was rooted in the counterculture of the time. The period is now dismissed as little more than daft clothes and hair, accompanied by a great soundtrack and the invention of sex and drugs.“It was, we are told, youthful self indulgence that ended badly because it was irresponsible and naive.”Frestonian Gallery)Frestonia was born out of problems that young people will recognise today: the lack of affordable accommodation. Sleep points out that the millennial generation might have a beef with the baby boomers who grew up in the 1960s and 1970s because they had it easy, and accommodation was cheap and plentiful. Not a bit of it, he says.“Rented flats were in very short supply, and mostly slum standard. You might achieve a rented bedsit as long as you weren’t black, Irish\u0026nbspor a dog. Then, as now, landlords wanted ‘professional’ people.“Council housing lists were only for families, and backlogged for decades. Despite what now seem like absurdly low prices, only the wealthy and secure could obtain mortgages at a time before easy mass debts. Less than half the population owned their own homes at the start of the 1970s.”Freston Road, where squatters and activists founded housing coop and community Frestonia\u0026nbsp(Getty)Many of the houses on Freston Road were empty, having been condemned as unfit for human habitation, and most of the residents had been relocated to the new highrise blocks of flats that began to go up in the 1960s and 1970s. There had been a move to demolish the vacant properties, but residents in neighbouring communities had complained that they would be looking out onto swathes of barren, rubble-strewn land that would encourage flytipping, so the authorities decided to take the cheaper option and just leave the buildings standing for a while.Freston Road might have been abandoned, but that didn’t mean it was unused. From 1974, squatters began to break into the empty houses and set up home there Tony Sleep, aged 24 at that time, was one of them.He recalls:\u0026nbsp“Squatting is distinctly equal opportunity. If you can gain possession, it’s yours. This led to an interesting mix of people who had little in common except needing somewhere to live and being poor for one reason or another. While some tried to make their new homes habitable, several houses were quickly wrecked.”Sleep remembers well his first sight of Freston Road. He’d been living in a “dismal rented basement” in west Kensington, but as he and his girlfriend parted company, he needed somewhere else to live, and heard about a street of empty houses. Some of his friends went to have a look and broke into two of the houses.“That night I paid them a visit,” writes Sleep. “Eight people, four guys, four girls, in one candlelit room, the only one that had windows. There was no toilet, no water, no electricity.”But his friends set to work installing plumbing and wiring as best they could, found an old toilet, rescued carpets and furniture from skips, and Sleep asked if he could move in with them.By 1977 Freston Road had settled into an unorthodox community, of sorts. But the attention of the GLC wandered back to these old, abandoned homes, and the squatters were told that they were to be evicted from these properties.The council offered to place the squatters in what were considered “hard to let” properties dotted around London, and some took the flats –\u0026nbspand, says Sleep, were promptly replaced in Freston Road by other people desperate for somewhere to live.\u0026nbspThe GLC announced its intention to bulldoze Freston Road after all, and a meeting was called, attended by 200 people. They decided – inspired by the Ealing comedy Passport to Pimlico – to go it alone. The Free Independent Republic of Frestonia was born. And the battle was on.The Frestonian National Anthem was written (“Long live Frestonia! Land of the free – not the GLC”) and a community newspaper, The Tribal Messenger, was distributed. Frestonia made the international press, and the Daily Mirror ran a piece declaring “All Hall, Frestonia”. The actor David Rappaport was made foreign minister, and playwright Heathcote Williams became ambassador to the United Kingdom.It was all a bit jolly and, of course, more than a pinch of Ealing comedy. But, Sleep points out, Frestonia was also an interesting way of putting British society under the\u0026nbspmicroscope.“Communities are defined, more or less, by what people have in common,” he writes. “That’s usually class, background or aspiration, sometimes race or religion. What people have in common helps them feel safe and valued. What is different can be threatening or isive.Frestonian Gallery)“Families, on the other hand, are a matter of being stuck with people you sometimes struggle to tolerate, let alone like. Frestonia was a bit of both.“Frestonians were, beneath the veneer of pragmatic anarchy, from different cultures. There were the hippies, idealists of a sort. There were the punks, nihilists of a sort. And there were the itinerant street people, whose lack of youth and lost changes gave them a thread of bitterness to chew on together.”Over the next couple of years, fighting the threat of the GLC bulldozers, the anarchic squat collective organised itself more seriously, forming the Bramley Housing Cooperative with an aim that was less about the fun of independence and more about securing the future of the Freston Road community.Eventually, the GLC won the war, and demolition of the squats began in 1983. But the Bramley Housing Cooperative, working with the Notting Hill Housing Trust, continued to fight for Freston Road as a residential area. And, ultimately, they won.Sleep says, “Frestonia didn’t cease when the squats were demolished. How could it? They were only useful ruins. Frestonia was about the people, its improbable family.“If you walk through Frestonia now, there’s little to suggest it is much different from anywhere else. You’ll find a street of small, but perhaps unusually pretty houses, built in the mid 1980s. They look carefully designed, a bit too inidual to be social housing. You may not notice the enclosed communal gardens, or the sheltered housing scheme that the coop insisted on, you won’t know the coop ensured housing for some of the more vulnerable Frestonians.”It might be that Frestonia would be forgotten all together, but for Tony Sleep’s photographic record of the people, events and houses on Freston Road in the late 1970s and early 1980s.‘Pop-up squat’: Activists occupy property to protest Housing BillNew photography exhibition shows the tough reality of squattingChallenging consumption and overwork in a Danish communityThe name does linger on in the form of the Frestonian Gallery, opened in 2017 by Matt Incledon and Rollo Campbell, who have published Tony Sleep’s photographs and recollections in Welcome To Frestonia. A pair of, in their own words, “itinerant art dealers”, they opened the gallery in The People’s Hall, a Victorian building that was once at the heart of Frestonia.\u0026nbspFrestonian Gallery opened in 2017 to remember a most curious episode in London’s history\u0026nbsp(Tony SleepFrestonian Gallery)Becoming appraised of the story of Frestonia, they were introduced to Tony Sleep, and arranged an exhibition of his photographs. They write in their foreword: “It was an exhibition unlike anything either of us had worked on previously. Each day at the gallery provided a steady stream of visitors keen to revisit and share their own personal memories of Frestonia. It would be a nice point at which to say ‘We then decided a book of Tony’s work needs to be published...’ but again, in truth, the decision had been made for us already by the sheer emotional response to this unique exhibition.”Was it all worth it for the Frestonians? Did it make a difference? Tony Sleep closes his remarkable document of this time by musing, “Forty years on, the UK seems to have travelled in a large circle and arrived little the wiser, but probably angrier, more cynical and more ided than ever.\u0026nbspWe are all Frestonians, on this small blue dot in the middle of nowhere.

One believes that the Labour leader’s radicalism in this area is a political weakness or a distraction that should be set aside to ensure focus on domestic policy, the party’s strength. The other side takes the view that not only are there important principles at stake, but that in fact Corbyn has some compelling iding lines to draw here with his opponents and predecessors.\u0026nbspSo long as Corbyn remains leader, it is the latter camp that is likely to win out. The prominence of foreign policy is simply an unavoidable fact of life for any British government or opposition, irrespective of any desire to focus on the domestic. The UK is a permanent member of the UN Security Council, a nuclear power, one of a tiny minority of states capable of projecting military power on an intercontinental basis, and one of the largest economies in the world.\u0026nbspCorbyn’s stances in this area will continue to be shaped by his longstanding worldview, and the fact that the recent furore over his participation in a Palestinian wreath laying ceremony in 2014 has had no discernible effect on Labour in the polls means that there is little incentive for him to change course.\u0026nbspIt may be, however, that the underlying premise of this disagreement at the top of the party is a faulty one. Because when we look seriously at the actual substance of Labour’s foreign policy, what we find is not particularly radical. Corbyn’s personal philosophy on international affairs may be sharply different from that of the political class, but the concrete set of policies Labour espouses under his leadership are (to make a strictly analytical rather than a value judgement), mildly reformist, not revolutionary.\u0026nbspLabour’s current policy position is set out in four key texts: Corbyn’s speech to the foreign policy think tank Chatham House in May 2017, his brief speech in response to the Manchester Arena bombing that same month, a speech to the United Nations in Geneva in December 2017, and the party’s 2017 election manifesto. The defining themes throughout are the importance of international law and the UN system, the value of multilateral and inclusive dialogue to avoid or de-escalate conflict, and the urgency of tackling global poverty and inequality. Scholars of international relations looking to categorise this overall stance are likely to find liberal multilateralism –\u0026nbspa conventional tradition in the academic literature –\u0026nbspto be the closest fit.\u0026nbspThis is not to imply any sense of business-as-usual. Corbyn’s strongly sceptical view of western military interventionism, together with his critique of corporate-friendly globalisation, situate his policy platform firmly on the left-hand edge of the liberal multilateralist paradigm, and at odds with a great many of its adherents. But these are hardly off-the-wall positions in the context of numerous western policy failures (from the Iraq war to the financial crisis) over the past two decades, and align to some degree with a growing disquiet in the centre left of established thinking.\u0026nbspOne of Corbyn’s most ostensibly challenging positions was the one articulated after the bombings in Manchester during last year’s general election campaign, when he argued that a connection exists between western military interventions in the context of the “war on terror”\u0026nbspand the persistence of the terrorist threat. Again, within the academic literature on non-state violence this is an entirely mainstream and unremarkable analysis\u0026nbspwhen taken with Corbyn’s acknowledgement of the importance of other factors, such as the ideological outlook of the terrorists and their socioeconomic backgrounds. It is also a common view amongst the general public, with 53 per cent of those subsequently polled agreeing with Corbyn’s analysis versus 24 per cent who disagreed, and with voters across all parties more likely to agree with him than not. What generates near hysteria from media pundits and political opponents elicits merely a shrug elsewhere.“Radicalism”\u0026nbspis a relative term. While the formal foreign policies of Corbyn’s Labour are hardly radical when set against the spectrums of expert or public opinion, the underlying view of the international scene that guides Corbyn personally on these matters is very much at odds with that of the political class, and this perhaps is the real source of tension.AFPGetty)Like many on the left of his generation, Corbyn is a product of the 1960s peace movement, opposition to the Vietnam war, and the global campaign against apartheid. His worldview is one that sees modern international relations – specifically the large imbalances in military power and economic autonomy – as the product of centuries of formal empire, out of which a more informal system of quasi-imperialism has evolved in recent decades.\u0026nbspThis sharply contradicts the conventional wisdom of the political establishment, articulated by former Labour foreign secretary David Miliband, that “if the world is increasingly ided between firefighters and arsonists then Britain has, for centuries, been a firefighter”. Many in the global south do not recognise this version of history, to put it mildly. For them, and for much of the grassroots left in Britain, global north states such as the UK are not inherently benign actors, and have in fact long presented a challenge, and even a danger to, the nations and peoples of the south. Evidently Corbyn shares this view – an authentically radical one in relative if not objective terms – and this rather than his formal policy programme seems to be the actual cause of the resentment from his opponents and detractors. There is a palpable sense that Corbyn is regarded by a significant number of them as not just mistaken but treacherous – his crime being a refusal to uphold the official faith in the inherent virtue of British power in the world.\u0026nbspUK news in picturesGreg Rutherford after his last ever long jump competition as a professional athlete during the Great City Games in Gateshead.

Corbyn’s vision of future UK relations with the global south were set out most clearly in his December 2017 Geneva speech to the UN, where he advocated for British participation in UN peacekeeping missions, a crackdown on tax havens to help protect the fiscal autonomy of developing states, a marked increase in support for refugees, and a stronger response to global warming. There is little reason to suspect that this is a mild veneer disguising a revolutionary reality. Those who knew Corbyn best during his days in the political wilderness affirm that he could never be heard expressing support for violent struggle, with the hard-left former MP George Galloway referring to him rather sniffily as a “woolly Californian”. So even in that area of foreign relations most closely associated with his radicalism – relations with the global south –there is little in his formal policy stances to seriously offend the average genuine liberal, whatever deeper philosophical differences they may have with him.This potential, practical common ground between Corbyn and more pragmatic elements of the centre left is reflected in the resemblance between his preference for dialogue over conflict and that of Barack Obama. In the American context, Obama was the reaction to George W Bush, just as Corbyn was a reaction in the British context to Bush’s valet, Tony Blair. Although each come from different political starting points, they share a scepticism that conflicts can be solved militarily, and a willingness to point to the experiences of the 2000s to underline the point.\u0026nbspObama’s presidency should not be sentimentalised in hindsight, given, to take one example, the active enabling role his administration took in Saudi Arabia’s devastating war on Yemen, and his culpability in the resulting humanitarian disaster. But on Iran at least, Obama took a view (under considerable fire from his opponents) which Corbyn would recognise, namely that diplomacy is most required precisely with people we dislike, and is almost always preferable to military conflict.\u0026nbspHere, Obama’s approach was a direct rebuke to that of his predecessor. When Iran offered a “grand bargain”\u0026nbspto the Bush administration in 2003, offering to withdraw support for Hamas and Hezbollah, sign up to the Arab peace initiative for a two-state settlement to the Israel-Palestine conflict, and submit to nuclear inspections in return for a normalisation of relations, the offer was summarily rejected by Washington on the grounds that “we don’t talk to evil”. It is likely that a lot of subsequent pain in the region could have been avoided had that door not been slammed shut, and Obama’s push for the nuclear deal during his presidency was part of an effort to revive these possibilities, reintegrate Iran into the international system and thus de-escalate wider conflicts and tensions. The other parties to the deal have worked hard to maintain it after President Trump walked away, demonstrating the fact that its strategic wisdom remains widely appreciated.Miliband (pictured with Hillary Clinton) said: ‘If the world is ided between firefighters and arsonists then Britain has\u0026nbspfor centuries\u0026nbspbeen a firefighter’ – a view sharply contradicted by the Labour leader\u0026nbsp(AFPGetty)Obama was notoriously careful about spending political capital, and his drive to secure the Iran deal resulted in weaker stances elsewhere, not least on Israel-Palestine where he showed a consistent unwillingness to apply the serious pressure on Israel that any fair resolution to the conflict will require. Israel-Palestine is the issue area where Corbyn is politically weakest due to Labour’s much discussed problems with anti-Semitism, but his policy stance itself is an entirely conventional one: support for a two-state settlement with “a secure Israel alongside a secure and viable state of Palestine”. Moreover, the wisdom of emphasising diplomacy over the “we don’t talk to evil” approach is clearly one that could be usefully applied to this case.When Hamas won the 2006 Palestinian elections, a hypothetical Prime Minister Corbyn at that time might have urged the west to take the approach it eventually took with Iran on the nuclear issue: one that says “we don’t like your ideology or your policies, but we recognise that it’s better to talk through our problems if possible”. Instead, the new government was cast beyond the pale and sanctioned, leading to a civil war between the key Palestinian parties, the isolation of Gaza, over a decade of immiserating siege, several rounds of devastating violence between Hamas and the Israeli military, and the total collapse of the peace process. The recent acceptance from Hamas of a two-state settlement (a position long in gestation within its leadership) hints at the possibilities of what might have transpired had the diplomatic approach been taken from the start. Again, a good deal of pain over the past decade might have been avoided.\u0026nbspOne of the reasons that Obama, a cautious moderate, arrived at a similar place to the more philosophically radical Corbyn in respect of the question of diplomacy over conflict is the experiences of the past decade and a half in Iraq and Afghanistan, and in Libya on his own watch. While Corbyn and Obama would disagree about whether these ventures were crimes or merely mistakes, the upshot places them in the same reality. The application of western military force is repeatedly showing itself in practice to be a futile and destructive endeavour, making the search for negotiated settlements, even in situations as unpromising as Syria, the more attractive or least unattractive proposition. Whether one likes it or not, the west is apparently unable to impose its will militarily on the global south as it once could, forcing a shift of emphasis to diplomacy irrespective of whether that is taken up with reluctance or enthusiasm.\u0026nbspJeremy Corbyn should back a Final Say on the referendumTrump and Obama’s foreign policies are unexpectedly similarThe deeper trends in international relations are also driving in this direction. The end of the Cold War may have given the west a deceptive notion of its own omnipotence, but the slow and steady return of global south powers such as China and India to the levels of international prestige they enjoyed before the ravages of European colonialism only serves to further underline the point that a reliance on mere strength – military, diplomatic or economic – will not serve the global north states well going forward.\u0026nbspAdjusting to these new realities is proving challenging for some in Washington and London. Senior Obama aide Ben Rhodes referred contemptuously to the US foreign policy establishment as “the Blob”, in his frustration with its resistance to his boss’s approach. Across the Atlantic, one senior British general went so far as to threaten a mutiny if Corbyn made any attempt to “emasculate and shrink” the armed forces. Quite the revealing turn of phrase. But the fact remains that the experience of the “war on terror”\u0026nbsphas been a political disaster for Anglo-American militarism, creating space for less chauvinistic figures –\u0026nbspfrom Obama to Ed Miliband to Corbyn – to emerge from various points on the liberal-to-left spectrum, and raising the prospect of some significant policy changes in the future.\u0026nbspNotwithstanding the current right-wing moment in both the UK and the US, the long-term demographic trends point to an inexorable shift in the political balance of power in favour of the Democratic and Labour parties, both of whom have been experiencing internal left-wing insurgencies to varying degrees. There is now a fair prospect of a future President Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren making some degree of common cause on the international stage with a future Prime Minister Corbyn. And while this would not herald a strictly revolutionary change in Anglo-American foreign relations, it would represent a very real and important departure from the days of Bush and Blair.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":null,"title":"subscribe to the daily edition our newspaper for your tablet","story":"For full functionality of this site it is necessary to enable JavaScript...Please follow the instructions in the link below.Please upgrade your browser to improve your experience."},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/03/29/10/istock-823319856.jpg","title":"northern rail south western rail strikes","story":"Created with Sketch.Click to followThe IndependentRail workers from Northern and South Western Rail are striking for 24 hours on Saturday as part of an ongoing struggle\u0026nbspbetween unions and rail companies over the role of guards on trains.\u0026nbspThe latest round of industrial action began on 25 August.\u0026nbspA Northern Rail spokesperson said that managers had been trained to step in for the absent conductors and that the\u0026nbspimpact of the weekend strikes was also more manageable for the company than weekday ones, which affect rush-hour trains.\u0026nbspThere are approximately three to five\u0026nbspof our drivers who historically refuse\u0026nbspto cross the picket line on strike days but we knew that in advance, so we could plan for that, the\u0026nbspspokesperson said.\u0026nbspThe biggest impact will be felt at the tail end of the day, for evening commuters.\u0026nbspFrustrated Northern Rail commuters tweeted about the difficulties of evening travel during the strikes.

The 2019 European elections will decide the future of the EU“Europe is at a turning point. The 2019 European elections will decide the future of the EU,” Mr Weber said in a statement on social media.“Today is about the self-assertion of Europe and the defence of our values, because we are being challenged from the outside and the inside. It’s about the survival of our European way of life.“We cannot go on as we are now in the EU. I will help bring Europe back to the people and re-establish the bond between citizens and the European Union. I want to kick start a new chapter in the EU.\u0026nbsp“I want to become the EPP\u0027s lead candidate for the 2019 European Elections and be the next President of the European Commission. Europe needs a new beginning and more democracy.”AFPGetty)In recent months Mr Weber has taken a tough rhetorical line on immigration and migration, in an apparent bid to position himself for the role. In January he was forced to apologise for a comment in which he called for a “final solution to the refugee question”. He later said he regretted the choice of words after it was pointed out that they resembled a Nazi slogan.The European Commission president is chosen through a convoluted process based on the most recent set up European Parliament election results.\u0026nbsp The European Council votes by weighted qualified majority for a candidate, taking into account the results of the elections.\u0026nbspEuropean commission member in charge of Brexit negotiations with Britain, French Michel Barnier listens at the President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker speaking at the European Parliament in StrasbourgFrank-Walter Steinmeier, President of the Federal Republic of Germany, delivers his speech at the European Parliament in StrasbourgEuropean Union\u0027s chief Brexit negotiator Guy Verhofstadt, President of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE), addresses the European Parliament during a debate on Brexit priorities and the upcomming talks on the UK\u0027s withdrawal from the EUMichel Barnier, European Chief Negotiator for Brexit reacts during a meeting at the European Parliament in StrasbourgMember of the European Parliament and former leader of the anti-EU UK Independence Party (UKIP) Nigel Farage wears socks with Union Jack flag at the European Parliament in StrasbourgNigel Farage, United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) member and MEP, addresses the European Parliament during a debate on Brexit priorities and the upcoming talks on the UK\u0027s withdrawal from the EUEuropean commission member in charge of Brexit negotiations with Britain, French Michel Barnier gestures  during speeches at the European Parliament in StrasbourgThe President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker (L) speaks with European commission member in charge of Brexit negotiations with Britain, French Michel Barnier at the European Parliament in StrasbourgEuropean Union\u0027s chief Brexit negotiator Guy Verhofstadt, President of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE), addresses the European Parliament during a debate on Brexit priorities and the upcomming talks on the UK\u0027s withdrawal from the EUGerman president Frank-Walter Steinmeier delivers a speech during a plenary session at the European Parliament in StrasbourgThe European Parliament in Strasbourg, eastern FranceEuropean commission member in charge of Brexit negotiations with Britain, French Michel Barnier listens at the President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker speaking at the European Parliament in StrasbourgFrank-Walter Steinmeier, President of the Federal Republic of Germany, delivers his speech at the European Parliament in StrasbourgEuropean Union\u0027s chief Brexit negotiator Guy Verhofstadt, President of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE), addresses the European Parliament during a debate on Brexit priorities and the upcomming talks on the UK\u0027s withdrawal from the EUMichel Barnier, European Chief Negotiator for Brexit reacts during a meeting at the European Parliament in StrasbourgMember of the European Parliament and former leader of the anti-EU UK Independence Party (UKIP) Nigel Farage wears socks with Union Jack flag at the European Parliament in StrasbourgNigel Farage, United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) member and MEP, addresses the European Parliament during a debate on Brexit priorities and the upcoming talks on the UK\u0027s withdrawal from the EUEuropean commission member in charge of Brexit negotiations with Britain, French Michel Barnier gestures  during speeches at the European Parliament in StrasbourgThe President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker (L) speaks with European commission member in charge of Brexit negotiations with Britain, French Michel Barnier at the European Parliament in StrasbourgEuropean Union\u0027s chief Brexit negotiator Guy Verhofstadt, President of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE), addresses the European Parliament during a debate on Brexit priorities and the upcomming talks on the UK\u0027s withdrawal from the EUGerman president Frank-Walter Steinmeier delivers a speech during a plenary session at the European Parliament in StrasbourgThe European Parliament in Strasbourg, eastern FranceIn 2014 this meant picking the “lead candidate” from the group which won the biggest candidate at the elections – in that case the EPP.

This is a fight for the soul of our party and the future of our democracy, Ms Pressley said. That movement is reshaping a Democratic Party still searching for leaders and identity in the era of Donald Trump.\u0026nbspGrassroots activists on the left have a mixed record in Democratic primaries this election year, but the self-described progressive movement has scored enough victories to suggest its popularity is based on more than just protesting the Trump White House. The movement is also remoulding the Democratic Party into a younger, more erse and decidedly liberal party.\u0026nbspAyanna Pressley and New York\u0027s Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, two women of colour, both defeated Democratic incumbent congressmen in their primaries. The progressive movement has helped nominate three black Democrats for governor\u0027s seats, including a clear upset in Florida, where Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum knocked off establishment favourite Gwen Graham. Mr Graham\u0027s establishment credentials could not have been stronger. Her father, Bob, is a Florida icon who served as governor and US senator.\u0026nbspGeorgia\u0027s Stacey Abrams, meanwhile, trounced a primary opponent recruited and backed by much of her state\u0027s Democratic old guard. Ms Abrams would become the first black woman elected governor in any US state.\u0026nbspScores of other down-ballot candidates are running for local, state and federal offices with backing from grassroots groups like Inisible, MoveOn.org, the Working Families Party and the offshoot of Bernie Sanders\u0027 2016 presidential campaign, Our Revolution.\u0026nbspWhy it mattersThe ersifying, more liberal slate will be measured by the outcome in the November vote.\u0026nbspRepublicans — and some Democrats — argue that the party is going too far to the left for American voters, particularly outside of the cities and close-in suburbs where Democrats\u0027 base of white liberals and non-white voters is concentrated.\u0026nbspProgressive nominees like Ms Pressley and Ms Ocasio-Cortez are running in Democratic strongholds, so their wins in November are all but guaranteed. But Republicans will use the rise of the left — and its support for policies like single-payer health care and scrapping US Immigration and Customs Enforcement — to tar all Democratic candidates.\u0026nbspThe counter argument from Democrats and activists on the left is two-fold: 1) Many issues that more liberal candidates support — some gun regulation, expanding Medicaid, raising the minimum wage — actually have widespread public support, even among independents and some Republicans and 2) the more openly liberal candidates from outside the old-guard establishment can bring in new voters who do not regularly cast midterm ballots.\u0026nbspBeyond November, the new generation of Democrats will have a say in how the party governs. Ms Pressley and Ms Ocasio-Cortez will not determine whether Democrats pick up the 23 new House seats they need for a majority, but they will help shape the arguments within the Democratic caucus.\u0026nbspThey and their fellow freshmen will have a say in whether a new Democratic majority returns Nancy Pelosi to the speaker\u0027s chair. They will have leverage — much like the arch-conservative Freedom Caucus does with the House GOP leadership — over every debate, from health care to the potential impeachment of Mr Trump.\u0026nbspSo, for example, while there might not be enough support for a real push toward single-payer health care, the movement could draw the party toward supporting a public health insurance option to compete alongside for-profit companies selling policies in Affordable Care Act exchanges. And, even if an immediate $15 minimum wage is too heavy a lift, perhaps the left-flank forces a compromise of graduated raises over time.\u0026nbspWhat to watch out for\u0026nbspDelaware Democrat challenges incumbent as part of \u0027blue tsunami\u0027Democrats take double-digit lead over Republicans ahead of midtermsDemocrats need to focus on young people in the 2018 midterm elections Trump unprepared for impeachment and Democratic takeover: reportSanders-backed progressive could become Florida\u0027s first black governorBefore primary season concludes, there are a few more key match-ups to measure the left\u0027s influence. In Delaware, military veteran and activist Kerri Evelyn Harris is aiming on Thursday to knock off moderate Democratic Senator Tom Carper. She is a big underdog, but even a competitive finish will serve notice anew that incumbents must at least contend with the left base. Similar dynamics exist in New York, where actress Cynthia Nixon is trying to topple Governor Andrew Cuomo in a 13 September primary.\u0026nbspSome of the most intent observers of the party\u0027s evolution are the gaggle of aspiring presidential candidates. Certainly, some of those figures have helped drive the shift — Mr Sanders and his 2016 campaign, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren and her outspoken economic populism.\u0026nbspBut Mr Sanders, Ms Warren and the rest are also careful to watch the base and not get caught flat-footed as it evolves. That is one reason potential candidates like Senators Cory Booker and Kamala Harris and former Vice President Joe Biden have made sure that their endorsement and campaign finance activity this midterm cycle has ned the spectrum of the party\u0027s down-ballot candidates: If the so-called progressive movement becomes the centre of the party, no one who wants to be the Democratic presidential nominee boxed out.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/04/14/xi-jinping-china-africa.jpg","title":"china africa bejing forum investment interest free loans","story":"Created with Sketch.China\u0027s Xi Jinping\u0026nbspsays\u0026nbspinvestment comes with \u0027no political strings attached\u0027Click to followThe IndependentChinese President Xi Jinping, centre, with South Africa\u0027s Cyril Ramaphosa, centre left, and other leaders behind, attend the 2018 Beijing FOCAC summitRepresentatives from\u0026nbspalmost every country in Africa dined with Xi Jinping on Monday night as they attended what is believed to be the largest gathering of African heads of state ever staged\u0026nbspoutside the continent.They had plenty to toast, after China’s President Xi pledged new infrastructure investments in their countries of $60bn\u0026nbsp(£46bn) ning the next three years.The latest investment\u0026nbspis in addition to the $60bn\u0026nbsppledged back in\u0026nbsp2015, and promises to continue the remarkable growth of China-backed building projects across the African segment, known as the Belt and Road Initiative.China now far outstrips the economic clout and engagement in Africa of either the US or Europe, and its involvement has inevitably sparked criticism.Malaysia’s prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, warned against what he called a “new version of colonialism” last month when he cancelled a $20bn Chinese-backed rail project.And in his speech addressing leaders at Beijing’s Great Hall of the People, Mr Xi appeared to acknowledge these concerns, saying Chinese investment came with “no political strings attached”.“China does not interfere in Africa’s internal affairs and does not impose its own will on Africa,” he said. “More than 1.3 billion Chinese people and more than 1.2 million African people have always pursued a shared future.“We respect Africa, love Africa and support Africa.”Since Mr Xi’s announcement, African heads of state have similarly sought to play down any suggestion that China’s interests are in anything other than mutual economic growth.Zimbabwe’s newly elected president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, hit out at critics of China in an interview on state TV.“There is now a transition to a new world order and those who don’t see it are blind,” he said.Cyril Ramaphosa, South Africa’s president, said the Forum on China–Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) in Beijing was working towards “a vision that has been crafted in Africa, by Africans… of an integrated, prosperous and peaceful Africa”.May overlooked a vast humanitarian crisis on her Africa tourNever mind Brexit, the South Africans will love us after May’s dancingTheresa May’s visit to Robben Island is insultingThe UK securing trade deals in Africa doesn’t make much senseMay makes ‘unashamed’ vow to use aid to boost UK firms in Africa“FOCAC refutes the view that a new colonialism is taking hold in Africa, as our detractors would have us believe,” he added.Rwanda’s Paul Kagame, the current African Union chairman and a fierce critic in the past of foreign aid, said he considered China to be a “more respectful partner” than either Europe or America.“The relationship between Africa and China is based on equality, mutual respect and a commitment to a shared well-being,” he said. “Our growing ties with China do not come at anyone’s expense.”Some experts are not so sure. The International Monetary Fund warned in April that at least 40 per cent of low-income countries in Africa are either in debt distress or at high risk. Since the last FOCAC forum in South Africa in 2015, a number of countries have attempted to restructure their debt.But Chinese officials have previously denied taking part in so-called “debt trap” diplomacy, and on Monday Mr Xi said government debt from China’s interest free loans due by the end of 2018 will be written off for indebted poor African countries.“Unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise,” Mr Xi warned, an apparent reference to an ongoing trade war between his country and Donald Trump’s America.“China-Africa cooperation under the BRI (Belt and Road Initiative) is a way to common prosperity that brings benefits to both our peoples.”The only African country not represented in Beijing at the summit, which continued on Tuesday with meetings between business leaders and entrepreneurs, was newly-renamed eSwatini, formerly Swaziland.That’s because it is now the only nation left in Africa still conducting diplomatic relations with Taiwan, the self-ruled territory claimed by China. Beijing refuses to do business with any country that maintains ties to Taipei – business which the rest of the African continent has decided it cannot afford to lose.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/08/15/irish-presidential-election-candidates.jpg","title":"irish presidential election candidates higgins sinn fein freeman gallagher","story":"Created with Sketch.The incumbent President Higgins is hugely popular, but there is no shortage of candidates lining up to try their chances against him on 26 OctoberClick to followThe IndependentKevin Sharkey, Sarah Louise Mulligan and Sean Gallagher are among the names putting forward their vision for IrelandIf you’re accused of having ‘notions’ in Ireland, it means you’re getting a bit above your station - having delusions of grandeur.\u0026nbspIt’s an affliction which has infected the political landscape over this silly season, with a plethora of people coming forward to suggest that they should be elected president on 26 October. Follow the news from abroad and you’d think pretty much anyone can have a pop.Irish presidential elections weren’t always like this. In the past, there have been few entrants for a largely ceremonial job seen as a retirement present for elder statesmen. Only recently, through the tenure of Mary Robinson and Mary McAleese, has this been reimagined.Then the first truly modern contest came in 2011, in which a record seven contestants piled on, only to be subjected, one by one, to brutal character assassinations - as if the whole thing was being scripted by Agatha Christie.\u0026nbspBy the end, all that remained was the elfin Michael D Higgins, who was duly elected, quickly became beloved by the nation, and is now seeking a second term.Because of this particularly nasty episode in our political history, many in Ireland think you’d have to be mad to run for president - and there’s no shortage of people showing that they’ve got what it takes.With all the main parties supporting Higgins (bar Sinn Féin, who will run their own candidate), independents must seek the support of 20 members of the Irish parliament, or four county councils to get on the ballot.This has led to a motley crew of iniduals showing up at various council meetings around the country to give presentations which have been anything but dull.Donegal-born artist Kevin Sharkey wants to be the country’s first black president, but his ‘Ireland First’ platform is not proving popular. He is calling for stricter immigration, and even bringing back the death penalty for crimes against the elderly.Investigative journalist Gemma O’Doherty wants to use the platform to tackle corruption, although she is routinely accused on social media of being a glorified conspiracy theorist. In a recent tweet, she said her presidency would honour Madeleine McCann, saying “those who conceal the truth about what happened to her must be held to account.”\u0026nbspPope Francis visits Ireland – in picturesPope Francis celebrates the Holy Mass at the Phoenix Park, in Dublin Pope Francis arrives at Phoenix Park for a Papal Mass of the World Meeting of Families in DublinA vigil takes place at the site of the mass grave which contained the remains of 796 named babies from the Bon Secours Mother and Baby home in Tuam.

Businessman and Dragon’s Den star Gavin Duffy was a surprise entry, who already has one council nomination under his belt, as has psychologist and mental health advocate Joan Freeman - even though he has no political experience, and she has only been a senator for two years.The real ner in the works came last week when another Dragon’s Den tycoon entered the ring - Sean Gallagher, who ran in 2011 and came second.\u0026nbspHe had been the favourite to win until the final TV debate just days before the election, when an embarrassing anecdote about a signed photo, a rogue tweet, and his incensed reaction brought the whole thing crashing down around him. ‘Notions’ were quickly quashed.The entry of a third Dragon - US-based Peter Casey - was baffling even to the other two, and has made for a curious dynamic to proceedings.

The independents have until 26 September to try and get the required backing.At this point, a betting man might put money on Joan Freeman and Sean Gallagher making the cut, with the latter being the strongest challenger to Higgins out of the group.\u0026nbspBut, considering his very high approval ratings - and the dubious calibre of the people who have presented themselves as alternatives - it’s looking like our incumbent will be easily re-elected.

John McDonnell laughs at Chuka Umunna\u0027s \u0027call off the dogs\u0027 comment                Swedish politician says Brexit deadlock makes SWEXIT more likelyA planned speech by Boris Johnson on the fringe of the Conservative conference in Birmingham could act as a lightning rod for disaffected hard Brexiteers.With the former foreign secretary becoming increasingly vocal in his disapproval of the PM\u0027s handling of Brexit, some see it as a possible launchpad for a concerted effort to remove Mrs May as leader.Mr Johnson has denounced the Chequers plan as a disaster and has the backing of a large swathe of Tory MPs who prefer a Canadian-style free trade agreement with the EU.But while hard Brexiteers may be able to muster the 48 letters needed to force a vote of confidence in Mrs May, it is far from certain that her critics can amass the 158 MPs\u0027 votes needed to oust her. Leading Brexit-backers including David Davis and Jacob Rees-Mogg have said she should stay.Instead, the 60-odd MPs in the Eurosceptic European Research Group are expected to seek to quash Chequers by launching their own plans for a global Britain alternative.The political parties are also fraught with tension (Image: )Hardline backbenchers who have described her breakthrough Chequers plan as a \u0026ldquobetrayal (Image: )                Economist reveals HOW the UK can beat Brussels                \u0027Spanner in the works\u0027 Royal Navy SCUPPERS post-Brexit deal with ChinaMeanwhile, Remainer Tory MPs are growing increasingly restive as the prospect of a no-deal Brexit looms larger, with Dominic Grieve, Anna Soubry and Heidi Allen all suggesting they would quit the party if Mr Johnson became leader.Equally, Jeremy Corbyn\u0026rsquos party is tearing itself apart as many MPs are putting pressure on the leftwinger \u0026ndash and veteran eurosceptic \u0026ndash to call for a second referendum.Labour has never taken the option of a People\u0027s Vote on the final Brexit deal off the table, and many constituency parties are understood to be ready to back a motion at conference committing the party to a fresh poll.But the prospect of a full-scale Brexit bust-up at conference appears to be receding, after the Corbynite Momentum group decided to consult members on the issue later in the year rather than take a position in Liverpool.Polling consistently suggesting that voters think Britain took the wrong decision in 2016 (Image: )People\u0027s Vote campaigners are focusing a good deal of effort on winning Mr Corbyn over to their cause, releasing research suggesting a significant shift away from Brexit among Labour supporters.Although a majority of constituencies held by Labour MPs voted Leave in the referendum, support for Brexit among the party\u0027s voters was far lower, with around 65 percent backing Remain. Analysis by the Best for Britain campaign suggests that just 71percent of those who backed Leave in 2016 would do so now.Mr Corbyn supported Remain in the referendum but has since been accused by critics of failing to engage with Brexit. His stance of constructive ambiguity may now be reaching the limits of its usefulness.Labour advocates a significantly closer post-Brexit relationship with the EU than the Government, with a new customs union and an internal market arrangement on trade.But a significant bloc of MPs want Mr Corbyn to go further and fight for EEA membership or a second vote. Unhappiness with his position has been a key element in speculation about possible splits and breakaway parties.Meanwhile, the handful of staunch Leavers in Labour\u0027s parliamentary ranks have faced threats of deselection over their decision to vote with Tories on Brexit, with Frank Field complaining of bullying as he quit the party whip.Liberal Democrats, who kick off the conference season in Brighton this week, have the advantage of being the one major UK-wide party which is not split over the EU.But their call for an Exit from Brexit does not seem to have done them any favours among the electorate, despite polling consistently suggesting that voters think Britain took the wrong decision in 2016.

This is through early next week when it forecasts to re-intensify back to category three.\u0026ldquoThe hurricane scone only goes out five days but if we extended the models out to seven days some models show it could go as far south as South Carolina.Hurricane Florence: Tropical storm could come \u0027uncomfortably close\u0027 to US east coast (Image: WSVN\u0026bullNOAA)\u0026ldquoOther models through the mid-Atlantic, some into the northeast and some models recurve the storm out into the open Atlantic.He added: \u0026ldquoThis time of the year is always a good idea, especially if you live\u0026nbspon\u0026nbspa coastal location, to have a hurricane kit and a hurricane plan in place.At least 67 named storms have passed within 200 nautical miles of where Florence is currently located since 1851. None of these storms have ever hit the US.The latest NOAA statement reads: \u0026ldquoLittle change in intensity is expected during the next day or so, but restrengthening is forecast over the weekend.

But one of ­Parliament’s biggest secrets is that most of the men and women in it are actually pretty decent.What rightly makes voters angry with Parliament is that it doesn’t look like the country it represents, and approves policies that often make the world a worse place. In the current Parliament, 29 per cent of UK-educated MPs went to private schools.This is a record low, but it is out of step with the public, which is around seven per cent privately educated. Only 32 per cent of MPs are women, and 7.8 per cent are from ethnic minorities, while roughly 14 per cent of the general population is black or minority ethnic.The majority of MPs were already working in politics before being elected or held well-paid jobs as lawyers.In my new book, Why We Get The Wrong Politicians, I’ve discovered one of the main reasons why only well-off people become MPs. It’s because they have to spend tens of thousands of pounds of their own money on standing for Parliament.I asked 532 candidates who stood in the 2015 election how much it had cost them, and was shocked by the answers. The average cost for all candidates, whether they were standing in a seat that they’d certainly win, one where they might win or a no-hope constituency, was £11,118.For those who had to fight in marginal seats, the costs were even higher. Conservatives who won their seats spent £121,467. Their colleagues who failed to win still lost an average of £18,701.Labour was no better. If you won your seat, you lost around £19,022, but those who failed to get elected spent even more — £35,843.Some spent money they had saved to buy a home. Others maxed out their credit cards and are still paying off the debts today. This money didn’t go on leaflets or any of the other official campaign spending that is tightly regulated.Instead, it was working for free for up to two years, travelling around and sometimes even moving to the constituency, and attending local events. One broke candidate needed help from members of her party to pay her mortgage. She didn’t even win her seat.Another ex-candidate was delighted when he landed a new job and could afford to buy a house — before he realised he’d spent the deposit on campaigning, ironically for the “party of home ownership”.This ludicrous cost excludes so many people who would make much better MPs than the ones we currently have. MPs do not really do the job they’ve been elected to perform, anyway.The pressure is for them to do as their whips tell them, rather than to look at the legislation going through the House of Commons. Most vote on bills without realising what they might entail.Even when they are appointed to the bill committees scrutinising every line of a law, MPs in the governing party are told to sit quiet and vote with the Government every time. Many write their Christmas cards in these committees.From the “bedroom tax” to interventions in Iraq and Libya, MPs have failed to notice problems before they turn into real crises.It doesn’t have to be like this. The parties could pay their candidates to stand. The Conservatives have already announced a modest bursary fund, and Labour has toyed with the idea too. Other groups should stump up some funding as well.The Women’s Equality Party, for instance, is stunningly well-funded but has little chance of getting an MP elected. It would be much better to use that money to get more women MPs in all the political parties. Currently MPs don’t have to take any responsibility for approving dud policies.My book suggests a new stage for legislation, called “Public Payback Panels” where people directly affected by a government policy could ask the minister and members of the bill committee who approved it to explain why they voted the way they did.This would encourage politicians to take their job seriously and really look at the laws they were approving.If this doesn’t change, MPs will still have the most expensive job interview on Earth — and will then be told when they arrive in Parliament not to do their job.

I felt like I was in hell.“And just now the feeling of what its like to come out of hell and feeling the relief of that burden.People said I seemed like I was wearing this cloak of darkness. And I was - I never in my life felt so incredibly burdened and grief stricken.”Catherine and India first attended a NXIVM seminar in 2011 in Venice, California, believing it to be a business skills course.It wasn’t long before Catherine realized the truth - but by then India was already being brainwashed and sucked deeper into the group.India, only 20 at the time, spent thousands on more NXIVM course and eventually left her home in Malibu and moved to Albany, New York, to be nearer the NXIVM’s headquarters.It was here she fell under leader Raniere’s spell, and joined a secretive and disturbing sect at the core of NXIVM, a master-slave cult which branded, beat and starved women called DOS.DOS - which claimed to be a “badass” female empowerment group forced each member to hand over damaging collateral each month - including naked pictures, vows of obedience and taped confessions about their family members, which they threatened to release should they ever leave.Many of the DOS women were told to have sex with leader Raniere as a way of achieving “enlightenment” as well as being branded on her pubic area with he initials of Raniere and Mack.When Catherine discovered what was happening she “lost her mind”.“I wasnt happy with Indias involvement in NXIVM, but I had no idea what was really going on beneath the surface until a young woman, a defector, who reached out to me and said ‘You have to save her’,” she said.“She started to explain the dynamics of what was going on, that there was this slave-master hierarchy that these women were being recruited, under the pretext of being involved with the female empowerment group and that actually Keith Raneire was orchestrating the whole thing as their ultimate master. None of them knew this.“So all of the practices of this group were based on deception, coercion and manipulation.In order to gain admission, they had to give damaging collateral that would be ruinous if it was ever revealed.“If Keith wanted them for himself - for his own sexual gratification - they were put on these very strict diets, between 500 and 800 calories a day, which is starvation.“Then I found out about the branding and I think at that point I lost my mind. If it wasnt bad enough already - with the recruiting for sex and the slaves having to recruit more young women aggressively. It was growing like an evil vine. “Each ‘slave’ was pressured to recruit between five to six slaves of her own so it had the potential to spread dangerously - Keith’s own lawyer admitted 150 women had been recruited into DOS.“From what I understood, the women had to be held down by the other women in their slave cell.“They would hold down their legs and their arms because they would be struggling to get free, its just excruciating and it took them 30-40 minutes for the entire procedure.“Im just imagining that my daughter had been subjected to this. How is that even possible?“So I knew that my mission was to rescue her from an environment that was encouraging this level of abuse against women and cruelty and making sure that nobody else was subjected to this type of torture.”Catherine teamed up with Frank Parlato, NXIVMs former publicist who had turned against the group and first exposed them as a cult.Together the pair risked their lives, receiving numerous death threats, as they tried to expose the NXIVM, help women leave the group and collect evidence that would ultimately lead to the arrests and indictment.Catherine added: “I heard through the grapevine that they were planning on suing me and that I was going to be put in jail.“I was warned not to go to Mexico because I would get killed. I received threat letters from Mexican attorneys and a Mexican state attorney general that were issued by Emiliano Salinas who runs NXIVM, Mexico. And a lawsuit accusing me of fraud and extortion.Frank added: “One of my sources told me they’d hired two people to assassinate us and they even described how they were going to find us and how they were going to do it.“I would receive death threats over the phone, emails - and for a long time we were out on our own against this group. It was a lonely four months just me and Catherine up against all these forces.“It was definitely a risk, there were threatening letters from Mexico where lawlessness is commonplace. We knew if either one of us went to Mexico we’d never come back.“We were Raniere’s public enemies number one and two.“It was terrifying but that was dwarfed by the joy we got from all these women who were escaping the cult and coming to us one after the other and saying thank you.“We stopped many women from even being branded - once we started exposing it they started cancelling the branding.Throughout it all Catherine’s biggest fear was that she’d lose her beloved daughter - either through a suicide pact or worse.“There was a moment when I was convinced that they were all involved in some suicide pact,” she said.“I felt that perhaps Keith needed some sort of distraction to take the attention away from what he was doing and maybe get some poor young woman to do that and I thought, what if its India because it would be a perfect way to punish her mum for causing the demise of his group.”Catherine and Frank compiled files of evidence to law enforcement and eventually in March this year Raniere was arrested, quickly followed by Allison Mack and other high profile members.As the cult collapsed around her, India found work at a vegan restaurant in New York before finding love and finally returning home to Malibu where she is now trying to put her life back together.“India is in a really good place,” Catherine said. “Shes moving forward with her life and of course I want to share everything about the time that we spend together, which Im treasuring after a long period of estrangement, but Im as protective of privacy as I have been for her safety.“I have watched other young women come out of NXIVM and this transition period is a very fragile moment in these womens lives where everything that they believed has imploded and most of them have asked the question ‘was everything I believed in a lie?’ and its a very frightening moment. I would liken it to an identity crisis.“I want to make very clear to people is that this was no 50 Shades of Grey. This was not consenting adults.“This was a coercive, exploitive, dangerous group that was abusing women and it needed to be stopped.”Catherines book Captive is out now."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000431318129.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=577\" height=\"960","title":"mick hume facebook lucy mchugh","story":"Coming from the privacy- flogging, free speech-trampling bosses at Facebook, this “principled” stand over a child murder looks like a shameless display of hypocritical grandstanding. The company should be renamed Two-Facedbook.Lucy McHugh’s body was found in Hampshire woodland six weeks ago. She had been stabbed to death.Police arrested Stephen Nicholson, 24, a care worker who had been living with Lucy’s family, on suspicion of murder and sexual activity with a child.Nicholson admits being in contact with Lucy via Facebook on the evening before her disappearance and on the morning of the tragic day. But he refused to give police his Facebook password so they could check what was said.Nicholson was prosecuted for refusing to cooperate with the investigation. His lawyer said his client was afraid cops would find evidence of his involvement with cannabis.The judge dismissed this excuse as “wholly inadequate”, surely putting it mildly.Last week Nicholson was jailed for 14 months for preventing police from checking his messages. In the UK, failing to cooperate with police is an offence under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act. He got a much longer term than he would ever get for smoking dope.Meanwhile Facebook — a US company not bound by our laws — refused a police request to divulge Nicholson’s password.Detectives had to apply to the US authorities for an order giving access to Nicholson’s account. That process could take many months.Facebook insists it cannot give police quick access, because of its commitment to privacy and freedom of expression. That excuse sounds even more pathetic than Nicholson’s dopey cannabis story.Yes, privacy and free speech are crucial principles to defend, including online.But in practice, Facebook has as much regard for those freedoms as a police-state apparatchik.Its bosses’ one serious commitment is to their freedom to rake in cash. They monitor our private lives and make money off our likes and desires.Facebook and other tech giants use our online activity to target advertising and allow companies access to our data. As for free speech, Facebook has been busy closing right-wing pages that do not suit its leftie Silicon Valley tastes.It says it will not tolerate “hate speech and harassment”. When it comes to child murder suspects, it apparently takes a more liberal attitude.Facebook has bizarrely chosen the case of Stephen Nicholson to strike a phoney pose as a stalwart defender of privacy and freedom.Double standards don’t come much lower. This looks like a grossly misjudged attempt at moral grandstanding designed to repair Facebook’s right-on reputation.It appears more likely to have the opposite effect, lowering its standing still further.We should never take the issue of privacy and state intervention lightly. In a free society, the police should not be given licence to pry and poke into our affairs and online activities as they see fit.We must be on our guard against the creeping advance of state snooping.But the demand for privacy can also be used to the detriment of a free and civilised society. After Sir Cliff Richard won his privacy case against the BBC over the reporting of a police raid on his home, many have demanded “Cliff’s law” be enforced to prevent the media naming those suspected of serious crimes.In a terrible case such as the murder of Lucy McHugh, it surely ought to be possible to work out a fast way to access the chief suspect’s Facebook account — he having chatted with the victim shortly before she disappeared — without declaring open season for police snoopers.The law must be changed to help police get data in cases like this — so long as that law is tightly framed and properly scrutinised.Facebook can posture and hide behind the US courts but our media is subject to a full book of laws that have empowered police and state agencies to demand news- papers hand over sensitive information and name their confidential sources. No passwords required.

They do not like Jews.The evidence for that is so categorical and so widespread across the left of the party that nobody can doubt it now.Certainly I don’t. Nor does our Jewish community, which is genuinely worried by the ­hideous Corbyn.If you’ve got your doubts then I just don’t know what WOULD convince you.Maybe CCTV of Corbyn torching a synagogue and screaming “Intifada!” Would that do it? Or would you respond by saying, ah, he was actually worried that the people inside the synagogue might be a bit cold. That’s why he threw the firebomb in.Or maybe the excuse Corbyn himself comes up with, every time. It wasn’t me! I wasn’t there!Then, when it’s proved that he was: “Oh, um, yes. But I didn’t really know what I was doing.”As I’ve said before, Corbyn’s defence is always to portray himself as a complete moron who doesn’t know where he is or what he’s doing. It doesn’t wash. He’s an anti-Semite.But there’s another group of people who know this only too well. And they’re doing very little about it.That’s the Labour MPs. The ones who cannot abide Corbyn and Momentum and want him gone. The Old Labour Party, the one we used to have before the lefty infants took over.But they do nothing. Not a thing, apart from moan quietly in the background.If ever there was a time for a split, for a new party to be formed which might capture the attention of the voters, this is it.But they don’t have the balls. Or they are scared to lose their safe seats and their nice incomes. That’s probably a false hope too, mind. Corbyn isn’t going anyplace anytime soon.And if he did another lunatic would take over who might conceivably be worse. And Momentum now control the entire party. So, one after another, the moderate Labour MPs will be deselected and lose their seats anyway.The ones who think Israel has a right to exist.The ones who don’t think Cuba and Venezuela have particularly brilliant governments.The ones who don’t want to police newspapers which don’t agree with them.The MPs whose first consideration is poverty and inequality, not identity politics and fatuous agitprop grandstanding.So far only one of these has made a stand — the excellent Frank Field. He has resigned the Labour whip, disgusted at ­Corbyn’s anti-Semitism.All it would take is three or four more and suddenly we would have a new political party.So, what about it, Kate Hoey? And the former Blairite, Caroline Flint? And Ben Bradshaw? And John Mann?Are you telling me you’re happy where you are, in today’s Labour Party? Or are you just waiting for someone to come and rescue you?You’ve got a long wait. You have to do it yourselves.I WAS feeling a bit sorry for Roxanne Pallett.She made a mistake, only a kid really – and now she’s lost everything.And then I saw an interview with her.Dense as a slab of tungsten – although I suppose that’s not her fault.I mean, if you were born with only a five-watt bulb flickering away inside your skull it’s not something that can be changed very easily, is it?But more than that, it was her absolute self-absorption.Everything was about me, me, me.Not the hurt she had caused to others, but the misery she’d inflicted on HERSELF.It’s a common condition these days, I suppose.But Pallett is a pretty extreme example.SEEN what’s been happening in Germany?Huge demonstrations against immigration in Chemnitz, formerly Karl-Marx Stadt.The BBC and others say it’s all the “far right”. Neo Nazis. People with posters of Hitler in their bedrooms.I daresay there are a few nasty types on those marches who wish there was still a Gestapo. But I think the vast majority of those demonstrating are ordinary German citizens, sick of what has happened to their country.And the same thing has been happening across Europe.It’s not the far right at all, no matter how often the liberals tell you it is.GREAT call from the President of the Philippines, a bloke called Rodrigo Duterte.According to him, if women want to avoid being raped they should not be so beautiful.Maybe they should have all their teeth removed? Men won’t want to give one to someone who is totally toothless. It’ll put them off completely.The women could also slice their noses off.Or have facial surgery to make them resemble an anteater or a pipistrelle bat.The world has its fair share of dimbo leaders. But Rodrigo is right there near the top.SO the latest plan is to put road markings on the pavement.It’s so zombies attached to their iPhones, staring at the ground, don’t walk into the middle of a road or off the edge of a cliff.There has been a rise in accidents involving pedestrians who are locked tightly into their own little world.I have been nearly flattened by joggers immersed in some crap pounding through their thick skulls. And nobody talks to anybody any more. We discuss banning the burka from public spaces.But is there anything more antisocial than someone with their head down, oblivious to the world around them?ANNOYED that her partner had allegedly cheated on her, Serena Reynoldson filmed herself pouring bleach into his tropical fish tank while cackling, “Die, die, die!” Which is what they did, of course.I think her ex, Jon Fitzpatrick, is well out of it, frankly.It all seems a bit hard on the poor fish. So far as we know, they hadn’t cheated on Ms Reynoldson. Mr Fitzpatrick also had a snake, which was lucky to get out of the place alive.I think the moral is if you’re going to upset your missus, make sure you have pets that can look after themselves. A Tasmanian devil, say, or a king cobra.WHY has Jose Mourinho not been sacked by Manchester United?I don’t mean because his team are not terribly good. Or about as pleasing to watch as John Prescott eating a curry.But he’s just been handed a one-year suspended prison sentence and hit with whopping fines – for tax evasion running into the millions of pounds.Does Manchester United not have any principles?I’LL be glued to the box watching The Mighty Redcar on BBC2 tonight. Seeing that the town is only a stone’s throw from my gaff in Saltburn.I was worried at first that it was just another poverty-porn film.You know, when the BBC turns up somewhere north of Watford so everyone can have a good old snigger at the people who live there.But having spoken to some of the people who took part, it isn’t like that at all.Redcar’s had it rough and wages are low. Both Labour and the Tories have let down the steelworkers, who are no more.But there are plenty of new businesses thriving, beyond the BBC’s cameras.Redcar will be just fine in the end, just as it was when I lived there in the Seventies.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The richest one per cent pay 27 per cent of all income tax, as opposed to just 11 under Labour in the 1970s. Raising the top rate nets LESS money since the wealthiest find ways to avoid it, or leave.Low corporation tax is partly behind the incredible job creation since 2010. Reverse it and see the dole queues grow.And an avalanche of taxes on wealth won’t bring equality. The overall burden is near a 30-year high. Raising it further will kill aspiration, investment and jobs.To help the poor, CUT their taxes instead.WE’RE not swallowing the Treasury scares about jobs being at risk if restaurants are made to put calorie counts on their menu.Food apps can assess a dish’s calories in moments. Totting up a menu is a few hours’ work once in a while.Better that than impose more nanny-state taxes to crowbar diners off grub they like. It’s far more likely to persuade them to pick a healthier option too.The problem is enforcing it. We don’t want council “calorie cops” giving firms a hard time.

The stitch-up reeked.When MEPs found out, even the European parliament was appalled.The improper manoeuvre will keep Selmayr, a devout federalist, at the centre of power for years to come and long after his patron Jean-Claude Juncker has retired to spend more time with his wine cellar.How did they pull it off?The outgoing secretary-general had told Juncker, privately, he would retire this year.Armed with Juncker’s inside knowledge, Selmayr successfully applied to be deputy.Then, at a meeting of commissioners, Juncker revealed the secretary-general post was suddenly vacant and that, as luck would have it, Selmayr was ready to fill it.The ombudsman’s conclusions on what the pair did are scathing. Four serious breaches of protocol and maladministration are listed.Selmayr did not take appropriate measures to avoid conflict of interest. The rules of procedure were broken.“A situation of urgency to fill the post of secretary-general was created artificially,” O’Reilly says, and: “The commissioners  responsible for the maladministration in this case. It is extraordinary that no commissioner seemed to question the secretary-general appointment procedure, which in the end raised valid widespread concerns.”Extraordinary is putting it mildly.The report makes for shocking, if not surprising, reading. The rules-based Brussels order and its highly paid apparat behave like a gangster racket.Just to be helpful, I’m going to send a copy of O’Reilly’s report to every EU flag-waving “People’s Vote” campaigner and to Gary Lineker, the crisp- toting TV football host, who has emerged as a leading voice in the campaign for a second referendum.Needless to say, Selmayr and Juncker face no sanctions or punishment.Instead, O’Reilly recommends that the commission should develop a new procedure — I’m sure that will help — for appointing the next secretary-general.My first thought on reading her report was that the commission is an even more appalling and arrogant organisation than it looks, sitting at the heart of an imperious EU wedded to ever-closer integration.Thank goodness we’re leaving. But are we?To listen to the hysterical wailing of the People’s Vote crowd in recent weeks, you would think that Brexit is about to be stopped and a grateful public will beg to be bossed around by Selmayr and his goons for years to come.There isn’t the parliamentary time for another referendum before we leave on March 29 and it’s an exceptionally duff idea regardless.If there can be two referendums, why leave it at that? Why not make it best of three or five? The decision to leave has been taken. Britain is quitting the EU.Thank goodness, in my view a shame, in the view of others — what matters now are the terms.Here, the Tory party is engaged in a row with itself over the Prime Minister’s Chequers proposal, which envisages Britain sticking with the EU’s rule book on goods.It is astonishing to see how purist this has made some of my fellow-Brexiteers who spent years before the referendum acknowledging in private that there would have to be compromises.Not long ago, Boris Johnson was so torn by the nuanced arguments on either side that he plumped for Leave by the narrowest of margins. Now he plays the zealot.But contrary to the prophets of doom, the Chequers proposal isn’t dead yet.No10 is adamant that it has “unlocked the talks” and that, beneath the rhetoric of the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier, progress is being made that may become apparent at the Salzburg meeting of EU leaders on September 20.In a weird way it might work. With Theresa May’s internal critics split and producing almost as many alternative Brexit plans as there are Tory MPs, Labour divided, and other EU member states anxious that we don’t leave without a deal, something like the Chequers plan remains the best one on offer.It would satisfy non-obsessives like me to just agree a deal, improve it as we go along, and get on with life beyond Brexit. Life is full of compromises.This is sacrilege to my purist friends. But soon, hardline Conservative MPs must decide whether they care so much about ideology that they are prepared to vote down an imperfect deal.If they do that, they risk losing the lot.And by opening the way to emergency extensions of our membership until we come up with another plan, they could condemn Britain to staying in the awful organisation that elevated Martin Selmayr to power.Times/News SyndicationOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They were repeatedly warned to stop their unjustified price hikes — and laughed in the Government’s face.Yes, customers should switch supplier. But it’s not easy and many don’t, or can’t. They should not be treated as cashpoint machines by unscrupulous corporations.The failing water and rail firms should be next. But the nationalisations Labour lazily clamour for are a recipe for shoddy service, strikes and crippling losses to taxpayers, as in the past. The answer is MORE privatisation, more competition.Because these aren’t truly free ­markets. Until they are, firms enjoying effective monopolies should expect far greater Government scrutiny and action than those who genuinely compete.“We’re in a different age now,” Mr Clark says. Good.CORBYN’S Labour hope to sneak into power on a pack of lies.It’s not just that their economics are a fantasy that would plunge us into ­poverty. Look at their other positions:Corbyn and his No2 John McDonnell both now admit they would never use our nukes, even under attack. A Corbyn Britain would thus abandon our deterrent, whatever Labour’s manifesto says.Will they ever be honest enough to tell voters they would unilaterally disarm, just as the world gets more dangerous?Honesty, though, is not their strong suit.Yesterday McDonnell repeated the absurd lie that he only wanted “peace” in Northern Ireland. He and Corbyn wanted IRA victory, achieved through ­murder. McDonnell wanted Provos “honoured”. He praised them for bombing their way to the negotiating table.As for the anti-Semite Corbyn, how chuffed he must be that 40 per cent of Jews could flee Britain if he wins power. How proud that Corbynite racists plaster Jew-hating posters across London.It’s what happens when you campaign, as Corbyn did, for the right to be more racist towards Jews than the international anti-Semitism definitions allow.And then there’s Brexit, and the insanely dangerous second referendum he seems increasingly ready to back.But at least Leavers would then know who betrayed them.

There is misery throughout the supply chain.Seven-year-old Joel Urhie, who dreamed of being a firefighter, died in a suspected gang arson attack on his family home in August.He was trapped in his bedroom in Deptford, South London. It was thought a gang had targeted his brother.A family friend told how the lad’s elder brother. 21-year-old Sam, broke down and sobbed: “It should have been me.”He had links to the 814 gang — an offshoot of The Ghetto Boys — and had spent time in jail for drugs offences.A friend said: “This might be because of something Sam did. He was involved with the wrong people.He used to live there before he went to prison and was there for a bit afterwards when he came out.“He was apparently involved in gangs and stuff and it might be the case the people who did it were after him.”Rapper Siddique Kamara was stabbed to death just yards from where his fellow band member was killed.Siddique, who went by his stage name Incognito, was stabbed in Cameberwell on 1 August.His bandmate Rhyhiem Ainsworth Barton was shot to death in May 2018.The two men were both pictured alongside Radio 1 DJ Tim Westwood and have appeared on his YouTube channel.Kamara died at the scene on Warham Street, and two other males aged 16 and 31 were taken to hospital with non life-threatening stab wounds.Moscow17 has been engaged in a longstanding feud with Zone 2 from neighbouring Peckham.The borough of Southwark, were Camberwell and Peckham are, has the second highest level of knife crime in London — with 805 stabbings last year.Tanesha Melbourne, 17, was shot dead in Tottenham, North London, in April while outside her boyfriends mums house.She was with a group of friends when she was hit by a hail of gunfire in a drive-by shooting.The Sun offered a £50,000 reward to catch the killer.It was believed she may have been gunned down in a dispute sparked by a brawl in a milkshake bar.Mobile phone footage of a punch-up may have snowballed into a deadly gang war which left innocent Tanesha caught in the crossfire.There has been a ten-year dispute between the WG and NPK gangs in the area.Corey Junior Davis, 17,  was fatally shot in the head in East London in September last year.The schoolboy was sat with friends when the attacker approached from behind wielding a gun and opened fire in a suspected revenge attack.CJ suffered irreversible brain damage and his life support was switched off.His mum Keisha McLeod said gangs bragged about the killing online.She said: There’s a rap song saying, ‘I don’t care your son’s dead, I laughed when I saw you bury him.’“These are the lyrics of the song. I’ve ­actually had to hear this. They just don’t care.“I’m speaking out against them and even when my son’s killers are caught this will not stop for me.”CJ was killed as part of a turf war between rival gangs Woodgrange E7 and The Beckton E6 crew."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000431857217.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960\" height=\"959\" width=\"960","title":"lidl worker gangster girlfriend kim kardashian lifestyle","story":"Gangsters moll Emily Lock liked the high life and gave the game away by posting pictures of extravagant holidays and expensive designer items online.Her partner, Mark Price -

despite the budget supermarket worker earning less than £10,000 a year.Suspicions were raised after they shared snaps sunning themselves in Paris and Dubai, wearing Gucci sunglasses and driving an Audi RS4.Defending Lock, Andrew Taylor told the court she became obsessed with living like a celebrity, adding: Many young people today are fixated by a Kim Kardashian type of lifestyle.Wales Online reports it is thought they spent more than £100,000 on their high-end life during Prices drug dealing.Cops eventually raided the 28-year-olds home in September 2017 and found a 110g bag of cocaine.Price admitted possessing cocaine with intent to supply, being concerned in the supply of cocaine and fraud.A message on his phone to co-defendant Kyle Crowley was also found boasting of earning £1,600 a week dealing the drug.Locks home was searched while the couple were on another luxury holiday to Thailand and dozens of luxury items were found including jewellery, watches and bags worth around £50,000.When she was quizzed by cops she claimed she had no idea her boyfriend was a dealer and thought he was a builder.The 22-year-old woman from Caerphilly admitted acquiring criminal property and was sent to prison for 15 months.The court heard Lock, in her second year of a criminology degree, was 19 at the time of the offending and Price – who is five years older – was her first boyfriend.Price was jailed after the trial for seven years at the trial in April and ordered to pay back £24,000.He had bought himself an Audi RS4, while Lock bought herself Vivienne Westwood handbags, Gucci sunglasses, Christian Louboutin shoes and Christian Dior perfume.The CPS estimate the pair blew £100,000 while Price was dealing drugs.Police raided Crowley and his partner Dionne Thomas’ home, also in Caerphilly, and found 12 cannabis plants with a potential street value of up to nearly £8,000.Edward Mitchard, who defended Crowley, said he had been forced to stop working as a nurse following mental health problems and set up a cannabis factory to make money.The court also heard Price had taken out a £33,000 loan by fraudulently stating he was employed by a construction company that had actually gone bust.Crowley was jailed for five years, while Thomas was given a community order requiring her to complete 120 hours of unpaid work.Price’s phone led officers to Christopher Morgan and they found 30 cannabis plants in his attic on January 5.He claimed the plants were for personal use but the 30-year-old later admitted producing and supplying cannabis and was given 20 months in jail.PC Michael Coles, for Gwent Police, said: I hope the sentences issued to these individuals highlight that the supply of controlled drugs will not be tolerated in Caerphilly.These people endanger our community and this lengthy investigation shows we are committed to using all powers and resources available to bring them before the courts.I hope this sends a message to those who continue to be involved in the supply of controlled drugs, that you will not just be prosecuted, we will also use our powers to seize any financial assets you have acquired though criminality."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000431913424-e1536347326341.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"brexit backing tories back boris","story":"Arch Eurosceptic Jacob Rees-Mogg said the split was “obviously very sad news for him personally and for Marina”.But he insisted the ex-Foreign Secretary would make a “fine” PM.He told The Sun: “I don’t think it makes any difference to the fine regard and admiration people in the Conservative party hold for him.“I supported him last time and I don’t regret my decision.”The Sun’s explosive revelations came a day after Boris Johnson opened a 20 POINT lead over Sajid Javid in a poll of Tory members about their preferred choice for the next party leader.Arch Eurosceptic and long-time Boris ally Nadine Dorries insisted Boris Johnson was the only politician with “rock star” status.And she said Theresa May should step down and make way for the Brexit champion.She said: “We cannot continue with a Prime Minster who is non-consensual, who doesn’t listen, who doesn’t take on board people’s concerns and acts in a presidential style.“That is not how politics work, and I’m afraid it is the end of the road now.”“We need somebody in Number Ten now that can take us forward in a much more positive way.“If we don’t … we will be handing the keys of Number Ten to Jeremy Corbyn.“Because the alternative is Jeremy Corbyn, we need somebody more than ever in number ten who has popular support from the people – and Boris has that, and can win for the Conservative Party.”Pro-EU Tory MP and Digital Minister Margot James – a longtime critic of the ex-Foreign Secretary -

She said the Government backed a Private Members’ Bill launched by Tory backbencher Sara Wollaston – guaranteeing it will pass through the Commons.The PM said: “The stories highlighted by The Sun’s “The stories highlighted by the Sun’s Stop a Stalker Campaign have underlined the too often tragic consequences of this terrifying crime.“I am determined to do everything I can to better protect victims and stop perpetrators at the earliest opportunity.”She said Ms Wollaston’s Private Members Bill – which calls for Stalking Protection Orders – would build on the action already taken by the Government to tackle the scourge.Ministers have created specific stalking offences and doubled the maximum sentences for both stalking and harassment from 5 to 10 years.Mrs May said: “I thank the Sun and its readers for their campaigning on this issue, but most importantly I would like to commend the victims and their families who have come forward to share their experiences and help draw attention to this appalling crime.”Dozens of vulnerable women have been murdered before cops could intervene. The Sun is calling for a change in the law to help police move more swiftly.Figures suggest more than a million people are stalked every year. One in five women may be victims and one in ten men. But last year just 806 stalkers were prosecuted and sentenced.That’s because their actions, while terrifying and intimidating, often falls just short of breaking the law in the early stages. However, evidence shows many stalkers will escalate their actions until they injure or kill.Tory MP Sarah Wollaston has a Private Members Bill in Parliament that calls for the introduction of Stalking Protection Orders. They would allow police to go to magistrates at the first hint of stalking for an order warning an offender to stop or face jail.We want Sun readers to sign our petition urging the Government to throw its weight behind Dr Wollaston’s Stalking Protection Bill to make sure it becomes law.

Known as The Ghetto, it is awash with guns and drugs.Ten people have been shot dead in Malmo already this year, despite police crackdowns on gang violence. In January, Rosengard’s police station was bombed.Police blame criminals from migrant backgrounds.When we visit Herrgarden, three Iraqis in a BMW glare menacingly until they hear our English accents.“We thought you were cops,” one eventually laughed.Doing her grocery shop in an Arabic corner shop, headscarf-wearing Rabia Arif, 30, originally from Lahore in Pakistan, shakes her head when asked about the SD election surge.The mum-of-one said: “I’m worried. If they come into Government they’re not going to want migrants in Sweden.”Her fears may be well-founded.SD leader Jimmie Akesson once called his nation’s Muslim population “the biggest foreign threat since the Second World War”. He wants to stop asylum seekers coming to Sweden and to ban full-face veils in public. In 2010 he emphasised his nationalist credentials by dressing in traditional Swedish costume to enter parliament.Sweden’s centre left prime minister Stefan Lofven, of the  Social Democrats, has described the party as “a neo-fascist ­single-issue party” with “Nazi and racist roots”.SD began life in 1988 as a white supremacist group. They eventually traded bovver boots for business suits and on Sunday may become the country’s largest party, according to some predictions.Anders Sannerstedt, a political scientist at Sweden’s Lund University, said: “There are still neo-Nazis in the party but they’ve been more careful this time vetting candidates.”At Malmo’s Central rail station, we meet a local SD councillor and parliamentary candidate who hardly fits the knuckle-dragging mould. Iran-born Nima Gholam Ali Pour’s first home in Sweden as a five-year-old was a refugee camp before his family moved to the Rosengard “ghetto”. The former primary school teacher insisted: “There are a lot of people with a migrant background in the party.“Our programme is a conservative one without any extreme elements. When a person says something ­racist they are thrown out.”A recent poll showed 12 per cent of foreign-born Swedes now support the Sweden Democrats. Mattias Karlsson, the party’s parliamentary chief, said: “A lot of the crime is happening in the suburbs where a lot of foreign-born people live.“It’s their cars that are being burned. It is their children’s schools that are descending into chaos.”His colleague Nima blames Sweden’s “liberal migration policy” for the failed integration of migrants following the refugee ­crisis.The Nordic nation’s open-door policy saw almost a quarter of a million asylum seekers arrive in 2014 and 2015. More than 40,000 of the new arrivals were unaccompanied children, mostly boys. Schools and housing were overstretched.Today, around a fifth of Sweden’s 10million people have foreign roots.Nima, 36, explained: “We took too many people in too quickly — we didn’t have the capacity,”SD also want to follow Britain’s lead and quit the EU.“We want a referendum on membership and we want Swexit,” Nima added. “We don’t want bureaucrats in Brussels deciding on our laws — we want the representatives of the Swedish people to decide.” When he returned to Rosengard to campaign recently, Nima was abused in an area that votes heavily for the current PM’s centre left Social Democrats.“People spat at us, called us traitors,” Nima revealed. “I was disappointed — some of these people were born in Sweden and feel that all Swedishness is their enemy.”Rosengard — built in the late Sixties as housing for workers — is home to around 24,000 people mostly from a migrant background.Ex-Man United star Zlatan Ibrahimovic grew up here. So did IS terrorist Osama Krayem, a suspect in the Paris and Brussels attacks, currently in a Belgian jail.Like other migrant areas in Sweden’s big cities, Rosengard is plagued by violent crime, something the SDs are quick to underline.More than 320 shootings and dozens of bombings were reported in Sweden in 2017. And there were more than 110 murders and 7,226 rapes — a ten per cent increase on 2016. Rosengard police inspector Mats Svensson says nearly all suspects in his area — and their victims — come from a migrant background.“We can’t go on like this,” he said. “We need to stop mass immigration and take care of these neighbourhoods before racism starts to spread together with crime.”Strolling past Rosengard’s Middle Eastern butchers and grocers, Ahmed Diini, 19, says he understands why crime and immigration are key issues at this election.Born in Malmo to Somali parents, he revealed: “The Swedish Democrats are racist, they blame everything on immigrants. In Malmo we have a lot of shoot-outs. Often it’s immigrants shooting each other.The after-school club teacher — who supports the Social Democrats — added: “It’s only a few immigrants who mess it up for the rest of us. Sweden has given many of us a new life. My father and mother arrived here from war. I am forever thankful.”Back in the neighbouring SD stronghold of Almgarden, undecided voter, builder Pelle Svensson, 42, said: “People here see a foreign guy driving a BMW and get mad.“Just because our immigration law has been s*** doesn’t mean you should vote for the SDs.Just three miles from Rosengard in Malmo’s old town, the gang epidemic seems a world away.White-collar Swedes sip wine at outdoor cafes in medieval squares.Sweden’s economy is booming and it is regularly ranked as one of the best places to live in the world.Yet this “humanitarian superpower” is still trying to cope with the fallout of the 2015 refugee crisis.Student Frida Eliasson, 24, won’t be voting for the SDs, but says: “Integration hasn’t worked. We have the Swedish and the immigrants. We must mend this split society.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But the British won’t do that.One Brexit red line that Theresa May is adamant that she will never cross is her insistence that no British PM could sign the EU’s proposed text on the Irish border, which would see Northern Ireland become part of the customs territory of the EU.But the two sides need to sort this issue out. For the alternative is no deal, a scenario that neither side is prepared for.One Cabinet minister tells me that “no deal would be almost a state of economic war” between the UK and the EU.This is an exaggeration. But it does show the tensions it would lead to. No deal would also result in the kind of Irish border that both sides say they are keen to avoid.Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, is prepared to ­produce a de-dramatised ­version of the backstop.This would concentrate on the 16 areas where the EU thinks there would need to be checks between Britain and Northern Ireland.The hope is that the dry, technical nature of this ­document will make it less controversial.But the UK will still struggle to sign up to this backstop.Why? Because it would still leave the threat of a customs border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the country. The Government COULD accept some regulatory checks between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. But it COULD NOT accept Northern Ireland being part of a different customs territory to the rest of the country.Senior figures on the UK side are instead mulling an approach where the checks are split three ways between the UK, Northern Ireland and the Republic.Their thinking is that the point of the backstop is to keep the Irish border as it is today but not to create a back door into the EU for goods.If the responsibility for that was split three ways with the UK doing regulatory checks on goods going into Northern Ireland and the Republic taking care to ensure that all goods from the North exported via its ports are properly declared, then you would have a solution that was acceptable to the UK.The EU will be very wary of this idea. It doesn’t want the Irish to have to carry out any additional checks.It also wants to keep the UK in a customs union with the EU, and the Northern Ireland question helps them in their attempt to do this.But the UK should point out that if disagreement over the Irish border prevents any kind of deal, then there will have to be a hard border.The Government is hopeful of making some progress on a deal with the EU at the Salzburg summit later this month. One of those closely involved in the negotiations tells me: “Salzburg won’t be dramatic. But look for a shifting of the plates. They need to give her something to stand up and point to.”What May must avoid is being faced at the end of the negotiations with a choice between staying in a customs union or no deal.A customs union would send Britain out into the world with one hand tied behind its back while no deal would cause real problems in the short-term.BORIS Johnson has received multiple ­communications from the Tory inquiry into his newspaper column on the burka.I understand that the former Foreign Secretary received an initial letter asking him if he wished to say anything in his defence. Those with knowledge of the inquiry say that he responded to that with a vigorous defence of free speech and the need for politicians to be able to take part in these debates.Johnson’s response was met with a further ­communication from the party asking him if he wanted to say anything about his particular ­comments about people wearing the burka ­looking like letter boxes and bank robbers. My information is that Johnson has not responded to this letter. The Tory inquiry simply says that it does not ­comment on ongoing investigations.In truth, this absurd exercise should be dropped. The Tories having an inquiry into the newspaper column of a backbench MP is ridiculous. If it is still dragging on by conference, it could become yet another thing that causes trouble there.Of course, the reason so much attention is paid to Boris Johnson is his status as the members’ favourite to be the next Tory leader. Since quitting over Chequers, he has enjoyed a resurgence in popularity with the party rank and file.Oddly, though, his status as favourite might help Theresa May if a vote of confidence in her was called. As one Cabinet minister explains: “At the moment, there’s a majority against Boris having the top job. So you have to vote for Theresa as you can’t risk him being in the final two.”IN the event of no deal there would be 12 weeks of disruption at the border, ministers will be told on Thursday.Ministers will be summoned to Number 10 for a two-hour Cabinet meeting on no-deal planning.Originally, it had been expected that this meeting would take place at Chequers. But it was then pointed out that this would look like a crisis summit and the idea was shelved.It will be emphasised to ministers that no deal means no deals. In other words, don’t expect a series of workarounds to be agreed between Britain and the EU to keep things ticking over.At best, the Government is hoping for a couple of bilateral deals in areas that are of overwhelming importance to the EU. If no deal does become the most likely scenario, I am told no-deal readiness will become pretty much the sole activity of the civil service.Ministers will also get to discuss a Treasury forecast of the short-term economic impact of no deal. But, rather absurdly, these papers won’t be circulated until Tuesday.THE police and intelligence work that has enabled two Russian operatives to be identified as the lead suspects for the Salisbury attack is impressive.But we shouldn’t kid ourselves that this public exposure will put a stop to Russian mischief.The very decision to use Novichok in the attacks shows that Moscow really didn’t care if it was traced back to Russia.I AM told that the Budget this autumn will not be a dramatic affair.With better than expected tax receipts, Chancellor Philip Hammond should be able to fund an increase in NHS spending without raising the headline rates of tax.However, other tax changes – including to the Enterprise Investment Scheme – are being discussed.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If the winner of a group has already qualified for the Euros, the next best team which has not qualified goes into the play-offs.Those 16 teams will go into four groups, with the top team going to the Euros. The four teams play two one-off semi-finals and one one-off final to determine play-off winners.So, if one of the Home Nations fails to qualify the traditional way, each league has a path of its own to the finals.The UEFA Nations League rankings will also determine the composition of draw pots for subsequent European Qualifiers.:: What are the benefits?\"The UEFA Nations League creates more meaningful and competitive matches for teams and a dedicated calendar and structure for national team football,\" say UEFA, who believe the new format addresses concerns national associations raised about friendlies no longer providing adequate competition.The format gives Home Nations sides an alternative route to major tournaments.As well as the appeal of being named National League winner after the Final Four showpiece event for top teams, weaker teams will have better opportunities to qualify for European Championships - the bottom 16 in the rankings are now guaranteed one of the 24 qualifying spots.Weaker teams will also face teams of a similar level - so there will be fewer thrashings and more meaningful games for fans.:: Is this the end of friendlies? Not completely. There will still be some space in the calendar for friendlies - particularly for the top teams, who are in groups of three within League A and B and the top group in League C. There will also be room for pre-tournament warm-up games ahead of World Cups and European Championships. But, essentially, the outcome of more international games will matter.:: Will the new format increase players\u0027 workload? The Nations League and new Euros qualification process operates within the current international calendar, so there are not increased demands in terms of the number of matches.In fact, UEFA claims the new product will actually reduce strain on players. That\u0027s because there is likely to be less travel and players will be playing at their own level. Players will also go back to their clubs earlier than is currently the case.:: How can I watch the Nations League?

Parents Louise and Nikki Draven – who told their controversial story in the Sunday Mirror last year – are set to undergo gender reassignment surgery. Dad Louise, 32 – whom Star calls his mummy – is to become a woman. Mum Nikki, 31 – called daddy by the child – will be a man called Charlie. Even five-year-old Star has cut his hair to look more like a boy than a girl. “It’s been a long time coming,” said Louise – born a man and Star’s biological dad. “I started my transition in 2011 but things, mainly weight, held me back.”  She shed 16st – slimming from 25st to a slim 9st – to avoid complications so she can have the December op.  She added: “It took a lot of self-discipline after bariatric surgery.”  Louise said of the swap op: “I have doubts all the time but that’s just part and parcel of my transition. “No one chooses these feelings but when people do, they need the outside of their bodies to match the inside.” Louise has also ditched her striking red and black hair – shaving it off after hormone treatment left her thinning. She said: “The hair doesn’t make the woman – the woman makes herself.” Meanwhile Nikki – born a female and registered as Star’s birth mother – now calls himself Charlie and is planning a female-to-male operation soon. The ex-pub bouncer said: “I’ve never been comfortable being female but it’s taken me a while to admit that. “I was never happy about having periods or growing breasts. It felt all wrong. So I did some soul-searching and realised I’ve always wanted to be male.”  Last year he revealed he was pansexual – some days he would dress as a woman, and others as a man. Now he only ever dresses as a man and binds his breasts every day. The couple say Star is “still gender neutral” and is happy and well-adjusted. Charlie said: “He has a five-year-old’s understanding of our situation. “I’ve always been daddy and Louise has always been mummy and that’s never going to change. “Star sometimes asks questions. Recently he asked why I had to wear a swimsuit at the pool and not trunks like other daddies. I tell Star mummy is going to a special doctor who will take away her ducky, which is Star’s word for penis. “I say that when I go to the special doctor I’ll be getting a ducky of my own then I’ll be just like him.” Star’s school is supportive. He wears a boy’s uniform but can accessorise. At home he is free to wear make-up, paint his nails, wear boys’ or girls’ clothes and play with dolls. In January, he cut his long hair and Louise said: “He’s in two minds now about whether or not he wants it long again.” "},{"url":null,"title":"gran 80 tells how brave","story":"NewsBingo caller saves gran\u0027s life after she collapses on the floor when heart valve clamped shutMaureen\u0027s bingo hall saviour Katie explains how she rushed to help her – and the inspiring rescue story shows the importance of learning first aid no matter what you do for a livingShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByGemma Aldridge19:16, 8 SEP 2018Updated19:56, 8 SEP 2018NewsBingo hall caller Katie, left, saved the life of Maureen, right, thanks to her first aid knowledge \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailWhen granny Maureen Gleghorn, 80, collapsed at the bingo hall, trained first aider Katie Jones, 25, used CPR to keep her alive until help came. Now firm friends, they are urging everyone to learn the skills that could make all the difference... Katie\u0027s story I will never get the date out of my head – I can remember it like it was yesterday. I was working as a caller at Mecca Bingo in Stevenage, Herts, when there was an announcement for a first aider to come to the main hall. I’d taken a British Red Cross course a year earlier and was a named first aider at work. I knew it must be serious for the announcement to interrupt the bingo so I ran from the front desk. As I went up the aisle, I could see Maureen lying on the floor.  My colleague Leanne was already there. She checked for a pulse as I checked Maureen’s breathing. It was irregular – we’d been taught on our course to treat that as if a person isn’t breathing. We looked at each other, realising how serious it was and knew we had to start CPR . I began cycles of 30 chest compressions and breaths while Leanne stayed on the phone to the emergency services. Then she took over compressions. At one point, they told me to stop doing breaths and do 600 compressions without stopping as they were most important. All the time I didn’t know if she was going to survive. We were warned on the first aid course that we would break ribs and I could feel that happening – I felt awful to be hurting her but she would have died otherwise. The paramedics arrived and used a defibrillator, giving Maureen two shocks. They managed to get a pulse and Maureen was taken to hospital after about an hour and a half. Before they left, they said: “We just want to thank you for what you’ve done, you’ve potentially saved someone’s life.” It wasn’t until I got home that night that the emotions came rushing out. Although I didn’t know Maureen personally at that point it was still very hard.  Thankfully, Maureen made a full recovery and when she was out of hospital we met up. Leanne and I took her some flowers and she told me that no bingo win could repay us for our actions that day. I’ve left Stevenage and Mecca Bingo now and work as a civil servant. Maureen and I exchange Christmas cards and at that time of the year I think about her sitting with her family – it’s priceless to think you’ve managed to give someone more time with their loved ones. Earlier this year, I got a tattoo on my shoulder to remind me of how precious life really is and of the importance of first aid knowledge. I got a steam punk heart as it’s mechanical, to represent the fact that Maureen’s heart has since been rebuilt but is still in perfect working order. It bears the day, date and time that it happened. It’s so important that everyone knows first aid – you never know when you might need to put those skills to use.  Maureen\u0027s story What happened to me came completely out of the blue. I was a Monday regular at the bingo and I remember my husband George dropping me off in town. I went into the bingo, got my books and had a chat to a friend on another table, returning to my table for the start. That was it. I remember nothing else from that day until I woke up in hospital two days later. I had been in an induced coma for two days. I was told I had had a cardiac arrest. Surgeons suspected a heart valve had clamped shut and not opened as it should.  I needed three stents. I spent five weeks in Lister Hospital in Stevenage and went to Royal Brompton Hospital in London, where I had a defibrillator inserted in case it happens again. But I was told to go and live a normal life and I’ve been great. I play bowls and still go to the bingo. But what happened is still there in the back of my mind. I often think: “Thank God I’m still here for another Christmas or birthday to see my grandchildren growing up.” I very nearly didn’t make it – I was so lucky Katie and Leanne were there. If it wasn’t for them, I wouldn’t be here today.  It’s frightening to think about but you’ve just got to be grateful that each day comes. I couldn’t put it into words how grateful I am to them or how much they mean to me. Everyone at the hospital was fantastic too, I want to say a huge thank to you to them. It was lovely to meet up with Katie again. When I saw her tattoo I thought it was such a lovely thing to do. It makes me emotional to think about it.

Essential first aid skills If someone is bleeding heavily Put pressure on the wound with a towel, a cloth or whatever is available to stop or slow down the flow of blood. Call 999 as soon as possible or get someone else to do it. Keep pressure on the wound until help arrives.  If someone is unresponsive and not breathing If someone is not moving and does not respond when you call them or gently shake their shoulders they are unresponsive. Tilt their head back and look and feel for breaths. If they are not breathing call 999 as soon as possible or get someone else to do it. Give chest compressions: Push firmly downwards in the middle of their chest and then release. Keep pushing firmly at a regular rate until help arrives.  If someone is choking A person who is choking may be clutching at their chest or neck and won’t be able to speak, breathe or cough. Hit them firmly on their back between their shoulder blades. This will help to dislodge the blockage. Call 999 if necessary. How to help someone who is having an epileptic seizure Prevent further injury by using a blanket or clothing to protect their head while they fit. Do not restrain them. After the seizure, help the person to rest on their side with their head tilted back. The person needs urgent medical attention if it is their first seizure, if the seizure lasts longer than five minutes, if they have hurt themselves or if you are unsure about the cause of the seizure.

Shouts of f***ing hell can be heard as the HGV driver approaches the crossing and slams on his brakes. The footage, filmed during the Monday morning rush hour commute, begins by showing a large group of cyclists waiting at traffic lights before they cross the road. And it is as they begin to cross the drama unfolds near London\u0027s Cycle Superhighway 3 by Blackfriars Underpass. One of the cyclists was wearing a helmet camera and captured the moment in full.  The cyclists start crossing the road when the lorry comes into view and slams on its brakes. Some of the witnesses are seen putting their hands to their face in shock, while others put their arms on their head, including a passing runner. Luckily, the cyclists escaped serious injury and continued across the road. Soon after the near-miss one of the cyclists urges the lorry driver to reverse so the rest of the group can start to cross the road. The cyclist who filmed the incident believes the driver is at fault for failing to notice the traffic lights, but the clip does not show whether they were red, amber or green.

Event \u0026shyorganisers have reported a spike in requests from people wanting to spoil their pups on birthdays. Celebrity party planner Charlotte Melia says she has heard of major celebrations laid on for ducks and hamsters. Charlotte, 32, who specialises in \u0026shychildren’s parties, revealed her team put on an eighth birthday bash for a Chihuahua named Oscar last month. “It was our first dog party,” she said. “I’ve learned to expect the unexpected in this job, but this was a new one. “People do treat their pets like family so I guess it’s not surprising that they like to celebrate their birthdays.” Doggy bags and personalised treats were provided for 10 of Oscar’s canine friends and they all enjoyed organic food from bowls personalised with their names.  Owners also tucked into cookies shaped like Oscar and sat around on low-level seating so they could pat their pets.  “We had a treat table with bespoke cakes and cookies,” said Charlotte, from Camberley, Surrey, founder of Dazzle and Fizz.  “It worked out really well and the client was delighted.” The London party cost Oscar’s owner Lizzie Lewis, 26, a minimum of \u0026pound5,000. The room featured a welcome board listing facts about Oscar, such as he only eats beef and salmon and loves sleeping and going to spas for a pamper session.

Megan Fairfield, 22, was more than twice the legal drink driving limit when she smashed her red Audi into the vehicle just 200 yards into her journey.  A court heard she had been celebrating her last shift as a care assistant with colleagues when she decided to drive the 500-yard trip home on August 1.  And now she cannot take her dream job caring for young children in the community as she\u0027s now lost her driving licence, Rossendale Free Press says.  Fairfield admitted drink driving and was given a fine and costs totalling \u0026pound299 and disqualified from driving for 40 months, reduced by 40 weeks if she completes a drink driving course. Burnley Magistrates Court heard she had previously been disqualified in March 2016 for 17 months for the same offence.  Charlotte Crane, prosecuting, said: He [the owner of the parked car] went outside and was approached by Miss Fairfield who initially claimed that she needed assistance because her friends had run off. He called the police and they arrived. She then changed her story and accepted driving the Audi and made comments that she had been to a leaving do, had been done for drink driving before and apologised for her behaviour. The defendant, from Helmshore, near Blackburn, Lancs., provided a breathalyser reading of 78mg in 100ml of breath. The legal limit is 35mg. But her lawyer said she has been extremely remorseful since the smash.

The 11-year-old had got on the wrong bus, and was getting further and further from home when the kind-hearted trio stepped in. The boy, who did not have a phone or any money had no means of getting home to Netherton, Liverpool, the Liverpool Echo reports. However, after spotting him crying, Year 11 student Tom O\u0027Brien gave the boy \u0026pound10 for a taxi, while Year 7 students Harry Campbell and Dylan Robson made sure he got home safe. The act of kindness was shared on Facebook by a mum and has since gone viral with thousands commenting on the post to congratulate the boys. Collette, Harry\u0027s mum, said the whole situation \u0027restores faith in humanity\u0027.  She said: It was my husband who saw Harry standing outside the house, talking to this boy we had never seen before. Harry had told Dylan to ring the taxi to pick him up from our house, to make sure he got home safe. Then he had walked him to ours and was stood outside waiting until the taxi came. God love him, this little fella was upset and had got on the wrong bus and with it being his first day wouldn\u0027t have known very many people either. I asked Harry had he seen the boy today and how he was and he said he was fine and had thanked him. I just think it is lovely. I\u0027m very proud of him. It puts faith back in humanity and that little fella will know there are good people who will help him.  Tom told teachers he was just happy the boy had got home safe and was pleased that teenagers are getting some good publicity. Now his dad Kenny has spoken out about how proud he is of his thoughtful and caring son. The 55-year-old said: I am very proud of him. He is a very thoughtful lad and has a great personality. He didn\u0027t tell me what had happened until later in the night when he realised people were talking about it on Facebook. He just said he was on the bus asking the Year 7\u0027s how they had got on, on their first day and he noticed this kid sat on his own, looking anxious and upset and asked him was he okay. The boy said he had got on the wrong bus and was getting further and further away from home so Tom thought on his feet, told him to get off the bus and gave him \u0026pound10 for a taxi. Dylan\u0027s mum Toni said she heard about what happened when her son got home from school. She said: He came home and said that there was a boy on the wrong bus and he was upset. He told me about Tom giving him the money and how he and Harry had rang a taxi. I asked him how he had known the number to ring and he said he had Googled it. I am very proud of him.

But it sounds like things weren\u0027t all plain sailing, as she made a common mistake lots of other parents make whenever it comes to shop shopping.  A source told Hello! that Kate forgot to pack socks for George and Charlotte to wear when they were trying on their new shoes. The kids were wearing summer sandals when they went to pick out their new shoes, so Kate had to borrow socks from the store. Woops! It\u0027s an easy mistake to make, and something all parents have done at some point. Kate and Wills aren\u0027t just hands on when it comes to the start of term tasks, and they are reportedly both regulars on the school run .

More than 130 – mainly soldiers – allegedly fell victim last year alone. Of those, 77 were physical attacks, including 29 rapes, according to MoD figures on Military Police probes. The rest of the sex crimes included exposure and voyeurism. The MoD said in a Freedom of Information request that at least 10 members of the Armed Forces are on the sex offenders register. Almost 20 per cent of all court martials are now linked to sexual assault, rape or child pornography. The alarming figures come just two years after a hard-hitting campaign to combat sex crimes in the Forces after figures for 2015 showed there were 60 physical atacks, including 20 rapes.  A senior officer said: “Sex crime is a major problem. Women are most at risk but around 20 males were also victims of rape and sexual assault.” The vast majority of sex offences occur in the 80,000-strong Army, roughly twice the size of both the RAF and Navy. A judge criticised a culture of sexualised behaviour and heavy drinking within a Royal Military Police unit investigating sex crimes. And even the cadet force has been tainted. Last year it emerged that almost 100 instructors have been dismissed in the past five years after allegations of sex abuse. In 2016 Army recruitment sergeant Edwin Mee, 46, was jailed for 11 years for two rapes and 14 sexual assaults on mainly overseas female recruits. The Scots-born divorced father of five was based in Croydon, South London. In July this year a member of the Coldstream Guards was jailed for 19 years after raping a woman in Windsor.

The Bristol shop is being transformed into a Super Centre as part of a \u0026pound8.2m refurbishment, reports Bristol Live .  The first new addition is a \u0027concept cafe\u0027, which is designed like a rainforest and will include table service and a \u0027premium menu\u0027.

Then there’s Tony Blair , who took time out from lobbying for a gas \u0026shypipeline on behalf of his autocratic Azerbaijani paymasters, to give an important interview with the BBC.  As we hit the 10th anniversary of the banking crash, was he finally going to admit that his government’s lax \u0026shyregulation and its attitude of being “intensely relaxed” about the rich getting richer, helped cause the worst depression since the 1920s? Maybe an apology, or an attack on The Big Swinging Dicks who caused it, then were allowed to speed past the rest of us in shiny red Lamborghinis while we sat in clapped-out Ladas in the slow lane? No. Just an attack on a Labour Party leadership that is proposing policies that would rein in the City-led greed that holds our country back. This past decade, while banks have grown bigger, richer and more untouchable on taxpayer subsidies, ordinary people have been punished with a brutal austerity programme which has seen their wages stagnate and personal debt rocket. Their recklessness may have ruined millions of lives but not one senior banker has been jailed in the UK or one judge-led inquiry into their countless acts of criminality set up.  Today our banking system has more capital behind it than it has done for a century yet the wider economy has suffered the lowest decade for growth since Victorian times. They’re still Masters of The Universe, enjoying eye-watering pay, bonuses and payoffs, and the subservient politicians who encouraged their reckless greed a decade ago are even more in awe of them. It’s as though the political class has deliberately refused to learn anything from that seismic crash. The mantra from on high is still that without these financial “wealth creators” our public services would start collapsing. Even though, like that dated economic model itself, they already have.

Unions in Spain, Italy, Portugal, Belgium and the Netherlands have agreed to the day of action, although the exact date is yet to be specified. The decision was taken by a joint meeting of unions in Rome yesterday when all the groups in the Ryanair conflict were represented. That included TCP cabin crew, pilots and ground personnel. Unions said this was normal, bearing in mind that Ryanair continues to ignore the labour law of each country in which it operates.  The unions represented were the USO and Sitcpla for Spain, UILTrasporti and FILT-CGIL for Italy, the SNPVAC of Portugal, CNE/LBC of Belgium and FNV of the Netherlands. Unions said they expect the company\u0027s workers to join in other countries. The date for the strike is currently being discussed but it will be announced before September 13.  The unions have apologised to travellers in advance but claim Ryanair is ignoring the labour laws of each country in which it operates despite months of meetings and negotiations. The union USO confirmed the strike action in an official statement, saying: The USO, together with the Spanish union Sitcpla UILTrasporti and FILT-CGIL for Italy the Portuguese SNPVAC CNE / Belgian LBC and FNV of the Netherlands have agreed this afternoon in Rome, after evaluating the good result of monitoring the different summer strikes, but the company\u0027s zero reaction, to call a new day of strike action in all the countries that joined the TCP strike in July, and to which more countries will likely join, at least Holland.  “That strike will be convened for the last week of September, although we have to harmonise the different legislations to find the exact day on which we can all coincide. “The exact date will be known before September 13, the deadline for some of the countries,” they added. With respect to the passengers, we have already seen during the previous strikes the treatment they have received from the company and the support they have given us. “We are sorry to provoke a new setback and we have tried to notify as soon as possible, but it is necessary to cut the problem at the root so that in the future the company complies with the legislation for workers and users.

Sick John Dickson had spent two decades subjecting ious women to horrific abuse. The labourer, who had raped, beaten and psychologically tortured women for two decades, was passive as handcuffs fixed his arms behind his back. Last week, Dickson appeared visibly shaken at the High Court in Glasgow as he was sentenced to 14 years in jail, with a further four-year restrictions order. It was an impressive result following an extensive investigation, triggered by a relatively minor report of Dickson throwing a mobile phone at a partner. The assault had happened last year on February 24, the Daily Record reports.  The victim\u0027s mother had reported it a week later and the task force investigation was launched on April 3, 2017. Detective Sergeant Iain Renfrew had spotted the complaint among the daily reports of all domestic incidents across Scotland, routinely sent to a task force. Experience led Iain to scan Dickson\u0027s previous record, where he saw a few complaints - not extreme, but they related to a number of partners over several years, usually at weekends, when Dickson\u0027s drunk. And there were reports from neighbours who had heard rows in Dickson\u0027s Motherwell flat, and sounds of crying. Iain said: Gut instinct told me it was the tip of the iceberg.  Victims will usually have experienced dozens of assaults before they eventually pick up the phone to police. There were multiple partners and indications of a pattern of behaviour over the years. I thought it was worth digging into Dickson further. The case was passed to Detective Constable John McFarlane to look at Dickson retrospectively and trace previous partners who could confirm if Iain\u0027s instincts were right that Dickson\u0027s potentially a serious abuser of women. This retrospective strategy has been so effective in establishing the essential element of corroboration that the blueprint has been mirrored by Police Scotland\u0027s rape task force. DC The Police Scotland domestic abuse task force  set up in 2009, signalled a neapproach in prioritising the crime across Scotland.  It is a collaborative offensive, involving specialist courts, greater consultation with the Crown and pulling in victim support agencies like ASSIST and Women\u0027s Aid to take care of women\u0027s emotional needs. Such abuse, once too often dismissed as just a domestic, now had an elite group of specialist officers tackling it with the intensity of a murder investigation. Detective Inspector David Cockburn oversees the DATF\u0027s West team and in 2018, his task force, together with those in the North and East areas of Police Scotland, have racked up sentences equating to more than a century of jail time for domestic abusers. He said: Proving these cases has been notoriously difficult in the past because the vast majority of domestic abuse happens behind closed doors with just the two people present, one word against another. It is difficult to get enough corroborative evidence and that\u0027s where we come in, as specialists digging that bit deeper to find what is needed for a successful prosecution. Going back to previous partners has to be handled sensitively and with skill. We are aware they will have tried to move on with their lives. We are conscious of taking them back, to a horrible experience and of re-traumatising them. That\u0027s why we also need to make sure they can access any emotional support they need.  The starting block is usually with the partner who is deeper in the past, who is likely to have broken off all contact with the abuser. When John introduced himself at the doors of Dickson\u0027s partners, there was an instant response. He said: When I said I was from the task force, they sensed I was there to talk about Dickson. Their reactions were visceral. One woman opened the door, initially bubbly and relaxed, but her face darkened at the mention of his name and there were tears. Another looked away and stared at the wall for a few seconds, unable to speak. In this job, I have never dealt with a victim who has truly moved on. They may think they have but they still experience flashbacks, triggers from TV or mayb e from something they have read.  Sometimes it takes the inquiry for them to see the psychological barriers that have existed far beyond the end of the relationship. The officers are careful not to lead or coerce victims and can\u0027t share if others have come forward, in case they feel pressurised to co-operate. Not all of Dickson\u0027s victims felt they could be involved but the four who did relayed horrifying stories of psychological and physical abuse by Dickson, over a period stretching from 2000 and 2017. One woman was raped more than 1000 times between 2000 and 2005, including in a train toilet. He battered her, spat on her, derided her with insults. He terrorised another by attacking her with his pet 9ft snake. The court heard Dickson\u0027so fathered a child with another woman while dating her.  One was so scared of him she was found cowering in a storage cupboard near his flat. He tried to suffocate his last partner with a plastic bag and attempted to strangle her. The psychological control he had over his victims was absolute and he was meticulous in its execution. Dickson timed partners when they went to the shops and he forensically examined receipts. He told some what to wear, how to have their hair. He liked pigtails and, in his words, easy access clothing. Despite having been independent career women, he forbade them from having jobs, leaving them financially at his mercy. He locked them in the house or hid the keys if he was there. If they visited family, he would call the land line to check they were there. He harangued one woman, telling her she was overweight, despite her tiny frame, and he hid food from her until she was malnourished. During an extensive interview following his ARREST, Dickson didn\u0027t ask for a lawyer but stared emotionlessly at the desk in front of him, responding no comment as a stream of allegations were put to him. If the silent tactic had worked in the past, it wouldn\u0027t this time. David said: He was used to dealing with response officers over isolated incidents. He was probably blase, thinking it was going to be a quick interview and out the door but he would soon see this was a whole different ball game. Before Dickson\u0027s ARRESTed, the DATF had meticulously constructed a compelling case, a fat file of evidence, which would run to 50,000 words by the time the case hit court. The procurator fiscal had been regularly briefed and was able to present 59 charges to the court. For the officers, there is an inevitable sense of duty towards the victims who have entrusted them with intimate, harrowing experiences. For some victims, it is a healing process.

Aaron, 36, has dreamt of living in a 1930s\u0027 home complete with authentic gadgets and furniture from the era ever since he was a five-year-old boy. He is the proud owner of a modest three-bedroom semi - built in 1937 - looks like the rest of the suburban street from the outside but is a time capsule inside. Everything inside is from a bygone era, including the rare wallpaper, coal fires and electric cooker which was one of the first of its kind. Aaron recalls browsing junk shops aged five, picking up an old radiogram, hoover, mincers and gas lamps during trips with his grandmother\u0027s sister. Since then, he has slowly become enamoured with the decade\u0027s style and way of life. He bought his current home in Blackpool, Lancs., for \u0026pound87,000 in 2007 after it had stood empty for nearly a decade.  The enthusiast has worked tirelessly to transform the house - installing German wallpaper which was buried in a time capsule in the 1930s and cost Aaron \u0026pound100 a roll. He sleeps in a vintage bed, has a GEC cooker, doesn\u0027t own a television or fridge and still uses a laundry mangle. Not content with just looking like it\u0027s in the 1930s, the house also runs like a pre-war one would have, heated by four coal fires and without double glazing windows. He said: From the age of five I always liked the music, a lot of people think I\u0027ve been here before. My grandmother\u0027s sister would take me round junk shops and I collected a lot of gramophones.  The first ever item I bought was an old radiogram from the 1950s and an old hoover, as well old mincers and gas lamps. It\u0027s all bits like that as to how it all started and it\u0027s got a bit out of hand since. I\u0027ve tried to make sure all the items in the house are originals, rather than being replicas. My pride of joy is an HMV state of the art gramophone from 1937. It came from an old house down south where bits and pieces were being sold off, and a friend of a friend told me about it. Anyone that comes to the house absolutely love it, I\u0027m not saying they would want to live in it but I\u0027ve not really had any bad feedback. Aaron, who has no children, loves 1930s vocalists including Judy Garland, Jessie Matthews and Billie Holiday and even watches silent films.  When at home, he wears vintage clothes, sports a slick back undercut hairstyle and bearded finish and eats a 1930s diet - including cooking foods in beef dripping. The house was built in 1937 so this house always had a toilet, he added. It runs on coal so I have to lit the fire in the backroom for hot water. If I buy a rib of beef and have friends for tea I will cook it the old fashioned way, I don\u0027t use oil.  The washing machine I\u0027ve got is a Hotpoint electric one with a mangle. The hoover is a 1934 electric hoover senior which I have been using since I was kid. The wall masks I collected are hard to come by, they are by an artist called John Douglas. I have the King up on the wall and there are thirties art decor original pictures. There is the Victorian organ in there as well as a great big Edwardian sideboard. The kitchen has got the original tiles and sink and cupboards. It\u0027s pretty bog standard to how it was when it was built. The hallway is pretty much as it was apart from it\u0027s got new wallpaper, it\u0027s an old reprint. The items I have sort of go up to the 1940s. Even at the end of the war, you were still living in the thirties because there was no production.

Sub-zero temperatures could sweep across the country in late October and leave shivering Britons longing for this summer\u0027s heatwave. The weather will be a mixed bag in the coming days and weeks - with heavy rain and strong winds in some places and warm sunshine in others - before temperatures eventually plunge. This weekend will be wet and windy across much of the UK with a washout expected in parts of Wales.  As much as 40-50mm of rain could fall in some places in Wales by Sunday night. The heaviest rain on Saturday will be over north-west Wales and north-west England, with outbreaks of rain in central parts of the UK. Much of Scotland will be dry with some sunny spells. Rain will continue to fall across central regions and spread north into Northern Ireland and southern Scotland on Saturday night, with chilly temperatures in north-west Scotland.    On Sunday, the rain will clear to sunshine and showers across Scotland and Northern Ireland. England and Wales will be cloudy with patchy rain moving to the south-east, but it will feel warm in any sunshine across the south. Forecasters say a north-south divide is poised to take hold of Britain early next week. It will be cool and wet in the northern half of the country, while the south will see the return of an Indian Summer. Daytime temperatures are forecast to potentially drop to the low teens in parts of northern England and Scotland, while highs will be around the mid teens to low 20s elsewhere, with the best of the warmth in the south-east.  Sarah Sammy, a forecaster with The Weather Channel, said after an unsettled weekend conditions will improve across the south, but stay very mixed in the north.   She said: Rain will affect much of the north on Monday, particularly in the northwest. This will gradually extend across Ireland to affect northwest England, Wales and the Midlands during the day. The far south and southeast should be drier but cloudy, likewise for the northeast and eastern Scotland in the later afternoon. Maximum temperatures will range from 14 to 19C in the north and 15 to 21C in the south. By Tuesday, the mercury should rise up to 3-5C above average for the time of year across the south, with highs of 24C likely in the capital. It\u0027ll be a largely cloudy day for all. But umbrellas will be needed in northern and western regions as low pressure is set to bring persistent, and at times heavy, outbreaks of above average rainfall. Ms Sammy added: Tuesday should see further rain across Ireland, Scotland, Wales and Northern England. The Midlands and southern England should remain mostly dry with sunny spells developing - it\u0027ll feel very warm in these areas too.

The girl, who cannot be named for legal reasons, claims the abuse she suffered between 1998 and 2001 began when she was just 13 years old, jurors heard. Her video interview was played at the trial of eight men accused of sexual abuse of five girls over a five-year period from 1998 to 2003. They were arrested and charged as part of Operation Stovewood - a police investigation into sexual abuse launched after the Rotherham grooming scandal. Sheffield Crown Court, South Yorkshire, heard how her number would be passed around between the men - with others then demanding to meet her. She said: I can honestly say that by the age of 16 I had slept with 100 Asian men - some I didn\u0027t see again.  The ones who come and use you for one time are the ones who are hard to remember. As soon as you get to know them your number gets passed around. Asian lads demanding to meet you - then you meet a new group and it went on like that. I didn\u0027t know at the time I was being passed around when I was 13 but I know now I\u0027m older. Tanweer Ali, 37, and Mohammed Imran Ali Akhtar, 37, are both accused of indecently assaulting the girl between 1998 and 2001 when she was under the age of 16. Ali and Akhtar would have been aged between 17 and 20 during the alleged period of offending. The victim described how she initially disliked Ali Akhtar, of Rotherham.  However she eventually \u0027fell\u0027 for the delivery driver when he made her feel special by visiting her every day after he finished his shift in the early hours of the morning. She fell pregnant with his son at the age of 14 and gave birth to him when she was 15. The victim claimed sexual activity with Ali Akhtar continued throughout pregnancy. She told how and after their son was born, she \u0027tricked\u0027 him into meeting him when he visited her hoping for sex. She said: I never saw him again after that. The victim told how her sister was also allegedly abused by Ali Akhtar and said the abuse they suffered made it feel as though their childhoods were snatched away.  She said: Before, we would just enjoy going on holiday with our granddad but we had advantage taken of us - we were children one minute and adults the next. We were snatched away. Ali, also of Rotherham, and Ali Akhtar are on trial with six other men, all accused of committing historic sex offences in Rotherham against five alleged victims. They face a total of 28 counts of sexual abuse of five girls over a five-year period from 1998 to 2003. Akhtar, of Rotherham, faces four counts of indecent assault, one of supplying a controlled drug, one of rape, one of procuring a girl under 21 for unlawful sexual intercourse with another, one of aiding and abetting a rape and one of sexual assault.

The Temple Institute announced the birth on their YouTube channel and said the calf and its mother would undergo extensive examination to determine if it\u0027s blemish free. In the announcement, the Institute said the red female calf brings the promise of reinstating Biblical purity to the world. In both Christianity and Judaism, red heifers feature in tales about the end of times.  The birth and sacrifice of the red cow is said to precede the construction of the Third Temple in Jerusalem. In mainstream Orthodox Judaism, the rebuilding of the Temple will happen before the coming of the Jewish Messiah. The two previous temples have been destroyed. However, The Temple Institute and other organisations have been established with the goal of building the Third Temple on Mount Moriah or the Temple Mount. But some theologians believe the construction of the Third Temple is linked to \u0027Judgement Day\u0027 or the \u0027end of times\u0027.  Director of The Temple Institute, Rabbi Chain Richman, believes it\u0027s now time to build the Third Temple following the birth of the red heifer. The video on the Institutes\u0027s YouTube channel shows the calf with its mother and proclaims: “a perfectly red heifer was born in the land of Israel”. The calf has since undergone “extensive examination by rabbinical experts” who confirmed she is a “viable candidate for the Biblical red heifer”. However, the cow could be disqualified due to natural causes. Bosses at the Temple Institute founded a Raise a Red Heifer in Israel program three years ago.

And it\u0027s apparently been in right in front of us this entire time. The story of Atlantis comes from the Greek philosopher, Plato, whose books date back to approximately 360 BC. According to the story, which has now become somewhat legend, the island of Atlantis sank into the sea in a single day and night, lost forever, after its people fell out favour with the gods. Conspiracy theorists have long been searching for the location of mythical city, with guesses ranging from Santorini, Sicily and Malta to Crete and Cyprus. But now, YouTube channel Bright Insight claims to have discovered a location in the Sahara Desert in Africa that has similarities to the details written about Atlantis all those thousands of years ago.   The Richat Structure, which is also know as the Eye of the Sahara, located in Ouadane in west-central Mauritania. The bizarre, circular feature was thought to have been created by an asteroid, although no credible evidence actually exists to prove this is true. Scientists have since concluded that the structure must be a natural phenomenon. But this is not necessarily as cut and dried as it seems if Bright Insight\u0027s theories are to be believed.  Plato stated in his texts that Atlantis was destroued in 11600 BC, which fits with the timing of The Younger Dryas theory that suggests a comet is said to have the hit the Earth and caused the Ice Age. Could that have been how Atlantis was destroyed? But the coincidences don\u0027t end there. According to the channel, the Richat Structure has a outer circle diameter of 23.5km, according to Google maps. In Plato\u0027s writing, the city of Atlantis was said to measure 127 Stadia, which would equal 23.49km in today\u0027s terms. Plato also described Atlantis in his texts, writing: There were alternate zones of sea and land encircling each other, there were two of land and three of water.

Since the tragic incident, the boys have been on their own and the eldest brother now desperately wants to be reunited with his grandmother.

I think it might be good for both of us.”While Kamara has remained in Scotland this week for treatment, Kallman is off on international duty, though not with the full squad.But while, after winning his first full cap earlier this year, he appears to be dropping a level as he joins the U/21 squad for two vital Euro qualifiers, he’s happy.The 20-year-old is very much of the opinion that his near-certain involvement against Denmark and Poland will be a case of taking one step back to make two forward.The Dens loan signing from Turku doesn’t hide from the fact he would love to have competed at the higher level.For him, though, time on the park is what matters most and that’s why he’s more than happy to be representing his country in the younger age group.“Of course you always want to go forward and I heard back in Finland they were looking to put new players into the team and the manager said I was one of the options,” he said.“However, then again you have to think about that. Now I am in the U/21s and we have two qualifier games.“I’ve played with them all the time and am going to play as the first striker for them. You have to know which are the best moments to go to the first team because, if I go to the U/21s, I’ll get playing time and we have two games to try to qualify with them.“For that reason I think it might be better to be with the U/21s to get playing time. If I got called up to the first team, yes, I would be there but how much playing time will I get, I don’t know.“It’s easier to say afterwards because you don’t know how much time you will get but with the U/21s I know I am guaranteed playing time.”And the benefit to Dundee of his trip back to the continent should be the competitive nature of the action he sees.Not only are the opposition he’ll face of a decent standard, there’s plenty of stake in the fixtures.If the young Finns can win both, they would still be in with a chance of qualifying for the Euro finals, though the history of the group so far does suggest they will have their work cut out.When they faced the Danes at home last year they were on the wrong end of a 5-0 drubbing, so to beat them in the away tie will be a big ask.Kallman, though, is up for the challenge and is determined to do all his can to at least extend Finnish interest in qualification.“These will be a tough two games. They are the deciders for us because teams are four and five points ahead of us in the table with Poland first and Denmark second.“We have to at least not lose these game to still have a chance to proceed.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"craig easton sees irn bru as a chance for dundee united kids to get their fizz back","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United reserve team boss Craig Easton believes Saturday’s Irn-Bru Cup clash with Alloa will be the perfect test for his young team.The Tangerines second string were on the wrong end of a 5-1 score in the Reserve League at Hearts on Monday.But Craig believes the margin of the home team’s victory was not a fair reflection on his side’s play and is viewing the weekend tie as a chance to show that.“We are looking forward to the game even though it comes on the back of what wasn’t a good result for us against Hearts,” he said.“It wasn’t a 5-1 performance, though. We missed two penalties and we were always in the game until the last two goals went in later in the second half.“So, I think the score was harsh on us in the end but you still don’t want to lose five goals in any game and you want to defend better.”Looking forward, he suspects Alloa will not be much changed from the side that drew with United in the Championship last weekend“I think they don’t have a massive squad so it could be similar to the league game against us on Saturday. They are a good, fit and organised outfit. It will be a hard game.”As was the case in the first-round victory over St Johnstone Colts last month, the United ranks at Tannadice on Saturday are likely to be bolstered by several first-team men.And young midfielder Archie Thomas is back in contention for a starting place.He was injured in the first minute of the first-round victory but returned for half an hour of Monday’s game.United have set the entry price for Saturday’s game at £10.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b618c05b50b5-923x564.jpg ","title":"csaba laszlos new boys are showing some promise at dundee united","story":"\t\t\t\t\tIt remains early days so far as judging new-look Dundee United goes but there is no question Csaba Laszlo’s team are getting to know each other.After a sticky start to the season, there have been definite signs over the last three, unbeaten, Championship outings that the team is coming together.And the Tele takes a look and how the new men have contributed, so far.Matej RakovanAfter joining up on the same day as fellow-goalie Benjamin Siegrist, one of the big questions going into the campaign was which of the pair would get the nod. It was the Slovakian and, so far, he’s justified the faith shown in him with a string of impressive performances. He did make an error for the goal lost against Partick, but by then the game had been comfortably won.Frederic FransThe Belgian was added to the squad to provide steel in central defence and the fact he had experience of the Scottish game from a spell with Partick made him a sensible addition. So far he’s lived up to expectations and looked a strong and calming influence.Paul WatsonProbably the most low key signing, at first it seemed doubtful if the man who was a squad player at Falkirk would feature too often. Given his chance at Queen of the South last month, the powerful centre-half grabbed the opportunity and impressed in each of his three league games to date, scoring three goals in the process. With the arrival of Rachid Bouhenna, he still faces a challenge to keep his place.Christoph RabitschThe Austrian has had a robust start to his United career and a couple of rash tackles when he was already on a booking have seen him subbed to prevent the team being reduced to 10 men. The 22-year-old was publicly slapped down by Csaba for that. He appears to have taken it on board and there’s no question his ability to get in about opponents is an asset.Adam BartonCaptured from Partick Thistle just before the Betfred Cup games kicked off, the tall Englishman has added to United’s new-found aerial strength. Most of his appearances so far have been in midfield, so he’ll face a challenge once skipper Fraser Fyvie returns from injury, but he’s also been used in central defence and that versatility has given the manager more options.Fraser AirdOne of the first signings of the summer, the Canadian has added pace in the wide areas. He earned his move on the strength of performances against United for Dunfermline last term and, so far, he might just have been the best of the new bunch.Yannick LoembaThe winger was an unknown quantity who hadn’t had much football in the last year or so. However, there’s been no evidence of that and he’s made a lightning start to his time with United. The 28-year-old always wants on the ball and his eagerness to get forward has made him a fans’ favourite.Pavol SafrankoThe loan signing from Aalborg marked his debut with an excellent goal in the win at Queen of the South and has looked the part since. Well-known to the manager from their time together in his native Slovakia, Safranko looks to be the centre-forward United have been crying out for.Craig CurranA dead leg picked up in pre-season delayed his involvement until the opening league game when Dunfermline won at Tannadice. As his fitness has improved after that injury, Curran has shown himself to be a hard worker and chipped in with a goal against Partick.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/5b924897b32e7.jpg ","title":"dundee centre of gaming universe after plans for 9m centre unveiled","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee has been dubbed “the centre of the gaming universe” after plans for a £9 million research and development centre were unveiled. 100vw, 2916px\" /The Innovation for Games and Media Enterprise  – to be based at Abertay University – will offer resources and support to games companies in the city and across the UK.Several companies including Microsoft, the BBC and Beano Studios have signed up to the project with support from Creative Scotland, Dundee City Council and V\u0026ampA Dundee.Local games studios will be given access to the expertise of partners and be able to share new and emerging games technologies as well as forming new working relationships.InGAME will also provide industry experience for students from three universities as they work on business-led assignments.The project was set to be announced today by Abertay University in association with Dundee University and the University of St Andrews.Michael Stirling, head of Beano Studios Scotland, said: “In Beano’s 80th year it’s fantastic to be recognised as a next-generation media player.

Because it was the first time it was exciting, but I soon realised it did not appeal to me any more.”Victoria said she didn’t like the sensation of drinking alcohol as it triggered feelings of anxiety.“Most of my friends drank at that point, so sometimes I felt left out,” she said.“But I soon decided I didn’t need to drink just because everyone else was.“It is hard not to feel pressure sometimes so I had to stay with the friends who didn’t care if I was drinking or not.“I have lost friends through my decision not to drink.“Sometimes it would be my friend’s 18th birthday party and I would say I was not going out drinking.“I naturally became distant from those friends who expected me to drink.“I’m quite lucky to have some supportive people around me now.”Victoria admitted that it has not always been easy to avoid being a part of the drinking culture.She said: “I am very aware of the pressure but I am quite honest about it when I am asked why I do not drink.“It is my personal choice not to and it’s not like I try to change what others do if they want to drink.”Although students coming to Dundee for the new university year may be mostly looking forward to enjoying lively nightlife, Victoria, who is studying English and history at Dundee University, says she has still been able to enjoy the experience without alcohol – and still goes on nights out.She said: “I’ve managed to make friends with people who don’t expect me to drink.”The confidence to say no is something which may not come naturally to everyone, but Victoria encouraged others to stand up for what they believe in.She said: “I have always been quite confident and outgoing but it becomes easier to not drink as you grow older.“I am happy to go to a bar with friends and still not drink.“I don’t worry about it too much.”Speaking about what other young people should do if they are thinking about giving up alcohol, she added: “Just give it a go and don’t be scared.“Imagining what it would be like is always worse than reality.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/5b8e4d427df01-507x564.jpg ","title":"dundee united must win dirty games laments csaba laszlo","story":"\t\t\t\t\tIn the wake of Saturday’s 1-1 draw at Alloa, Dundee United boss Csaba Laszlo still cuts a frustrated figure.The Terrors, and Csaba, had been on a high after comfortable wins over Queen of the South and Partick Thistle saw them, seemingly, turn a corner.United controlled and managed those matches well but all their good work came undone as they laboured to a point at the Indodrill Stadium at the weekend.Csaba had spoken at the start of the season about his side’s need to start grinding out results if they want to win the Championship.And his disappointment and anger was evident as they couldn’t dictate what he called a ‘dirty game’ in Clackmannanshire.“It was a dirty game but one which really, if you want to make the top league, you have to manage all the time and finish,” he said.“This is not about dominating the game, it’s about winning the game.“It is clear for us that this was an artificial pitch and even it was seven, eight yards shorter than usually.“So I wait for my team and it’s clear, in this case, you have to circulate the ball quicker, you have to move the ball out quicker to have the possibility to move up the pitch.”United had opened the scoring in the second half through a Paul Watson header on 71 minutes, his third goal in two games, and it could have been more.Yannick Loemba had what would have been his first strike for the Tangerines ruled out for offside and Csaba felt 18-year-old Declan Glass could have played in fellow-sub Callum Booth to put the game beyond doubt.As it transpired, the kid gave away possession and Alloa broke to win the free-kick which Iain Flannigan curled home on 82 minutes to earn the Wasps a point.It was no less than the home side deserved but Csaba couldn’t help scrutinise his team’s game management.“We were in front, you have just to keep the ball and keep the result,” he added.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"it could be all change in the dugouts as dundee

this term, it will be reserve team boss Craig Easton who takes charge for the coming second-round tie.And there could also be a change in the Wasps’ dugout after their manager Goodwin was tipped to succeed Alan Stubbs at former club St Mirren.Stubbs was sacked by the Buddies yesterday after just nine games and a run of just one win in four Premiership outings, against bottom club Dundee, so far.If Goodwin does return to the team he has such strong links with, it could see former United favourite Paddy Connolly, his assistant at Alloa, put in charge at Tannadice.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"i was looking to see if i could go elsewhere ex celtic kid paul mcmullan back from the brink at dundee united","story":"\t\t\t\t\tWinger Paul McMullan has revealed there was a real chance of him leaving Dundee United before the transfer window closed a week ago.And the former Scotland U/21 international can’t rule out being on the move when the next window opens in January.However, between now and then, the former Celtic kid, who was brought to Tannadice by Ray McKinnon before the start of last season, insists his only focus will be on winning back a regular first-team place.That fight will continue in today’s Irn-Bru Cup second-round clash with Alloa, a game McMullan concedes he might not have been involved in.“The speculation last week, it was true. I was having a look to see if I could go elsewhere because the playing time here has been limited,” he said.“In the end there wasn’t anything that I felt attracted me more than Dundee United did, so that’s why I’m still here.“The club had made it pretty clear to me that, if I wanted to move on, they weren’t going to stand in my way, they’d let me go.“Between now and January I’ve got to get my head down and try to get time on the park.“And when it comes to January I will re-evaluate because I will only have six months on my contract left. I will have to look at it.“Right now, though, I’m just doing my best to try to get back into the team and see how that works. I’m not looking at anything else, I’m just focused on getting in the team and contributing.”With that in mind he is not looking at tomorrow and the Irn-Bru Cup, a competition United have made clear is not a priority this term, with any sense of disdain.He sees it as another chance to show manager Csaba Laszlo, who’s likely to be watching from the stand as reserve manager Craig Easton takes charge of the team, he should be in the starting line-up every week.For fans turning up, history suggests McMullan’s presence could mean they will be in for another late show.When the teams met at the same stage this time last year, he and Willo Flood struck deep in injury time to earn United victory.And in the first round this season, it was McMullan’s last-gasp strike that secured a remarkable comeback win over St Johnstone Colts, who’d been two up late on. This time he’d settle for the winner to come a little earlier than that.“I’ve done that a couple of times with late goals in this cup,” he added.“Hopefully, we don’t leave it until that late again and the boys can do well and get into the next round.“It would be nice to have a more straightforward victory but it is going to be a hard game and we saw at the weekend how tough it is playing against Alloa.“We just have to take it as it comes and see how we get on.”With Alloa expected to be along the same lines as when they lined up against United in the Championship last Saturday, McMullan knows making the third round could be a big ask.“I wouldn’t think they will make too many changes but it’s an opportunity for us to show what we do and we will try to take it.“It will be a good learning process for the younger ones in our team and a good test against seasoned pros who know what the game is all about.“For me, it’s an opportunity to show what I can do and that’s what I have to keep on doing.“I feel I’ve done OK, it’s just the chances haven’t been there for one reason or another and there’s not a lot I can do about that.“All I can do is stay patient and, if an opportunity comes, do all you can to make sure I take it as best I can.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/5b8e4d5611cad-e1536054160536-814x564.jpg ","title":"no excuses for display at alloa says dundee united midfielder adam barton","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United midfielder Adam Barton insists they can have no excuses for their poor performance at Alloa despite the tough conditions.The Terrors drew 1-1 with Jim Goodwin’s side on Saturday in a game they were expected to win.The synthetic surface at the Indodrill Stadium was narrowed for United’s visit and the hosts made life difficult for Csaba Laszlo’s men throughout.Despite opening the scoring through a Paul Watson header on 71 minutes, as well as enjoying some bright spells in the second half, the Wasps were always in control.A sublime Iain Flannigan free-kick earned Alloa a well-deserved point and it could’ve been more.Barton said: “If we want to win the league, these are the places you’ve got to go and do the job.“What frustrates me is people on the outside, particularly the fans, who were there in good numbers on Saturday. They don’t understand how difficult it is to go to places like Alloa and do what you usually do.“Looking at the pitch, compared to Tannadice it’s completely different altogether, so you have to adjust your game. Alloa are playing there nearly every week so they’re used to it.“You’ve got that against you but it’s not just us, it’s going to be every team that goes there.“It was a difficult task on Saturday but again that’s an excuse and we shouldn’t have excuses.“We should be going there and doing the job.”Barton and central-midfield partner Christoph Rabitsch endured a difficult afternoon as Alloa’s Allan Trouten and Steven Hetherington engaged them in a physical battle.And the 27-year-old Englishman admits they lost control of the match.“We didn’t control the game at all, it’s as simple as that, we tried and couldn’t. It’s just the way the game was,” he added.“I’m sure at home it will be a completely different game but we weren’t used to the conditions and the width of the pitch, so it was tough.“I thought we deserved a point. I don’t think we deserved to win the game and fair play to them because they gave everything they’ve got.“We went to Alloa knowing it was not going to be easy. We didn’t underestimate them but they just played their game very well.“Even in midfield I drop in to get the ball and we mostly look like a back three.“We couldn’t do that against Alloa because it would give them a chance to press us and we were unable to do that.“That was one way in which we were affected in the way we like to play but I’m sure a lot of teams will go there and struggle to play their game.”Barton was honest in his assessment of the performance and says United’s players are not used to a more physical game but insists he knows they’ll need to get used to it.“It turned into a bit of a scrap. We don’t set up to play that kind of football and we don’t have the players who do that.“A lot of people would say you need to be able to adapt to most games but even the best players in the world don’t do the scrappy side of things.

Detailed measures will be presented next week.Leaders of the minority independent administration said every attempt would be made to minimise the impact on services but \u0026ldquosome impact on service is inevitable.Budget leader Alister Mackinnon said: \u0026ldquoOur  reserves of \u0026pound8 million are well below the minimum recommended by Audit Scotland and it\u0027 vital that they\u0026rsquore not depleted further. The committee agreed stricter controls on recruitment and overtime, a review of all agency appointments and tighter controls on staff travel.The \u0026pound5.1 million figure equates to one per cent of the total budget and compares with a \u0026pound2.7 million estimate at this stage last year. The potential overspend is blamed on high cost placements for \u0026lsquolooked-after children\u0026rsquo, lower income from new parking charges and fewer savings from toilet closures because those two policies have not yet taken full effect.Council chiefs insisted no staff jobs were at risk.Finance director Derek Yule, however, warned there were \u0026ldquono more rabbits to be pulled from hats to tackle the problems.Black Isle Liberal Democrat Gordon Adam blamed Scottish Government grant cuts while SNP city councillor Richard Laird said the crisis was \u0026ldquoentirely of this council\u0027 making.Council leader Margaret Davidson claimed local government services were \u0026ldquonot a priority for the Scottish Government.The budget leader angered the SNP benches, accusing group leader Maxine Smith of not fully participating in budget discussions. He said he invited her to meetings but had been turned down \u0026ldquobecause she views her private commitments more important than reorganising her diary.She was not in the chamber to respond. In a later statement she said: \u0026ldquoOn Friday, I received a request to attend a meeting on Monday to discuss the budget. I had commitments but they were pre-arranged meetings with constituents.

He will remain a Central Ward councillor. He said: \u0026ldquoMy health isn\u0026rsquot good enough. That\u0027 the reason I\u0026rsquom stepping down. For the last year or so, both my physical health and my mental health have been in decline. I\u0026rsquove been told by the doctor to reduce my workload a bit.SNP group leader Maxine Smith said: \u0026ldquoI am saddened that Richard has had to step down as depute group leader, as we have worked well together. His illness has been creeping up on him for some time and he feels he needs time to rest, so removing the huge responsibility of chairing a strategic committee is a sensible thing to do. Richard will continue to be a valued member of our group. He is a highly intelligent man, who has lots more to give.Saturday 8 Sep 2018 8:36 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/ResizeCache/00125000/00125302-124x067.jpg","title":"Kirking of the Council road closures","story":"The annual Kirking of the Council parade takes place this Sunday and will see a number of city roads closed for a period as follows:Kingsmills Road closed at its junction with Union Road to its junction with Charles Street, between 10.25am and 10.35am.Stephens Street closed at its junction with Kingsmills Road to its junction with Stephens Brae between 10.30am and 10.40am.Stephens Brae closed at its junction with Stephens Street to its junction with Eastgate between 10.30am and 10.40am.Eastgate closed at its junction with Stephens Brae to its junction with High Street between 10.30am and 10.40am.High Street closed at its junction with Eastgate to its junction with Bridge Street, between 10.35am and 10.45am and between 12.25pm and 12.45pm.Bridge Street closed at its junction with High Street to its junction with Bank Street between 10.35am and 10.50am and between 12.30pm and 12.45pm.Bank Street closed at its junction with Bridge Street to its junction with Fraser Street between 10.40am and 10.55am.Fraser Street closed at its junction with Bank Street to its junction with Church Street etween 10.40am and 10.55am.Church Street closed at its junction with Fraser Street to its junction with Friars Lane between 10.45am and 11am and between 12.15pm and 12.25pm.Church Street closed at its junction with Fraser Street to its junction with Union Street between 12.15pm and 12.30pm.Union Street closed at its junction with Church Street to its junction with Academy Street between 12.15pm and 12.30pm.Academy Street closed at its junction with Union Street to its junction with Inglis Street between 12.20pm and 12.35pm.Inglis Street closed at its junction with Academy Street to its junction with High Street between 12.20pm and 12.40pm.\u0026nbspSaturday 8 Sep 2018 8:36 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04030000/04030004.jpg","title":"Moves to stop private meetings at Highland Council","story":"OPPOSITION councillors have condemned an apparent trend of holding private \u0026ldquomembers\u0026rsquo briefings on significant Highland Council topics.In the run-up to such a closed meeting next month about investment in new Inverness schools, two councillors have criticised the growing practice of holding discussions behind closed doors on a wide range of issues.The frustration surfaced at an education committee meeting where the independent-led administration was reminded that multimillion-pound capital spending would affect the council\u0027 entire \u0026pound500 million annual budget and, therefore, impact all wards.The briefing is aimed at Inverness city committee members, with no public or media attendance.Dingwall and Seaforth councillor Graham MacKenzie, a former school rector, told committee colleagues meeting in Inverness: \u0026ldquoForgive me, but I get a bit jumpy when I hear about private briefings for Inverness members in terms of capital projects and school builds in Inverness.\u0026ldquoWhy is this information not to be made available to all of us because, quite clearly, whatever happens in Inverness will have implications for the rest of us.Council leader Margaret Davidson indicated that Cllr MacKenzie would be welcome to attend.Other big-money projects handled at private briefings have included a proposed waste disposal operation and public spending on controversial arts projects on the riverside in Inverness.Inverness South non-aligned councillor Ken Gowans said: \u0026ldquoThere are 26 members of the city committee that are invited to this but there are 74 members of this council whose areas this will also affect.\u0026ldquoYou could say the vast majority of councillors are being denied any input into the debate.He acknowledged that one area of such debate can be matters that are commercially confidential. But Cllr Gowans added: \u0026ldquoInverness schools are one of the biggest budget pressures we\u0026rsquore going to face. The last estimated cost to resolve the issue would be something like \u0026pound200 million.\u0026ldquoThat would affect every single service within this council \u0026ndash not just Inverness. But they\u0026rsquove been restricted to Inverness members.\u0026ldquoI cannot fathom why such important issues as Inverness schools, and the implications that has for the resources of Highland Council, are not being brought forward in an open, transparent way in the chamber so they can be discussed.\u0026ldquoThat way, we could reassure communities that this matter is being addressed.Ross and Cromarty area committee chairwoman Fiona Robertson, an independent councillor, did not join the chorus but, speaking after the committee meeting, said: \u0026ldquoWhen it comes to the allocation of the grant, then all councillors need to be involved at a much earlier stage.Saturday 8 Sep 2018 8:36 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117364.jpg","title":"New service gives job hunters a Fair Start","story":"\u0026nbspScottish Government ViewpointFAIR Start Scotland is the country\u0027s new devolved employment support service.It is focused on supporting unemployed people who have challenges in accessing the labour market for whom work is a realistic prospect.Launched in April, earlier this year, it is an example of one of the first uses of newly devolved powers under the 2016 Scotland Act.The service will run until 2023 and aims to provide tailored, flexible and person-centred support to at least 38,000 people across Scotland who want help to find work, and stay in work.Fair Start Scotland is distinctive in that participation is purely voluntary.This means that people have everything to gain and nothing to lose \u0026ndash choosing to participate will not affect existing benefits or be driven by fear of benefit sanctions.The service is delivered locally, meaning that no participants are left without the support they need.Delivery is over nine geographic areas including the Highlands and reflects local area economies, meeting the needs of employers, disabled people and those at risk of long-term unemployment.Jamie Hepburn, Minister for Business, Fair Work and Skills, said: \"What\u0027s crucial about Fair Start Scotland is that it treats people with fairness, dignity and respect and that it is focused on the needs of the individual.\"We are dedicated to delivering a high quality employment support service that will lead to real and sustained job outcomes and help people to achieve their full potential.\"As well as meeting the needs of unemployed people, Fair Start Scotland also seeks to help businesses find the skilled and committed employees they need to thrive.\"One of the many now benefitting is Highlander Alan Cairns .He has not worked for over a year and his biggest barriers to work have been low confidence and computer skills but now he has secured 16 hours of work per week.Alan started on the Fair Start Scotland service in the middle of May and has been attending the service for the past 12 weeks.

And McInnes hailed Shinnie for retaining his spot in McLeish’s squad.He said: “Hopefully Graeme can continue to establish himself with Scotland not only through training with them but out on the pitch with game time.“With the squad Graeme was involved in at the end of last season there were a lot of the Celtic players and established players left out.“It was an opportunity for Graeme to go and show Alex his capability through his training and through games.“He has obviously done that and has also started the season well for us, especially in the two games against Burnley in the Europa League.“He was very influential in those games against Burnley.“Graeme has got the recognition for that by remaining in the squad and I am delighted for him.”Shinnie is the only Aberdeen player in McLeish’s Scotland squad that will face World Cup semi-finalists Belgium tonight.That friendly is a warm-up for the UEFA Nations League opener against Albania on Monday.Aberdeen centre-back Scott McKenna would have been named in the squad if fit.However, the 21-year-old missed out with a hamstring tear that has ruled him out of Aberdeen’s last four games.McInnes anticipates McKenna, who captained Scotland in the 2-0 loss to Mexico, to return immediately after the international break.The subject of a rejected £7 million transfer deadline day bid from Aston Villa, centre-back McKenna is set to return for the trip to St Johnstone on Saturday September 15.McInnes hopes club captain Shinnie can face a Belgium side packed with world class talents such as Eden Hazard , Romelu Lukaku , Marouane Fellaini  and Vincent Kompany .He reckons facing opponents of that calibre can only help Shinnie’s own game improve.McInnes said: “Any time you go away to be involved with your country is a brilliant experience.“Graeme will be involved with some of the countries’ top players.“Then he will also hopefully get the games on top of that.“Ideally he can get game time against Belgium and Albania.“Belgium have some top class players involved and all of that is great for any player’s development.”McInnes and Aberdeen aim to tie up skipper Shinnie on an extended contract.The midfielder’s current deal expires at the end of this season and Shinnie would be free to speak with any interested club from the start of the winter transfer window on January 1.McInnes recently confirmed he would sit down with Shinnie and his agent to try to thrash out a new extended contract.The Aberdeen gaffer also confirmed he has been in regular contact with McLeish regarding Scotland internationalists.He said: “I spoke to Alex after the two Scotland games in the summer and a few times since.“Graeme has made a good impression and it is great to see him in the squad.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dons looking to benefit from us soccer boom","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAberdeen aim to tap further into the lucrative United States market to secure financial backing in a bid to help take the club to another level.Pittodrie commercial director Rob Wicks hopes the Dons can secure new opportunities across the Atlantic, where soccer is booming.American-based businessman Tom Crotty invested £775,000  into Aberdeen last November after buying up shares.US-based software entrepreneur and investor, Dave Cormack, made a substantial seven-figure investment in the Dons last June through the acquisition of shares.Life-long Aberdeen fan Cormack, who had previously held the role of Pittodrie chief executive from 2000 to 2001, was also appointed to the Dons board.Wicks said: “Football is doing some amazing things in the United States.“We have Dave Cormack, a major shareholder at the club and also a board director who is based over there.“Dave is very well placed within the United States market to look at new opportunities for us.”Aberdonian Cormack introduced venture capitalist Crotty to the Dons.Crotty is a board member and major donor to US-founded charity Grassroot Soccer which was set up by Tommy Clark, the son of legendary Dons keeper Bobby.Aberdeen, AFC Community Trust and the now global-based Grassroot recently entered into a formal partnership that focuses on adolescent health and well-being.Through the partnership a football-inspired education programme for young people around mental health will be piloted at Aberdeen’s new £47m super academy at Lochside.On confirmation of his investment last year Crotty admitted his first experience of Aberdeen was golf and playing the north-east’s courses. Cormack utilised that link and made a compelling case about Aberdeen’s future plans.Wicks said: “There is such a strong relationship with the US and Scotland as we have the likes of Donald Trump and his golf.“If you look at the visitor statistic of people coming into Scotland a very high proportion are Americans.“They love golf, the whisky trail and there are some really interesting opportunities for us to broaden that relationship and look at new ideas and partnerships.”Football, or “soccer”, is thriving in the United States and is closing in on the big three of American football, basketball and baseball.A Gallup poll recently found 7% of Americans named soccer as their favourite sport to watch.That represented a 3% gain from four years previously.Soccer was the only sport to post such a large increase.Gridiron was at 37%, down from 39%, basketball 11%, down from 12%, and baseball 9%, down from 13%. Ice hockey was at 4%, up from 3%. Only 1% of those polled over 55 named soccer as their favourite sport while the figure was 11% between those aged 18-34.It is expected soccer will surpass baseball in popularity.The rise of soccer in the United States also came despite the national team’s failure to qualify for the World Cup in Russia – the first time they had not been at the finals since 1986.The MLS recently signed an historic eight-year TV deal with ESPN, Fox Sports and Univision worth 720m with games now broadcast in 140 countries.“You look at some of the clubs out there in the MLS and what they are achieving and the fan experience that they are able to deliver,” said Wicks.“There is a lot we can learn and we have to be cognisant of that. There are wider opportunities.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"aberdeen woman forever grateful to liver donor","story":"\t\t\t\t\tElaine Baxter from Dyce went from being healthy to being put in an induced coma and going through a liver transplant within the space of a few weeks.The 58-year-old underwent a transplant in 2013 after falling ill when her liver stopped working.She said: “I wasn’t on the waiting list at all, because I just took ill very suddenly.“I was really nauseous and very, very tired, but unknown to me, this was me going into a coma.

That is why I love the north-east.“I could love Aberdeen, because you get tides all the way down there, so it could be amazing.“People have also been amazing and their first reaction including here has been ‘do you need anything?’.“It’s been so nice to share experiences with people.”Ross has been helped along with his challenge by Red Bull and filming video blogs along his route sharing his experience in the Moray Firth and even coming into contact with a seven-metre basking shark at Loch Alsh.It hasn’t all been plain sailing for the adventurer though, as he has had to use gaffer tape and two kilograms of Vaseline to combat wetsuit chafing and has grown a beard to defend himself against jellyfish stings.Ross added: “It has been a bit of blur all of it.“Scotland has been amazing, the scene is incredible and the people are incredible too.“Swimming through the night in the Moray Firth, you experience a darkness that I have never experienced before.“It was cloudy so I didn’t have any help from the moonlight, obviously there were no boats around and you are away from the land so you don’t get any help from street lights.“I couldn’t see my hand in front of my face.

We are down but certainly not out and we will be buzzing again.“The guys are gutted to lose the goals and make the mistakes they did.“You have to tear your hair out at the goals as they were gifts.“At this level against a team of Belgium’s stature the consequences of mistakes are devastating.“Sometimes at club level you can do that four or five times and still get away with it.“But at this level the consequences are terrible.”Defensive errors while under no pressure from John McGinn, Charlie Mulgrew and Ryan Jack each led directly to a goal.Although frustrated at conceding McLeish refused to slate his squad because the mistakes came because the players were utilising his passing philosophy.He refuses to ditch that and his principles to go route one just because of a heavy defeat.He said: “We know we are not up at Belgium’s level but there is a lot of ability there .“It was a catalogue of errors in the second half but if anyone is to take the blame it is me for telling them to pass it.“I know how good Charlie Mulgrew is at passing the ball but he was just caught out with his vision and didn’t catch it fully.“Ryan Jack was caught with the ball and for the first goal John McGinn turned into Mousa Dembele and it is fatal when you don’t know what is behind you.“They were harsh mistakes. And they will learn from them.“I praised them as they did a lot of good things. They passed the ball well at times and we cut through Belgium to create three of four chances.“There is no way they should be down-heartened. They should be heartened with the way they tried to play.“I don’t want them to just lump it up the pitch.“We have to use the ability we have with the ball at our feet.”Since taking over the reins from Gordon Strachan following the failed World Cup 2018 bid McLeish has lost four out of five games.A victory in Hungary is the only success of his second period in charge of the national team. Under McLeish the Scots have failed to score in defeats by Costa Rica , Peru , Mexico  and Belgium.In the Gothenburg Great’s defence all those defeats have come against teams that competed in this summer’s World Cup.Scotland were thrashed by a Belgium side that never got out of first gear.You wonder how damaging this defeat could have been if Belgium had really gone for the jugular.The reasoning behind taking this friendly also has to be questioned.If the SFA believed securing the World Cup semi-finalists would be a cash cow they were wrong as there were only 20,000 at Hampden. All it achieved was delivering a heavy defeat to a side preparing for a first competitive game under McLeish. On taking the friendly, McLeish said: “We have got to test ourselves and but for that first goal would probably have gone in at half-time all square.“It was a very difficult game coming before Albania. But it is the start of the season and the players have full fitness so they can cope with two games in a short period of time if we have to put the same boys in again.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 31","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 03/08/18, 1:40 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Well done to young Ella Pollock for recognising that she can make a difference.Something as simple as baking cakes can be all it takes to make another\u0026#8217s life a little better.

They admit to feeling this way once a month or more after scrolling through other properties on Instagram, with 25-34-year-olds feeling dissatisfied most frequently.The findings describe people having an unrealistic idea of what their home should look like, spending time worrying about flaws which would be unnoticeable to others, whilst feeling pressure to maintain a certain appearance in their home and being self-conscious of it in front of visitors. This mindset has been described by Chartered Psychologist, Dr David Lewis, as ‘Home Dysmorphic Disorder’ .energypr representative, Beth ReynoldsSir,Researchers at the University of St Andrews have shown for the first time that some of the standard measures of memory in rodents and humans are likely based on the same cognitive process which could have implications for development of treatments for memory disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease.One of the most widely used memory tests for rodents is the novel object recognition test, in which animals explore two objects one of which is new and the other they have seen before.The results of new research showed that their participants object recognition scores were far more associated with their memory abilities than their preferences for newness.One of the research team, Dr James Ainge, of the School of Psychology and Neuroscience at St Andrews said: \u0026#8216This is important as it provides some of the first evidence that the standard memory tests in humans and rats are testing the same cognitive process.

The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a different form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of diversity to suit individual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very significant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex  from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray.

A glass pane at Belleisle pro Richard Gordon’s shop was smashed in the 4am raid. Titleist and Wilson clubs were taken, in addition to Richard’s Ping bag and clubs. Police told the pro there’s been around 25 similar thefts in Scotland since April. And they are working with the Scottish Professional Golfers’ Association to track down raiders. “It’s absolutely gut-wrenching,” said Richard, 45. “The bag and clubs were presented to me in April in Phoenix, Arizona,” he said. The pro was given the accolade of being named Ping Custom Fitter of the Year for Scotland. His precious set of clubs includes a titanium driver, along with a three-wood, hybrid clubs, a full set of irons and a putter. All are high-end, high-value clubs - as are the other makes taken in the raid. Richard and his staff moved into the new South Ayrshire Council shop facility around two-and-a-half years ago. “It’s fully alarmed, and has CCTV cameras,” he said. “Security is excellent, but these raiders are prepared to go to any lengths.” It’s been reported, in other raids, that thieves have smashed through metal shutters, and even brick walls. The pro shop at Dundonald Links, between Troon and Irvine, was also targeted in a recent raid. Richard praised the way the police are conducting their inquiries. “They’ve been highly forensic in their investigation - even trying to get DNA,” he said. “The CCTV shows hooded figures, but it’s something the police are still looking at,” he added. Richard has been associated with Belleisle for 25 years, and has been head pro for 11 years. Richard’s wife Vikki works with him in the business, and Lee Hughes is his assistant pro.

Pupils, parents and teachers surrounded the car park of Kyle Academy to show their appreciation of Gavin Drysdale, who smashed a world record at the European World Para Athletics in Berlin. S6 pupil Gavin, of Ayr, brought home the gold in the race running 100m category with an incredible time of 17.37 seconds. And he was given a hero’s welcome as he was led in by a bagpipe performance. He made his way round the hundreds of emotional crowd, and there was barely a dry eye to be seen. It was clear to see how much Gavin had brought the community together, and how immensely proud they were of the superstar. A teacher was even seen asking “is my mascara running?”, which summed up the emotional parade for Gavin. And it was so clear to see how delighted Gavin was with the turnout, with pupils even running over to grab selfies with him. A buzzing Gavin said: “The reception I got coming back to school was overwhelming. “I wasn’t expecting anything like that reaction I got, it was great. “Kyle Academy are always very supportive of any competition I am doing.” Gavin, 17, has cerebral palsy and has been race running for 10 years. He trains at Dam Park, and when he started way back in 2008 he was the only race runner from Scotland. Now there are over 100 competitors from the country.  He is part of the race running club which is supported by Blue Rock Insurance Brokers. The race club is a branch of Ayr Seaforth and is coached by David Phee. Gavin also trains at Red Star in Glasgow with Janice Eaglesham. And the race running has came so far since he started, and these games have helped it get well on its way to being a part of the Paralympic games. Gavin competed in a special racing trike, which has impressive Continental tyres on it. Gavin is still on cloud nine after bagging the top prize in Berlin. He said: “When I won I was totally stunned. “I felt like I had already won a gold medal just by being there, so the fact I actually won was amazing!”  All the way through Gavin’s journey, his mum Margaret and dad Peter have been there supporting him. His family and friends have helped him along the way, and his sister Natalie even had banners up at the family home to celebrate his success for when he got back. Dad Peter said: “We are just so proud of Gavin. “We were so relieved when he won the gold - as we knew how much hard work he put into his progress. “The games went great, and it’s incredible to see how well the Scottish athletes done at the games.  “We have to extend our thanks to Kyle Academy for being so supportive and for this spectacular welcome they have given us.” Gavin isn’t just a star on the track, he has just sailed through S5 picking up an impressive five highers at A and B grades. He was also a part of the Commonwealth games baton relay in 2014. Headteacher for Kyle Academy, Mary Byrne said: “The whole school is so proud of Gavin. “We are delighted that we are able to show our support for him, and everyone at the school is delighted for him.” "},{"url":null,"title":"prestwick airport could used free","story":"NewsPrestwick Airport could be used as free parking base for ScotRail passengers on Ayr to Glasgow Central lineGovernment officials have pledged to examine the possibility of using the airport - which they own - for free parking relief to help ease the pain of commuters.Share\u0026nbspByStuart Wilson16:08, 6 SEP 2018NewsPrestwick Airport could be used for free parking \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribingSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailPrestwick Airport could be used as an unlikely saviour in the ongoing crisis at Ayr Railway Station. Government bosses are examining a plan to utilise the flight hub - which they own - for free parking. A number of services on the Ayr to Glasgow Central line will start and terminate at Prestwick Town from next Monday. But with concerns over a lack of parking in the town, transport chiefs have begun scrambling for other options. Ayr MSP, John Scott, led calls for the move to be considered during First Minister\u0027s Questions today in Holyrood. After raising the issue with Nicola Sturgeon, he told the Ayrshire Post: This is now a crisis situation and we should be looking at all available options. Parking in Prestwick is at a premium as it is, so if the airport can provide free spaces until this situation is resolved, it is something we should look at. Responding to Mr Scott\u0027s idea in parliament, Ms Sturgeon said: It strikes me as a very good suggestion and I can\u0027t think of any immediate objection anyone would have. We know the pressure this is putting on commuters. The First Minister has pledged to explore the option with her officials. Four carriage services will continue to operate between Ayr and Glasgow, but six carriage trains will be halted at Prestwick as part of ScotRail\u0027s plan to combat overcrowding on the line.

of some vehicles by residents on Waggon Road access to our depot was difficult at certain times for our vehicles due to the need to make a right hand turn into the depot. “Green Street offers an almost straight ahead manoeuvre for our vehicles into the depot which minimises the risk for our drivers, vehicles, local residents and all other road users. “We monitor our vehicles at all times and

report showed just five were issued in the space of a year.\nFigures revealed via a freedom of information request showed that in 2017 the local authority received 100 complaints about out of control dogs \u0026ndash but gave just six advisory notices and five dog control orders to irresponsible owners.\nHowever, following a meeting with Midlothian South, Tweeddale and Lauderdale MSP Christine Grahame, the council has revealed it has handed out 15 dog control notices over the last 12 months, with two still pending.\nMs Grahame, who introduced the Control of Dogs  Act 2010 as a member\u0026rsquos bill, said: \u0026ldquoI had a very useful discussion with the representatives from Scottish Borders Council and it was important to hear first-hand how this legislation is being used in practice.\n\u0026ldquoIn the last year there have been 15 dog control notices with two pending, although there are some issues with obtaining owner details. Some owners just need to be spoken to and advised of their responsibilities.\nDog control orders allow Scottish Borders Council to impose certain conditions on dog owners. For example, a dog which frequently runs away may be required to be kept on a lead at all times, or an aggressive dog may have to be muzzled when in public spaces.\nThe control orders can also be used to compel dog owners to seek training for themselves and their pet. Failure to adhere to a dog control order could lead to a ban from keeping animals or the dog being put down.\nA Scottish Borders Council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe council is currently reviewing its responsible dog ownership strategy, which will aim to remind owners of their social and legal responsibilities.\n\u0026ldquoAs part of this strategy, the council works in partnership with local and national charities to promote responsible ownership and dog control by educating the public at ious events across the Borders.\n\u0026ldquoThe council responds to all complaints received concerning out of control dogs, but in order to assist us in investigating each complaint fully, we ideally require the dog owner\u0026rsquos details.\n\u0026ldquoMembers of the public can contact 0300 100 1800 or visit www.scotborders.gov.uk if they have a concern about a dog\u0026rsquos behaviour.\nMs Grahame added: \u0026ldquoMy main concern is that members of the public may not be aware that if a dog\u0026rsquos behaviour is causing concern, for example being allowed to be out of control, they can report it to the council through this route.\n\u0026ldquoThe police, of course, deal with the most serious incidents. However I brought in my bill establishing dog control notices as a way of intervening before a dog bites or attacks and becomes dangerous.\n\u0026ldquoOnce a dog control notice is issued, the council will regularly check up to ensure it\u0026rsquos being followed.\n\u0026ldquoI would encourage anyone concerned about a dog\u0026rsquos behaviour whether in public, in its garden or indeed any other private place to get in touch with the council.

Before the official opening, our reporter Hilary Scott met up with Susan Meikle and Hazel Millen, owners of the Allotment, who stepped in to save the day following the closure of the previous Post Office on the High Street.\nIt wasn\u0026rsquot ever their dream to be postal mistresses. Susan and Hazel were content running their successful store, which has been selling fresh fruit and vegetables, cheese, wholefoods, jams and chutney since 2011.\nThey had always been open to suggestions from residents on new products and ideas \u0026ndash creating a monthly cheese tasting evening, and a popular home delivery service.\nWhen news hit the town of the Post Office closure in February last year, the community fought a hard campaign to see its full-time service return.\nThe impact of the closure was felt by the Allotment and other High Street businesses. Susan explained: \u0026ldquoWhen it closed, a lot of people who previously used the Post Office started going out of the town and naturally doing their shopping elsewhere. It hit Innerleithen hard.\nThe pair had previously laughed off any suggestions by locals that they could house the Post Office within their store.\nBut one evening in late December, something moved Susan to click a link online to find out more information \u0026ndash and from this very moment, the revival of the Post Office began.\nNo-one had officially approached them to take on the Post Office, so when asked what moved them to send the application, Susan and Hazel looked at one another and mused: \u0026ldquoYou could call it insanity!\nIt wasn\u0026rsquot easily signed, sealed and delivered. There were many loop holes to jump through, including applications, interviews and trips to Glasgow for training, before they could start running Innerleithen\u0026rsquos new service from their premises.\nAnd although Susan and Hazel say they will not financially benefit by taking on this new responsibility, they feel the gain is retaining a vital service for the people of Innerleithen.\nVariety is the spice of life, and for the Allotment owners and their two hardworking members of staff Leanne and Susan, they\u0026rsquoll be juggling more than apples and pears on occasions. \u0026ldquoI hope people give us a chance. It is going to be a challenge running the Post Office and serving our valued customers, added Susan. \u0026ldquoThere are going to be times that there will be a queue and we would appreciate people\u0026rsquos patience. We are new to this. It might take a little longer for us to do things, but it will be done right.\nI on the other-hand like to think that a little festive magic played its part in the happy ending to this tale, and somewhere in this quaint town, the one request on someone\u0026rsquos Christmas list was that the community didn\u0026rsquot lose its postal service.\nAnd it wasn\u0026rsquot delivered by a postman, or a man with a white beard wearing a red suit and black boots.

local schools.If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved  school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of diversity to suit individual communities.Council authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very significant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system.Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is of course partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms so as to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew’s House.Is it

Both present geological challenges but they can be overcome.\u0026#8216Today, I\u0026#8217ve asked for a feasibility study to look at these issues and move things forward.\u0026#8217In February, the Courier compared a potential bridge from Kintyre to Northern Ireland, to the Øresund bridge, which connects Copenhagen in Denmark with Malmo in Sweden.Professor Dunlop drew on this comparison during his speech, referencing the fact that the Øresund bridge links two separate countries, each with their own distinct identifies but sharing a cultural heritage, similar to Scotland and Northern Ireland.He pointed out the political benefits of linking the two UK countries, especially post-Brexit.He believes a bridge may re-balance the concentration of power held by Westminster and be an investment in what he considers to be the true north.Argyll and Bute MSP, Michael Russell, said of the plans: \u0026#8216A bridge, together with better road links to the central belt, would open up Argyll in a dramatic new way.\u0026#8216I would be keen to see public bodies investigate the feasibility of such a link.\u0026#8217The Øresund bridge, linking Denmark and Sweden, could be similar to a structure linking Kintyre with Northern Ireland.

Oban.The items, including a dummy shell, gas goggles, badges and medals, a uniform and original airship banners and propellers, were collated, over the course of a year, by Eleanor McKay, bibliographic and local studies librarian at Live Argyll, after a conversation with Major Struthers\u0026#8217 son Charles.\u0026#8216He said he had \u0026#8216one or two things\u0026#8217 belonging

collections from the First World War that we have seen.\u0026#8217There are parts of shot-down airships, a parachute, fragments of a radiator from a zeppelin and much more.Accompanying the artefacts, are photographs, many taken by Major Struthers himself, documenting his personal life and military career, as well as the history of airships.Major Struthers, who was mentioned in dispatches, was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, with two bars later added, for his missions with the Royal Naval Air Service, which amalgamated with the British Army\u0026#8217s Royal Flying Core to become the Royal Air Force in 1918.Major Struthers was recognised for flying more hours than any other airship pilot during the war.Aged 52 by the time the Second World War broke out, Major Struthers was too old to serve but he was in the Royal Observer Corps, his patch stretching from Sutherland to Machrihanish.\u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s local to Oban but it\u0026#8217s an Argyll story,\u0026#8217 said

One that people don\u0026#8217t really think about.\u0026#8216They think about later aircraft, especially in World War Two, but I don\u0026#8217t think they know the role they had in World War

Sometimes it can be a struggle to get teams, so perhaps MacNair played singles against a doubles pair.In 1922 honours were taken by Miss C. K. MacNish and Mr E. Armour.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.

And it takes the masterplan a stage further with more detailed ideas for each of the zones proposed in its vision, including calling for the Scottish Government to be invited to base its HQ for its proposed state company on the site, as well as suggesting offshore windfarm company Inch Cape \u0026ndash which wants to place a substation on the land to bring energy ashore from proposed turbines \u0026ndash should also be encouraged to put its Scottish base there.  The community council document comes in the wake of a brochure produced by neighbouring Prestonpans Community Council promoting its vision of a Port of Prestonpans cruise terminal at the former power station site.  That proposal sparked anger among supporters of the masterplan vision, who accused the Prestonpans group of ignoring the views of the local communities.  It led to the launch of \u0026lsquoGreenhills: delivering the Masterplan\u0026rsquo, a campaign by local groups and businesses backing the consultation document.  Now Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council has drawn up a draft brochure which sets out why it supports the plans and proposes a range of detailed ways it could be taken forward.  That includes putting head offices for Inch Cape and the Scottish Government energy interests in one part of the site, identified as its \u0026lsquoEnergy Quarter\u0026rsquo.  It also floats the idea of flooding the power station footprint to create a marina \u0026ndash as suggested by a local fisherman \u0026ndash with associated retail and leisure facilities, attracting businesses such as a film studio or 3D printing innovation to the site, or even creating a brewery.  Graeme Jeffrey, community council chairman, said: \u0026ldquoAs a community council we are promoting our vision of what we would like to see. It supports the masterplan, looking at how it could be delivered.  A Scottish Government spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoWe have set out our ambitions for a public energy company and its contribution towards tackling fuel poverty.  \u0026ldquoWe will be consulting on proposals later in the year and will make sure that Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council have an opportunity to provide their views."},{"url":null,"title":"hearing-to-take-place-on-substation-plans-at-former-cockenzie-power-station","story":"  Scottish Ministers called in the planning application by Inch Cape Offshore Ltd  earlier this year before East Lothian Council had been given a chance to make a decision on the proposal.  ICOL wants to build a substation, which will bring energy from an offshore windfarm onshore and into the National Grid, on the former power station footprint.  The application has been opposed by local community councils and the council, who believe it is not the best use of the site, which was bought by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower in March and is subject to an ongoing masterplan process for its future.  However, within weeks of the council buying the site, Scottish Ministers called-in the only lodged application for the land, from ICOL.  They said the move was because it was of \u0026ldquonational importance and denied any link to the fact that First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was on a state visit to China \u0026ndash whose state-owned company Red Rock own ICOL \u0026ndash at the time of the announcement.  The reporter appointed to investigate the application carried out a site visit at the start of this month.  Following that visit, it was announced a hearing into the plans would be held and Allison Coard was named as the appointed reporter who would oversee the hearing and report back to ministers.  Ward councillor Lachlan Bruce welcomed the announcement.  He said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom glad that there is going to be a hearing on this application.  \u0026ldquoI, of course, would prefer if members of the public could also speak at the hearing to give their views and opinions but I do think that community councils being invited is a welcome step.  \u0026ldquoOf course, this is again lengthening the process of the application out. If it had been left by the Scottish Government for East Lothian to make a decision we probably would have had an outcome by now and members of the public would also have had their chance to have a say.  \u0026ldquoI am confident that the hearing will be a further step in helping to convince the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos independent reporter that the current Inch Cape application is wrong for the site and wrong for the people of Cockenzie and Port Seton and Prestonpans.  Invitations have been sent out to Prestonpans and Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Councils inviting them to be represented at the hearing, along with East Lothian Council and representatives of ICOL.  All four have confirmed they will be attending the hearing.  In a statement following the visit, it was announced: \u0026ldquoThe reporter considers it would be helpful to have some wider community participation at the hearing and suggests that these views might be represented by one or both of the local community councils.  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoThe appointed Reporter has decided that a hearing should be held on certain matters to help her consider the application, and the council has confirmed in writing that we will participate in this procedure. The council welcomes the Reporter\u0026rsquos decision to invite both Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council and Prestonpans Community Council to participate in the hearing.  A preliminary date for the start of the hearing has been announced as Tuesday, October 2, with a venue and more details of those attending to follow.  A spokesperson for ICOL said: \u0026ldquoWe welcome the announcement that a hearing will take place on the planning application for the proposed substation, in line with planning guidance for schemes of national importance.

That project came about following rising safety concerns from drivers who did not feel confident using the unlit road.  Since then, driver confidence has improved by 78 per cent, with the project, which was undertaken by UK-based Clearview Intelligence in partnership with Transport Scotland and Amey, shortlisted in the Road Safety, Traffic Management and Enforcement category at the National Transport Awards, which take place in October.  Councillor Norman Hampshire, a Dunbar ward councillor and deputy leader of East Lothian Council, as well as chairman of the A1 Action Group, was one of those hailing the project as a big success.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe installation of the studs has, in my view, revolutionised the driving experience on the A1 after dark.  \u0026ldquoThe studs have improved night-time visibility beyond all recognition along certain parts of the route.  Concerns about driving conditions on the unlit road were first raised by the A1 Action Group, which comprises councillors from Scottish Borders and East Lothian Councils, transportation groups and community councils.  Transport Scotland met with the action group and, upon investigating the road, recognised that entering or exiting the A1 during the hours of darkness was a key area of concern due to a lack of visibility, junction definition and consistency in signage and road markings.  Clearview Intelligence was then appointed by Amey to make improvements to the road as part of a wider project and installed the road studs to give a visual consistency to the route by ensuring all major junctions were visible and treated similarly.  This included using white, red, amber and green studs to effectively highlight road edges, the centre of the road and junctions.  Andy Salotti, director of solutions at Clearview Intelligence, said: \u0026ldquoWe are immensely proud of the work we did to improve the driving conditions on the A1 and delighted this has been recognised at a national level.

A planning statement submitted as part of the application for the site, reads: \u0026ldquoThe proposal is to restore and convert a redundant and roofed-over water reservoir into a residential dwelling and improve the quality of this site.  The report adds that the house would be \u0026ldquodesigned so that the proposal provides an acceptable solution, preserving and enhancing the character and appearance of the building, which is category B listed.

The agricultural land has been earmarked by East Lothian Council for business use but Barratt claimed the council\u0026rsquos vision was financially unviable.  They said the only way to make the \u0026ldquonumbers add up was to create a mixed use site with housing and industry.  But their claims were rejected by councillors after Provost John McMillan , cabinet spokesman on economic development, insisted: \u0026ldquoIf we build it, they will come.  The quote, paraphrasing one made famous in the US baseball movie Field of Dreams starring Kevin Costner, came as he backed council officials who recommended the plans from Barratt and site owners The Co-operative be thrown out.  Jason Watt, from Barratt, told a meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos planning committee in Haddington last Tuesday that site drainage and geology issues meant it would cost \u0026pound1.5m to get ready for development.  Once general costs were taken into account, the total development bill would be \u0026pound2.25m \u0026ndash yet the value of the land was estimated at only \u0026pound1.1m.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe numbers clearly do not add up and never will unless there is cross subsidising with a mixed use development.  Ward councillor Kenny McLeod  backed the Barratt proposal, highlighting the lack of council housing available for rent in Tranent: the proposed Barratt development included 25 per cent affordable housing.  Mr McLeod said: \u0026ldquoWe need to keep the local connection and they are not building housing for rent in this area.  \u0026ldquoIt must be 50 years since a house was put in the area for rent.  However, fellow Tranent, Wallyford and Macmerry councillor Colin McGinn  said he was concerned about the traffic that would be created by more than 100 homes on the site, which is on the opposite side of the town\u0026rsquos Haddington Road from Steading View.  He added: \u0026ldquoWe have a responsibility within Tranent to increase employment and opportunities for our young people.  Councillor Brian Small , opposition leader, told the committee: \u0026ldquoThere is no point in having a [Local Development] Plan if at the first turn we think we can turn it over. We need to give this business land the opportunity to develop.  The committee was told that while the district valuer had agreed with developers that the land was not financially viable as a single business plot, they had said it could be made financially sound by developing it in phases.  Mr McMillan said: \u0026ldquoWe have enough land set aside for housing.  \u0026ldquoPeople want \u0026ndashand need \u0026ndash local employment and if we build it they will come. This is a signal to developers we want to grow the number of jobs around the county.

That means traffic was responsible for 18.5 per cent of the total amount of carbon dioxide released in East Lothian in 2016.  But in total, CO2 emissions in the county fell over the same period.  Jason Rose, from East Lothian Greens, blamed more housing developments in East Lothian for the rise in CO2 from emissions relating to transport.  He told the Courier: \u0026ldquoTo live [in the new developments], you need a car. More houses means more cars.  Mr Rose also highlighted the fact that nearly half of East Lothian residents commute to Edinburgh every day for work.  \u0026ldquoThe main issue is half the people who live in East Lothian work in Edinburgh, so they have to commute, he said.  \u0026ldquoBuses take a long time, you want cheap and reliable.  \u0026ldquoWith trains, there definitely needs to be more of an effort to improve length and frequency.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Council should be trying to increase employment in East Lothian, so people don\u0026rsquot need to commute.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove heard some people say, \u0026lsquooh what if you open a bridge here or build another road?\u0026rsquo but creating more roads just increases traffic and spreads the problem around.  Overall, emissions from transport, both private and for business purposes, increased by 3.5 per cent in the UK over the period between 2011 and 2016.  However, total CO2 emissions fell by 4.6 per cent over the five years in East Lothian.  The county was responsible for releasing 1.1 million tonnes of CO2 in 2016 \u0026ndash down from 1.15 million tonnes five years earlier.  But Mr Rose highlighted that it was not just CO2 emissions that needed to be monitored.  \u0026ldquoWe need to watch for NO2  and PM10  \u0026ndash those are the pollutants that can cause health risks, he added.  In East Lothian, industrial and commercial activities are by far the main producer of CO2 emissions, releasing 63.9 per cent of the total. In 2016, households produced 16 per cent of the CO2 in the county, lower than five years earlier.  The Department also takes into account the amount of CO2 produced by farms and through other rural activities and the CO2 removed from the air by trees.  According to its estimates, these agricultural activities produced more greenhouse gases than forests removed, and so were responsible for 1.6 per cent of the carbon emissions in East Lothian in 2016.  Overall, the UK reduced its carbon emissions by 15.4 per cent over the five years."},{"url":null,"title":"in-this-weeks-courier","story":"  We\u0027ll also reveal the Top 25 in this year\u0027s Pet Idol competition.

Duo Gymnastics, based at the Aubigny Sports Centre, Haddington, is keen to buy a new vaulting table, which costs about \u0026pound1,000.  Jane said: \u0026ldquoWhat I have been really impressed with is the way the club and coaches have adapted to him.  \u0026ldquoThere is mainstream gymnastics but they have adapted lessons for his needs.  \u0026ldquoIt has made him not feel different and he still feels part of the club \u0026ndash he really enjoys it.  \u0026ldquoCameron\u0026rsquos disability comes under Global Development Delay.  \u0026ldquoHe has a real difficulty with comprehension and understanding what is being asked of him, following instructions.  \u0026ldquoHe is also very sensitive to noise and sudden loud noises.  \u0026ldquoThat is what they have managed to do really well, break it down into small parts for him.  \u0026ldquoThrough time, it becomes a routine and he understands what is being asked of him.  Jane, who lives near Gifford, has been a keen swimmer for a number of years and represented Scotland in the 1994 Commonwealth Games, in Canada.  However, after a break from swimming she returned to the pool at the beginning of the year before swapping the pool for the sea earlier this summer.  She said: \u0026ldquoI kept swimming as a hobby and to keep fit.  \u0026ldquoI have always swam but it has always been indoor swimming.  \u0026ldquoI started looking about and had always had an interest in open-water swimming but never did it.  \u0026ldquoI came across the Firth of Forth swim and that quite appeals to me and thought I would give it a go.  The mum-of-two signed up in March for the swim, which sees swimmers head off from Hawes Pier and swim alongside the Forth Bridge towards North Queensferry.  Swimmers set off at 2.10pm and have an hour to complete the 1.4-mile swim.  In preparation for the fundraiser on September 22, Jane has taken to the waters off Dumfries and Galloway\u0026rsquos coast and has also linked up with the Bass Rock Swimmers, who are based in North Berwick.  Despite being an accomplished swimmer, Jane said there were still challenges.  She said: \u0026ldquoThe currents are certainly a big factor.  \u0026ldquoIt is just your awareness and you can go off track very easily and just that anticipation of what is below you and what you are swimming over.  \u0026ldquoI have enjoyed the challenge and it has certainly put me out of my comfort zone.  \u0026ldquoI have really enjoyed it and met some really lovely people.  \u0026ldquoMy thanks go to my husband, Garry, and family for support and encourage to take on the challenge and to Duo Gymnastics Club for the support and help they have given Cameron.  Pamela Fletcher, from the gymnastics club, said: \u0026ldquoThanks to Jane undertaking the swim, the club can purchase a new and much needed vaulting table for the gymnastics at Aubigny Sport Centre. Due to local support we have now met our target however donations continue meaning we can hopefully purchase some more equipment. Our club trains twice a week however classes are ran Monday to Friday through enjoyleisure so the equipment is well used by over 200 local gymnasts.

I\u0026rsquom now in my late 50s, and 60 is looming ahead of me like a cat waiting to pounce and have cruel fun. Yet I know people who are in their 30s and 40s who are much older than me, and folk in their 60s and above who are younger. My oldest daughter is in her early 20s and is already lamenting the fact she is no longer \u0026lsquoyoung\u0026rsquo.  The truth is that age is a mentality or, as is often said, \u0026lsquojust a number\u0026rsquo. Of course, deteriorating health and pain can come with age, as I have experienced, but even then, getting this far makes me very thankful despite the wear and tear.  I often say that life is like toothpaste: we use it with abandon at first and then, as we realise it\u0026rsquos running out, each squirt becomes increasingly more precious and satisfying.  \u0026ldquoA whole summer seems nothing these days, it\u0026rsquos over before you get used to it, a friend said to me recently. And indeed it is nothing if we measure it by days passed.  Yet if we measure not the passing of hours, days or years but the accumulation of memories and experiences, then time seems longer, both in quantity and quality. The trick, then, is to make those experiences and memories, and to truly live in them as they happen. This means understanding what is truly meaningful to us, and what gives genuine joy and fulfilment.  I think that is the secret to a long life, regardless of what number you reach. It\u0026rsquos not just about how much toothpaste is in your tube, it\u0026rsquos about how much you savour and use the amount you have. All of us savour key moments, of course. The first day at school for our children, our holiday time, time with friends or spent doing things we enjoy.  Yet inevitably such moments are less common than what we might call the daily routine of life. I suppose that\u0026rsquos what makes them stand out. Thus the daily routine of \u0026lsquonormal\u0026rsquo life shoots us by, almost without us noticing. And that\u0026rsquos most of our life.  And so I am now more determined than ever to make my life \u0026lsquonot normal\u0026rsquo for as long as I may have left. This isn\u0026rsquot a commitment to hippy living in a campervan  but a conscious decision to savour every day as if it were my last. And what really helped me in this realisation was a conversation one day while waiting for a train. . .  One spring morning just before this summer, I was standing on the platform at Prestonpans station waiting for a train. I was not used to getting this early train and was surprised how busy it was. I was heading into Edinburgh to do some storytelling and so unusually sharing my journey with commuters.  It was a beautiful warm sunny morning, the herald of the heatwave soon to arrive. As I waited for the train I scrolled on my phone. Then I heard a voice behind me saying: \u0026ldquoOn your death bed, will you really look fondly back on the countless hours, equivalent to years of your life, spent scrolling on a phone? Will you remember just one per cent of that activity, or even want to?  I turned round to see who was speaking to me there was nobody. Then I noticed the hawthorn tree.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos better, the hawthorn said. It was resplendent with blossom, leaning over the edge of the side of the bridge which takes the cars below the station.  Perhaps I had seen it before, but this time I really noticed it because it had spoken to me. I studied its flowers and took in the immense beauty of it. It\u0026rsquos perfectly situated to admire, but the hawthorn seemed sad.  \u0026ldquoCan you imagine the effort it takes to get this magnificent and beautiful? it said. \u0026ldquoYet nobody seems to notice me.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom sure they do, I replied. \u0026ldquoNo, they don\u0026rsquot watch, insisted the tree. And so I did.  The hawthorn was right. People walked past the tree, stood next to it, but nobody seemed to notice it, and certainly nobody took any time to admire it.  \u0026ldquoBut they are busy, I said in our defence.  \u0026ldquoWe are all busy in different ways, said the tree. \u0026ldquoBut we can choose to be \u0026lsquotoo busy\u0026rsquo for some things while being busy doing others. Often you decide what is important to be busy with so you exclude what you think are the less important things.  \u0026ldquoLike looking and admiring you? I replied sarcastically.  \u0026ldquoPrecisely, said the hawthorn, perhaps not understanding a sarcastic tone.  Suddenly the train arrived. People put away their phones and I bade a hasty farewell to the tree. We all crammed into the carriage and it filled up to the brim. I saw the blazing white of the hawthorn\u0026rsquos blossom through the window. Then we headed for Wallyford.  The train ground to a halt and the doors opened. There was a crush and people calling out politely \u0026ldquoplease move up. I wondered if everyone would get on, and I think they did, but only just. Now the train felt overloaded and it literally ground its way out of the station.  When it arrived at Musselburgh, the doors opened to present a human wall made of commuters from the Pans and Wallyford. There was simply no way anyone was getting on. I watched from the privilege of my seat. Two young men with suitcases, obviously going on holiday had no chance, and didn\u0026rsquot even try.  As the train pulled away, leaving dozens of people stranded on the platform, I felt a sense of guilt at having a seat. At Waverley we were trapped in a bottleneck by ticket collectors, ensuring that none of the lucky ones who had actually managed to get onto the train would escape paying for their good fortune.  When I returned I had to cross the bridge to my car. And there was the hawthorn tree, showing off its blossom like a peacock trying to impress a mate with its feather display.  And I have noticed the hawthorn ever since. The blossom faded as summer arrived and now it bears it berries. Its haws glisten where once there was blossom, reminding me that summer has had its course, and asking the question of how I made it memorable.  I am so thankful for the hawthorn\u0026rsquos advice. It was simple but so important. The trick is to live in the moment to notice that which makes the mundane and normal extraordinary or beautiful or special.  We can pepper our daily life with simple but extraordinary moments of connection, so a day never really remains \u0026lsquonormal\u0026rsquo. We just have to truly live in that moment, to come out of our busyness and worries, and savour it.  Maybe the hawthorn tree will speak to you if ever you find yourself at Prestonpans train station. Or maybe someone else will your child, your grandchild, your partner, friends, your grandparents, your work colleague, or perhaps your inner self.  Maybe it wasn\u0026rsquot actually the tree which spoke to me. Perhaps it was my inner self. But then again, perhaps it was a speaking hawthorn, and you have to be \u0026lsquonot normal\u0026rsquo to hear it!"},{"url":null,"title":"leader-of-councils-conservative-opposition-steps-down-after-health-issues","story":"  Councillor Brian Small, who has held the position since being one of seven Conservative councillors elected in May 2017, stood down for a brief period last year following a severe bout of sepsis before returning to the post.

The Association for the Protection of Rural Scotland  told East Lothian Council the plans to build next to medieval Dirleton Castle, which dates back to the mid 13th century, were too \u0026ldquomodern and suburban.  The association said the new development,\u0026nbspproposed at Castlemains Farm immediately to the east of the castle, would \u0026ldquoirreparably damage the setting of Dirleton, destroying the important edges that define the village and separate it from the surrounding countryside.  And at a meeting of the local authority\u0026rsquos planning committee in Haddington, councillors voted by seven to four to reject the plans, which had been recommended for approval by their own officers.  Local ward councillor Jane Henderson said that the intervention from APRS had been \u0026ldquocritical as she criticised Historic Environment Scotland, which is responsible for Dirleton Castle, after it\u0026nbspfailed to formally object to the proposals.  The public agency, who were consultees on the application, told the local authority that while they acknowledged the development might have an impact on the castle, which is a scheduled monument, they considered the proposals\u0026nbspnot to have an impact of \u0026ldquonational significance.  Councillor Henderson said: \"I am particularly disappointed in Historic Environment Scotland. How they can hold that name and come through so weakly on the setting of a castle, you have to ask questions about that.  However, the agency said it had already responded to a previous application for housing on the same site which had later been withdrawn.  They said: \u0026ldquoWe were consulted by East Lothian Council on the planning application for Castlemains Farm in January 2018, on the potential impact of this application on the setting of Dirleton Castle and Gardens which is a scheduled monument.  \u0026ldquoThis second planning application addressed the concerns that had been raised when the first planning application was submitted, primarily the impact of the development on the relationship between the castle and the land to the south and east. As a result, we did not object to the application.  \u0026ldquoWe did, however, highlight a risk of impact from landscaping and lighting, and have recommended further mitigation.  Developers Queensberry Properties told the committee they had held extensive consultations with council planners and the local community but they admitted they had come to an impasse with Dirleton Village Association and had to \u0026ldquoagree to disagree.  Their spokesman told the committee that while they wanted the new houses to face outwards on the edge of the village instead of presenting visitors with a view of \u0026ldquogarden sheds and trampolines, the village association wanted the houses to \u0026ldquoturn their back on the outside world.  Architect John Finlay, who helped produce the Dirleton Expects document outlining the village association\u0026rsquos vision for its future, said: \u0026ldquoThe design is as alien as if it had landed from outer space. It even has a suburban road, with all the clutter that entails, in the forefront of the castle.  Martin White from Gullane Area Community Council said the group was opposed to the development because \u0026ldquoyou do not hide castles.  He said: \u0026ldquoDirleton Castle is one of East Lothian\u0026rsquos top five visitor attractions. It may not be of national impact but it certainly matters in East Lothian.  The council received 71 written objections and only one representation supporting the development, which cited a need for affordable housing in the village.  Dirleton Castle is a medieval fortress which dates back to the mid-13th century and has been at the centre of numerous sieges. At one point it was owned by the Ruthvens, who were involved in several plots against Mary Queen of Scots and King James VI.  Councillor Stuart Currie, planning committee member, raised concerns that the development appeared to bear little resemblance to the original development brief for the site that the local authority had consulted on with the community.  However, planning convenor Councillor Norman Hampshire said the fact those opposing the development did not have the support of Historic Environment Scotland and the council\u0026rsquos own heritage officer led him to back the planning officials\u0026rsquo recommendation to approve it.

The patient was transferred to the expert infectious disease unit at the Royal Free Hospital in London on Saturday morning.  They are believed to have contracted the infection in Nigeria before travelling to the UK.  PHE said monkeypox does not spread easily and most patients recover within a few weeks, but it can cause severe illness in some people.  Initial symptoms include fever, headache, aching muscles, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion.  A rash can also develop, usually starting on the face before spreading to other parts of the body. It eventually forms a scab which falls off.  PHE said that as a precautionary measure, it is working with experts in the NHS to contact a number of people who were on the same flight as the patient.  The body has not revealed whether the patient is a member of the military, or confirmed their gender.  PHE said in a statement: \u0026ldquoPeople without symptoms are not considered infectious but, as a precaution, those who have been in close proximity are being contacted to ensure that if they do become unwell they can be treated quickly.

Her mother requested a meeting with Leo Varadkar to discuss how families could be better supported when a loved one dies abroad.

Masked troops in combat fatigues set up checkpoints and rode through the city centre in black pickup trucks with heavy weapons mounted in the back.  Security forces in Humvees deployed at intersections.  The deployment came after an alliance of powerful Shiite militias, many of them backed by Iran, vowed to respond to the violent protests that have gripped the city for the past week, raising the threat of further violence.  At least 15 people were killed and 249 injured in clashes between protesters and security forces this week, health officials say.  Since June, Basra has been shaken by the most serious protests in the oil-rich southern region in years, with angry residents complaining of poor public services.  In recent days, protests escalated, as crowds turned their rage on neighbouring Iran, blaming its outsized influence in Iraq\u0026rsquos political affairs for their misery and calling for radical change.  Iran controls powerful Shiite militias in Basra, home to some of the largest oil fields in Iraq.  Raad Abdelhamid, a Basra firefighter, said he feared for Iraq.  \u0026ldquoThe militias are responsible for this corruption, he said as he stood outside the still-smouldering provincial government building on Saturday, his second day of working to put out a fire there.  \u0026ldquoI fear Basra is headed for more blood, he said, in tears.  A banner on one side of the building read in Arabic: \u0026ldquoNo to the militias, your militias under our feet.  Despite the oil wealth, the city has long suffered from government neglect, soaring unemployment and a crumbling infrastructure.  Over the past month, thousands of people were taken to hospital after drinking polluted water.  Angry protesters have torched government buildings and offices belonging to the Iranian-backed militias in the weeklong protests demanding improved services and an end to corruption.  On Friday night, protesters chanting anti-Iranian slogans including \u0026ldquoIran, out, out! stormed the Iranian consulate and set it on fire.  They also burned an Iranian flag and trampled on a portrait of Iran\u0026rsquos Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.  Iran\u0026rsquos Foreign Ministry spokesman, Bahram Ghasemi, condemned the attack on the consulate, which he said caused significant damage to the building.  He called for maximum punishment for the assailants. The ministry also summoned the Iraqi ambassador to relay Tehran\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquostrong protest.  On Saturday, an Iraqi flag was placed at the entrance to the consulate after the Iranian one was torn down and set ablaze.  Sprayed in red on the concrete wall of the consulate were the words: \u0026ldquoDown with Iran, down with the militias, the revolution will continue.  The government-sanctioned Shiite militias known as the Popular Mobilisation Forces \u0026mdash Hashed in Arabic \u0026mdash threatened retaliation Saturday, raising the spectre of further escalation.  \u0026ldquoWe will have a response to those who are carrying out acts of arson and sabotage, the militias\u0026rsquo commander, known as Abu Yasser al-Jaafari, told reporters in Basra.  On Saturday morning, assailants fired three Katyusha rockets at Iraq\u0026rsquos Basra airport, which houses the US consulate, adding to the tensions.

Kim\u0026rsquos effort to ease tensions with US President Donald Trump have stalled since their June summit in Singapore.  Both sides are now insisting on a different starting point.  Washington wants Kim to commit to denuclearisation first, but Pyongyang wants its security guaranteed and a peace agreement formally ending the Korean War.  With tensions once again on the rise, a parade featuring the very missiles that so unnerved Trump last year, and led to a dangerous volley of insults from both leaders, could be seen as a deliberate provocation.  The North displayed its latest missilery in the February parade, however, and Washington hardly batted an eye.  So it is possible Kim might choose to display them but give the missiles a lower profile if he makes his usual address just before the parade begins.  Either way, soon after the Sunday celebrations end, Kim will once again meet in Pyongyang with South Korean President Moon Jae-in to discuss ways to break the impasse over his nuclear weapons.

The final whistle, and the players\u0026rsquo unbridled joy on learning that Switzerland had simultaneously failed to win in Poland, confirmed Kerr\u0026rsquos long-held belief that it would be the top seeds who faltered at the last hurdle.  The win over Albania at the Lori Borici Stadium was somewhat laboured, but neither the head coach Shelley Kerr nor her players were concerned about that after the team\u0026rsquos historic achievement.  The two results left Scotland on top of Group 2 for the only time since the qualifying campaign began last September. They can now look forward to next summer\u0026rsquos finals in France while the Swiss contemplate the four nation play-offs.  \u0026ldquoYou could see our energy was zapped tonight after the win over Switzerland on Thursday night and the pitch here wasn\u0026rsquot great, Kerr said. \u0026ldquoBut that\u0026rsquos why I knew it would be the same for the Swiss against Poland.  \u0026ldquoThe team are going to celebrate for sure because they deserve it \u0026ndash it\u0026rsquos not every day you get to a World Cup, is it? Nothing compares to this. I\u0026rsquom delighted for all the players, the organisation and all the other people who support us. We had seven or eight good chances, we\u0026rsquove hit the post again and we should have made it more comfortable but I\u0026rsquom no going to dissect the performance.  \u0026ldquoThe whole week has been so tense and I\u0026rsquove tried to keep calm as a coach. I\u0026rsquove just told the players to try and win the games and they\u0026rsquove done it magnificently.  Top scorer Jane Ross, who was left out of the starting line-up for the previous two games, returned, while Manchester United\u0026rsquos Lizzie Arnot was also given her first start since returning from an ACL injury in April.  Christie Murray and Claire Emslie dropped down to the bench.  With the home side expected to get as many bodies as possible behind the ball, Scotland\u0026rsquos game plan was to stretch them on both flanks and it didn\u0026rsquot take long to pay off. After nine minutes of probing, Lisa Evans got clear on the left and sent over a cross to the far post which Arnot sent back into the paths of Kim Little and Erin Cuthbert. The Arsenal captain claimed it and crashed a volley past Viona Rexhepi.  It looked to be a non-contest as the Scots created chance after chance but they lacked the sharpness to take advantage. Rexhapi was also doing her part and made a terrific double save from Cuthbert and Ross six minutes after the goal.  The pattern continued until the half hour when the Albanians started to find some confidence. They found an equaliser just before half time, and just minutes after Rexhepi had made an even better save from Emma Mitchell \u0026ndash Megi Doci sending a low shot past Lee Alexander, who had been redundant for most of the 45 minutes.  Left-back Mitchell came even closer with a shot which hit the post and Cuthbert drew out another fine save from Rexhepi, but it was starting to look fraught midway through the second half when the much-needed goal finally arrived.  Caroline Weir took a free kick which her Manchester City team-mate headed back into the path of Ross and the striker scored her 57th, and most important, Scotland goal.  After that there was no way back for Albania, who spent most of the remaining time pinned back in their own half.

His determination to clear his name of allegations of sexual impropriety has the potential to tear the Scottish Government and the SNP apart. The two most important politicians in the modern history of Scottish nationalism have been pitted against each other at the very moment the party needs to unite over the future of independence.  We\u0027ve had the extraordinary spectacle of the former First Minister, and SNP leader, conducting a war of legal words over social media with the current First Minister, and SNP leader. In lengthy posts, Nicola Sturgeon defended the anti-sexual harassment procedures she introduced in January, and insisted on fairness for the complainants. Alex Salmond has condemned that due process as an unfair kangaroo court. Worse, he\u0027s accused the Scottish Government of leaking salacious details of the allegations to undermine him. Mr Salmond has even raised an action against the Scottish Government in the Court of Session.  For their part, Scottish Labour say that Nicola Sturgeon should already have suspended her predecessor from the party. That she has failed to follow the precedent set by the expulsion of the former Children\u0026rsquos Minister, Mark Macdonald. No formal complaint been lodged, however, with the SNP that could trigger such a disciplinary procedure. But to the dismay of many members, Ms Sturgeon has pointedly failed to rule out Mr Salmond\u0027s future defenestration. She can\u0027t.  The FM faces an acute dilemma. Under the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos procedures, complaints against former ministers are assessed by the civil service. If the result is problematic it is handed to the First Minister, \u0026ldquoin their capacity as party leader, so that the FM \u0026ldquocan take action to secure the highest standards of behaviour in the current administration. It\u0027s not clear what actions should be taken here, but you can be pretty sure critics will insist that suspension from the party is one of them. The allegations have been serious enough to be handed to the police.  However, the usual resignation argument that a minister cannot do their job properly until they\u0027ve \u0026ldquocleared their name does not apply. Alex Salmond sits in no parliament, holds no senior position in the party and is merely a sometime television presenter.  Labour\u0027s Rhoda Grant called for Mr Salmond to be suspended in order to create \u0026ldquoa safe space for his accusers \u0026ndash the two women who have made complaints. But it\u0027s not at all clear what kind of threat he is supposed to present to these women, or how removing Mr Salmond\u0027s membership card would make the space they occupy any more safe. The implication that Alex Salmond is some kind of crazed sex criminal, who cannot be allowed to walk free, is appalling. He\u0027s been found guilty of no improper conduct whatever.  Of course, the real damage was done by whoever leaked the confidential details of the allegations that he sexually assaulted two women. This vastly increased pressure on the First Minister to suspend Mr Salmond for the duration. He strenuously rejects the allegations and says he\u0027s been denied the right to see the evidence. That\u0027s assuming there is any concrete evidence.  Police and government agencies tend to work nowadays on the supposed Macpherson Principle that \u0026ldquovictims should always be believed, which is sometimes taken to mean that actual evidence is superfluous. Following a succession of miscarriages of justice, the politan Police has now abandoned this inversion of the presumption of innocence, and changed its guidance to say that accusers should be \u0026ldquolistened to rather than their allegations automatically accepted as fact. But it may be too late for Alex Salmond. In politics, you are now guilty until proven innocent. All the parties have tended to suspend politicians when allegations become public.  Many in the SNP are dismayed that Ms Sturgeon did not, at the very least, give her former mentor some kind of positive character reference last week, and then refuse to comment further. The First Minister placed herself at the forefront of the controversy, declaring that she was \u0026ldquo100% behind the Permanent Secretary, Leslie Evans, whom Mr Salmond\u0027s supporters believe has acted as judge and jury. Her remark that the complaints couldn\u0027t be \u0026ldquoswept under the carpet sounded damning.  The unalloyed glee among opposition politicians at what they see as the final humiliation of their greatest former foe is matched in the SNP by a kind of existential despair. It is hard to convey just how important Alex Salmond is to the independence movement. Political journalists and Women for Independence may regard the former leader as a hangover from alpha male politics, but for many ordinary nationalists he has hero status, comparable to that of Charles Stewart Parnell, the 19th century Irish Nationalist with whom Salmond used to compare himself. Unfortunately, that career ended with a sex scandal, too, over Parnell\u0027s adultery.  Irish nationalists always believed that Parnell was brought down by Establishment dirty tricks. There is an unshakeable conviction among many in the SNP that today\u0027s scandal must be, if not the work of M15, then a move by the deep state to silence an influential voice on the eve of a possible announcement of a second independence referendum. Salmond promised in his so-called Morningside Declaration in May to return to front line politics as soon as indyref2 is announced.  But if this is an establishment plot, then the unfortunate reality for Nationalists is that Nicola Sturgeon finds herself at the apex of it. As the new parliamentary term begins she\u0027ll come under intense pressure to suspend Mr Salmond from the party, or be accused of favouritism and hypocrisy. But if Alex Salmond were expelled on the eve of the most crucial SNP conference in years, the consequences would be unimaginable. The SNP has not just been rocked by this development it has been traumatised \u0026ndash and it may never be quite the same again."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8557817.jpg?type=article-full","title":"faith-no-more-questions-over-a-liberal-approach-as-church-of-scotland-affiliation-plummets","story":"  The latest Scottish Social Attitudes survey has caused disquiet in some quarters as it reveals that those that say they belong to the Church of Scotland have fallen from 32% in 15 years ago to just 18% in 2017.

In 2002 it was 14%.  Mr Montagu added: \u0026ldquoAs attitudes in Scotland become more socially liberal on issues like same sex relationships and abortion, church leaders will no doubt be considering how to better connect to a changing society.  \"It will be interesting to see what impact liberalising measures, such as the Church of Scotland\u0026rsquos efforts to allow ministers to conduct same-sex marriages, have upon these numbers in the future.  In June, the largest Protestant church in Northern Ireland voted to sever ties with the Church of Scotland due to what it felt was the Kirk\u0027s more liberal attitude to same-sex relationships.    The unprecedented move by the Presbyterian Church in Ireland means the Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland will no longer be invited to the annual meeting of the church\u0027s General Assembly in Belfast. And the PCI will no longer accept invitations.  Survey data also reveals that in 2009, over one in three said they had attended a Church of Scotland at least once a month, but in 2017 it had dropped to one in four, according to the survey. Those who went to a Catholic church at least once a month dipped from 60% nine years ago to 52% last year.  A Catholic Church spokesman said \u0026ldquoWhile it is reassuring to see Catholic figures remaining relatively constant, the decline in other Christian churches is very concerning.  \"An analysis of numbers however should not ignore the significant social capital the Christian church contributes to Scottish society.\"  A Church of Scotland spokeswoman said there were ious surveys and reports on congregational numbers and religious affiliation and \"differing interpretations of their meaning\".  She added: Our view is that we endeavour to be a Christian presence in communities and a force for good and we will continue to focus on that.  \u0026ldquoJesus called every Christian to be faithful to God and to make a positive difference in the world.  \u0026ldquoThat is why throughout history you have found Christians fighting injustice and inequality, being a voice for the poor and standing up for those who otherwise were alone.  \u0026ldquoJesus called this being a light in the darkness.  \u0026ldquoThe Church of Scotland is there to celebrate with individuals and families in the happy times but also to provide support during the difficult and sad times.  \u0026ldquoIrrespective of the Church\u0026rsquos popularity, that calling remains the same and is why today you still find Christians active at all levels of society.  \u0026ldquoWhether we are many or we are few, the church will always seek to be a force for good in society.\"  The Church of Scotland backed a report in May which could lead to same-sex marriages in church.  The General Assembly backed a motion which tasked a committee with drafting church law on the issue.  Its legal questions committee was asked to report back to the annual meeting of the decision-making body in 2020.  The 2016 Scottish Social Attitudes Survey was based on a sample of 1,237 people interviewed between July 2016 and December 2016."},{"url":null,"title":"over-staffed-press-drama-not-the-write-stuff-about-newspapers","story":"  Doctor Foster writer Mike Bartlett was therefore guaranteed a big slice of attention for his new drama, Press, set in the fictional worlds of The Herald, a broadsheet, no relation, and The Post, a red top.  But would Press pass muster with those in the trade? More importantly, would it interest those viewers who left papers for the internet years ago? The short answers are no, not really, and maybe, if Bartlett turns the gas up on the drama and eases off on the pondering.  Press is about as true to real newspapers as the sex and revenge drama Doctor Foster was to the life of an average GP.  Among the Acorn Antiques-level bloopers were journalists who typed like YouTube cats, slapping away on their keyboards, unnaturally tidy kitchens, and staffing levels last seen in 1952. At one point an exasperated hack told a contact: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom one of only three investigative reporters left at my paper.  That noise battering the window was a nation\u0026rsquos journalists guffawing as one. Three investigative reporters? Lucky you. Most glaringly of all, there was hardly any ******* swearing.  Bartlett didn\u0026rsquot show much imagination in the stories covered, which were the usual rag bag of Cabinet minister being caught out doing things they should not, MI5 skullduggery, etc, and he reached for the broad brush when it came to the characters: the cocky tabloid editor, the maverick reporter.  The show was saved by the quality of the cast, and the trail of appetising breadcrumbs Bartlett left behind after the first of six episodes. Ben Chaplin, last seen being a very naughty boy in Apple Tree Yard, is terrifically watchable as ego-on-legs editor Duncan Allen, while Charlotte Riley  convinces as the dour deputy news editor who looks like she\u0026rsquos carrying the weight of the world in her backpack.  The possibility of these opposites attracting is promising. Paapa Essiedu is worth keeping an eye on as the office new start who is not too sure if he is in the right business. Then there is the not inconsiderable matter of Duncan\u0026rsquos tangled private life, which included a tall blonde turning up at his door in the middle of the night who did not look like she was there to deliver pizza or give his kitchen the once over with the Mr Muscle. Which, of course, would never happen. The turning up, that is, not the cleaning.  But drama requires a little oomph the way papers need stories, and if the formula worked for Bartlett in Doctor Foster it could do the same here.  Bring on the first blood on the walls dinner party.  After the BBC\u0026rsquos majestic Planet Earth and the Blue Planet, here is your guide to some of the inhabitants of Planet Press and their real-life counterparts in today\u0026rsquos newspaper jungle.  EDITOR  Fiction: Editor of The Herald is the cool, cerebral Amina Chaudhury , while the Post is helmed by lad-about-town Duncan Allen .  Fact: Editors are the silver-backed gorillas of newspapers, much given to beating chests and swinging through newsrooms looking for someone to pummel. There is rarely a female of the species. Will not work for peanuts but expect staff to do so. Often get together with other silverbacks to compare circulation size.  PROPRIETOR  Fiction: The mysterious George Emmerson, given to having quiet chats with editors in the back of his limo, is played by David Suchet of Hercule Poirot fame.  Fact: The real kings of the jungle and the powers behind any newspaper throne. Over the years their ranks have included more than a few rogues who made Charles Foster Kane look like Charles Hawtrey. Today, newspapers are more likely to be owned by a multinational firm with shareholders rather than a sole proprietor. Far less fun, but safer for pensions.  NEWS PUP  Fiction: Going on his first \u0026ldquodeath knock, calling at the door of the recently bereaved, is boy reporter Ed Washburn .  Fact: As in fiction, newcomers to the trade should be possessed of the requisite mix of charm and rat-like cunning. In reality, if working on a London paper, Ed would be an ex-public schoolboy whose uncle, the business editor, owns half of Wiltshire.  INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER  Fiction: Clark Kent lookalike Al Weaver is James Edwards, investigative reporter.  Fact: A rare and fast disappearing breed. Eccentric sorts who grew up with posters of All The President\u0026rsquos Men on their bedroom walls instead of Kylie in gold shorts, they are the true romantics of the profession, the keepers of the flame, and the only hope for humanity. More importantly, they have the filthiest gossip.  NEWS EDITOR  Fiction: The Post\u0026rsquos news ed is played by Shane Zaza and The Herald\u0026rsquos by Charlotte Riley.  Fact: News editors are the meerkats of the trade, much given to popping up from their desk every five seconds to find a reporter they can dragoon into carrying out the editor\u0026rsquos latest insane idea. Highly excitable. On no account feed after midnight or get wet. See Gremlins for handling instructions. Riley also typifies the kind of hard-working woman in newspapers who is twice as good as the men but paid half as much. Not that she is bitter about it. Goes to boxercise in evenings.  EDITOR\u0026rsquoS SECRETARY  Fiction: So far in Press, viewers have only met Lucy , the long-suffering PA to Duncan Allen.  Fact: Outside of the proprietor, the editor\u0026rsquos secretary is the most powerful person in any newspaper and a real tigress. She, and it is always a she, knows where all the bodies are buried. More importantly, she is usually the only grown-up in the building, spending her days dabbing skint knees with Germolene, drying tears before bedtime and sorting toilet accidents.  COMING SOON  The quietly heroic, working all hours production editor who last saw their family six years ago the features editor, usually female but sometimes the odd metrosexual chap sneaks in, which comes in handy when there is mansplaining to be done and the sports editor, possessor of a mind for stats and a six-pack like Winnie  The Pooh."},{"url":null,"title":"tony-blair-says-moderate-labour-may-have-lost-party-to-jeremy-corbyns-left-for-good","story":"  The former prime minister said Labour under Jeremy Corbyn is now a \"different party\" and he hopes it is not \"lost\".  His comments come after another leading figure of the Blair era, Lord Blunkett, warned that the party is facing \"irrelevance\" unless there is a rethink of the \"Corbyn project\".  Mr Blair told the BBC: \"I\u0027ve been a member of the Labour Party for over 40 years. You do feel a strong loyalty and attachment, but at the same time it\u0027s a different party. The question is, can it be taken back?\"  \"This is a different type of Labour Party. Can it be taken back? I don\u0027t know.\"  The former PM\u0027s comments come after Labour activists in Enfield North passed a vote of no confidence in Joan Ryan, a minister in the Blair administration who now chairs Labour Friends of Israel.  Ms Ryan, a vocal critic of Mr Corbyn\u0027s handling of anti-Semitism, blamed the 94-92 defeat on \"Trots, Stalinists, Communists and assorted hard left\".  Writing on Twitter following the vote, she said: \"So lost 92 to 94 votes hardly decisive victory and it never occurred to me that Trots Stalinists Communists and assorted hard left would gave confidence in me. I have none in them.  \"I will be out tomorrow morning working hard for the people of Enfield. Just to be clear I will not be resigning. I am Labour through and through and I will continue to stand up and fight for Labour values.\"  Another former minister in Mr Blair\u0027s government, Frank Field, resigned the party whip after losing a vote of no confidence in his constituency, blaming the anti-Semitism row and allegations of bullying among members.  Another Corbyn critic, Luton South MP Gavin Shuker, also lost a no confidence vote of local activists on Thursday evening.  In a message to constituents, he said: \"It\u0027s not part of any formal procedure, so it changes nothing about my role as Labour MP for Luton South.  \"I\u0027m really sorry a handful of people in the Labour Party want to overturn your vote of confidence in me last year. Their actions say far less about me - and you - than they do about the face of today\u0027s Labour Party.  \"I\u0027ve not changed, but the Labour Party has.\"  Mr Blair said: \"There\u0027s lots of people associated with me who feel that the Labour Party\u0027s lost, that the game\u0027s over. I\u0027m kind of hoping they\u0027re not right.\"  The former PM said the row over anti-Semitism that has engulfed the party is \"ghastly\" and a \"matter of great sadness\".  He said he could not have imagined the row taking place in the way it did \"in the Labour Party I joined, all the way through to this moment\".  \"I can\u0027t imagine that we have had three to four months debating over something where we have profoundly insulted the Jewish community in our country,\" he said.  A Labour Party spokesman said: \"Labour is giving a voice and hope to communities that have been held back and ignored for years.  \"Our policies to end austerity and bring water, energy and rail into public ownership are popular and reflect the mainstream of public opinion.  \"At last year\u0027s election, when all the pundits and critics had written us off, Labour had our biggest increase in vote share since 1945 and deprived Theresa May\u0027s Tories of their majority.\"  Lord Blunkett - a Labour MP for 28 years and a minister for most of Mr Blair\u0027s administration - said he was not sure if he would back the party even if he knew his vote would make the difference between Mr Corbyn becoming prime minister or not.  Asked what he would do in these circumstances, the Labour peer told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme: \"It would entirely depend on whether my good friends in the Parliamentary Labour Party and the Commons hadn\u0027t been deselected and were there to ensure that the sane, rational policies of a Labour Party for the future were going to be implemented.\""},{"url":null,"title":"snp-mp-defies-westminster-leader-over-kremlin-tv","story":"  Angus Brendan MacNeil, a member of Westminster\u0026rsquos joint committee on national security strategy, also appeared to question if Russia was behind the Novichok attack in Salisbury.  Theresa May told MPs on Wednesday that two members of the Russian military intelligence service, the GRU, used the rare nerve agent to poison Sergei and Julia Skripal in March.  The new evidence led to calls for Mr Salmond to end his weekly show on RT, which is forced to register in the United States as an arm of the Putin regime.  SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford said this week that RT was a \u0026ldquovehicle of the Russian state and advised people not to lend it credibility by appearing on it.  He said: \"I certainly wouldn\u0027t encourage people to be seen on RT. I\u0027ve made it clear that I don\u0027t believe that people should broadcast on RT.  \u0026ldquoI think RT is a vehicle of the Russian state. People need to know exactly what the Russian state are doing, and by extension, RT are part of that.\"  Mr MacNeil, who has appeared on RT several times, including on Mr Salmond\u0026rsquos show, made it clear he would not be heeding his group leader\u0026rsquos warning.  Asked if he was reconsidering his appearances on RT, he told BBC Radio Scotland: \u0026ldquoNo. I think I\u0026rsquoll talk to any media. Many people have issues with the BBC. I\u0026rsquom talking to the BBC just now. And I\u0026rsquoll talk to any media at all if it\u0026rsquos possible.  He was asked if he would appear even if there was clear evidence RT was a tool of the Russian state, as Mr Blackford said, and Russian authorities had poisoned people in the UK.  He replied: \u0026ldquoWell, some people might have clear evidence of work by the secret services of many countries, perhaps even the UK.  \u0026ldquoI think it\u0026rsquos above my pay grade to go round and hold enquiries into every media channel.  Asked if he believed the UK government when it blamed Russia for the Salisbury attack, he merely said that \u0026ldquoif Russia was to blame, there were ways to push back against it.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe best way to counter anybody\u0026rsquos propaganda is to get on and put a different message, and perhaps a difficult message for them as well, and not let them carry on with the propaganda.  \u0026ldquoIf we only talk to our friends, all we will have is a single unitary voice that\u0026rsquos very much a very narrow segment of society, so I think we have to have broader voices.  \u0026ldquoIf that\u0026rsquos happening with Russia, get on to RT and say that\u0026rsquos happening, so that their propaganda - if that is the case - is easily put because you\u0026rsquove got a counter message on RT and not just the message the Russian government would like to hear on RT.  Mr MacNeil, 48, whose Western Isles constituency adjoins Mr Blackford\u0026rsquos Ross, Skye \u0026amp Lochaber seat, has been an MP since 2005, a decade longer than Mr Blackford.  It emerged this week that Mr Salmond\u0027s co-presenter on his RT show, Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh, is to leave the SNP\u0027s ruling body next month.  Ms Ahmed-Sheikh, a former MP who jointly owns the company that makes the show with Mr Salmond, had been women and equalities officer on the SNP\u0027s National Executive Committee for seven years."},{"url":null,"title":"social-value-portal-event-set-to-measure-the-impact-of-businesses-on-communities","story":"  With public finances under increasing pressure and many charities at full stretch the time is right for businesses to step up and do more to contribute to the public good, according to the organisers of The Social Value Gathering.

It will also see the launch of a tool to help firmsmeasure their value to society \u0026ndash whether that is through inclusion and equality, employment and training, or sustainable growth.  Participants include Josh Littlejohn, the founder and chief executive of Social Bite, a company built on the goal of improving society, firstly by providing homeless people with jobs and now through the Social Bite Village, ensuring they have homes as well.  The event will also hear from Naila Akram, Community Investment Manager at sponsor Balfour Beatty, which is looking at the impact the construction firm makes on local communities, not only through supporting employability and skills but increasingly trying to support small businesses and charities. \u0026ldquoThe area that we could do more in is wider economic growth, supporting SMEs and the 3rd sector as well as the environmental side of social value, such as habitats and biodiversity, she said.  The first such event of its kind in Scotland, the Social Value Portal, which is supported by the Herald, aims to ensure social benefit becomes \u0026ldquobusiness as usual for Scottish firms.  Guy Battle, chief executive of Social Value Portal says advances have been made, with laws in England and Scotland which encourage government to factor in social value when planning public spending.  \u0026ldquoWith the public sector struggling with the financial burden they are facing businesses really need to step up to the plate, he said. \u0026ldquoSocial value encourages businesses to get involved in delivering services in that space : whether it be community wellbeing, environmental benefit, community businesses or local spend. It encourages businesses to do more than just deliver the contract.

Perhaps somewhat incongruously, just before SVC turned up, there was a blast of a Beach Boys\u0026rsquo track \u0026ndash to remind everyone of their long-departed summer holiday - before we were entertained by the more sombre Vince the Movie.  When the Twinkletoes from Twickenham turned up late in the fine Charlie Kennedy tradition, all the best lines about his expected departure and his planned reforms had slipped out.  One \u0026ldquointeresting proposal, as a party grandee diplomatically described it, was opening up the leadership to non-MPs. Really.  Before he made reference to this, SVC made sure he pointed out to the gaggle of colleagues sitting in front of him that they were wonderfully talented human beings, any one of whom could become the next leader. Honest.  Yet, he insisted, the party had to exploit a wider pool of talent. Senior Lib Dems could be seen shuffling uncomfortably in their seats. Message received and understood.  So who could the next Lib Dem leader be? Michael Palin? Stephen Fry? Gary Lineker?, Brenda from Bristol? Corky the Cat?  Another proposed reform was having registered supporters, who could help online campaigning and vote in any future leadership contest \u0026ndash for free.  SVC, brushing aside fears of entryism, declared: \u0026ldquoWe cannot be afraid of opening windows lest a few flies get in.  Asked if he was worried those horrid Scottish Nats might seek to infiltrate the Lib Dems north of the border to push for independence, he referenced his remark about \u0026ldquonot letting the flies in and insisted there would be safeguards.  SVC spoke of creating a mass movement of like-minded liberals and touched on the idea of a new centre ground party.  But arguing it was easier to work with current party structures, he noted: \u0026ldquoThere is a danger in becoming like the scene in Monty Python\u0026rsquos Life of Brian where the Judean People\u0026rsquos Front refuses to work with the People\u0026rsquos Front of Judea for the most petty of reasons. But this is not a Monty Python sketch, it is the future of our country. Indeed.

Two of its 11 turbines are said to be the most powerful in the world, generating enough energy with a single rotation to power an average home for one day.  The wind farm, situated around 1.5 miles from the shore, is expected to produce enough electricity to meet the demand of almost 80,000 homes a year.  More than 100 business leaders and dignitaries joined Nicola Sturgeon and staff from Swedish-owned Vattenfall at an opening ceremony on board a NorthLink Ferries vessel on Friday.  Ms Sturgeon said: \"I am proud that as part of this groundbreaking project, the world\u0027s most powerful offshore wind turbines are now up and running in Scotland.  \"The European Offshore Wind Deployment Centre will maintain Scotland\u0027s reputation for innovation in low-carbon and renewable energy development and deployment.  \"A single rotation of one of these 8.8mw turbines will generate enough energy to power a home for 24 hours, which truly shows the potential of this technology to strengthen Scotland\u0027s renewable energy-generating capacity in the future.\"  The 11 turbines include two 8.8 megawatt  turbines standing 191 metres tall, which are the most powerful operating anywhere on the planet.  The project has a total capacity of 93.2mw, enough to meet the electricity needs of 70% of households in Aberdeen, industry association RenewableUK said.  The first of the turbine foundations was installed in the seabed in March, with the final turbine put in place at the end of May.  It was connected to the national grid after the laying of more than four miles of high voltage underground cable between Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks\u0027 substation in Dyce and the wind farm\u0027s onshore substation at Blackdog.  The project had faced delays, including a court challenge by Mr Trump, who claimed the turbines would ruin the view from his golf course at Balmedie.  Speaking to the crowd gathered for an inauguration ceremony on the deck of the ferry, Ms Sturgeon added: \"I think it\u0027s fair to say it\u0027s had its opponents along the way.  \"But I hope what we\u0027re seeing today - and I\u0027m going to use this word deliberately - the beauty of what we\u0027re seeing today, will in time be capable of persuading even the sternest critic of this fantastic centre.\"  Ms Sturgeon and Vattenfall president Magnus Hall together pressed a button following a countdown to declare the EOWDC open.  Mr Hall said: \"The innovation we have implemented at the EOWDC - and will continue to demonstrate - will turbocharge the growth of a global, low-cost offshore wind industry. And in doing so, do much to secure a fossil fuel free future for us all.\"  Claire Mack, chief executive of Scottish Renewables, said: \"This project is significant on a global stage. The developments and research which are taking place in Aberdeen place Scotland at the very forefront of offshore wind innovation and cement the city\u0027s reputation as an energy powerhouse.  \"The supply chains which have come together on projects like the European Offshore Wind Deployment Centre, and others including Beatrice and Moray East further north, are already revitalising coastal communities.  \"With 25% of Europe\u0027s offshore wind resource, the deployment of technology like these turbines - the most powerful in the world - presents an enormous opportunity for Scotland.\""},{"url":null,"title":"unspun-the-political-diary","story":"  NICOLA Sturgeon was keen to plug her latest economic wheeze in Tuesday\u0026rsquos programme for government.

Had the change been in place last month, it would have allowed the party to suspend Alex Salmond swiftly after it emerged he faced allegations of sexual misconduct related to 2013.  At the time, the SNP was under intense pressure to suspend the former First Minister, with last year\u0026rsquos suspension of former minister Mark McDonald cited as a precedent.  However Nicola Sturgeon said the SNP had \u0026ldquono legal basis to suspend Mr Salmond as the party had received no complaints about him and had therefore not investigated him.  But the new rules would allow for precautionary suspensions pending investigations.  The move flies in the face of recent criticism from Mr Salmond, who said when he resigned from the SNP that he had \u0026ldquoalways thought it a very poor idea to suspend any party member on the basis of complaints and allegations. Innocent until proven guilty is central to our concept of justice.  Mr Salmond denies criminality.  Under the existing constitution, the SNP National Secretary can only suspend members after concluding they have broken party rules.  But the new constitution says: \u0026ldquoThe National Secretary may suspend a member from exercising any or all rights of membership while investigations are being investigated and considered. In all cases where this action has been taken, the suspension will be regularly reviewed.  The proposed rules create a faster, more \u0026ldquoflexible punishment process.  At present, the party\u0026rsquos notoriously slow disciplinary process can only admonish, suspend or expel members.  In future, members could also have their party rights restricted, be forced to make \u0026ldquoappropriate restorative action, such as an apology, forced to \u0026ldquoundertake appropriate training, or be punished with \u0026ldquoany other proportionate sanction or requirement.  In his introduction to the proposals, National Secretary Angus MacLeod said they would see a \u0026ldquomodernising of our disciplinary processes with an enhanced approach on \u0026ldquobullying, harassment and social media use.  The proposed constitution also beefs up the SNP\u0026rsquos policy-making apparatus, which former deputy Jim Sillars and others have long complained is inadequate.  There would be a new Policy Development Convenor on the SNP\u0026rsquos ruling body, a Policy Development Committee, and members would be encouraged to \u0026ldquouse online forums for initiating policy discussions.

Only a tiny fraction join Britain at such an early age.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos why I want Scotland to join the majority of countries around the world. I want schools be able to change the way we teach children aged four and five.  \u0026ldquoWe should start formal schooling at six or even seven. I want children in Scotland to get the long-term educational benefits.  The call received a mixed reaction from other parties. The Tories noted there is \u0026ldquointeresting international evidence which points to very successful education systems with a later start than is the case in Scotland.  But shadow education secretary Liz Smith said these nations \u0026ldquotend to have very different structures for both childcare and general taxation.  Scottish Greens education spokesman Ross Greer said the party had \u0026ldquolong believed formal education should start at seven, as it does in the countries which regularly top the global league tables for both education and child happiness.  Countries such as Finland, Estonia and Switzerland all have a kindergarten stage for three to seven-year-olds, with an emphasis on outdoor play and creativity.  However Eileen Prior, executive director of Connect \u0026ndash formerly the Scottish Parent Teacher Council \u0026ndash warned introducing such a system in Scotland would be a massive logistic challenge.  She said: \u0026ldquoChange is not easy for anyone, and I think we can see that \u0026ndash some of the changes in our education system have been very difficult.  The EIS, Scotland\u0027s largest teaching union, said it was currently investigating the \"opportunities and challenges\" associated with changing the school starting age.  A spokesman added: \u0026ldquoOther countries whose children start school later have universal pre-school provision, something we don\u0026rsquot have in this country.\"  Mr Rennie will use today\u0027s conference address in Dunfermline to attack Scottish national standardised assessments, which have been criticised by teachers.  He will say the LibDems would back parents and staff who boycott the literacy and numeracy tests, aimed at helping teachers judge a child\u0027s progress.  Mr Swinney announced changes to assessments last month after hearing feedback, but opposition parties want them scrapped.  Mr Rennie will say: \"International evidence shows that the under-sevens need a play-based approach to learning with plenty of opportunities for active, outdoor, social, self-directed play.  \"National testing, especially for five-year-old primary ones, pulls Scottish education in exactly the opposite direction.\"  He will warn the minority SNP Government that opposition parties would defeat it in a vote against the tests, adding: \"At that point if the pupils, parents and teachers boycott these tests, we will stand with them.  A spokesman for Mr Swinney said: \u0026ldquoThis is deeply irresponsible from Willie Rennie. For the sake of a cheap party conference speech line, he wants to threaten the future of children\u0026rsquos education. That is reprehensible, even for the Lib Dems.  \u0026ldquoSchool assessments have been used in Scotland for years. Twenty-nine of Scotland\u0026rsquos thirty-two councils had them before the national scheme was introduced \u0026ndash including many Lib Dem-run councils \u0026ndash and, unlike the new scheme, the majority assessed P1 pupils twice.  \u0026ldquoThroughout that time we didn\u0026rsquot hear a peep from Willie Rennie. It would appear he only discovered he was against school assessments when a new version was introduced by the SNP Government. This is perhaps the worst example of Lib Dem hypocrisy we have seen in recent times."},{"url":null,"title":"snp-ministers-signal-crackdown-on-designer-dogs","story":"  It comes amid increasing demand for puppies in Scotland, with between 70,000 and 190,000 sold every year.  A new consultation proposes a number of changes to the licensing system to protect pets.  Plans include making it more flexible while also imposing tighter rules over how cats, dogs and rabbits are bred.  Ministers want to \u0026ldquocounteract the market incentive towards designer dogs and other pets which are deliberately bred to exaggerate certain features \u0026ndash such as short noses or long ears.  Such breeding \u0026ldquoheightens the risk of harmful genetic conditions and can seriously affect the future health and wellbeing of the animal, the consultation says.  It suggests prohibiting \u0026ldquoany breeding practices which are likely to cause the offspring suffering in later life as a condition of licensing.  Breeds particularly at risk of health problems include pugs, bloodhounds and bulldogs.  Rural affairs minister Mairi Gougeon said: \u0026ldquoThe high demand for particular breeds and \u0026ldquodesigner pets means irresponsible breeders use harmful practices, leading to genetic conditions which seriously affect the future health and wellbeing of these animals, as well as causing distress and veterinary treatment costs for owners.  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government believes that irresponsible breeders should be more accountable for their actions, so we will be looking to deter these practices through new licensing conditions, whilst encouraging responsible breeders to continue to follow good breeding practices.  \u0026ldquoWe will also be raising public awareness of the problems that irresponsible breeding can create.  \u0026ldquoUltimately we want a modern licensing system in Scotland to improve conditions for these animals."},{"url":null,"title":"celtic-orders-independent-review-after-crush-before-old-firm-game","story":"  Five people needed medical treatment following the incident in Janefield Street at Parkhead before Sunday\u0026rsquos match against Rangers as fans tried to get into the stadium before kick-off.

The University of Glasgow graduate has been chosen as the recipient of a Breakthrough Prize four decades after the same discovery earned her male collaborator a Nobel Prize, but controversially left her uncredited.  Now Dame Jocelyn wants to use the award money to challenge \u0026ldquounconscious bias in science by funding a scholarship for female and minority students to become physics researchers.  She said: \u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot want or need the money myself and it seemed to me that this was perhaps the best use I could put to.  \u0026ldquoThose are the people that tend to be discriminated against through unconscious bias, so I think that\u0026rsquos maybe one of the reasons why there aren\u0026rsquot so many. If they come with some funding with them, then they look much more attractive.  Born in Lurgan, Northern Ireland, Dame Jocelyn\u0026rsquos scientific career began in Glasgow in the 1960s.  She graduated with honours in physics from the University of Glasgow in 1965, before moving on to Cambridge where she made the ground-breaking discovery.  While poring over data from a new radio telescope she helped build, Dame Jocelyn spotted a faint and unusual signal: repeating pulses of radio waves.  She was able to characterise the signal and show it originated from space, eventually identifying it as a rapidly spinning neutron star.  Despite her achievement, Dame Jocelyn previously admitted to feeling like an imposter, revealing that she felt as if the university had \u0026ldquomade a mistake admitting her.  Edward Witten, chairman of the Breakthrough Prize\u0026rsquos selection committee, said: \u0026ldquoJocelyn Bell Burnell\u0026rsquos discovery of pulsars will always stand as one of the great surprises in the history of astronomy.  \u0026ldquoUntil that moment, no-one had any real idea how neutron stars could be observed, if indeed they existed.  Dame Jocelyn will be handed the Breakthrough Prize at a star-studded ceremony in the US in November, 50 years after the discovery. Previous winners include Stephen Hawking and seven scientists behind the discovery of the Higgs boson subatomic particle.  The award also recognises Dame Jocelyn\u0026rsquos scientific leadership. A role model and champion for young students, especially women in science, she has remained immersed in astronomy work, championing science, education and the Stem curriculum.  She was the first female president of the Institute of Physics and the Royal Society of Edinburgh and is currently a visiting professor of astrophysics at the University of Oxford.  This year Bell Burnell was named Chancellor of the University of Dundee after receiving an honourary degree from the institution in 2017. She was also the recipient of an honorary scientific doctorate from the University of Glasgow in the late 90s.  Professor Dame Julia Higgins, president of the Institute of Physics, said: \u0026ldquoThis is an excellent and hugely appropriate acknowledgement of Jocelyn\u0026rsquos work. Her discovery of pulsars still stands as one of the most significant discoveries in physics and inspires scientists the world over.  \u0026ldquoHer example of using insight and tenacity to make a discovery that rings through the ages stands her alongside the greatest of scientists.  \u0026ldquoAlongside her scientific achievement, Jocelyn has become a hugely respected leader in the scientific community. She has been instrumental in making sure the issue of access to science by people from under-represented groups is at the very top of the science community\u0026rsquos agenda.  While the Nobel Prize win left Bell Burnell uncredited for the achievement for most of her career, the scientist is not embittered.  She said: \u0026ldquoI feel I\u0026rsquove done very well out of not getting a Nobel Prize. If you get a Nobel Prize you have this fantastic week and then nobody gives you anything else.  \u0026ldquoIf you don\u0026rsquot get a Nobel Prize, you get everything that moves.

To deal with the potential of a rush to experience the new \u0026pound80m museum, Dundee V\u0026ampA have issued free tickets to the first people who will see inside the Kengo Kuma-designed building.  The opening weekend, on Saturday 15 and Sunday 16 saw around 6,000 tickets have been issued for the first weekend of the museum\u0026rsquos life.  Without one, you will not be able to enter.  A spokeswoman for the museum said that the system had been designed to allow the first visitors to the museum the \"best experience possible\", without long queues or crowds.  After the opening weekend, the V\u0026ampA will be free to enter for all, although its special exhibitions will still have charges.  Visitors to Dundee on the opening weekend will be able to see the 3D festival, which is accompanying the formal opening.  The festival, which takes place on 14 and 15 September, has a capacity for 20,000 people.  Again, ticketed Friday event is sold-out, however, the non-ticketed Saturday 15 event is not.

What do you get when you pour boiling water over a Dundonian? A new flavour of pot noodle .  And it wasn\u0026rsquot just outsiders taking the proverbial. Even for generations of Dundonians, the city\u0026rsquos biggest critics tended to be Dundonians themselves.  This is, in part, explained by the multiple body blows suffered by the city\u0027s economy, including the demise of two of the much-vaunted three Js jam making and jute spinning. The third of the city\u0027s iconic trio, journalism, appears to be in rude enough health.  Dundee jute may have covered the wagon trains that colonised most of America but even slave wages in the city mills couldn\u0026rsquot withstand Calcutta\u0026rsquos challenge for the title jutopolis. And with that industry in decline, the days of Dundee\u0026rsquos whaling fleet \u0026ndash whale oil was used to soften the fibrous raw material \u0026ndash was also numbered.  More recently, other totemic employers like cash machine makers NCR have embarked on cataclysmic downsizing, while others like Levi jeans, watchmakers Timex and shipbuilding went the way of the dodo.  Some of the wounds have been more self-inflicted, like short-sighted insistence over a single trades union deal that killed car giant Ford\u0026rsquos plan to build a components factory in the 80s, depriving the city of scarce manufacturing jobs.  And never forget the blatant acts of civic destruction \u0026ndash fuelled by wanton corruption \u0026ndash perpetrated in the middle decades of last century. Where Edinburgh protected the old town and Glasgow maintained many facades of its grandest architecture, Dundee\u0026rsquos city fathers levelled so many buildings of character amid infamous brown envelope scandals.  Imagine, if you will, going back in time and taking a daunder for a mile or two down the old Wellgate steps, along the Murraygate, on to the Overgate, up the Blackie  and doon the Hackie . If you\u0026rsquove seen the Harry Potter movies, you\u0026rsquove just walked through Diagon Alley. Yes, the frontage of old Dundee was so inspiringly quaint that Warner Brothers built a theme park in its image.  Considering all that and more, it\u0026rsquos forgivable the city suffered a crisis of confidence.  But that was then, this is now and Dundonians have discovered a confident swagger. There is much to be optimistic about. Dundee is obscenely youthful. It has one of the highest student ratios of any British city, thanks to its two universities.  It\u0026rsquos at the forefront of the gaming industry and, with a fair wind, the ground-breaking research in the city\u0026rsquos life sciences sector may provide humanity with a cure for, amongst other things, cancer.  Dundee and its people are friendly and welcoming and the city boasts the finest riverfront in Britain.  To appreciate what city living has to offer, take a trip to the top of The Law, the conical hill that dominates the skyline. Look north to the Sidlaws, the range of hills that stand sentinel over the city. Just beyond are the beautiful Angus Glens and the winter playgrounds of The Cairngorms.  Look to the east and bask in the full majesty of the Tay estuary, flanked on opposite banks by Carnoustie\u0026rsquos golf course at Barry Links and the Fife nature reserve of Tentsmuir and Kinshaldy Beach. A trip to Broughty Ferry, just 10 minutes by car from the centre, might reward you with the sight of bottlenose dolphins and seals at play in the surf. If not, console yourself with a pint in many of the welcoming howfs .  If you\u0026rsquore atop The Law in the evening, cast your gaze west for breathtaking sunsets that blaze like a furnace over the platinum and gold of the River Tay as it meanders through the Carse of Gowrie and Perthshire. Dundee is blessed with the most yearly hours of sunshine of any British city. Sunny Dee, indeed.  Now look due south to Fife. St Andrews is 14 miles away straight across the road bridge and the East Neuk villages of Crail and Anstruther another 10 miles or so further.  Look right and witness, between the spans of the rail bridge, the broken-tooth pillars of the ill-fated first bridge, a bleak testament to that catastrophic storm 140 years ago next year.  Now look down. Spread before you nestles the city centre, not the one devastated by the myopic corruption of last century where the town was cut off from its riverside heritage.  Gone is the high-rise concrete monstrosity of Tayside House, the 18-story brutalist council HQ. In it\u0026rsquos place are up-market hotels, thronging pubs, restaurants, wine bars and civic spaces for open air events.  And at its centre the V\u0026ampA, the catalyst for transformation in this \u0026pound1billion Waterfront Project.  That a city so crippled by low self-esteem has been pulling itself up by the bootstraps long before the V\u0026ampA opens gives me great confidence this is merely another step on the road of Dundee\u0026rsquos revival.  The city\u0026rsquos rich heritage is being combined with stimulating, contagious optimism. Dundee\u0026rsquos swagger is as tangible as the concrete walls forming the museum\u0026rsquos already iconic building.  A significant nod to that heritage sits alongside the V\u0026ampA. The RRS Discovery, the ship Captain Scott sailed to the Antarctic, is docked just a few hundred yards from where she was first launched in 1901.  I left the City of Discovery more years ago than I care to count and absence makes the heart grow fonder but one of the best things about living away is returning home to witness this reawakening.  It has taken too long but finally Dundonians are rediscovering what I have been preaching for years: Our home town is pretty damn special.  So I say it loud: I\u0026rsquom Dundonian and proud."},{"url":null,"title":"lord-foulkes-peoples-vote-on-leaving-eu-must-include-youngsters-aged-16-to-17","story":"  It will of course will sting for those of us, like me, want to remain.

That is without doubt the most important reason that I am raising the fact in the Lords at Question Time, that there are nearly a million and a half people who have attained the age of 18 who were not able to vote in the 2016 referendum.

Then in a desperate bid to shore up his position in the tory party, to bring the warring sides together, he stakes his credibility on a Remain vote in the EU referendum, arrogantly thinking the result would be a sure thing.  Anyone who watched his ashen faced resignation in the days that will follow now know how very wrong he and his cohorts were.  The difference in this misguided vote, however, was the way it was conducted.  In Scotland the franchise included 16 \u0026amp 17-year olds, EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens overseas.  It meant every adult who would be affected by the result had a vote.  In contrast EU citizens in the UK, who contribute to our economy with their taxes, industry and friendships, and UK citizens overseas whose lives will be more affected by the decision to leave the EU than the rest of us, were denied a vote.  The greatest injustice was the refusal to extend the franchise to 16 \u0026amp 17-year olds, who will be affected by the disaster of leaving the EU for far longer than those of us in our 70\u0026rsquos.  In their stage fright, their battle to remain in power, the Government chose what was an advisory result as a demand and instruction from the public. The consequences of pending job losses, cracks in industry, investors moving elsewhere, a possible new migration of people away from these shores leaving huge voids behind, is all too real.  Parliament would normally decide such a fate.

What options would be put to the people? I will strongly argue that we should be allowed to vote on an option to Remain in the EU. Whether that is against a deal or no deal remains to be seen.

Only this time, all those with an interest, would have a final and informed say on the matter without the scaremongering and underhand tactics and interference that went on before.

Nick said he would be eternally grateful to his donor and their family for giving him a new life.      \t                                                             Nick , from Echt, explained: “Philippa and I had been out in Pitlochry during the day and went back to the hotel for a meal. I’d put my phone on silent and forgot to turn it back on.                                                    “So they called Philippa and said I needed to get to the hospital in Edinburgh.        “My brothers said they were going to wind me up on our wedding day or honeymoon so I thought they were just kidding on.“But when I checked my phone, I had a lot of missed calls from a mobile number.                                       \t      \t\tWe Need Everybody...is the message from Organ Donation Scotland during Organ Donation Week 2018, from September 2 to September 9. The campaign is being fronted by ordinary Scots, like Gordon Hutchinson who underwent a life-saving transplant, aged just 13.      \t         “I called and was told I needed to get down to Edinburgh right away.”It was a call Nick had waited two and a half years to receive. He was born with a kidney condition that meant neither of his organs worked properly.                                                                                                         He underwent surgery at 18 months old and then went for regular checkups to monitor how his kidneys were functioning.  At a routine appointment in October 2014, doctors delivered the news that his kidneys were failing and Nick started dialysis shortly after.He said: “I’d lived with the condition all my life so hearing that I’d need treatment was a shock. “The doctor told me I’d be lucky to make it to Christmas without being on dialysis but I held on until February 2015.                                                                                                        “By the time I went on dialysis, my kidney function had dropped to eight per cent. I thought I was okay but looking back I was constantly tired and agitated. Things were a bit of a struggle.”Nick was determined the dialysis would not take over his life and kept working throughout.He said: “I was team leader at that time for an oil company – in charge of the onshore group.“I was determined to keep on working and have as normal a life as possible but it meant doing dialysis every night after work.“I’d leave home at 7am and not get back until 10pm or 10.30pm every day                                                                                                         “Dialysis was hard. I felt like my life had been put on hold but I knew the treatment was the only thing keeping me alive. “Some days were better than others the staff at the hospital got me through some difficult times.”Despite that, Nick decided to propose to Philippa and booked the wedding at the Winter Gardens in the hope she would say yes.“I left flowers by the kettle one night – happily she said yes,” said Nick.“We’d been together for ten years and she saw me through everything.“She had to put up with an awful lot – the mood swings, not going out because I was too tired all the time – but she still said yes.”The couple got married last August and were on honeymoon when Nick got the call that would transform their lives.He said: “I was really lucky – I was only on the transplant list for two and a half years.“But I didn’t get my hopes up too much until I was taken down to theatre and knew it was going to happen.“I was building myself up for disappointment until that point. It was a really surreal experience.”Happily, the transplant went ahead and Nick woke up to a whole new life.“As soon as I woke up from surgery I instantly felt better,” he said. “Nothing could have prepared me for the difference it made.  “I’d just got married and then I got the gift that I’d waited over two years for.  “To have a life free from dialysis was the best feeling and I felt amazing. I didn’t realise how ill I’d been until I had the transplant and started to feel 100 times better. It was fantastic.”Nick, an electrician by trade, has made the most of his donor’s incredible gift – enjoying life to the full and setting up his own business.He said: “It was something I always wanted to do but would never have been able to achieve on dialysis.“I now have my own electrical business and am working all over Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire.“It’s made a massive difference to Philippa and me too – we can go out and enjoy ourselves now. It’s nice to have that freedom it’s a new life basically.”As for his donor’s family, Nick has written a letter thanking them for his gift.He said: “I know nothing about the person who made my transplant possible but I owe them everything. “They saved my life and are truly my hero. I want their family to know I will be eternally grateful for this incredible gift.”Nick is already on the organ donor register and hopes his story will encourage others to sign up.He added: “It’s quite possibly the most important thing anyone can ever do.”To join the NHS Organ Donor Register, visit weneedeverybody.org                "},{"url":null,"title":"scottish tradesmen it s your call to help children","story":"        Protecting children does not just fall to the police, social workers and professionals who work with them.

We would ask them to look at it from the child’s point of view – or their own child’s.                                                                                                        “The police and children’s services are not in the business of getting involved, willy-nilly, when they don’t need to.“In the vast majority of cases, children are not removed from their homes but their families do get the help and support they need.“Often, parents have their own pressures and have lost sight of their child’s needs.“They’re overwhelmed with their own difficulties and have a strong instinct against asking for help.“It’s very often a burden that is lifted when they get a chance to talk about something they have been struggling with on their own for far too long.”                                                                                                        On the flip side of that coin are children who are in imminent danger.NSPCC Scotland asks the public to call its helpline – 0808 800 5000 – or the police immediately in the worst case scenarios.Last year in Scotland, the NSPCC’s helpline referred 2012 calls and emails to local agencies such as the police or children’s services.The majority were from people who were concerned a child was being neglected  followed by concerns about physical abuse , emotional abuse  and sexual abuse .Matt said: “There has been increased traffic to our helpline.“People are often unsure whether to report something – they really struggle with it.“By calling the helpline, they can talk through their concerns and decide whether it’s something that needs to be taken forward.“Our advice would be for people to consider if it was their child in that situation – better safe, than sorry.”As the NSPCC relies on donations from the public to deliver its services in Scotland, the It’s Your Call online course does cost £19 for individual tradesmen, with package deals also available for employers.But Matt is hopeful that it will become a success.He said: “It’s very early days for the It’s Your Call training but we are hoping individuals and employers will take it up.“We are not funded by the government – we raise all our own funding – so a fee is involved to cover the cost of delivering the training. “But we hope people will agree it’s a small price to pay to help children who are potentially being abused or neglected.“It’s about helping to give children a voice when they can’t speak out themselves.”NSPCC Scotland prides itself on providing a voice for children but is also keen that young people, of all ages, are able to make their own voices heard too.The charity holds special Speak Out, Stay Safe assemblies at primary schools in every local authority area in Scotland with that aim in mind.Matt added: “We help children understand what abuse is and what to do if they are affected.“We then go back two weeks later to find out what the children made of it and reinforce the message. “Children often come to Childline when they are aged 12 and above, talking about things that have happened to them for years.“So we wanted to deliver a programme for primary schools in the hope that children would start reporting issues earlier.“Teachers have been very positive about the programme as it’s a topic they often struggle with too.” The NSPCC is the leading children’s charity fighting to end child abuse and protect children at risk in the UK and Channel Islands. Voluntary donations make up around 90 per cent of its funding.Childline open 24 hours a dayThe NSPCC’s Childline service has two bases in Scotland, in Aberdeen and Glasgow.In 2017/18, Childline volunteers delivered almost 280,000 counselling sessions to children and young people across the UK on the phone and online. Based on the population of Aberdeenshire, it is estimated that volunteers delivered around 1800 counselling sessions to children living in that area last year alone.Some of them are going through the toughest times of their lives. They face issues such as mental/emotional health, family relationships and bullying. So it’s vital that they have somewhere to turn. Childline – 0800 11 11 and www.childline.org.uk – is there for them 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.On average, a child somewhere in the UK contacts Childline every 25 seconds.NSPCC Scotland’s Speak Out Stay Safe  service, which helps children learn how to recognise abuse, has now been delivered in the majority of our mainstream primary schools.Sadly, in the average primary school class, at least two children have suffered abuse or neglect.Just £4 pays for a child’s call or contact with Childline and £3 pays for the SOSS programme to reach a child. But the NSPCC relies on donations from the public to provide its services across the UK and volunteers to help deliver them.To find out how you can help the charity or to make a donation, visit the website https:www.nspcc.org.uk/what-you-can-do.

Peter Chapman has said that calls are being diverted from the Rural Payment and Inspection Division  office telephone line at Thainstone, Inverurie, to Elgin.                                                    This has led to delays while calls are then transferred back to Inverurie or problems for farmers getting through at all as the lines are too busy.                                                    Mr Chapman was contacted by a constituent in Aberdeenshire who has expressed his frustration at the problem.        It is understood that the fault relates to a fallen phone line near Thainstone.The rural payment offices provide information to farmers about application forms that need to be filled in for grants and payments to meet strict deadlines.Peter Chapman, Scottish Conservative MSP for the north-east region, said: “I was contacted by a farmer constituent of mine who has raised concerns about this problem, which has been going on for nearly a month.“This is causing problems both for local farmers and for the Elgin office, which I gather is being inundated with calls.                                                                                                        “Farmers are being kept waiting for long periods of time to be connected, while staff in Elgin do not know if those in Inverurie are present to deal with the call.“It is important that people can reach their local office as quickly as possible, as very often application forms are subject to strict deadlines.“I have written to the Rural Economy Secretary seeking some information on when this issue will be resolved and also some assurance that the Scottish Government is making sure the Thainstone office can accept local calls.”                                                                    "},{"url":null,"title":"play facilities to be installed at kingseat","story":"        A long running planning related issue at a residential development on the site of the former Kingseat Hospital, near Newmachar will be resolved next week.                Aberdeenshire Council will carry out work to form a community park and install play equipment, after the initial developer of the site, Avant Homes, failed to install the facilities as required.                                                     The work had been a condition of the planning permission agreed for the site and late last year the council served planning enforcement notices to try to get the work moving.                                                     Other than preliminary works there has been no significant progress from the developer or landowner, so the council will begin work on site from Monday  to deliver the park and play area and seek to recoup the cost.         The lack of community facilities at Kingseat has been an ongoing concern for the local community and Councillors for a number of years.The enforcement notices were served in connection with two breaches of planning control, relating to the storage of spoil/materials and the lack of a play park. The focus is on a fenced-off central area of the site where there was previously a bowling green and open space area within the former hospital complex. This was intended to form part of the open space/facilities for residents within the completed development. Avant Homes had 12 weeks from October 20, 2017 to clear the spoil storage area and create a new open space area, including play equipment.                                                                                                         The notices were not appealed by the developer and the period for compliance expired on February 12.Since then the site has changed ownership to ZTR Investments and Aberdeenshire Council gave the new owners time to comply with the notices, while making alternative arrangements. Aberdeenshire Council’s Head of Planning, Robert Gray, said: “Although some preliminary clearing work was undertaken by the new owners there has been no significant progress in forming the park or installing the play equipment. As such the Council has appointed contractors to complete the works. “The site owners, Kingseat Community Association, Newmachar Community Council and immediate neighbours to the development area have been formally notified of the start date.                                                                                                        “This is the first element of an attempt to facilitate completion of the wider development at Kingseat and deliver some much-needed community facilities for the residents.”The work is expected to take up to 60 days to complete, depending on weather conditions.

A language that official bodies such as the UNESCO insist has been dead since the 1800\u0026rsquos.\u0026ldquoIt wouldn\u0026rsquot be the first time UNESCO has prematurely pronounced a language as dead. Back in 2009 UNESCO declared Manx extinct despite there being over 1500 speakers of Manx.\u0026ldquoUNESCO was forced to change its classification of Manx from \u0026ldquoExtinct to \u0026lsquoEndangered\u0026rsquo after a group of school children wrote to them in Manx asking what language they were writing in if Manx didn\u0026rsquot exist.\u0026ldquoThe more people I talked to the more I came to find that Norn isn\u0026rsquot dead, it has just become lost in our English. When I gave people examples they shrugged them off as \u0026lsquoCaithness Words\u0026rsquo but it is so much more than that it is \u0026lsquoCaithness language\u0026rsquo if only we put our minds and our hearts to it.With her Norn Min series workbooks Grace Hall is spreading the Norn language both within Caithness and outside of the region as well.She added: \u0026ldquoThe Norn Min series has three workbooks published and another two in the pipeline. Copies of the series have sold as far away as America and Sweden.\u0026ldquoIt was just after the publication of Norn Min buk two that I received an email from the University of Bari in Italy as their Minority Languages department was interested in Norn.\u0026ldquoThey asked if they could use the Norn Min series to create an Italian-Norn phrasebook. A week later I was contacted by the World Children\u0026rsquos Book project and they offered me a contract to translate five of their books into Norn.The World Children\u0026rsquos Book project has over 200 translators making their bilingual books available in languages traditional publishes ignore such as English Igbo in Nigeria, German/Tigrinya in Ethiopia and now English/Norn in Scotland.Copies of both the workbooks and storybooks are available at John O\u0026rsquoGroats and Caithness Horizons.\u0026nbspSaturday 8 Sep 2018 9:01 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"BT exchange gets the bird","story":"CONCERNS have been raised by an animal charity after a number of birds became strangled in roof netting in Wick.An angry reader has claimed that the birds included seagulls, crows, blackbirds and pigeons, all of which found themselves trapped on top of the BT exchange in Union Street.The netting is said to be on the building for \u0026ldquosafety reasons \u0026ndash but, as the picture the reader provided shows, it doesn\u0026rsquot appear to do much for the welfare of those trapped in it.The reader, who did not wish to be named, has said that both BT and animal protection charity the SSPCA have been contacted to see what can be done \u0026ndash \u0026ldquobut to no avail \u0026ndash and is appealing to them to do something before more bird injuries and deaths occur.\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove tried calling them but nothing seems to be done, the reader said.\u0026ldquoOver the year I\u0026rsquove seen around eight birds \u0026ndash seagulls, pigeons, blackbirds and crows \u0026ndash trapped on the roof netting of the BT building on Union Street.

My organisation, Walking to Save Dogs, raises funds to support carefully selected local shelters and projects that rescue dogs from these Festivals and the meat trade.\u0026ldquoThe ultimate goal is to put an end to the dog-meat trade through education that dogs are sentient beings, changing legislation, and providing dog-meat traders with alternative means to support their families.Robert aims to reach John O\u0026rsquoGroats by September 18, although he has already lost one of his canine companions.He added: \u0026ldquoSadly, Madeleine recently developed an eye problem so has gracefully pawed out.\u0026ldquoShe continues to support the rest of the pack from a comfy armchair at home.\u0026ldquoMy pets are the voice of millions of less fortunate dogs.\u0026ldquoThey have been well-prepared for this task and they love the outdoors.\u0026ldquoWe have been walking 12 miles a day on average and hope to finish our walk within a couple of weeks.\u0026ldquoI am touched beyond words at the kindness and generosity of the Scottish people I have met along the trail and look forward to meeting lots more on the way to John O\u0026rsquoGroats.To follow Robert\u0026rsquos progress and to donate, go to: www.walkingtosavedogs or www.justgiving/crowdfunding/walkingtosavedogsSaturday 8 Sep 2018 9:01 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"High success rate for Wick school leavers","story":"WICK High has been praised for how they prepare their pupils for the adult world once they leave school.A report from the director of education, presented by Alison Donald, education quality improvement manager for the north, showed that leavers from the school had made considerable progress with a large number going onto positive destinations.These include universities, higher education colleges and full-time employment.The breakdown of positive destinations showed that54.4 per cent of pupils going on to higher and further Edu-cation in 2014/15 had now increased over two years to 60.6 per cent.On top of that, nearly10 per cent of pupils becoming unemployed either seeking or not seeking employment in 2014/15 had fallen to less than one per cent in 2016/17.Local councillors have welcomed the report\u0026rsquos findings and have praised the school for helping pupils embark on a positive course when they leave.Councillor Raymond Bremner said: \u0026ldquoIt is absolutely fantastic to see that in two years of performance analysis in respect of pupils going on to positive destinations from Wick High School.\u0026ldquoThis surely has to be one of the best improvement increases in the Highlands, if not the country and you cannot help but be extremely proud of this on behalf of the school.\u0026ldquoThe figures detailing the types of destination our pupils from Wick High School are going to are also hugely encouraging.

Local resident and self-professed \u0026ldquoTrinkie lover Bryan Newlands welcomed the group\u0026rsquos formation, underlining that the pool harboured a lot of memories. \u0026ldquoI used to go there a lot... Even though I lived on the other side of town, every summer myself and a friend would go \u0026ndash even when it was raining, he said. \u0026ldquoIt was a great place as the town didn\u0026rsquot have an indoor swimming pool until 1994. Many people learned to swim at the Trinkie.While a slideshow showed images of how the pool used to look and how much Wickers got from it, other more contemporary images show a dilapidated ruin \u0026ndash a far cry from the hustle, bustle and smiles of yesteryear.The new group was formed with a mission to \u0026ldquobring the pool back to life and a number of office-bearers were proposed and elected.James Bremner was elected chairman with other roles going to William Macdonald , Catherine Patterson  and Garance Warburton .Seven committee members were also elected: Fiona Bremner, Trudi Mcalpine, Davina Lyall, Fiona McPhee, Leslie Grant, Roddy Mackay and Councillor Willie Mackay.Ms Patterson underlined that it was going to be no easy fix as \u0026ldquothere are holes in the wall at the deep end, which also has cracks that go right down to the ground.\u0026ldquoThe previous group... had the holes patched up, but they kept reappearing, she said. \u0026ldquoThe wall itself is also crumbling and the bridge that divides the deep and shallow ends has had its fixtures corroded. Also the south access road that leads the public to the pool is in poor nick.She stressed that volunteers to patch things up and general goodwill is always welcome, \u0026ldquobut [often] their help only scratches the surface of what needs to be done.She added: \u0026ldquoMajor investment is needed along with a report from a structural engineer to see how much damage there is, what can and cannot be done, and to get an estimate of how much the restoration will cost.Mr Newlands \u0026ndash committee member Ms Lyall\u0026rsquos son \u0026ndash stressed that the Trinkie added tremendous character to Wick.\u0026ldquoPut it this way, with the summer we\u0026rsquove had, that pool would have been full had it been in use, he said.Other memories came from Wick Society chairman Iain Leith. \u0026ldquoGoing there was a popular pastime in its day with adults and kids from all over Pulteneytown flocking to it, he said.\u0026ldquoRestoring it could be a big boost to the town\u0026rsquos economy by making it a tourist attraction as well as giving back the town a much-loved landmark.Ms Patterson emphasised that the Trinkie had the potential to be an asset to both locals and tourists.\u0026ldquoBut we need investment because if nothing gets done the pool is on its way out.Saturday 8 Sep 2018 9:01 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117364.jpg","title":"New service gives job hunters a Fair Start","story":"\u0026nbspScottish Government ViewpointFAIR Start Scotland is the country\u0027s new devolved employment support service.It is focused on supporting unemployed people who have challenges in accessing the labour market for whom work is a realistic prospect.Launched in April, earlier this year, it is an example of one of the first uses of newly devolved powers under the 2016 Scotland Act.The service will run until 2023 and aims to provide tailored, flexible and person-centred support to at least 38,000 people across Scotland who want help to find work, and stay in work.Fair Start Scotland is distinctive in that participation is purely voluntary.This means that people have everything to gain and nothing to lose \u0026ndash choosing to participate will not affect existing benefits or be driven by fear of benefit sanctions.The service is delivered locally, meaning that no participants are left without the support they need.Delivery is over nine geographic areas including the Highlands and reflects local area economies, meeting the needs of employers, disabled people and those at risk of long-term unemployment.Jamie Hepburn, Minister for Business, Fair Work and Skills, said: \"What\u0027s crucial about Fair Start Scotland is that it treats people with fairness, dignity and respect and that it is focused on the needs of the individual.\"We are dedicated to delivering a high quality employment support service that will lead to real and sustained job outcomes and help people to achieve their full potential.\"As well as meeting the needs of unemployed people, Fair Start Scotland also seeks to help businesses find the skilled and committed employees they need to thrive.\"One of the many now benefitting is Highlander Alan Cairns .He has not worked for over a year and his biggest barriers to work have been low confidence and computer skills but now he has secured 16 hours of work per week.Alan started on the Fair Start Scotland service in the middle of May and has been attending the service for the past 12 weeks.

Like that earlier work, The Katanes Saga is told in an unpretentious, engaging, sometimes blokey style. From the drunken arguments to the devious plots to the mutilations and killings, Cassells tells it like it is.\u0026ldquoThe Raven Banner was basically a guide to Norse Caithness with a little bit about each area and what I thought were the main things that happened in Norse times, he explains. \u0026ldquoThe Katanes Saga is far more in-depth.\u0026ldquoThey were people like you and me. They had the same faults. You could meet three Vikings in the pub any night.\u0026ldquoOne word I would use to describe the Norse is pragmatic. They were really pragmatic people. If that\u0026rsquos the way it works, that\u0026rsquos the way it works \u0026ndash if it doesn\u0026rsquot, I\u0026rsquoll do it my way.\u0026ldquoI do mention that of all the Norse earls of Orkney only a handful actually died in their beds. Most suffered violent deaths. One was killed with contact poison from his own auntie and mother on a shirt.Cassells  is a retired Royal Mail manager who previously worked as a lighthouse keeper on Muckle Flugga and Stroma. Those experiences inspired two other books, No More Paraffin-Oilers and A Light Walk.The Katanes Saga sees him returning to a theme that first sparked his interest at an early age. Born in Barrow, he moved to Thurso in late 1950s when his father came to work at the Admiralty test establishment.\u0026ldquoI always liked Greek and Roman mythology and I started reading about Norse mythology as well, he recalls. \u0026ldquoAs a young boy I lived in Sweyn Road in Thurso and I wondered who Sweyn was. A pal of mine said, \u0026lsquoAch, that\u0026rsquoll be Sweyn the pirate.\u0026rsquo So for about a year I had this happy vision of a Pugwash-type character that the street was named after. I then discovered Sweyn Asleifarson.Swyen , iously described \u0026ldquothe last of the Vikings and \u0026ldquothe greatest troublemaker in the westernlands, had an estate at Duncansby and was renowned for raiding, plundering and pillaging. One of the many who suffered at his hands was Frakokk, who had featured in the poisoned-shirt incident: she was burned to death in her farmhouse at Helmsdale, along with other members of her faction, in a revenge attack led by Swyen.It\u0026rsquos an example of the way in which many of the strands are intertwined, as Cassells points out.\u0026ldquoI read the sagas and I started taking a look at place names, he says. \u0026ldquoFor a long time I lived at Scrabster \u0026ndash Skarabolstadr, the \u0026lsquohomestead of the sea-mews\u0026rsquo.\u0026ldquoAnd the stories were interesting to read. They were intriguing.\u0026ldquoYou try and unravel it and it\u0026rsquos just more or less two families feuding all the way through it. That goes right to the very last act of the local earl being knifed in a beer cellar in Thurso.One of the most shocking events is the burning to death of Bishop Adam by a mob in Halkirk in a dispute over a butter tax.\u0026ldquoHe got a bit greedy, Cassells says. \u0026ldquoThey complained to the earl at the time who more or less said, \u0026lsquoDamn the bishop, you can burn him as you please,\u0026rsquo so they took him at his word.\u0026ldquoBishops crop up a couple of times. There was lot of enmity between the local Norse earldom and the Scottish king over bishops. A bishop got his eyes put out in Scrabster.\u0026ldquoAfter the bishop was murdered at Halkirk, the Scottish king came up here and carried out what was, for want of a better description, pure genocide of the people from the Halkirk area. I believe they were all massacred round about where the Pennyland estate is now in Thurso. Hundreds of people were killed there.\u0026ldquoIn those days you just didn\u0026rsquot go burning bishops \u0026ndash they\u0026rsquore going to come down heavy on you.\u0026ldquoRavenshill Road used to be known as the Gallows Hill, before the atomic houses were built there, so that has been a place for judicial executions for quite a long time.From the machinations of the \u0026ldquofemme fatale Ragnhild at Murkle to the murder of Earl Rognvald at Forsie to the Battle of Clairdon Hill outside Thurso, the power struggles and manoeuvrings come thick and fast. It\u0026rsquos a rapid-fire history lesson, but more than anything Cassells simply wants people to enjoy the stories.\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a thing I never learned in school here. It was never mentioned, he says. \u0026ldquoThis is our own local history, and I just hope people think it\u0026rsquos a good read.The Katanes Saga  is self-published and is on sale in Caithness Horizons, newsagents in Thurso, and Wick Heritage Museum.Saturday 8 Sep 2018 9:01 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Open evening in Thurso for potential Childrens Panel members","story":"AN open evening is taking place next week with the aim of attracting volunteers for the Children\u0026rsquos Panel in Caithness.Tuesday\u0026rsquos event in Thurso will allow members of the public to find out how they can play a part in the children\u0026rsquos hearings system \u0026ndash helping others and giving something back to the community in the process.Volunteers from all walks of life make life-changing decisions that create a difference in the lives of many, and this is very true for children, young people and families in Caithness and across Scotland within the children\u0026rsquos hearing system.It relies on the voluntary involvement of around 2500 people who are willing and able to give their time and commitment to serve as Children\u0026rsquos Panel members.A number of agencies work together with the system to deliver protection, care and support to families, children and young people.

Brian, who was awarded a British Empire Medal in June this year in recognition of his services to military history in Orkney said: “Many people have dedicated time and energy to gathering photos over a period of 20 years or more and would like to see the collection completed as far as possible for the centenary of the Armistice on 11 November this year.“Having a nearly complete set of images of all the Orcadians lost would be a most poignant way for our community to mark this anniversary and a wonderful resource for future generations.”It’s believed 578 Orcadians died serving in the Great War and the Legion’s collection, available to view on their website, contains photos of just over half — 297 — of those lost.The council’s call comes as part of Orkney’s First World War commemoration programme, which is being coordinated by the council with invaluable contributions and support from local organisations community groups and individuals.As part of a series of events, on November 11, Orkney will participate in a national commemorative event that involves as many photos of local lives lost in the war as can be found and the participation of their families, a further reason for trying to complete the collection.Lucy Gibbon from the council’s Library and Archive service said there may well be much sought-after photos in people’s attics and family memorabilia collections: “Whilst very few people had a camera during the Great War, nearly all towns had photo studios. Most servicemen visited one of these while training in the UK.”“If you know you lost an Orcadian relative in the war, now is a great time to find out more about them. The Orkney Library \u0026amp Archive might have some items to help shed light on their story.”The Legion’s photo archive has been made possible thanks to the generosity and hard work of many — for example around half of the photos have been sourced from The Orcadian, which has published photos sent in by families in a feature called Our Roll of Honour during the Great War.Other notable contributors and donators over the years include Tom Gibson of Rousay, Beatrice Thomson of North Ronaldsay, Mabel Eunson of Deerness and the late Margaret Watters of Stenness, Bill Miller of Stronsay, Phyllis Gee of Flotta, and George Esson who spent two decades visiting families in South Ronaldsay and Burray seeking photos of loved ones lost in the war, and with the help of and David Mackie and Colin Rendall made copies for the Orkney Library and Archive.These and many more contributors are noted on the project’s website — where people can also view images in the collection by Parish and by significant battles.Anyone with photos they believe are not already included in the Legion’s collection is urged to contact Brian Budge on phone 01856 872225 and email brian.budge@btinternet or to drop into the Orkney Library and Archive in Kirkwall.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

share of a \u0026pound6500 prize pot. Finalists will also receive feedback from some of the region\u0026rsquos top entrepreneurs and business advisers on how to take their idea forward.Run by Create, the UHI\u0026rsquos Centre for Enterprise and Innovation, the competition is now in its 13th year and is open to all students studying at the UHI as well as non-students living in the Highlands and Islands, Moray and Perthshire.Last year the competition attracted more than 115 entries. This year the entries will be narrowed down to 15 finalists who will discuss their ideas with the judges at the finals day on November 22.Last year\u0026rsquos top prize went to former Inverness College UHI student Paul Beaulieu , from Milton, Invergordon, who took home a cash prize of \u0026pound1500 and a combined legal and accountancy package worth \u0026pound2000 for an idea that could revolutionise how pipes are fabricated and fitted together.Dr Carol Langston, head of Create, said: \"Often people have a business idea, but they don\u0026rsquot know what to do with it, or who to turn to for help. That\u0026rsquos where Create comes in.

When the kirk on the shores of Lochbroom was put up for sale by the Church of Scotland back in 2016, it\u0026rsquos future looked uncertain.A determined local fundraising drive saw it eventually taken into community ownership by locals who see it as a key hub in the beautiful, remote area.Celia said: \"We saw how well Donnie Mackenzie\u0026rsquos fundraiser for Clachan did and the huge boost it gave everyone involved. Sara and I thought we would enjoy getting fitter, seeing more of our country, and help Clachan at the same time. Since our local Trust became owners on June 22 we straightaway saw the difference it has made to our community. It has become a community focus right from the start.\"With the doors open more often we know there\u0026rsquos someone there and stop for a chat. For those of us living on the no-through road on the west shore of Loch Broom, we pass Clachan every time we go anywhere so it is ideal.\"\"When Clachan opened during the Lochbroom Sheepdog Trials, the trust displayed some local produce, from handloom weaving, cards, honey, handmade books and paintings, to show the range of economic activity in Lochbroom. That is the tip of the iceberg. There\u0026rsquos only a small population but there\u0026rsquos a huge number of people producing high-quality goods \u0026ndash having their work displayed in a public building helps everybody.\"Sara and I are confident that Clachan will be an asset to the Lochbroom community for many years to come so we are asking for sponsorship. This can be done at the New Broom hub in Ullapool and by emailing me at celiajcharity@me. Thank you.\"Kenneth Macleod, an interim trustee of Clachan Lochbroom Heritage Trust, said: \"I have seen the benefit that grows from rescuing a building, improving it and making it available for wider purposes. Of course Clachan continues for the usual church occasions \u0026ndash we want everyone to know that! \u0026ndash whilst extending its usefulness for other appropriate purposes.\"Saturday 8 Sep 2018 9:02 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Activist Ewan McRobert said there were four primary schools in the Aberdeen area that were in this position.            He spoke out as members at the party’s Scottish conference in Dunfermline overwhelmingly backed a motion demanding an independent review of  terms and conditions for the profession.

Some schools have languished without a headteacher for three years.”            He said that while Scottish teachers work “the second longest hours in the world” for the profession - behind only Colombia - a new teacher is paid 30% less than the average graduate salary of £30,000 a year.“That is why it is urgent we increase teachers’ pay,” he said.The Liberal Democrats are calling for an independent expert commission to review teachers’ terms and the demands placed upon them.• READ MORE: Nicola Sturgeon hints at defying parliament on P1 tests            Education spokesman Tavish Scott said: “Teachers have had a rotten deal over recent years.“They’ve been inundated with paperwork and diktats, lost thousands of teaching and pupil support colleagues, and been squeezed out of budgets.“This plan shows Scottish Liberal Democrats are committing to restore the status, strength and resilience of the teaching profession.“We’re bursting with good ideas to improve Scottish education, and the system is in sore need of them.“Teachers are the backbone of Scottish education and they ought to command the pay and conditions to reflect that.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4796826.1536334175!/image/image.jpg","title":"john mclellan experts suggest scots workers are lions led by donkeys","story":"        We have the developed world\u0026#8217s most skilled workforce, but still the economy struggles and \u0026#8216low levels of management quality\u0026#8217 could be one reason why, writes John McLellan.                Without reading American author Arthur Herman’s bestseller “How the Scots Invented the Modern World”, most Scots are familiar with the gist even if it’s only from those “Wha’s like us?” tea-towels on sale in Royal Mile tourist traps.             Television, the telephone, the steam engine, the thermos flask, penicillin we can proudly roll off a long list of Scottish inventions and discoveries from the mid-18th Century onwards. More recently are Dolly the Sheep and the Higgs’ boson, work carried out at Edinburgh University although Doll’s creator Sir Ian Wilmut is from Warwickshire and Professor Peter Higgs a Geordie.             Historian Herman has no known connection to Scotland other than a fascination about how a poor country on the periphery of Europe managed to have such a significant impact on the development of the Western World.  Having four universities helped, but in a nutshell the foundations were laid after the Reformation by the development of universal public education through the Church of Scotland’s parish network, which meant that by the 18th Century the average Scot could read, write and count while the masses of most other European countries were largely illiterate. Political union in 1707, the end of over 100 years of internal religious and constitutional strife with the defeat of the 1745 Jacobite Rebellion, and the rapid expansion of the British Empire between 1714 and 1763 opened up global opportunities for the skills and knowledge Scots had in abundance.So what’s this got to do with today? The rest of the developed world caught up generations ago and far from being a global leader in education, year after year the Programme for International Student Assessment  has demonstrated a steady decline to the point now where Scotland is below international averages, particularly in science. The Scottish Household Survey published this week showed that satisfaction with local schools is down to 70 per cent, by some way the lowest since the data was first collected in 2007.Presenting her Programme for Government this week, First Minster Nicola Surgeon was once again at pains to emphasise the priority her administration puts on education and training. “Closing the attainment gap and raising standards in our schools remains the overriding mission of this government,” she said, knowing the data suggests the mission continues to prove stubbornly impossible.Her speech led with a focus on the economy, with a pledge to expand the modern apprenticeships scheme and produce a new skills action plan. The link between education and economic output was emphasised in this week’s “Wealth of the Nation” report from the David Hume Institute, which concluded that a prominent focus on skills was essential to kick-start a Scottish economy which had stalled for over a decade.            The report was produced in co-operation with Strathclyde University’s Fraser of Allander Institute and funded by the Scottish Policy Foundation which has former SNP deputy leader Angus Robertson on its advisory council.READ MORE: Report: Scotland’s productivity has ‘stalled’ in past 15 yearsThe paper shows that despite relatively low educational achievement, Scotland has the most skilled workforce of the developed countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. This suggests three possible explanations: maybe we are good at playing post-school catch-up in the workplace or in tertiary education perhaps we attract a lot of expertise from elsewhere, like Peter Higgs and Ian Wilmut and then there is David Hume director Jane-Frances Kelly’s view that skills are not being matched with opportunity.“Despite a skilled workforce and no shortage of strategies, Scotland’s productivity performance underperforms compared with many advanced economies,” she wrote. “While the Scottish workforce is well-educated, it is not clear we make the most of it, given our relatively low levels of management quality and our high concentration of small, lower-productivity firms,” she wrote.            Poor management quality rarely features in discussions about training, the focus usually being on school-leavers and graduates like this week’s Programme for Government. It implies that however effective our post-school training might be, it only goes so far, and indeed continuous professional development is too often seen not as a staff motivation and retention tool but at best a box-ticking exercise or at worst a costly way to enhance the prospects of key staff landing better jobs with rivals.That Scotland has a problem at management level was also illustrated by the Scottish Fiscal Commission’s report that tax receipts were £500m below target because the number of higher band tax-payers has been over-estimated.READ MORE: Nicola Sturgeon’s Programme for Government – everything you need to knowIt shouldn’t be a surprise that if educational attainment is proving hard to improve then the economy will be too, but the First Minster painted a different picture of Scotland’s economic performance. “Economic growth in Scotland over the past year has been higher than in the rest of the UK,” she said. “Exports of goods have increased by 12 per cent – the fastest growth of any UK nation.”Ms Sturgeon will be well aware of the international comparisons, and it would be too much to expect a focus on negatives in a speech designed to gee up the troops for the year ahead, but only making comparisons with the rest of the UK invites complacency. Similarly, at a local level in Edinburgh, the city council’s recently revived Edinburgh Economy Watch is a useful document for gauging progress against other UK cities but gives little indication about international competition.            On the other hand, the Hume report is all about global comparisons and the verdict is damning. “There has been little employment growth in our most productive industries,” it says. “Business investment is relatively low, as is research and development spending we export less than the EU and OECD averages, from a narrow base of industries and firms.”Ms Kelly offers no quick fixes, quite the opposite, but plenty of sage advice. A focus on evidence to understand the problem consensus and collaboration across political divides and political cycles, and a prominent focus on skills are but three. “The population of Scotland will need jobs, and that focusing on the drivers of productivity that increase people’s skills and access to jobs will also increase opportunity,” she said.Yet as Finance Secretary Derek Mackay scrambles to fill the £500k higher-band income tax hole, there is an increasingly vocal minority which challenges the need for growth and is dismissive of warnings about the effect of ramping up taxes on the better off. Some of them are in the City Chambers, where just across the High Street sits the statue of Adam Smith, the Kirkcaldy man who gave the world modern capitalism."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4797006.1536399992!/image/image.jpg","title":"snp gather in edinburgh to debate scottish independence plans","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...

Some of the themes could be, \u0026#8216What do you enjoy about Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What makes you proud of Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What is Shetland famous for?\u0026#8217.\u0026#8221\n Send any ideas, before Friday 6th July 2018, to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call  744490 or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.\n\u0026#8220This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People 2018.”\n\n\nAre they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be done\nI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of life or some other pointless title.\nOver the years art has very much lowered its standards significantly to make and justify it becoming more commercially viable\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called \u0026#8216 limited edition rubbish \u0026#8216.\nI would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.\nNo doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and life experience\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230..despite the fact everybody else looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.\nLove the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain  credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself  doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate   and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! .\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists  when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.  Go on David,since you are consumed with what is appropriate why not have a go yourself ?  You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.David Spence.   I’ll lend you a trowel to apply the “paint” provided that you are prepared to produce it \u0026#8230\u0026#8230.. on stage at Mareel perhaps. After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and if you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 22 ","story":"After being tasked with compiling a feature to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the senior football inter-county, it was a pleasure to speak to several of those with first-hand knowledge of the history of the Milne Cup competition.\nGeordie Hunter goes the furthest back, having made his debut in the 1953 game. On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois  Benjamin Pad , Raphaël Varane , Diego Godín , Ivan Strinic  Ivan Perisic , Luka Modric , Jordan Henderson , Eden Hazard  Cristiano Ronaldo , Edinson Cavani .\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent.

Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed, if anyone could hear what was being said, were on the lengthy side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.\nIt is rare enough for a local game to end 0-0, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.\nAstonishingly, Delting’s 4-1 triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers if I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds if difficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped diffuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"spurs lose tight highland amateur cup final ","story":"Lerwick Spurs have narrowly lost the Highland Amateur Cup final after taking the tie to extra-time with a late equaliser.\nThe isles side had gone a goal down to Pentland United \u0026#8211 the competition\u0026#8217s most successful team \u0026#8211 in the 18th minute.\nPentland looked set to secure their eight Highland Amateur Cup trophy until a stoppage time equaliser from Spurs brought the game to extra-time.\nThe Lerwick side found themselves 2-1 down in the 6th minute of extra-time and were unfortunately unable to bag an equaliser.\nSpurs won five games on their way to the final including a quarter-final success against 2017 champions Avoch.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"big turnout to welcome the eighth serene to whalsay ","story":"The latest Serene arrives at the pier at Symbister.

One of the main benefits of participating is to achieve Best Value in services delivered locally. The Partnership provides an invaluable forum where the partners can co-operate and get this assurance.\nReducing energy costs is just one way to tackle fuel poverty. The insulation and boiler scrappage schemes that local partners have lobbied for, and secured, have also had a positive impact.\nFuel poverty is measured as a percentage of household income so increasing wages can also help. We already have a number of Living Wage employers in Shetland from public agencies to small businesses.\nNobody has said that the named organisations are expected to create 800 jobs.

Proposed change will bring a greater number of properties into the protected area and, therefore, under stricter planning controls.\nHowever, Andrew Puls, Highland Council\u0027s principal officer for building conservation and environment, told local councillors meeting in Grantown that from 732 local homes, and after a consultation event attended by 50 people, there were only 12 responses. Opinion was also sought online. There is potential for the amended boundary to generate more planning applications. Parts of Grantown including The Square were designated as a conservation area in 1975. This is the first formal review since that designation.\nThe proposal is to extend the designated area along South High Street and into peripheral areas of the conservation zone. Mr Puls stressed it was not the purpose of a conservation area to prevent development but \"rather to control development to ensure it is appropriately sited and designed\".\nHe said this was aptly demonstrated by a number of new developments consented in recent years. Strong views were expressed \u0026ndash for and against \u0026ndash on the inclusion of the belt of trees to the north and west of Inverallan Church.\nThe trees contribute to the setting of the conservation area, forming a backdrop to the B-listed church \"and provide a natural separation with the later development to the north west\", according to the officer\u0027s report to members.\nThose against the proposed extension cited the project to convert the church for \"community use, part funded by developing housing either side of the church\".\nThere was a sense that including the location within the conservation area would be \"a barrier to this development\".\nConversely, there was support for including the trees because they would be better protected from speculative development.\nThe draft proposals will go to the council\u0027s south planning committee for approval. If adopted, all properties within the conservation area will be notified by letter.\nSaturday 8 Sep 2018 9:03 PM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117295.jpg","title":"Lack of 999 cover for busy Harley weekend","story":"Gavin Musgrove\n\u0026nbsp\nAVIEMORE was covered by only a single-manned ambulance for most of the Harley Davidson Thunder in the Glens rally, it has emerged.\nIt means that a casualty could be attended to but not taken to Raigmore Hospital in Inverness in the event of an emergency until a second ambulance crew had arrived at the scene.\nIt is understood the village only had an ambulance with single crew rather than double crew available last Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday until 5pm.\nThere were an estimated 3000 motorcyclists in the area for the UK\u0027s biggest Harley rally.\nGMB Scotland also said Kingussie only had a single manned crew in operation from just after midnight on Thursday until Sunday morning.\nThe union said the situation is simply not acceptable and poses a real danger.\nAlong with the Strathy, the GMB has been calling for the Scottish Ambulance Service to get rid of the current on-call system and to replace it with 24/7 shifts to bring the Aviemore base into line with most other stations in Scotland.\nJohn Marr, GMB branch secretary, said: \"Only a first responder service would have been able to be provided by an ambulance with single crew.\n\"This would have involved looking after the casualty at the location until back up arrived.\n\"We think it is dangerous and we are stepping up our calls on the government to provide the Scottish Ambulance Service with the funds required to give Badenoch and Strathspey the service the area deserves.\n\"At the moment we are going round in circles asking why there is no 24/7 cover despite Aviemore being one of the busiest tourism spots in the whole of Scotland.\n\"We have repeatedly informed the Scottish Ambulance Service that this is a dangerous situation but nothing is happening.\"\nHighland Council convener and local councillor Bill Lobban, said: \"The current level of ambulance cover is clearly completely unacceptable.\n\"Given our population added to the huge number of visitors we see on a daily basis the Scottish Ambulance Service needs to make sure we have sufficient staff on duty to provide a safe and effective service.

Arising out of the local experience of sectarian discrimination, the march helped to set in train a series of events that would change Irish politics forever.\nNationalists in the Six Counties had begun to explore new ways of highlighting the reality of discrimination. They had looked to Governments in Dublin for decades but found little help there. The IRA’s Resistance Campaign had ended in 1962, having failed heroically against the overwhelming military superiority of the British Army and RUC. However, the imposition of internment without trial, the banning of Sinn Féin and the use of the B Specials as a rural terror force, all exposed the violence that lay beneath the surface of the Orange state. \n which read: ‘Protestant girl required for housework. Apply to the Hon. Mrs. Terence O’Neill...’\n\nFive years after O’Neill’s accession nothing had changed. Unemployment and emigration among Catholics was far higher than among their Protestant neighbours. In County Tyrone, with a population of just over 73,000 Catholics to 60,500 Protestants, there were only 52 Catholics employed in local government as against 300 Protestants. Such discrimination was highlighted by the Campaign for Social Justice established by Patricia and Conn McCluskey in Dungannon in 1964. \nParallel with these developments, the IRA and Sinn Féin were rethinking their strategy with more emphasis to be placed on open campaigning against injustice in the North. The Wolfe Tone Society was established as a forum for debate and to circumvent the Stormont ban on the Republican Clubs, the name which, in turn, had been adopted to evade the ban on Sinn Féin. Members of the Wolfe Tone Society, the Campaign for Social Justice and others were involved in the formation of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association  in February 1967.\nIt was direct action on the ground that propelled the nascent Civil Rights Movement onto the streets. The Brantry Republican Club in County Tyrone had campaigned for council housing to be built but when 15 houses were built in Caledon only one of them was allocated to a Catholic. The house next door was allocated to a single Protestant woman, the secretary of a unionist politician. \nLocal people decided to protest. The main organiser was Annie Mary  Gildernew, grandmother of Sinn Féin\u0027s Michelle Gildernew. Over a period of several months in 1967/68 a local family and supporters occupied a house in the Caledon estate. When they were evicted the case was raised in Stormont and began to make headlines beyond Tyrone. This was the spur for the march from Coalisland to Dungannon which received the endorsement of NICRA. \n\n\nIn a pattern that was to become all too familiar in the months ahead, Ian Paisley organised a counter-demonstration for Market Square in Dungannon. This was then used as a pretext by the RUC to ban the NICRA parade from the Square. \nAbout 2,500 took part in the NICRA march from Coalisland to Dungannon.

The march was blocked by the RUC at Thomas Street from entering Dungannon’s Market Square, subsequently leading to the second Civil Rights march in Derry’s Duke Street on 5th October 1968.\n\"The first civil rights march was a major cornerstone in Irish history, the people of the north stood up and said no more will we be treated as second class citizens, shaping politics on the island of Ireland for decades,\" he said.\nOver 2,500 took part in the first civil rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon.\nThis would evidently change politics here forever - this was very much a campaign organised by people, from all backgrounds and none. \nProminent republicans were also central to the organisation of demonstrations, including the now Mid Ulster MP, Francie Molloy and the late Stan Corrigan.\nReflecting on the first civil rights march, 50 years on, Colm Gildernew said the first civil rights march should act as a rallying cry to those of us who seek to promote rights, equality and respect for all in society today.\n\"We are currently experiencing an unacceptable blockade on a swathe of rights-based issues by the DUP, including Irish language, marriage equality, women’s health, and legacy rights.  \n\"There are huge concerns arising from Brexit and the recent Boundary Commission proposals, seen by many as a new attempt to gerrymander the north.

They were on active service and at Drumnakilly, close to their homes, they were ambushed and shot dead by a unit of the British Army’s SAS regiment. The Volunteers were brothers Gerard and Martin Harte and Brian Mullin.\nThe SAS killings brought to an end a month which had been one of the most intense and tragic of the war in Ireland. It began on 1 August with the IRA bombing of Inglis Barracks in London, close to Margaret Thatcher’s Finchley constituency. It was the first IRA attack in England since the bombing of the Grand Hotel in Brighton during the Tory Party conference four years earlier. A British solider was killed in the Inglis Barracks blast. In the following days, the IRA killed three British soldiers and an RUC detective in the North. \n\nOn 8 August, two young nationalist men were murdered by a loyalist death squad in Belfast. There were two more such sectarian killings of young nationalist men in Belfast, on 17 and 18 August. On 20 August, eight British soldiers were killed at Ballygawley, County Tyrone, when the IRA bombed a bus carrying members of the Light Infantry Regiment returning from England. On 31 August, two civilians were killed in Derry after they triggered an IRA booby-trap bomb intended for British forces. \nPolitically this period was dominated by the issue of extradition and, on 27 August, Robert Russell, one of the IRA prisoners who broke out of the H-Blocks in the mass escape of 1983, was handed across the border to the RUC. This was despite widespread protests, including public dissent from within Fianna Fáil.\nIt was on the Long Bog Road at Drumnakilly, four miles outside Omagh, that the three IRA Volunteers met their deaths.\nAt 4pm on 30 August, they were ambushed by British forces who poured a hail of bullets into their car. The RUC and British Army immediately sealed off the area and the bodies of the three men were left at the scene, within the cordon and inaccessible to grieving relatives, until the following afternoon. \n\nGerard Harte  was the eldest of the three Volunteers and was an experienced IRA activist. With his brother, Martin, he was a prominent member of the Loughmacrory St Theresa’s GAA Club, where he organised youth teams. \nMartin Harte was just 21 but had been in the IRA for four years at the time of his death. A talented football player, he had captained the Loughmacrory team. He was the father of a three-month-old son and, to compound the tragedy, his widow was Briege Mullin, sister of his friend and comrade Brian Mullin. \nVolunteer Brian Mullin  had been singled out for particular harassment by British forces. He was arrested and interrogated in Gough Barrack on numerous occasions and a few weeks before his death he and his brothers were beaten by crown forces outside their family home.\n\n\nHundreds of British soldiers and RUC members saturated the Tyrone countryside as the three Volunteers were laid to rest. Speaking at the graveside of the Harte brothers, Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams said the Volunteers were “good, decent, patriotic freedom fighters driven to fight for justice”. \nVolunteers Brian Mullin, Gerard Harte and Martin Harte were killed on 30 August 1988, 30 years ago this week.\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27466  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna\n\n“The policy of this government is failing the homeless, failing those renting and those who strive to own a home.

The excellent work done by Barrister Mark Bassett covers EU and Irish law and is unambiguous - with political will, this can be done,\" she said. \nMartina Anderson said that senior figures in the EU, as well as leading representatives from both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have already indicated support for the proposal. \n\"The European Parliament emphatically endorsed a resolution calling for democratic and social rights to be upheld in the north post-Brexit. The Parliament’s Coordinator on Brexit, Guy Verhofstadt supports continued representation for the north, as does the Fianna Fáil leader and Fine Gael MEP Seán Kelly believes it is worth considering,\" she explained. \nSinn Féin recently made a submission to the Constitutional Commission set up to examine the boundaries of European Parliament constituencies which called for the creation of a new constituency in the north and Martina Anderson explained this legal opinion reinforces that submission. \n The Sinn Féin MEP made a direct appeal to An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar to uphold the rights of Irish citizens in the north. \n“An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar stated that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish government. This is the first real test of those words. There are a number of regions and territories across Europe that offer flexible and imaginative solutions to ensure citizens maintain their voting rights, it’s time Ireland did likewise. So now it\u0027s over to An Taoiseach. \n“2018 marks the 50th Anniversary of the Civil Rights Movement in the north. Brexit threatens many hard-won rights and protections that we in Sinn Féin will continue to fight to uphold.

This is the most common form of food poisoning in the UK. \n  \nWe have heavily invested in research throughout the production chain and we have already implemented new ideas such as hot water heating, double barrier changing facilities in each house and other technologies which we firmly believe have had a major impact in reducing the number of our birds which can become infected with Campylobacter. \n  \nFurthermore, we are focusing on excellence in biosecurity and innovative processing technologies.\n  \n\n  \nOngoing challenges\n  \n\n  \nControlling infectious disease in poultry is an ongoing challenge Moy Park face, in particular avian influenza . To address this, they have upgraded their AI contingency planning, rewriting the rulebook in the past year to ensure they have a robust plan in place.\n  \nWe have to think carefully how we would react and prevent spread if AI came in to Northern Ireland and together with agencies and Government departments we exchange views regularly with working groups, in order to remain on top of this key issue, Peter said.\n  \n\n  \nCareer Highlight\n  \n\n  \nOver his 40 years with the company Peter said a key highlight has been promoting ownership and pride with the people he works closely with.\n  \nA back to basics approach is one of my fundamental pillars, and I still firmly believe that bird husbandry and welfare are key to producing a high-quality product.\n  \nThere are endless opportunities for those considering a career in agriculture and food production, and as my wife and son also work in the poultry industry, I can definitely vouch for that!\n  \nAs the world population continues to expand, the demand for goods also increases and food production, and those working in the industry, will have to keep up with this development.\n  \nBy strengthening our production capabilities over the past number of years, we are well placed to meet this demand, with poultry a healthy and versatile source of protein which is also good value for money.\n  \n\n  \nPositive outlook\n  \n\n  \nPeter concluded: As I look back on my time in the industry and at Moy Park, I’ve always started each morning the same way, and I think it has stood me in good stead!\n  \nThe first thing I think of is ‘today will bring a new challenge, a new opportunity and I will most likely learn something new’ as every day is a school day!”\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_995387.jpg--.jpg?1535635242000\n","title":"superb gcse results for dunclug college","story":"  \nDUNCLUG College is celebrating historic levels of achievement at GCSE level. \n  \nAll students, including those with ious learning challenges sat a minimum of 7 GCSE subjects, including the compulsory core of English, Maths and Science and a range of GCSE optional choices in a balance of General and Applied courses.\n  \n Many gifted and competitive students sat 8, 9 or 10 subjects. The overall result for GCSE English for the whole cohort was 80% in the A – C range, with the overall Mathematics result being almost 60%: in each case this represented the best outcomes in the school’s history. \n  \nOverall, almost 80% of students achieved 5 or more subjects in the A – C range with almost 60% achieving this standard inclusive of English and Maths. This significantly exceeds the National and Northern Ireland averages and places our school and is testimony to the success which can be attained at a non-selective school. \n  \n Many factors contribute to such success, not least the support of parents, the commitment of students and the motivational teaching which is inspirational yet grounded, and which proves that high expectations enable students to push boundaries and indeed predictions. \n  \nSubjects which achieved the outstanding success rate of 100% of pupils gaining Grade C or better were as follows: Art, Construction, Media Studies, Double Award Science, Occupational Studies, Further Maths, Prince’s Trust, Agriculture \u0026amp Community Sport.

Universal Credit is definitely a part of that, I am in no doubt about that. We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit.

by-election opens this Wednesday at three venues across North Antrim, including the Joey Dunlop Leisure Centre in Ballymoney.\nAccording to the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland  75,478 North Antrim voters are entitled to sign the Petition in respect of Mr Paisley, recently suspended from the House of Commons, with 10% of those or 7,547 signatures needed to force a by-election.\nUUP Leader Robin Swann and Dunloy Sinn Fein MLA Philip McGuigan have both expressed disappointment at the EONI decision to open only three centres with limited opening hours, instead of a possible 10.\n\n\nINADEQUATE\n\n\nBoth MLA\u0027s as well as TUV leader Jim Allister have said will be signing the petition.\nExpressing disappointment, Mr Swann said three petition centres was totally inadequate for a constituency the size of North Antrim, and by restricting the opening hours, the EONI has shown little regard to people in daytime employment,\n\nSUBVERTED\n\n\nMr McGuigan agreed that the EONI decision on venues was extremely disappointing, and simply not good enough.\nHe continued that people\u0027s ability to reject the disgraceful behaviour of Ian Paisley was greatly reduced by this decision after he had accepted lavish family holidays from the Sri Lankan government and lobbyied against a UN resolution about\u0026#160 human rights abuses by the Sri Lankan authorities.\nHe said the UUP would not register as campaigner during the recall petition, but would encourage any North Antrim electors who think what Ian Paisley did was wrong to sign the petition\n

grateful family of a Ballymoney schoolboy whose life was saved by his older brother\u0027s bone marrow have spoken publicly for the first time.\nA year after seven-year-old Caden Moore received a transplant at Bristol Royal Hospital for Children from his 11-year-old brother Ben their proud mother Sabrina has agreed to share their inspiring story.\nSabrina and her husband Bryan are hoping their unforgettable experiences will encourage others to give blood and sign the Stem Cell and Bone Marrow Register.\nSpeaking exclusively to The Chronicle, teacher Sabrina said: It\u0027s been the toughest year of our lives but what a difference the past 12 months have made no words can ever express how we all felt this time last year.\n\u0026#8220To have two children going through such life-changing procedures in the same hospital, on the same day, is something we could never have imagined. Caden is improving every day and Ben has never looked back. We can\u0027t forget their big sister Kaia who has kept us all smiling.\nThe family\u0027s agony began on June 8 last year when Caden, a pupil at St Brigid\u0027s Primary School, was diagnosed with aplastic anemia, a rare blood disease where bone marrow fails to produce sufficient blood cells.\nSabrina, who has taken time off from her job at Limavady Grammar School to care for Caden, recalled: Bruises started appearing all over his body and Caden was tired, so we knew something wasn\u0027t right.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n         your_name.focus      return false     else if        your_email.focus      return false     else if        friends_name.focus      return false     else if        friends_email.focus      return false     else     ]]\n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \"\n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            .src = \u0027/securimage/securimage_show.php?\u0027 + Math.random return false\"\n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n       .ready .click .hide          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.fadeIn          return false                .click .parents.fadeOut          return false                    */       ]]\n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n                           username.focus            return false           else if              password.focus            return false           else                      ]]\n      \n      \"\n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n               return false\" title=\"View The Leader online!\"\n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n banner\" title=\"Advertise with Us\" /\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n          ?

The Ballymoney man lost his father, Mervyn Robinson, to the\u0026#160 North West 200 in 1980, while in July his cousin, William Dunlop, was killed during free practice at the Skerries 100 near Dublin.\nAll of these setbacks forced a re-think, says Robinson. My main reason for quitting the sport was my wee boy, Max, he told Chronicle Sport.\n\u0026#8220Road racing is getting very dangerous and there have been too many accidents recently, so I\u0027m not prepared to take the chance any more.\n\u0026#8220My main fear is getting caught up in something outside of my control like, like an accident happening in front of me, or a bike seizing or something.\n\u0026#8220William\u0027s death affected me big time, to be honest I felt like packing it in immediately.\n\u0026#8220The\u0026#160 circumstances surrounding William\u0027s death were just awful. The fact he left behind a\u0026#160 young daughter and Janine [his partner] had a second baby on the way made it so horrible for us all to deal with.\n\u0026#8220I thought about it and I decided I wanted to do myself some justice and finish off the season before calling it a day.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n         your_name.focus      return false     else if        your_email.focus      return false     else if        friends_name.focus      return false     else if        friends_email.focus      return false     else     ]]\n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \"\n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            .src = \u0027/securimage/securimage_show.php?\u0027 + Math.random return false\"\n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field -

outside belfast to pay 17 more for gas","story":"\nTowns outside Belfast will be paying 17% more for gas prices following Firmus Energy\u0026#8217s tariff hike next month.\n\n                \nTen Town areas include Craigavon, Antrim, Armagh, Ballymena, Ballymoney, Banbridge, Coleraine, Limavady, Derry/Londonderry and Newry.\n\n\n\nThis is a further blow for consumers\n\nThe Consumer Council\n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nFirmus Energy is to increase gas prices by 12% in the Ten Towns area from 1 October 2018. The Consumer Council has branded the increase ‘unwelcome’ and called for more gas licence holders to enter the market so create more competition.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe council is urging the 38,000 natural gas domestic and business customers to consider ways to save on household energy bills.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nAn annual bill for a typical Firmus Energy customer in the Ten Towns areas using 12,000 kWh on a Pay As You Go meter will increase from £594 to £666, an increase of £72. Whereas the annual bill for a typical Firmus Energy customer in the Greater Belfast area using 12,000 kWh on a Pay As You Go meter will increase from £539 to £604, an increase of £65.\n\nGas prices in Ten Towns will be around 17% more expensive than Belfast, based on SSE Airtricity’s Pay As You Go tariff.\n\n“This is a further blow for consumers following recent electricity tariff increases by the three largest electricity suppliers in Northern Ireland,” said a NI Consumer Council spokesperson.\n\nRichard Williams, Head of Energy Policy at The Consumer Council, said: “This is unwelcome news for Firmus Energy customers, following a 6.8% increase in the Ten Towns area earlier this year. However, we are aware the main driver is the significant rise in global gas costs since the tariff was last set in April. From 1 October, the annual bill for a typical Firmus Energy customer in Ten Towns will increase by £72 a year to £666. It is the sole supplier of gas in the Ten Towns. We would like to see other gas licence holders enter the market so that consumers there can benefit from competition.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8628181.1536329418!/image/image.jpg","title":"candlelight vigil in memory of cameron truesdale","story":"\nA candlelight vigil is to be held in Waringstown tomorrow night  in memory of Cameron Truesdale.\n\n                \nThe teenager  died on Wednesday night after a 20-month battle with cancer.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe vigil will begin at 8pm in Waringstown Park, in the village near Lurgan.

After the Act of Remembrance, Bro Ward laid a wreath at the Herron family memorial plaque which was unveiled on the boundary wall of Dromore Orange Hall in April 2016 and is the only tangible memorial in Dromore to the history of the Troubles.  \n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nTown draper, William Herron , his wife Elizabeth  and daughter Noeline  died in the blaze after an incendiary device was planted in their Market Square drapery store in April 1976. The fire destroyed much of the shop and the family home above it, where the three victims died from suffocation. Bro William Herron was a member of Closkelt LOL 415 in Rathfriland District LOL No 3.\n\n* A series of commemorative events also took place across Northern Ireland last weekend as the Institution marked its inaugural Orange Victims Day. The Loyal Order formally remember the 335 Orangemen and one Orangewoman murdered by terrorists during the Troubles. The day, which will become an annual event, also highlighted the ongoing plight of the injured and bereaved.\n\n\n   \n                 .

as well as using the Shankill Leisure Centre as the filming schedule continues.\nSchool Principal John Martin said he was very impressed with the attention to detail the film crew put in to recreating the particular period of history.\n“The crew work so quickly to recreate the time and place,” he said. “We have had some of the corridors repainted, signage put up and some of our music rooms have been transformed to look like the Olympic Village were the skaters stayed – complete with itineraries on the walls and training timetables.\n“We are delighted that St Mary’s was chosen for the film project and look forward to seeing the school on the big screen.”\nFilming is continuing on the film with a release date expected in the autumn.\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"well not be derailed by latest mod stunt","story":"\n\nTHE\n Ballymurphy Massacre families have said that the latest ‘stunt’ by the British Ministry of Defence will not derail their much anticipated inquest into the murder of there loved ones.\n\nA preliminary inquest into the atrocity takes place at 2pm today  at Belfast’s High Court.\nLast week the MoD handed over a database containing almost 5,000 names of former soldiers to the Coroner’s Office.\n\nThe spreadsheet contains 1,366 names from the Parachute Regiment, 1,542 names from the Queen’s Regiment and eight names from the Queen’s Division. A further 1,492 names appear to be duplicates, meaning ‘when an individual has multiple regiments, or units on their Record of Service. \n\nThe Coroner’s Office had been attempting to trace former soldiers who may have  been in Ballymurphy during the three days in August 1971 when ten people were shot dead and one died of a heart attack.\nHowever, just days before the inquest was due to begin into the killings 47-year-ago the database containing nearly 5,000 names landed on the Coroner’s desk.\n\nSpeaking to the Andersonstown News Ballymurphy Massacre Families spokesperson John Teggart said: “Six working days before the start of our inquest and they  send this letter, this has been done before with the recent UVF story to attempt to delay our inquest.\n\n“Vital inquest resources are being used up here and that shouldn’t be happening, these stunts are nothing but a waste of time. We would now ask for more resources to be released on the back of this. All they  are attempting to do here is swamp the system days before we are due in court.\n\n“The families are devastated, we were and still are working towards this date, the Coroner  has been very focused in the lead up to this, she is now obliged to look at this list. We hope that it can be done in a speedy fashion.\n\n“We were prepared, we knew it wouldn’t be straight forward, when you’re working with the MoD the resources they have and the dirty deals they’ve been up to all along are well known. They’ve been sitting on their hands this entire time probably thinking they’d pull a stunt like this closer to the time [of the inquest], but to do it six days beforehand is utterly despicable.”\n\nMr Teggart continued: “Sure look at the UVF stunt a while ago, that was done to take the focus off the Paras and the Queen’s [regiment] another dirty tactic and I’d be confident that the MoD had a hand in it. \n\n“The UVF certainly weren’t out to help us that time and now the MoD have decided to swamp the inquest.”\n\nDiscussing what now needs to happen Mr Teggart said: “We need to remain focused and keep on track, we’ve had setbacks before and we’ve dealt with them, we will certainly deal with this one.\n\n“I hope there will be no delay we have a preliminary hearing on Thursday, the Coroner is demanding an explanation, she wants to know why this database has suddenly turned up and rightly so. \n\n“Our inquest is set to last 3-4 months, hopefully this database can be looked at in line with this time-frame so we aren’t setback.\n\n“When we were given a date for our inquest 18 months ago we clapped in the court, that’s unheard of. You now have good, independent people within the courts, the MoD have seen this so the only way they could try and delay this is with the dirty deals that they are doing now. \n\n“Bottom line is, the families are ready to go, the Coroner is ready to go, all the work’s done, the schedule has been set out, justice needs to be served.\u0026#8221\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37294538.ece/80de8/AUTOCROP/w620h342/crowd1-_Read-Only_.jpg","title":"healing the land organisers expecting thousands to pray for stormont solution","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

It\u0027s time to forgive one another.\n\n\"We feel threatened and suspicious of each other. That\u0027s one of the saddest things.\"\n\nAnother focus will be on the high rates of suicide in areas such as north Belfast.\n\nMr Campbell said: \"We have a diversity of people taking part. The four provinces of Ireland will be represented.\n\n\"The main thing we\u0027re trying to do by coming together is taking that look off one another of threat and suspicion.\n\n\"We keep revisiting our past, and while there is justice to be had in a lot of cases, we keep raking the same things up time after time.\n\n\"Revisiting that stuff that brings up the same old bitterness and hatred.\"\n\nEntry is free for the event, which will run at Nutts Corner Market from 1pm to 4pm.

I wasn\u0027t prepared to do it.\"\n\nMr Bell continued: \"I did argue hard not to do it, but she ordered me to do it.\n\n\"She said: \u0027Look I am the First Minister, you will follow my order. I am instructing you and reversing your decision.\n\n\"I felt bullied into taking the decision because I was taking the decision against my rational judgement.\"\n\nAs Department of Trade, Enterprise and Investment  minister, Mr Bell had already announced that the scheme would close with immediate effect on February 5, 2016.\n\nThis caused concern and anger among potential claimants.\n\nThe former DETI minister alleged that Mrs Foster \"created a paper trail\" calling for RHI to be closed, but verbally she and some DUP special advisers pushed for it to be kept open.\n\nAt the tense meeting in Stormont\u0027s Parliament Buildings, Mr Bell said the First Minister told him she wanted to keep the scheme open in order to consult further with industry.\n\n\"I thought that was totally unreasonable because we had a scheme that was out of control,\" he said.\n\nIn an interview with BBC broadcaster Stephen Nolan, Mrs Foster claimed it was the DETI Minister who had been \"very aggressive\" with her.\n\nIn his evidence yesterday, Mr Bell said that several hours after the first meeting, he had a second \"much more friendly\" encounter with his party leader.\n\n\"Arlene was in agreement then with me and said: \u0027I think what you\u0027re saying is correct,\" he told the inquiry.\n\nHe claimed that Mrs Foster asked for a two-week extension to the RHI scheme which he agreed to. He told DETI Permanent Secretary Dr Andrew McCormick that closure in a fortnight would be acceptable to the First Minister and Dr McCormick said he \"could live with that\".\n\nIt has been suggested to the inquiry by Mrs Foster and two DUP Spads  that Mr Bell opposed an extension to the RHI scheme because it made him look foolish.\n\nCounsel for the inquiry, David Scoffield QC, said they argued that Mr Bell\u0027s concern was \"not so much public finances, rather the fact that changing your position so soon after you announced the decision would be something which looked like a political U-turn\".\n\nMr Bell denied this was the case. He agreed that it did make him and \"the rest of the party\" appear foolish, but he also believed it was a foolish decision and the wrong one.\n\nThe main reason he had opposed the extension was to be \"a proper steward of public funds\".\n\nMr Bell was questioned about his relationship with Mrs Foster.\n\nHe said there had been other issues aside from RHI between them in previous months but he didn\u0027t detail them. The pair had been good friends when students at Queen\u0027s University Belfast and Mr Bell said he had previously relied on Mrs Foster for advice.\n\nMr Bell said all sorts of questions had been asked about his motivation in making his RHI allegations. He told the inquiry that he had sacrificied his political career to stop the RHI overspend.\n\n\"My only motivation was those hundreds of millions of pounds to get back into the health service and our education system.,\" he said.\n\n\"For that I knew I would have sacrificed my political career. I have had two objectives.\n\n\"One, an inquiry to establish the truth. We have got that and I have every confidence in this panel, including any criticism you may or may not have of me for which I\u0027ll apologise for in advance.\n\n\"But secondly, to ensure these costs were changed and that money is now available. For both of my objectives, I have achieved them.\"\n\nThe inquiry chair, Sir Patrick Coghlin, asked Mr Bell several times why he had secretly recorded a conversation with Dr McCormick in 2016.\n\nThe former DUP minister said he regarded Dr McCormick as a \"man of integrity\" and all he wanted was a \"valid record\" of his own concerns over special advisers\u0027 alleged interference in keeping RHI open after he had moved to close it.\n\nMr Bell did not tell Dr McCormick he was recording their meeting because he might not \"have been getting the accurate information\" otherwise.\n\nHe said he needed a \"contemporaneous, accurate account\" of their discussion and because Dr McCormick was then working for a different minister, there may have been a reluctance \"to have information released\".\n\nMr Bell said: \"I had serious concerns that the actual information I was seeking and needing was being evaded.\"\n\nSir Patrick replied: \"I\u0027m still, I\u0027m afraid, why it was necessary to bring a concealed recording device.\" The former DUP Minister said he refused to allow his secret recordings to be broadcast because his only purpose in making them was \"validating what I had to say\".\n\nThe inquiry heard about the spike in RHI applications at the time when DUP ministers were \"in-and-out\" of office in protest at the murder of Kevin McGuigan.\n\nThe father-of-nine was shot dead by the Provisional IRA in the Short Strand in August 2015.\n\nDUP ministers would resign for several days before returning to office for a short period and then resigning again.\n\nMr Bell told the inquiry that this action didn\u0027t impact on his work as DETI minister.\n\n\"DETI functions continued as normal,\" he said. \"I returned on a weekly basis to deal with urgent business, and only resigned when all urgent business  dealt with.\"\n\nAt the start of yesteray\u0027s hearing, Sir Patrick warned that the inquiry wasn\u0027t a \"media sensational platform\".\n\nHe said: \"There is no open invitation to witnesses to come along and use the hearings for the purpose of publishing material to which they object or take offence for reasons which are irrelevant to the inquiry.\n\n\"It is not a media sensational platform.\"\n\nThe warning followed a statement from Mr Bell during Thursday\u0027s evidence. He said his special adviser Timothy Cairns had told him \"in garish and lurid detail\" about \"the sexual misbehaviour of two DUP ministers\".\n\nThe RHI Inquiry resumes on Tuesday with Mr Cairns set to give evidence for the first time. Mrs Foster is due to be recalled to the Inquiry later this month.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"aviation society lands at maze for exhibition after fiveyear gap","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

It definitely can be done economically. \n\n\"There is concern about the cost of the project, but you know what they say you can have three economists you’d have four conclusions.  \n\n\"There are opinions either way about whether it can stack up or not.\"\n\nAt the conference Professor Dunlop also released the first artist impression of what the bridge might look like. \n\n\n\n\nWhy £15bn bridge to Scotland could be the answer to Brexit conundrum\n\n\n\n\n\nBoris Johnson backs bridge linking Northern Ireland and Scotland\n\n\n\n\nThe catalyst for the proposed bridge between Scotland and Northern Ireland came from a speech made by Boris Johnson in January 2018 while he was the Foreign Secretary, in which he floated the idea of a 22-mile bridge across the English Channel to France - something he said would improve transport links after Brexit. \n\nProfessor Dunlop said the proposal wasn\u0027t feasible as the stretch between the United Kingdom and France is one of the busiest shipping channels in the world, but was asked shortly afterwards by Scottish newspaper The National if a similar project between Scotland and Northern Ireland was a possibility. \n\nHe laid out two proposals for the route - one from Larne and Portpatrick  or a crossing between the Mull of Kintyrne and Torr Head .\n\n\"One haulier I was speaking to was making dozens of trips across from Northern Ireland to Scotland every year and the cost of that was £600 each time. So when you take personalised stories like this you can see how the financial benefit would add up,\" Professor Dunlop said. \n\nThe proposal received a boost in March after a spokesman for the Scottish Government said it would \"initiate discussions to explore improving connectivity\" between the island of Ireland and Scotland, adding it was important \"that all options are fully considered\" \n\nDUP leader Arlene Foster and MP Sammy Wilson have both previously voiced their support for the project.  \n\nThe idea was also supported by former Foreign Secretary, who has called for it to be considered \"seriously\".  \n"},{"url":null,"title":"european heritage open days history opens up to northern ireland public","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

To take the challenge visit discovernorthernireland/loveheritage\n\nTo inspire those interested in exploring their cultural heritage journey this coming weekend, here is a list of just some of the quirky culture and hidden heritage that exists right here on Northern Ireland’s doorstep:\n\n\nDid you know…\n\n\nAntrim: The historic village of Gracehill was a settlement founded by the Moravians in 1765 and Northern Ireland’s First Conservation area. For Moravians, the burial ground was known as \"Gods Acre\" and had a strict layout. Men were buried to the left and women to the right of a central path. All the headstones were of the same shape and design - the Moravians believe that everyone is equal in death - and were laid almost flat on the ground.\n\nBelfast: Next door to the Belfast Harbour Commissioner\u0027s Office you will find Sinclair Seamen’s Church, a unique maritime-inspired church. Built in 1853 as a tribute to the city\u0027s seafaring traditions, its interior features a pulpit shaped like a ship\u0027s prow, the bell from 19th Century-built battleship HMS Hood and lifeboat-shaped collection boxes.\n\nDown: Grey Abbey is the oldest example of Gothic architecture in Ireland founded in 1193 by John De Courcy. In the 17th century the abbey ruins were acquired by the Montgomery family, who still live in the grounds to this day.\n\nFermanagh: Enniskillen is Ireland’s only island town and Castle Coole is regarded as the finest country house in Ireland. The house itself has no back door which is said to be a deliberate omission in order to discourage salesmen from calling.\n\nTo find out more about the list of those properties open in your area for European Heritage Open Days 2018 and to get involved visit \nwww.discovernorthernireland/events/European-Heritage-Open-Days/\n.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"keep working to end stalemate at stormont clinton tells politicians","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

You have to do it because it\u0027s right, because you know it\u0027s right and understand what you are dealing with.\"\n\nMr Clinton was presented with a Dublin GAA jersey by footballer Michael Darragh Macauley following his side\u0027s All-Ireland win last Sunday.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland traffic alerts travel updates","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

almost 3m more than he paid for it in 2013.\n\nBuilt in 2010, the sun-soaked deluxe pad boasts six bedrooms, a fully-equipped gym, nine bathrooms, a swimming pool and a private jetty that serves a nearby lake.\n\nThe 10,500sq ft home has been tastefully decorated in greys and beige, with a pool table in one of the leisure rooms.\n\nThere\u0027s even a putting green in the grounds where the Holywood-born golfer could take out the clubs and get in a little after-hours practice if the mood took him.\n\nRory and his American wife Erica Stoll - who hails from the same area of Palm Beach where the house was sold - have now moved into a new home once owned by golf legend Ernie Els in nearby Jupiter.\n\nRory and Erica married in April last year at Ashford Castle in Cong, Co Mayo.\n\nThe couple first met when the stunning New Yorker was working manager of championship volunteer operations for the Professional Golf Association of America.\n\nShe famously woke McIlroy up after he had slept in during the Ryder Cup in 2012.\n\nThe new owner of the former McIlroy mansion, which the golfer originally paid £7.2m for, has not been revealed.\n\nIn 2013, McIlroy sold a five-bedroom house with its own golf driving range and putting green at Moneyreagh, Co Down, for £2m. \n\nThe 14-acre estate also boasted five bedrooms and a gymnasium.\n\nIn 2014 the golfer bought a property in Holywood through Simon Brien Residential estate agents.\n\nHe also snapped up a three-storey building there, described as having been sub-divided into five apartments.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"test shows some northern ireland meat had up to four animals in it","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

has revealed that meat being sold in Northern Ireland contains the DNA of different animals than advertised.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.push\n\n\n\nThe BBC has reported\n that out of 665 Food Standards Agency  tests on meat from Northern Ireland, England and Wales 145 were partly or wholly made up of unspecified meat. \n\nSome samples contained DNA from up to four different animals and others contained no meat from animals that were advertised. \n\nLamb was the meat mostly likely to be contaminated, followed by beef and goat, while cow DNA was the most commonly found contaminant in other meat.  \n\nMince meat as the most commonly contaminated product followed by sausages, kebabs and restaurant curries.\n\nSamples came from 487 different locations including restaurants and supermarkets.\n\nA number of the samples came from Northern Ireland.\n\nThe BBC revealed that 73 of the contaminated samples came from retailers across three supermarkets. 50 samples came from restaurants and 22 from food manufacturing or processing plants.\n\nOstrich DNA was found in one of the samples.\n\nThe majority of samples were tested for common food DNA such as cow, pig, sheep, goat, horse, chicken and turkey.\n\nThe FSA said that other animal DNA could have been prevent but not identified during testing as it was not being looked for.\n\nLocal authorities gathered the samples from businesses before sending them for analysis, this data was then sent to the FSA.\n\nThe FSA said that the level of contamination present suggested it was deliberate, with over 1% of a animal\u0027s DNA counting as deliberate. \n\nHowever the FSA said the results were \"not representative of the wider food industry\".\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37289182.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/freederrycorner.jpg","title":"trust apologises after pink free derry wall for organ donor

Thus, it is vital that everyone considers becoming a donor, registers as a potential donor and informs their next of kin of their decision to do so.

The first voice on air that day was Sir Laurence Olivier.\n\nProgrammes produced there The Kelly Show, School Around The Corner, Lesser Spotted Ulster, Counterpoint and Farming Ulster.\n\nIt was also used by television film crews around the world to process and edit film footage of the Troubles.\n\nBefore it was converted into a television studio, it was the site of a hemstitching warehouse.\n\nDuring the Second World War, the building provided a billet for troops who were tasked with providing protection for the city\u0027s numerous bridges.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"after a glimpse behind the scenes this week giving northern ireland more power is just unthinkable","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

It would be hilarious but for the money involved and the questions it raises about competence, cronyism and ethical behaviour at the highest levels of government. \n\nWe had allegations that former minister Jonathan Bell had tried to break his spad\u0027s finger and swung a punch at him. We heard that his former spad Timothy Cairns told him \"Listen to me, big b***s\" during a row witnessed by senior civil servants. \n\nThere were lurid suggestions of sexual misconduct made about two of Mr Bell\u0027s ministerial colleagues. \n\nThere was evidence that Mr Bell was unable to adequately discharge his duties the morning after a late night in New York. \n\nThere were claims that Mr Cairns answered to other spads rather than his ministerial boss and that some of them had families who stood to gain from RHI. \n\nAll this, before we even consider Mr Bell alleging that the Executive\u0027s spin doctor David Gordon characterised him as a \"monster\" who needed to be put to sleep and that a senior journalist was advising the DUP about how to attack him. \n\nThe former permanent secretary of his department stated that colleagues at Invest NI had complained of Minister Bell\u0027s \"limited contribution to Northern Ireland\u0027s interests regarding foreign direct investment and trade\" and the risk of him \"making inappropriate or unhelpful comments\".\n\nAfter a trade delegation he was due to lead to the US on St Patrick\u0027s Day was dropped, it was further stated that he delayed providing routine information to OfM/DfM and travel authorisation for Invest NI staff out of pique. \n\nMost of those settling in to watch the live feed were expecting to hear a Northern Irish version of Yes Minister. What they got sounded more like a particularly fractious episode of the Jeremy Kyle Show with the DUP family at war. \n\nDuring the hearing it appeared that Mr Bell\u0027s memory of key events and grasp of detail is far from perfect, that he made secret recordings of conversations with civil servants and party colleagues, and that spads rather than he made key decisions. \n\nRegardless of the veracity of any of the claims, the rest of us are left wondering about the ethics and integrity of those who govern us. \n\nSadly, the civil service does not emerge well either. \n\nThe people running the RHI scheme appeared not to be able to spot basic flaws. The unit was under-resourced, no staff had specialist knowledge of a complex field and personnel changes meant that there was no continuity as the crisis unfolded. \n\nMost people will be shocked and bewildered by all of this. Of course, the media can distort and sensationalise stories. But this one gets worse if you follow the live coverage and read all the documents. \n\nWe have no government. But if and when we do, there is no case for dancing in the streets. \n\nCivil servants and ministers will have much to prove. We need to trust that civil servants have the competence to manage large budgets, ministers the ability to lead them, and that unelected party officials are controlled by ministers, not the other way around. Until that confidence is restored, providing Stormont with yet more power would be unthinkable. \n\nNick Garbutt runs Nick Garbutt PR\n"},{"url":null,"title":"prayer groups bid to use council chamber rejected","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

But the particular use that it is requested for doesn\u0027t to me fit in with that.\"\n\nHe warned that if the prayer group gained access it could open the door to other uses \"that we might actually not deem appropriate\".\n\nCouncillor Paul Reid of the DUP said: \"As one who is a minister of religion I would encourage people to pray. \n\n\"It is a good thing to talk to God in prayer but I do not believe this chamber is the place where people ought to be praying for a number of reasons.\"\n\nHe said there were other parts of the building which could be used as \"a quiet place of reflection\".\n\nUlster Unionist representative Stephen Nicholl said: \"I don\u0027t think there has to be a specific place in which to pray. Anywhere is suitable for prayer. \n\n\"I think perhaps the attention is because of the work that we do here. Asking for assistance through prayer certainly would, on some of the later nights, be useful.\"\n\nHe added: \"If we say this is a political chamber then we determine that everything else is outside. \n\n\"Once we change that definition then we cannot stop anybody or anything going on in this chamber under the current equality legislation.\"\n\nCouncillor Timothy Gaston of the TUV said ratepayers had paid for the facilities and should be able to use them.\n\nHe said: \"We shouldn\u0027t be closing the chamber off to anybody. \n\n\"We should be opening it up for anybody to come in and view them and use it for whatever they can.\"\n\nA total of 24 councillors out of 32 present voted for the group to use another part of the building.\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article35627921.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/global1.jpg","title":"family of danielle mclaughlin to meet taoiseach after letter saying she is not an irish citizen","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

year.\n\nHer mother requested a meeting with Leo Varadkar to discuss how families could be better supported when a loved one dies abroad.\n\nBut Andrea Brannigan says she was told by Government officials that it was “probably not worthwhile” as her daughter was not an Irish citizen.\n\nThe distraught mother was advised to contact British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nThe 28-year-old was travelling on a British passport when she died \n\n\n\n\nIn a statement, the Department of Taoiseach said officials “incorrectly concluded” Ms McLaughlin was a British citizen as Ms Brannigan said she was travelling on a UK passport.\n\nThe statement said: “The Taoiseach is aware of the tragic circumstances surrounding the death of Irish citizen Danielle McLaughlin, and extends his deepest sympathy to Danielle’s family.\n\n“The letter received by the Department of the Taoiseach from Danielle’s mother indicated that Danielle was travelling on a British passport, leading officials handling the matter to incorrectly conclude that Danielle was a British citizen.\n\n“This was the basis on which the office advised Danielle’s family that the matter would be most appropriately handled by the British authorities.\n\n“Having now clarified the facts surrounding this case, the department can confirm that consular services of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade have and will continue to be provided to Danielle’s family, as appropriate.\n\n“The department sincerely regrets the misunderstanding that arose in this case.”\n\n\n\nThe lack of compassion and consideration beggars belief.\nPat Gallagher TD\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Varadkar is expected to travel to Co Donegal on Tuesday for an unrelated matter.\n\nPat “The Cope” Gallagher, a Fianna Fail TD for the area, said he was shocked and disappointed at how the matter has been dealt with.\n\nHe said: “Danielle’s mother and family requested a meeting with the Taoiseach but this week received what I can only call a reply lacking in all compassion, stating that due to the fact that Danielle was not an Irish citizen the Taoiseach would not meet with them.\n\n“This is a disgraceful response to send to anyone, but to send a response to a mother who lost their daughter in such a horrific way is beyond the pale.\n\n“While I am led to believe that the Taoiseach will now meet Andrea this week, the lack of compassion and consideration beggars belief.\n\n“There has been an eruption of anger and shock here in Donegal since the family received this reply.\n\n“While I don’t believe it actually matters, Danielle held an Irish passport previously and had lived most of her live here in Donegal.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nLeo Varadkar will travel to Donegal next week \n\n\n\n\n“I spoke with Danielle’s mother Andrea earlier today and their trauma and anguish has been exacerbated by this callous act.\n\n“What they have been put through has been made worse by the lack of empathy and compassion from the Taoiseach’s office.\n\n“The statement from the Government apologising is nothing more than the Government’s spin unit working overtime.\n\n“I have written to An Taoiseach expressing my concern at how this matter has been handled.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"irexit freedom group aiming to take republic out of eu","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n

in the Bonnington Hotel, with each person in attendance paying €8 towards the new party. \n\nSaturday\u0027s event was organised by Hermann Kelly, a former press officer for Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage.\n\nHe is also the director of communications for the Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy group in the European Parliament. \n\nThe Londonderry native has said he aims to register Irexit Freedom as a political party in the Republic with the aim of taking the country out of the European Union, and added such a scenario could be one way of avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland.  \n\n\n\n [0]if  returnjs = d.createElement js.id = idjs.src = \u0027https:connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1\u0026version=v3.1\u0027fjs.parentNode.insertBefore\n\n\nPosted by

Irish language and support of \"stable families for procreation\". \n\nIn a country where more than two thirds of people have a positive view of the European Union, the group could face an uphill battle for support. \n\nAmid chaotic negotiations between Brussels and London on the future of the UK\u0027s relationship with the EU, support in the Republic for the EU grew by around 5% over the past year, according to recent polling data. \n"},{"url":null,"title":"leo varadkar rejects reports of preparations for border checks","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n

this week that the Revenue Commissioners were formulating plans with Government officials for full customs checks amid fears the EU and the UK will fail to reach an agreement.\n\nLeo Varadkar was speaking at the end of a parliamentary party meeting in Co Galway, on the same day as EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said Theresa May’s Brexit plans were not acceptable to Brussels.\n\n\n\nThe

direction we’ve given to Revenue is not to prepare for customs posts on the land border between Ireland and Northern Ireland because that’s something we’re not contemplating,” Mr Varadkar said.\n\nHe added: “If the Revenue Commissioners are in any way trying to put in any physical infrastructure then that is news to me and I really don’t believe that’s happening.”\n\nThe Taoiseach said it was important to make a distinction between the land border between Northern Ireland and Ireland and the ports, where the Government could not “countenance” a hard border being introduced, and airports, where custom controls may be needed if a pre-trade agreement was not reached with the UK.\n\nMr Varadkar said there would be an intensification in the next phase of the Brexit talks in the coming weeks and he hoped a deal would be made by the October deadline or by November at the latest.\n\nWhen it came to the common travel area, Mr Varadkar said he had no concerns.\n\n“I am confident that no matter what happens, the common travel area will remain in place because both UK and Ireland want that for each other’s citizens,” he said.\n\n“It benefits citizens in both countries and the European Union has taken the view that we can continue that.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"varadkar defends minister murphy over housing issues","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n

in recent weeks over the worsening homeless situation after a woman and six of her children had to sleep at a Garda station last month.\n\nGovernment figures show there are 9,891 homeless people in Ireland, about a third of whom are children.\n\nLeo Varadkar said: “I do not think any reasonable person can hold Eoghan Murphy, who has been in office for over a year now, personally responsible for all the problems in our housing market.\n\n“I think that sort of criticism is unfair.”\n\nThe Taoiseach made the comments in support of Mr Murphy at the end of the Fine Gael parliamentary party’s two-day think-in meeting in Co Galway.\n\n\n\nIt shouldn’t be about blame, it should be about solving the problem\nLeo Varadkar\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Murphy has written to a number of local authorities telling them that he would remove their powers if they did not implement housing policies.\n\nMr Varadkar said the Government and local authorities needed to share responsibility for the issue.\n\n“It’s not good enough for them not to accept their share of responsibility,” he said.\n\n“It shouldn’t be about blame, it should be about solving the problem.”\n\nMr Varadkar took aim at Sinn Fein and left-wing members of local authorities for not doing enough to prioritise homelessness.\n\nHe added that the Government was “absolutely serious” about solving the housing crisis and it was committed to building 20,000 new homes this year.\n\nThe Taoiseach welcomed the decision by the Supreme Court on Friday not to hear an appeal on the outcome of the abortion referendum.\n\nThe court refused to hear a challenge taken by a Dublin woman on the result.\n\nIn May, people voted overwhelmingly in favour of liberalising the country’s strict abortion laws.\n\nMr Varadkar said the court’s ruling on Friday had paved the way for the Government to bring forward the legislation to allow for abortion services when the Dail returns later this month.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"secretary of states announcement of civil servant decisions is of greater significance","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n

They\u0027ll soon be receiving a mere 25% more than the average UK salary for not turning up for work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.push\n\n\nKaren Bradley\u0027s belated adoption of the Reaney proposals for salary reduction offered an overdue response to farce.\n\nIt was also a minimal response - and one which simply ignored legislation which requires her to call an Assembly election. Such a contest would of course be pointless and possibly counter-productive - but it is the correct legal position, one usurped at ministerial whim. Of much greater significance than the cash crowd-pleaser was the Secretary of State\u0027s announcement of legislation to allow civil servants to take the decisions MLAs ought to be making.\n\nIndirect rule.\n\nIf I was a civil servant I\u0027d be asking for a cut of the £13,000 being taken from one of those poor MLAs. Civil servants will soon be effectively moonlighting as Executive ministers. And we all thought double-jobbing had ended.\n\nBradley\u0027s actions are an obvious attempt to keep Stormont open as a bit more than a tourist attraction.\n\nAllowing civil servants to make decisions avoids the dreaded direct rule label. It keeps alive the possibility of a return to devolved government until there really does have to be an election, in 2022. \n\nAnd even then, we could have a fantasy election to an Assembly that doesn\u0027t exist: 2003 all over again. Rule by civil service decree is profoundly undemocratic. Those elected by no-one will be making important decisions that affect everyone.\n\nGovernance transfers to the unelected and unaccountable. The main means of citizen redress will be via the courts. \u0027First Minister Sterling\u0027 - a job he does not seek and in which he ought not to be placed - will take decisions without democratic mandate.\n\nWhether the quality of civil service rule will improve matters is unclear. A fair chunk of the RHI evidence suggests a body struggling with the complexities of the legislation - even if it ought to have been mainly a cut-and-paste from the Westminster model - and failing to warn hapless ministers as trouble developed.\n\nIn its defence, the civil service appeared short-staffed and overworked - problems now multiplied several-fold by the Secretary of State\u0027s promise of more roles.\n\nThe costs of a full Assembly dissolution would be personal as well as political. When the Assembly was created in 1998-99, it was not the main source of livelihood for many MLAs. Few had expected its formation and many had other jobs.\n\nAfter years of relative stability from 2007-16, it has become the main source of income for most members .\n\nSo sympathy is due to those MLAs who are blameless in the institutional collapse and diligent in their constituency duties. As my Liverpool colleague Sean Haughey has shown in the Journal of Legislative Studies, MLAs spend a big proportion of their work  on constituency activity. \n\nThere\u0027s also much to be said for working from home. But when the university term starts, I wouldn\u0027t get 35p let alone £35K for long if I played truant. And members of a legislative assembly need to be just that.\n\nReducing salaries can concentrate minds but not change them. It may make MLAs thrifty with the weekly shopping but paying people £13,000 less will not alter their views on an Irish Language Act, same-sex marriage, abortion, Brexit, blame for RHI, whatever. \n\nUltimately political will not fiscal rectitude will determine the Assembly\u0027s future. There remains the strong suspicions that the DUP is, for now, comfortable with political arrangements - no worries for the DUP nine, erstwhile 10, given their prospering at Westminster - whilst Northern Ireland\u0027s institutions are not Sinn Fein\u0027s ultimate concern anyway.\n\nLogically, there is no reason why the Assembly cannot be reconstituted to deal with schools, hospitals and other matters, even if its members are still arguing over the dead-end of identity politics and wrestling over social issues. \n\nAn incremental way forward would be for the Assembly to revive but confine legislation initially to agreed ring-fenced issues - baby steps back to the full model. But don\u0027t expect anything prior to the RHI verdict anyway. \n\nPublic support for the Assembly - but not the current fake one - remains high, despite the cynicism over MLA pay. Credible immediate alternatives remain in short supply. \n\nDirect rule? Non-runner for nationalists. \n\nTransfer of powers to local councils? 11 mini-Stormonts. \n\nJoint authority or unity? Unionist uproar. \n\nAt its brief best, the Assembly was passing nearly as much legislation as its counterparts in Scotland and Wales. Yesterday\u0027s nod towards a \u0027pay-per-legislation\u0027 model will not, alone, restore its fortunes, but at least a potential Guinness World Record - for Secretary of State indecision - has been avoided - for now. \n\nJon Tonge is Professor of Politics at the University of Liverpool\n"},{"url":null,"title":"first case of monkeypox recorded in uk","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

It opted for the capital version from IBM while the lowercase is taken from iomega – the predecessor of Lenovo. \n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch giant panda plays with a cardboard box cake for her","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

The ministry also summoned the Iraqi ambassador to relay Tehran’s “strong protest”.\n\nOn Saturday, an Iraqi flag was placed at the entrance to the consulate after the Iranian one was torn down and set ablaze.\n\nSprayed in red on the concrete wall of the consulate were the words: “Down with Iran, down with the militias, the revolution will continue.”\n\nThe government-sanctioned Shiite militias known as the Popular Mobilisation Forces — Hashed in Arabic — threatened retaliation Saturday, raising the spectre of further escalation.\n\n“We will have a response to those who are carrying out acts of arson and sabotage,” the militias’ commander, known as Abu Yasser al-Jaafari, told reporters in Basra.\n\nOn Saturday morning, assailants fired three Katyusha rockets at Iraq’s Basra airport, which houses the US consulate, adding to the tensions.\n\nSecurity officials said they reopened partially the vital Umm Qasr port on the Persian Gulf on Saturday, after shutting down operations for several days amid concerns that protesters might try to storm it.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"thousands march in paris against climate change","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

His charmingly naïve character is the perfect contrast to the outrageous Derry girls, whose antics inevitably lead to mayhem wherever they go.\n\nThe show has already garnered the attention of the critics, picking up a string of awards including two Irish Film and TV Awards, an Edinburgh TV Award, and scooping the Radio Times Comedy Champion award. And the second series promises to be just as successful with its winning combination of cringe-inducing 90’s nostalgia and biting comedy.\n\nThe cast are now looking forward to getting back together in the coming weeks, having been caught up in the whirlwind of publicity surrounding the show. As an honorary Derry girl, Dylan has already been immersed in the local culture thanks to his co-stars, and is looking forward to his return to the city. Invited by Derry City and Strabane District Council to present this year’s Fashion Fest event, Dylan will have the opportunity to impress a whole host of Derry girls at the North West’s premiere fashion showcase event.\n\nWhile he admits he isn’t a quite style icon, the popular actor, who hails from Reigate, is already planning his outfit – but promises he won’t be out to steal the show.\n\n“I can’t wait to get back to Derry, I had such a good time when I was there filming with the cast and crew,” he insists. “I love Ireland and having the opportunity to spend some time there filming in Derry and Belfast has been a real experience.”\n\nWhen he first received the script for Derry Girls, Dylan says he just knew it was going to be big – but didn’t realise just quite how big. “When I read it I loved it right away, I thought it was hilarious,” he recalls. “I just knew when I was on set with the cast and crew that it was going to be something pretty special. But I didn’t think it would be breaking records to the extent that it is – I had thought we might pick up about 500k viewers – but not 2.5million. That’s just phenomenal.”\n\nThe cast and crew had the chance to travel round a number of locations in Derry and also Belfast where they had access to a studio. And Dylan managed to sample a bit of the famous local hospitality while he was here – but not too much he insists. “The girls did take me out a bit in Derry so I got to try out some of the local bars and the nightlife, and the local music – but I’m not a big drinker. I was very responsible I promise.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\n“The nightlife is just amazing over there, I really enjoyed it, and I’m looking forward to seeing a bit more when I get back. I absolutely love the banter and the Irish sense of humour, that’s what makes the place for me. The girls have all taken me to meet their families and made me feel really welcome.”\n\nHis character James certainly won’t be setting many trends but what about Dylan’s own style? The former Hollyoaks actor is quietly confident that he can hold his own at Fashion Fest. But he won’t be trying out any Blue Steel moves of his own.\n\n“I’m on it – but I would say I will play it safe and go for a nice suit on the night. I think fashion is all relative really – it’s all about your own perceptions. I quite like vintage styles myself, 50’s, 60’s era - nothing too loud. Though I do quite like a Hawaiian shirt. I’ve got quite a cool military jacket which I like and a nice Harrington jacket which is a bit James Dean. I like to keep things simple - I won’t be out to steal the show.”\n\nDerry Girls serves as a painful reminder of some of the fashion crazes we would all rather forget from the 90’s, with shell suits, crunchy perms and bomber jackets galore. In terms of his own fashion faux pas however Dylan has emerged virtually unscathed so far in the family photo album.\n\n“I don’t think I’ve ever worn anything I’m really ashamed of,” he admits. “I’m very partial to pink though, so I have worn pink shirts or pink jumpers which can be really hard to pull off. But I think I handled it,” he laughs.\n\n“This is my first official Fashion event so I’m really looking forward to it. Perhaps I’ll pick up a few tips while I’m there. Going from my past experiences out in Derry I know it will definitely be a great night out.”\n\nYou can catch up with Dylan Llewellyn at the Guildhall, where the Fashion Showcase event will be dazzling audiences with an array of classic and contemporary couture on October 13th, including a collection by celebrity stylist and esteemed fashion designer Kate Halfpenny.

attending university magee","story":"\nThere has been a steady decline in the numbers of students attending the Ulster University’s Magee campus in Derry, it has emerged.\n\nThe news came to light after leaflets were delivered to householders living in the university area of the city advising residents there will be wardens active in the area tasked with dealing specifically with issues involving students’ ‘anti-community activity’.\n\nThe leaflet was issued by the Sinn Féin councillor for the area, Mickey Cooper.\n\nIn the wake of the leaflet drop, Derry Now spoke to residents living in the area about the issue of students and anti-social behaviour.\n\nHowever, many of the residents claimed that incidents related to noise or anti-social behaviour from students living in the area had significantly decreased, which they attributed to ‘dwindling numbers’ of student admissions at Magee University.\n\nDerry Now contacted Ulster University, who confirmed that there had been a ‘decline in overall admissions’ at the Magee campus.\n\nA university spokesperson said that in the past two years, the number of admissions had dropped by 172.\n\n“As part of our commitment to our multi-campus operation we balance student numbers across all campuses,” the spokesperson said\n\n“Full time undergraduate student places at Ulster University, for students from Northern Ireland and the EU, are limited by a Regulated Cap on Student Numbers, set by the Northern Ireland Executive.”\n\n“Enrolment figures for Magee for the last three years showed that there has been a decline in overall admissions with figures for 2015/16 standing at 4,391.\n\n“The enrolment figures for the following year, 2016/17 were 4,338, a drop of 53 student places.\n\n“The figures for the academic year 2017/18 stand at 4,219 – a drop of more than twice the number than the previous year with a further 119 fewer student enrolments.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize

googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\nHowever, the Ulster University spokesperson said there were ‘ambitious’ plans for the expansion of the campus.\n\n“These numbers have been broadly sustained despite the impact of the Northern Ireland Executive budget cuts of 2015 which resulted in an overall reduction of 1,250 students across the University.\n\n“For 2018/2019 enrolments, we continue to work through our confirmation and clearing period to provide educational opportunities to new students on a wide range of programmes on the Magee campus.\n\n“Our plans for our Magee campus and the city are ambitious.\n\n“The recent opening of the £11million teaching block is a major boost for our staff and current students and also paves the way for enhanced future capacity on the Magee campus in line with our broader expansion plans.”\n\nDisciplinary action\n\nIn relation to the issue of anti-social behaviour in and around the university area, the spokesperson said such incidents would not be tolerated.\n\nAn Ulster University spokesperson said: “Ulster University is proud of our role in the community and the positive contribution our talented students make to society, but we do not tolerate anti-social behaviour and have robust disciplinary processes in place to deal with any incidences, as and when they are reported to us.\n\n“We will be working with students from the start of the academic term to underline the impact of anti-social behaviour, both on the local community and on future career prospects.\n\n“We work closely with the PSNI on a range of initiatives who also join us each year in giving presentations to our students on the consequences of anti-social behaviour.\n\n“We will fully investigate all reports made to us by the authorities and begin disciplinary action where we have the necessary evidence to do so.”\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"tips issued help derry kids avoid dreaded back school germs","story":"\nAs the new school year gets under way, the Public Health Agency  is raising awareness amongst Derry parents about the importance of good hygiene – both in school and at home.\n\n“Schools can be a common breeding ground for germs and bugs so it is important to take steps to reduce the risk of picking up or spreading germs to others,” said Dr Philip Veal, Consultant in Health Protection at the PHA.\n\nParents and schools can help reduce the spread of germs by encouraging kids to practise good personal hygiene by washing hands thoroughly with soap and warm water after using the toilet and before eating.\n\nYou should also make sure your child carries tissues at all times and teach children to cover their nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing and to use a tissue which is disposed of quickly and carefully in a bin\n\nTeach children it is good to share, but not to share drinks, food or lip balm.\n\nMake sure your child receives the free flu vaccine if they are eligible\n\nThe PHA also suggests using an alcohol-based hand gel or wipe when hand washing is not possible, such as at school events or during field trips.\n\nThe spread of infection can also be reduced by thoroughly cleaning lunchboxes each day and supervising children as they regularly clean out their schoolbags. Use a wet cloth or wipe to remove dripped liquids and food crumbs from schoolbags.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\nIt is also important to keep children at home from school if they are sick.\n\n“Bugs and germs are often found in school and these can be easily passed from child to child,” said Dr Veal.\n\n“Effective hand washing is one of the most important tools in preventing many illnesses. Clean hands are vital in controlling the spread of infections and other illnesses such as food poisoning and seasonal flu. By following some simple steps we can help to avoid illness.\n\n“A great way for kids to learn about how these infections can spread is using e-Bug, a series of fun online games for primary and secondary school children.\n\nThe resources, which are free and matched to the school curriculum, can allow teachers to work with pupils and play games like the Bogey Bus, Microbe Mania, Kitchen Mayhem and Super Sneezes, learning about the spread of microbes while having fun.\"\n\nFor further information on the seasonal flu vaccine see \nwww.pha.site/fluvaccination\n\n\nFor more info on e-Bug, visit \nwww.e-bug.eu\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"a man from llandrindod wells had his life saved twice in one month by the wales air ambulance in welshpool","story":"\nLeft to right: Pilot, James Benson, pictured alongside Critical Care Practitione\u0026ltspan class=truncate\u0026gt\u0026ltspan class=truncate-preview\u0026gtr Kate Humphries, Gr\u0026ltspan class=truncate-full-screen\u0026gtant Withington and Critical Care Doctor Scott Farmery. \u0026lt/span\u0026gt\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\n\" data-thumb=\"/resources/images/8492487/?type=mc\u0026amphtype=0\" height=\"\"\n                                                                                                                        \nA man from Llandrindod Wells had his life saved twice in one month by the Wales Air Ambulance\n\nGrant and his family visiting the Welshpool airbase.

Only five players attended a pre-season meeting and Down took the field for their National League opener with barely 15 players.\n\nHowever, Rooney\u0026rsquos infectious enthusiasm has transformed Down and three months later the girls find themselves preparing for an All-Ireland showdown.\n\nSport is such a conundrum. All who have been involved in sport at any level can testify to the many frustrating and heartbreaking defeats sporadically interrupted by moments of sheer elation.\n\nIt\u0026rsquos these infrequent moments that keep players and coaches going year in year out in search of just one more. A half, a game even a season can be changed on a block, tackle, score or win and the momentum gathered can be infectious.\u0026nbsp\n\nA group, seemingly going nowhere except deeper into the abyss are suddenly galvanised, working for one another as if their lives depended on it. Success is like a lightning bolt. It can strike when you least expect it and you must keep the energy and drive going. You have to strike when the iron is hot.\n\nYet, as we all know, fairy tale endings only become fairy tale endings when the underdog performs to their very best and leaves the field of play with no regrets.\n\nOn their day the Down girls are a match for anyone as they have proved a number of times this year and they have also shown that when their backs are against the wall they can and have turned games around.\u0026nbsp\n\nDown have talented players all over the park. They will be led by Clonduff sisters Sara Louise and Fionnuala Carr, who were both on the side that won the All-Ireland Junior crown at Croke Park in 2014.\n\nThrow in in Bredagh\u0026rsquos Catherine Rocks, Liatroim\u0026rsquos Aimee McAleenan and Dearbhla Magee and you have the nucleus of an attack-minded side.\u0026nbsp\n\nHowever, Portaferry\u0026rsquos twin terrors Niamh Mallon \u0026mdash skipper of the 2014 side \u0026mdash and Saoirse Sands are the jewels in the Down crown and they have the potential to cut any defence to shreds and no better place to do that than Croke Park on Sunday.\n\nThere were plenty of raised eyebrows when Down got the better of Tipperary thanks to a 58th minute goal from Sara Louise Carr to reach the Liberty Insurance All-Ireland Intermediate final for the first time in 20 years.\n\nIt may have been a surprise, but there were indications that the Mourne girls were making real progress as the summer evolved.\n\nAdmittedly, the league was a disaster, as they lost all five outings, but then they got the better of Derry in the Ulster final. They followed that up with a draw against the much-fancied Oak Leafers in the opening round of the All-Ireland Championship.\n\nThat laid the platform for the rest of the campaign and they defeated Laois to bag the runners-up spot in Group 1 behind Cork, who had overcome all before them.\n\nTipperary topped Group 2 and were six points clear at half-time in the semi-final, but with the experiment of deploying Fionnuala Carr at full forward dispensed with, there was an immediate improvement as the Clonduff colossus began to exert greater influence from centre back. Nicole Kelly put the shackles on the dangerous Nicola Treacy too.\n\nMeanwhile, Niamh Mallon was busily keeping the umpire busy as she racked up nine points, seven from placed balls. That brought Down in touch and Sara Louise Carr, who got married earlier this year, pounced for the definitive goal to go with her earlier two points from play.\n\nCork will be desperate to get over the line having lost the last two deciders, including last year\u0026rsquos to Meath after a replay.\u0026nbsp\n\nMuch like their senior counterparts, they have cruised through to the final, finishing the group phase with a positive scoring differential of 65 points, compared to Down\u0026rsquos -2. Indeed, the Rebels were 12-point victors when the teams met in P\u0026aacuteirc Esler in July.\u0026nbsp\n\nThe Leesiders possess a lot of firepower with Finola Neville, Caroline Sugrue and Katelyn Hickey well able to hit the target. Minor star Cliona Healy came off the bench to have a big impact in the semi-final win over Galway, scoring three points in as many minutes soon after her second-half introduction to edge the Leesiders clear and finishing with four.\n\nHealy wasn\u0026rsquot involved when the Leesiders garnered the Division 2 League title, but she and a handful of other colleagues from the All-Ireland-winning Minor Championship side have made the step up and with that sort of ability to be called upon, they will be hard to beat.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Arts Centre launches new programme  ","story":"\t\t\t\nDOWN Arts Centre has announced its latest arts programme.\n\nThe new-look autumn guide, covering September to December, is brimming with a huge range of exhibitions, music, theatre, comedy, talks, classes and workshops.\n\nA ied season of live performances gets off to a comedic start with Owen O\u0026rsquoNeill\u0026rsquos new one man play, \u0026lsquoTen Songs To Die For\u0026rsquo.\u0026nbsp Also billed for the autumn are local comedians Shane Todd with his hilarious brand new stand-up show \u0026lsquoHero\u0026rsquo and Kevin McAleer \u0026mdash a comedy apparition not to be missed.\n\nMusical highlights include celtic and country classics including the Leading Ladies, charismatic singer songwriter Grainne Duffy and the ever popular Illegals with Niamh Kavanagh.\n\nNew to Down Arts Centre is local musician Tony Wright who will provide a unique night of story and song with a killer sound track.\u0026nbsp\n\nAlso not to be missed is The \u0026lsquoLegend of Luke Kelly\u0026rsquo, a spectacular tribute to the greatest folk artist of the 20th century, a definite must-see for all fans.

community service dedicated to eighth century replica monument  ","story":"\t\t\t\nA REPLICA of St Patrick\u0026rsquos Cross at Down Cathedral has been formally unveiled following a cross-community dedication service.\n\nThe replica eighth century cross \u0026mdash which stands an imposing 12-feet high and weighs five tonnes \u0026mdash is located just yards from where the patron saint is buried on the historic Hill of Down, with the Mournes in the distance providing a stunning back.\n\nBishops from the Church of Ireland and Catholic communities took part in last Friday afternoon\u0026rsquos service and they were joined by local clergy and monks from the Holy Cross Monastery in Rostrevor.\n\nFriday\u0026rsquos ceremony had been pencilled in for earlier in the summer but had to be postponed following the discovery of medieval human remains while contractors were preparing the ground for the installation of the cross, carved from Mourne granite excavated from Thomas\u0026rsquo Mountain high up in the mountain range.\n\nThe intricately designed structure was manufactured by the Kilkeel firm of McConnell Brothers and representatives from the firm were joined by Church of Ireland Bishop Harold Miller, Down and Connor Bishop Noel Treanor, the Dean of Down, the Very Rev Henry Hull, and members of the Cathedral Chapter.\n\nDean Hull, who led the short service of dedication, said the ceremony marked a very special day and was delighted a number of people heavily involved in the project were present, including Dr Mike King from the Down County Museum.\n\nDean Hull explained that Dr King played a key role initiating the replica cross project, financed by Newry, Mourne and Down Council.\n\n\u0026ldquoMike worked hard along with others to bring about the cross which replicates one that was in place around 800AD. Inside Down Cathedral, there are some old stones and through research, Mike discovered they were in fact part of the original St Patrick\u0026rsquos Cross, he said.\n\n\u0026ldquoIn some old drawings of the cathedral you can see broken portions of the cross which marked nearby St Patrick\u0026rsquos grave. Obviously this old Celtic cross had fallen down and was broken with some pieces placed inside the church.\n\nDean Hull said Dr King, with the help of Philip Armstrong, redesigned the replica cross based on drawings and sketches and eventually, through the help of McConnell Brothers, the imposing replica cross was produced.\n\nThose in attendance at the dedication ceremony were told that the source of the granite used to make the replica cross was most probably the same as that from which the original was made, Dean Hull said the cross is at the heart of the Christian faith and that because Jesus died on the cross, people are reconciled to God and find forgiveness.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoWe are reconciled to God but through the cross we can be reconciled to each other, with the cross reminding us of our common faith as Christians. It is lovely today that Christians from different traditions are able to stand around this cross today because the cross is a symbol of Christian unity and it reminds us that we have one faith, he continued.\n\nDean Hull said when people look at the cross and reflect back to Patrick and to the days of an undivided church, they are reminded that despite all has happened, \u0026ldquowe are still one in Christ with the cross a symbol of what people have in common\u0026nbsp \u0026mdash Christian unity.\n\nConcluding before the start of a short religious dedication service, Dean Hull thanked the Lecale and Down Historical Society which helped with the restoration project and the former Down Council and current Newry, Mourne and Down Council for their support.\n\nDean Hull\u0026rsquos words were reflected by Bishop Miller, who said a prayer as part of the dedication service along with Bishop Treanor.\n\nThe clerics then gathered at the base of the sculpture where they placed their palms over the imprint of a hand in the cross\u0026rsquos base and were joined by Bishop Grant Le Marque, former Anglican Bishop of the Horn of Africa, who was visiting the Down and Dromore Diocese.\n\n\u0026ldquoHere we have Christian hands together, said Bishop Miller, encouraging other people from all over the world to visit the cathedral to make the same gesture.\n\nHe added: \u0026ldquoThe cross is never just something at a distance it is the very heart of our faith in Christ, our relationship with Christ and our salvation in Christ.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Delight after new Translink bus service is extended to Clough  ","story":"\t\t\t\nA NEW bus service is operating in Clough.\n\nThe Downpatrick to Ballykinlar service is being extended to Clough from this month.

A super effort. The only other male junior, Oliver Robinson,\u0026nbsp did a double. The U-13 boys 100m in 15.15 and a strong run in the 1500m saw him finish in 5\u0026rsquo40.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\n\nA promising start to his career as a Year 8 athlete. The sole senior of the night was Davy Foster in 1,500m running a fast 4\u0026rsquo50. Maybe Davy will stick to these faster shorter distances to try and keep up with his daughters.\n\nGirls galore\n\nTwo of the aforementioned Foster girls competed in the U-11 girls\u0026rsquo 1200m. In a competitive race Jodi hit the finish line in 4\u0026rsquo17 then not far behind was the always-smiling Kari in an impressive time of 4\u0026rsquo43. They both also tried the long jump.\u0026nbsp\n\nIn the U-13 girls\u0026rsquo 100m EDAC had three runners. Heat one saw Kara Trainor finish well in second place in 15.01. In heat three we saw Lauren Madine win in\u0026nbsp a new PB time of 14.16 and Anna Gardiner come home in 15.67 with Lauren taking the overall win and gold medal for the distance.\u0026nbsp\n\nKara\u0026rsquos time placed her sixth overall. It was pleasing to see them follow the lead of the younger girls by trying a field event as well, in this case the discus. Commendable enthusiasm!\n\nFab five females\n\nThe U-13 girls\u0026rsquo 1500m saw a large field of 14 athletes, five of which were EDAC runners and which also included the top class City of Lisburn athlete Katie McCleery, who is ranked in the top 10 in the UK for her age category over this distance.\u0026nbsp\n\nMcCleery made her intentions clear from the start as she immediately hit the front. Lauren decided to track her run and see how she went and was closely followed by Anna Gardiner, Lucy Foster, Kara Trainor and Emily Burns.\u0026nbsp\n\nAll five EDAC athletes looked superb over the three and three-quarter laps. On the last bend McCleery tried to hold on, but Lauren moved up another gear waiting and cruised past to take first place with 100m to run and crossed the line in a superb time of 4\u0026rsquo57 which is a PB by 18 seconds and puts Lauren 8th in the UK for her age for 2018. That was an outstanding performance.\n\nAnna Gardiner was the next EDAC athlete to finish in 5\u0026rsquo05 which is also a significant PB.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp\n\nThe PBs were coming thick and fast as Lucy Foster came home in 5\u0026rsquo17 which was 12 seconds better than her previous best. The ever-improving duo of Kara Trainor and Emily Burns battled it out to the end and almost needed a photo finish to separate them \u0026mdash their times were\u0026nbsp 5.41.34 and 5.41.90. This race was really exciting to watch with brilliant efforts from all the girls. By filling first, third, fourth, seventh and eighth places, in the field of 14, there is surely cause for celebration at the depth of talent within the EDAC ranks.\n\nIcing on the cake\n\nLast girl to race was U-15 rising star Kirsti Foster in the 1500m. The girls were mixed with a strong U-15 boys\u0026rsquo field and Kirsti did not take the race lightly, despite carrying a slight niggle from hockey.\u0026nbsp\n\nShe dominated the girls\u0026rsquo field and beat some of the boys too in her race to finish a strong 5\u0026rsquo12 to provide a fitting finale to the night and to the track season.\n\nLaganside 10k\n\nPaula Radcliffe was obviously the star of the show, but EDAC had a few sparkling performances themselves.\u0026nbsp\n\nPaul Lloyd led the troops home and despite narrowly missing out on the elusive sub 40, he felt that he had given his all in the fast-paced race. His time of 40.08 is tantalisingly close and his consistency has to be commended.\u0026nbsp\n\nPhillip Vint, another man who rarely misses a weekend race, came next in 41.10 with Liam Keenan not far behind in 41.36. Gavin Hynds in 41.45 had plenty to celebrate as this was a PB and proves that marathon training doesn\u0026rsquot always slow you down and must be great morale booster for him.\u0026nbsp\n\nDeirdre v Paula?\n\nDeirdre Weatherall finished in 42.08 and was slightly disappointed with that. However, she was cheered up by the fact that Paula Radcliffe had decided to run in the pack and was seen in chat with ious folk en route.\u0026nbsp\n\nThis gave Deirdre the chance to have a sprint finish to the line with the women\u0026rsquos marathon world record holder.\n\nPaula also has European and World Championship medals too numerous to mention as well the accolade of four times Olympian. Many would defer to such greatness, but Deirdre is well known for her fresh-faced enthusiasm and took no time to decide that having a result sheet with her name one place ahead of Paula\u0026rsquos was an opportunity unlikely to be repeated.\n\nAfter reading on Wikipedia that Deirdre is described as the foremost tragic heroine in Irish legend and probably its best-known figure in modern times, she could probably argue that Paula should have been in awe of her rather than the other way round.\n\nThis is the spirit that is key to Deirdre\u0026rsquos rise in the ranks and long may it continue.\n\nLiam Smyth \u0026mdash veteran in terms of longevity in these events clocked up a respectable 44.42. Behind him another historic event was unfolding.\n\nGavin McConvey came in to the finish line in 53.51 declaring that the last time he saw a sub 54 minute 10K was in 2004. Not bad going Gavin, keep it up.\u0026nbsp\n\nRoisin Gaffney, another reliable EDAC runner, finished in 54.09 and for once found, despite her love of the sun, that the heat was oppressive and was glad to be done.\n\nDonal at the double\n\nDonal Smith headed to Kildare on Saturday to take part in an a 5k run in aid of the Injured Jockeys\u0026rsquo Fund - but having discovered that there was a 10K race nearby he decided in true horse lovers\u0026rsquo form to hedge his bets and do both. He did say afterwards that it was a lot for one day and he may need a few rest days, but knowing Donal, that won\u0026rsquot last for long.\n\nNo one from the club made their way to Derry on Sunday morning for the Waterside Half Marathon which this year was also the NI and Ulster Half Marathon Championships.\n\nWhat\u0026rsquos ahead?\n\nThis will probably come too late for regular readers of the weekly papers, but Tuesday is the night for the annual trek to Castlewellan for the lung busting, for some, Mill Hill Mile Challenge.\u0026nbsp\n\nThis is a race that is, or should be, on everybody\u0026rsquos bucket list so if you\u0026rsquore going don t\u0026rsquo forget you must register online beforehand.

They were freed on bail later that evening.\n\nAiring last November, the Alex Gibney-directed documentary was a hard-hitting examination of claims of state collusion in the murders, which broke new ground by publicly naming alleged suspects.\n\nThe six men killed in Loughinisland were Adrian Rogan, Barney Green, Dan McCreanor, Eamon Byrne, Malcolm Jenkinson and Patsy O\u0026rsquoHare.\n\nClare Rogan, wife of Adrian Rogan, said the families would not be deterred in their search for truth and justice.\n\n\u0026ldquoWe are shocked and appalled at the arrest of two journalists related to the No Stone Unturned documentary, which exposed the extent of state collusion between the state and loyalist paramilitaries in Loughinisland, she said.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe British government have systematically denied and continue to cover up its role in the murder of six people in the Heights Bar.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoThese arrests show the lengths of desperation that the British government and state forces are prepared to go to, in order to stifle the truth about what happened in Loughinisland.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe Police Ombudsman\u0026rsquos report into Loughinisland murders was one of the most damning expositions of state collusion in mass murder ever published.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoOur families, and many other families across the island, some of whom have been denied the basic right to an inquest, have campaigned for many years against state collusion and for truth and justice for our loved ones.\n\nSouth Down Sinn F\u0026eacutein MP Chris Hazzard has thanked those who came out to stand with the Loughinisland families on Friday night.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe arrests of two leading investigative journalists who helped lift the lid on collusion following the 1994 Loughinisland murders through \u0026lsquoNo Stone Unturned\u0026rsquo has re-opened many wounds for the families of those murdered, he said.\n\n\u0026ldquoThat truth would never have been possible without journalists like Barry and Trevor who acted always with integrity.

He started rowing back to shore, but one of the oars slipped overboard and into the water.\n\nAfter a few unsuccessful attempts to circle the oar, Mr Milligan decided to jump overboard to retrieve it. After getting the oar, Mr Milligan tried to swim back to the boat, but it was drifting away in the strong tide.\n\nA strong swimmer, Mr Milligan struck out for the shore and was about half a mile out when he was picked up by police in a rowing boat.\n\n\u0026ldquoI shouted to the children to keep calm and they did.

He is still the top bid. It is understood that two additional parties are interested in acquiring the 75,000 sq ft red brick building which once provided work for 400 people when it was owned by Hursts, part of the Ulster Weaving Group.\n\nNearly 150 years old, the five-storey mill was used for the wet spinning of flax and most of its flooring is tiled.\u0026nbsp This activity closed ten years ago.

The display was organised by Down District Council as part of their Percy French festival and more than \u0026pound500 worth of fireworks were used.\n\nBilly Caughey was the master of ceremonies for the evening and introduced several bands who played selections prior to the display.\n\nCROSSGAR \u0026mdash Mr James Mejury, founder of the family motor business in Crossgar, died at his home this week. He was 80. A native of Ballyronan, Derry, he moved with his family from Belfast to Shrigley after the outbreak of the last war and began his business in Killyleagh Street, Crossgar.\n\nHis conscientiousness at work meant that 12-hour days were common place. The solution of customers\u0026rsquo problems were his delight.\n\nDRUMAROAD \u0026mdash Gene Fitzpatrick, voted Ulster\u0026rsquos top cabaret artist, is to compere a grand iety concert organised by St Patrick\u0026rsquos Scouts and Cubs in Drumaroad Hall next Tuesday night. A top class line-up includes Fergie, Houl Yer Whist, Dominic Hughes and a local supporting cast.\n\nDuring the past few months the boys and their leaders have been very busy. The cubs spent a very enjoyable five days at Clare, while 30 miles away the scouts were on a ten-day camp at Birr, Co Offaly.\n\nThe scouts won the Diocesan Shield and represented Dromore diocese a few weeks ago at the Melviin Trophy in Dublin where they gained considerable success.\n\nKILLINCHY \u0026mdash A harvest fair in Killinchy Presbyterian Church Hall on Saturday afternoon raised \u0026pound1,300 for church funds. There was a high standard of entries for the ious classes for bread, cakes, fruit and vegetables and sales were also good.\n\nThe crowds seemed to enjoy a iety of sideshows on the football pitch where darts shooting and beanbag games contributed to the fun.\u0026nbsp\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Local minister gets in tune for marathon on the organ  ","story":"\t\t\t\nA PLUMP cushion will be the Rev Mark Spratt\u0026rsquos best friend as he undertakes a 12-hour music marathon.\n\nThe minister of Kilmore Presbyterian Church, near Crossgar, is once again preparing to play an organ and piano non-stop to raise funds for the church.\n\nHe will be playing hundreds of psalms, hymns, spiritual songs, church music, classical pieces along with wedding favourites from 9am-9pm on Saturday, September 15.\u0026nbsp\n\nIt will the second time since 2014 that Mr Spratt will take to the keyboards to raise money for the Drumaghlis Road church where he is Director of Music.\n\nA renowned organist, Mr Spratt told the Recorder: \u0026ldquoI did a 12-hour marathon before in 2014 and that time we raised just over \u0026pound2,000 for the Women\u0026rsquos Association and other church activities.\n\n\u0026ldquoThis time it\u0026rsquos to raise money for repairs to the church\u0026rsquos roof and other property matters and I\u0026rsquoll be happy with whatever the community is able to give.\n\nMr Spratt has successfully completed two other music marathons for Bangor Presbyterian Church where he was part of the ministry team before he moved to Kilmore.

She said people expect the politicians to be at work and backed the clamour for them to engage in meaningful talks on the way forward and get back into government.\n\nThe Dundrum woman said the event, alongside those held in other towns, was designed to send a clear message that people have had enough and want the MLAs back in Stormont working for those who voted for them.\n\nJoan hopes the We Deserve Better campaign is something that will focus a lot of minds, explaining people are aware that some MLAs who want to get back to Stormont as part of a functioning Executive, but this has not been possible as result of the political leadership vacuum due to the DUP and Sinn Fein being unable to agree a way forward.\n\n\u0026ldquoIt feels as if we have been putting up with the impasse but there is momentum for change. Hopefully this movement will be able to grow and put some pressure on the politicians to get back, she continued.\n\n\u0026ldquoA lot of people have said that maybe we should do this again and last week I encouraged those in attendance to take photographs and send them to their MLAs to show the support there is for them to get back to work.\n\nJoan said the simple message from last week\u0026rsquos meeting to the politicians was: \u0026ldquoWe elected you, get back to work.\n\nShe added: \u0026ldquoThe politicians are in effect our employees, we elected them to do a job for us and at the minute they are not delivering.

His greeting at a youth Mass in Galway where he declared \u0026lsquoyoung people of Ireland, I love you\u0026rsquo became a stand out moment, replayed on television on countless occasions since. My own childhood involved attending Mass at the Graan and serving as an altar boy in St Michael\u0026rsquos Church in Enniskillen with many of my primary school classmates. We were lucky too that for much of my childhood our pastoral leadership was led by Father Brian D\u0026rsquoArcy who preached a message of tolerance, diversity in the church, compassion for the complexities of life and the experiences that shape them. Even when a stream of disturbing disclosures arose that challenged the Church and its response to clerical abuse and coverup, Father Brian\u0026rsquos consistently strong and unequivocal demand for accountability, truth, justice and recovery for victims offered a pathway for the institutional church to remain connected with its members.\n  My own life journey took me to Dublin in 1999 and what I discovered very quickly was that the message of compassion, openness and truth that I had faithfully followed and listened to every Sunday did not reflect the views and actions of the hierarchy either in Ireland or in the Vatican. Like many people of faith I found this not just challenging but chilling.\u0026nbsp\n  As I embarked on a legal career in human rights law I spent many days hearing story after story of adults recalling their experiences of abuse and brutal actions at the hands of clergy and lay people at the Residential Institutions Redress Board.\u0026nbsp\n  Those stories will never leave me. Sine then, the full impact of church and state abuse has come through my office door clerical sexual abuse, church authority cover ups, Magdalene laundries, the cruel operation of mother and baby homes, where many single mothers lost their babies to a regime of illegal adoptions and told they had committed a mortal sin. We have been witness to church intolerance towards lone parents, women, advocates of shared education, access to certain healthcare services, separated couples and the LGBT community.\n  And so when I was given a ticket to the Pope\u0026rsquos Mass last weekend I thought long and hard about attending. I could see that for many people of faith this was an opportunity to gather as a church community and celebrate their faith, their God and their Christianity.\u0026nbsp\n  On the other hand I could see that for many victims of the Church the Pope\u0026rsquos visit resurrected those deep seated and enduring feelings of hurt, trauma and damage that has never been properly addressed with actions.\u0026nbsp\n  So many victims have said to me that the abuse itself is not nearly as bad as the culture of cover up, the systemic efforts to sideline and disbelieve victims, to hide evidence and wrongdoers from a process that would lead to truth, justice and love for the victim and their families.\u0026nbsp\n  So I ended up last Sunday foregoing the papal Mass and standing for truth with nearly 10,000 other citizens in Dublin City Centre. It was a personal choice. I am glad now I made that choice. I am sad that the Vatican and the leadership of the Church still don\u0026rsquot get it. Still don\u0026rsquot acknowledge that abuse wasn\u0026rsquot simply perpetrated on children by individual wrongdoers but that their many violations were facilitated, covered up and enabled by Bishops, Archbishops and Cardinals all the way to the Vatican.\n  Ireland has changed utterly since 1979. It is reflected in all the societal changes that have taken place in the last thirty nine years. It is reflected in the fact that the people of Dublin were much more interested and welcoming of the Queen than the Pope.\u0026nbsp\n  It turns out that Pope John Paul was wrong when he said back in 1979 that he loved the young people of Ireland.

This year the RUAS are delighted to welcome Paul Trapp, who is travelling from Wisconsin, USA, to judge. The event is also a great chance to interact with 200 dairy related trade exhibitors on the most relevant technological advances, difficulties and solutions in the industry. \u0026nbsp\n  Rhonda Geary, Operations Director, RUAS said: \u0026ldquo2015 saw the move of Winter Fair to our new purpose built exhibition venue, Eikon Exhibition Centre at Balmoral Park. The move has worked brilliantly and attracted one of the largest attendances to date. In preparation for the 31st Winter Fair we have increased the livestock accommodation and now have stalling, washing and milking facilities for 200 cattle. There is 4750m2 of exhibition space and a full house of 200 trade stands. \u0026nbsp\n  During the Winter Fair there is a busy Seminar Suite with talks presented every half hour from 11am until 3.30pm.\n  Dr. John Bailey from AFBI will speak about better phosphorous management, Bobby Irwin of United Feeds presents a paper on getting the lactation to the right start and Roberta Simmons of the YFCU and Barclay Bell, President of the UFU will speak about succession on farms.\n  CAFRE\u0026rsquos Martin Mulholland will be advising on feed efficiency this winter, making optimum use of grass silage \u0026nbspwhile Christopher Osborne form the UFU will speak about dairy commodity markets and the prospects for 2017.\n  Dr. Sam Strain and Sharon Verner from the Animal Health and Welfare Northern Ireland will look at improved biosecurity and BVD while Jessica Sloss from Red Tractor, speaks about the farm assurance scheme.\n  The live calf rearing demonstration will be making a return for the 2016 Show. \u0026nbspGorteade Cow Care owned by Barry O\u0026rsquoLoughlin will be displaying a fully functioning calf igloo with veranda and Heatwave ad lib calf feeder.\u0026nbsp\n  One of the innovative technological features at next week\u0026rsquos Winter Fair will be the Northern Ireland launch of the CalfApp and Calf Cloud by Volac which won gold at Eurotier in Hannover. It gives information about changes in drinking pattern and fluid intakes and monitors calf health.\n  The launch of the Winter Fair was held at Draynes Farm, near Lisburn, where Michael Drayne led a tour of agricultural journalists and industry representatives around his farm and milk bottling plant. The milk botting plant began when his father began with a horse and cart. Now the business has a fleet of vans distributing milk and dairy produces to customers in four counties. However their products are supplied to customers across Ireland through the Henderson Food Service and other companies.\n  The borehole gives Draynes Farm a constant supply of water which is also useful to soften the mains water for washing.\n  A 50KVA solar panel plant has been installed on the roofs of some of the buildings.\n  Draynes Farm processes 5m litres of milk per year and operates Monday to Friday with their own supply of 1.2 million litres of farm milk held over the weekend until the beginning of a new week. A total of 35 staff are employed in all departments.\n  The Draynes Farm dairy herd uses three Lely Astronaut A4 milking robots. The cows visit the robots on average 3.1 times per day averaging 33 litres per day with some exceeding 50litres.
