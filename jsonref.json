A little boy called Willem Fogle. He was my little son. Stillborn at 8 months. A little boy I never got to know. A little life that never got to live. A breath that was never exhaled.          Ben Fogle has conquered Mount Everest, days after revealing he had taken on the ascent in memory of his stillborn son Willem. News of the successful climb was revealed on the Instagram page of former cyclist Victoria Pendleton, who was forced to abandon her own ascent earlier this month on medical grounds. She also posted a picture of Fogle (left) and his team          Fogle\u0027s climbing partner Victoria Pendleton (right) was forced to abandon the trek earlier this month on medical grounds\u0027His loss changed our lives and I think about him daily. Losing my little boy made me re-evaluate life. Not only do we hold our two beautiful children closer to us but it was a reminder to live life for the now. Don\u0027t waste it.\u0027 The trip was not without problems. He had to scale the final 2,700ft, known as the \u0027death zone\u0027, alone after his climbing partner, Pendleton, was forced to abandon the challenge.TV star Ben Fogle and ex-Olympian Victoria Pendleton start...TV adventurer Ben Fogle and former Olympic cyclist Victoria...Share this articleThe Olympic cyclist began suffering from the effects of hypoxia - oxygen deficiency - at Camp 2, 6,400 metres above sea level, and required additional oxygen to alleviate her symptoms.The double gold Olympic cyclist cheered on the team lead by experienced mountaineer, Kentoon Cool, from the side lines and posted her congratulations online when they finished: \u0027Congratulations to @benfogle@kentoncool Mark @fishercreative and the team for reaching the summit of Mount Everest thanks to @anythingispossible.world in support of @britishredcross #believe #everest2018\u0027.

Never. There is a spirituality but I can also feel the support and the love here on Instagram. There have been so many lovely messages.           Fogle offered to cancel his own ascent in solidarity but Pendelton insisted he continue to the summit with the others\u0027I am sorry that I haven\u0027t been able to reply to you all but I promise you I read your messages and once this adventure is over I will endeavour to reply to you all.\u0027Cradling little Willem to say goodbye, I made a promise to him to live my life brightly. To embrace everyday. To always smile. To be positive and to inspire. In some ways I am now living my life for two. \u0027Willem is always there. I think he is my guardian angel here. There is one particular star that shines brighter. It draws my attention. It reflects off the snow and ice. I feel so lucky. I will never take life for granted but above all I\u0027ll never be alone.\u0027          Pendleton, from Stotfold in Bedfordshire, admitted in December that she was taking part in the challenge because she was \u0027probably having a midlife crisis\u0027 Ben Fogle on Instagram: “A thank you to YOU ALL from the summit of the world @britishredcross @anythingispossible.world @unenvironment”"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/17/11/4C58CACC00000578-5739861-image-a-13_1526552773853.jpg","title":"Meghan Markles trusted circle Pictures women friends fly UK big day","story":"    While her family tears itself apart in the days before her wedding, Meghan Markle can at least rely on her trusted girl squad who have flown to the UK for her big day. Pictured: Meghan with old university friend Lindsay Roth          Several of her closest pals have been spotted in London seeing the sights and on hand to offer the princess-to-be moral support and love. Misha Nonoo (above with Meghan) is said to have introduced the couple          The actress has made no secret of the bond between her female co-stars on Suits and a small number of well connected glamorous friends including fitness instructor Heather Dorak (above)          In a series of sun-kissed selfies and holiday snaps Meghan (pictured here with Misha Nonoo) and her friends portray a gilded life of travel, fun and partying          Among Meghan\u0027s close knit friends is her co-star Sarah Rafferty (above), who plays Donna Paulsen in the show. The pair are seen celebrating the show with glasses of wine and broad smiles          Meghan has described how the cast of Suits (above) became her ‘surrogate family’ after she moved to the Canadian cityNot only do the photographs reveal that the bride has travelled to some of the world’s most glorious holiday destinations, but they reveal how stylish she is.In an interview with the website Mr Porter, which has just emerged, she said:‘The way I dress is really monochromatic or tonal, and I like really classic pieces.‘I also love that French way of styling, where if your outfit is pulled together, then something’s got to be dishevelled – your hair, your make-up.‘Whereas with Rachel, everything is just polished and perfect. There’s something really pretty about effortless beauty.’Meghan’s love of travelling is captured on the Instagram page of one of her oldest friends Lindsay Jill Roth.The pair have taken holidays together to New York, Greece and St Barts in the Caribbean – they are seen taking selfies at the airport.The friends met in a Toni Morrison class at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, and have remained close ever since.A video of them shows them larking around at Elton John’s 2014 AIDS Foundation bash in New York.Lindsay, 36, based a character in her 2015 novel What Pretty Girls Are Made Of on Meghan.

I’d done a student film for her when we were in university together, so she gave him the film the next day.‘He called me and said, “You’re going to make money, and I want to take 10 per cent”. He was like, “I think you need to stay in LA.”‘Then you fast forward all these years of not working and trying to figure it out, and I’m just so grateful that all the stars came into alignment for Suits, because it’s changed my life.’It was after arriving in Toronto, and landing her role in Suits, that Meghan became close to co-star Sarah Rafferty, who plays Donna Paulsen in the show.          Meghan first crossed paths with fashion designer Misha Nonoo (right)  in December 2014 at the exclusive annual Art Basel exhibition in Miami    She later wrote on her online blog, The Tig, how she had spent the evening dancing and drinking cocktails with \u0027chic, badass\u0027 Misha.

Lindsay chose Meghan as her maid of honour the following year when she married British accountant Gavin Jordan, 44, in Greece two years ago. ‘We\u0027re the kind of friends who can be 3,000 miles away and still be talking about or thinking the same thing,’ she once said          Before Meghan stopped sharing her life on Instagram, one of her last posts was a picture of her at  Heather\u0027s home in California at Thanksgiving.

She also went to her hen do.‘We were seated next to one another at a lunch and we got along like a house on fire,’ she said.‘She has the most remarkable and generous spirit. I aspire to be as philanthropic as she is, and to have as much of an impact as her.’Meghan’s close friendship with Indian actress and UNICEF ambassador Priyanka Chopra can also be spotted on her Instagram page.After meeting her at a party in Toronto, Meghan interviewed her for her blog, the Tig, and Priyanka has posted photos of them drinking cocktails together.In an interview with Vanity Fair Priyanka said of her friend: ‘It would have been nice to write about her, not just her boyfriend.‘I mean, she\u0027s an actor, she\u0027s an activist, she\u0027s a philanthropist. It\u0027s just a little sexist ...‘There needs to be a certain sense of equality where a woman is not just a plus-one, you know. It\u0027s nice to be your own identity, too.’But she appears to have accepted them as a team: in a recent poll published by Time magazine she hailed both Meghan and Harry as ‘leaders’.

And, naturally, he would receive an RSVP from the Palace, for he had ‘always supported her, she knows that’, he said, recalling how he had taken Meghan to feed the ducks and babysat for her when she was little.Oh yes — and there was bound to be ‘a plus-one for Darlene’, he added, glancing at his 36-year-old fiancée, perched at his burly shoulder and hanging on his every word.\u0027Why can\u0027t she just say she loves him?\u0027: Social media users...Does Harry need a wife or a mother? Diana¿s death left her...Royal Wedding: The celebrity guests invited to Prince Harry...\u0027I have always cared for my father\u0027: Meghan breaks her...Share this article‘I would love to meet the Royals. I’d buy the prettiest dress,’ chirruped Darlene Blount, having, apparently, forgiven Thomas for drawing a gun on her less than three months earlier, during one of their drunken, violent quarrels.Fast forward 12 months and that two-hour conversation — which I listened to again yesterday on tape — sounds utterly surreal and, on reflection, rather sad. Events in the Royal Wedding drama are moving faster even than Thomas Jnr does when someone offers to buy a round of drinks at the Cedarwood Saloon, his local bar in Grants Pass, Oregon.However, with 24 hours to go before Meghan and Harry tie the knot, the state of play is as follows: the bride’s father — shamed by the revelation that he colluded with a paparazzi photographer — now lies in a Mexican hospital, recovering from a heart operation made necessary, he claims, by his son’s bad-mouthing of Meghan.          Family at war: Meghan at 11 (far left) with her father, Samantha and nephews Tyler and ThomasMeanwhile, Thomas Jnr’s sons, Thomas, 27, who runs a Domino’s Pizza franchise with his husband, and brother Tyler, 25, a cannabis farmer (it’s legal to grow the drug in Oregon) have indeed pitched up in London (with their glammed-up mother, Tracy Dooley, in tow).Tyler plans to cash in on his association with Meghan by launching a super-strong strain of cannabis called Markle’s Sparkle.They are here to watch the wedding as ‘pundits’ in an ITV studio. Or, at least, they were until yesterday when, wisely, we might think, executives at Good Morning Britain reportedly decided to drop them.          Meghan Markle\u0027s half-brother Thomas Junior wrote a poisonous ‘open letter’ to Harry  branding his sister ‘a jaded, shallow, conceited woman  Mr Markle Jr had recently penned an ‘open letter’ and told Harry: ‘As more time passes to your royal wedding, it became very clear that this is the biggest mistake in royal wedding history\u0027As for Meghan’s paternal uncles, Bishop Fred Markle and his brother Mick, a retired diplomat, these respectable septuagenarians will remain in America, along with various other snubbed relatives.Among them is Meghan’s maternal uncle Joffre, a graphic designer, who is actually two years younger than Meghan and is the product of her late maternal grandfather Alvin’s second marriage, to a lady named Ava Burrows.As he and Meghan are a similar age, and grew up in the same neighbourhood of Los Angeles, Joffre was genuinely close to her when they were children and resumed their friendship when she was an actress in Hollywood.Though he has shown admirable discretion during the pre-wedding hoopla, declining many interview requests, he, too, has been overlooked, leaving his mother feeling understandably hurt.    Meghan Markle pictured as a baby being held by her father Thomas who will not attend the royal wedding following a heart operation          Meghan Markle (right) with her sister Samantha (left) who has been snubbed from the wedding on Saturday          Samantha Markle gave a bombshell interview to US media where she insisted she had \u0027freedom of speech\u0027 and the right to criticise her half-sister Meghan‘I want everything to work out and wish them a great day,’ Ava Burrows told me this week. ‘Even though I might not be happy about how it has been handled as far as my son is concerned.’The retired teacher added: ‘That’s my boy who’s been left out and I’m a momma bear!’So, flying in the face of Meghan’s brother’s fanciful prediction last May, it seems — apart from her mother, Doria, who is expected to walk her up the aisle tomorrow — there will be no place in the chapel for anyone in the Markle family. The one thing Thomas Jnr got right when he contemplated the likely guest list, however, was that there would not be a pew for his sister, Samantha.It wasn’t difficult to forecast her absence, though, because Samantha, 53, who suffers from multiple sclerosis and uses a wheelchair, had already portrayed Meghan as ‘narcissistic and selfish’ and claimed her half-sister had disowned her because of her disability.Since then, her rants — delivered by the U.S. celebrity news website TMZ, which has also become the chosen mouthpiece for Thomas Markle Snr — have grown more wounding and bizarre by the day.          Prince Harry and Meghan Markle arrive at Windsor Castle ahead of their big dayYesterday, hitting back at Meghan’s reported pleas for her to stop sniping, she even invoked the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, saying angrily: ‘She’s not going to tell me that I can’t speak about my life. I’m not going to take it. She’s way out of her league . . . there is something in this country called freedom of speech. Meghan doesn’t have a copyright on that.’What, then, of Thomas Jnr? Having written a poisonous ‘open letter’ to Harry just over a fortnight ago, branding his sister ‘a jaded, shallow, conceited woman’ who would ‘make a joke’ of the Prince and the Royal Family and urging him to call off the ‘fake fairytale’ wedding, he appears to have had a truly Damascene conversion.The 52-year-old jobbing glazier has been flown to Britain by a redtop tabloid — no doubt, in return for yet another fat pay cheque — and was yesterday photographed posing beside one of the Queen’s guardsmen at Windsor Castle, his bleary eyes filled with awe.He now claims he hadn’t meant to hurt Meghan when he penned that cruel letter, published in a U.S. magazine, insisting he wrote it only because he and his family had been under intense pressure since the wedding was announced and he wanted to ‘shame the Palace’ into helping them.Audaciously, in his father’s absence, he is now trying to play the family’s elder statesman.  Meghan\u0027s nephew Tyler Dooley (pictured left) and his girlfriend Sandra Bazan (right) have not been invited to the wedding but were arrived at Heathrow airport on Monday          Megan\u0027s sister-in-law Tracey and nephew Tyler Dooley are pictured leaving a hotel in Waterloo‘The fact Dad’s not well enough to travel makes me want more than ever to be as supportive as I can to Meg,’ he drawled. ‘All I want is to see Meg happy and I hope she has found that with Harry.’Forgetting that he shared the family home with Meghan only briefly, when he was a teenager, and hasn’t spoken to his half-sister for many years, he added: ‘Knowing her as well as I do, and despite her job, there will be no acting on Saturday for sure. She’ll be unable to hide her happiness.’Quite what Meghan must be feeling as she prepares for the biggest day of her life, knowing her troublesome brother and various members of his clan lurk not a million miles from St George’s Chapel, we can but imagine.From the tranquillity of her home in the Californian desert — where I visited her last year — Ava Burrows summed up the car crash events of recent days with customary sagacity: ‘Family dynamics can be trying under normal circumstances but, in this family, under these circumstances, they are just plain crazy.’Weary of the hype, incidentally, Mrs Burrows has decided against getting up at 3am, West Coast time, to watch the wedding.           Tracey\u0027s son Tyler is developing a strain of cannabis called \u0027Markle\u0027s Sparkle\u0027 in the US state of Oregon, known for its relaxed drug laws    Tyler with his girlfriend Sandra (left) and with his mother Tracy, rightIndeed, though she will record the televised coverage for her invalid mother, who lives with her, she says she might never view it.The same goes for Meghan’s Uncle Mick, the retired diplomat.Puzzled and upset at being ignored (not least because he used his influence to get Meghan an internship at the U.S. Embassy in Argentina after she graduated), the 78-year-old, who lives in Florida, five time zones back from London, has also decided against setting his alarm.Whatever we might think of Meghan’s decision to exclude her family — be they blameless or otherwise — it means we can expect a scene of stark disparity in the chapel tomorrow.The right-hand side, where the groom’s contingent traditionally sit, will be packed with Harry’s family members, close and distant. The left, reserved for the bride’s guests, is likely to be filled with her high-flown new circle of friends, such as tennis queen Serena Williams, Jessica Mulroney, daughter-in-law of the former Canadian prime minister, and her co-stars in the TV drama Suits.          Thomas Markle admitted to staging  paparazzi photos (pictured) with an agency for money          Thomas Markle is seen on surveillance video entering an internet cafe with photographer Jeff Rayner to set up staged photosOn which side of the chapel David and Victoria Beckham will be seated, we can’t be sure. For those unacquainted with the Markle family’s chequered history, perhaps I should explain how this extraordinary state of affairs came about.The Markles are ided by many long-standing feuds, but the most bitter is between Thomas Jnr and Samantha, who loathe one another with a vengeance.The children of Meghan’s father’s first marriage, they were raised in Chicago — where Thomas Snr worked as a TV lighting technician — but when they were very young, their parents orced and they moved to live in the backwoods of New Mexico with their mother, Roslyn.Thomas Snr, meanwhile, decamped to Hollywood, working on the hit TV series Married With Children and marrying Meghan’s mother, Doria, 12 years his junior, who was temping at the studio.When Samantha was in her early teens, with visions of forging an acting career, she went to live with them, followed by Thomas Jnr.            The future princess\u0027 family are a mix of colourful characters that include a reformed alcoholic, a bishop, and even a cannabis farmerAs I learned when researching Meghan’s life story, however, the arrangement was a disaster from the outset. By many accounts, Samantha was deeply jealous of her baby half-sister (though she strenuously denies this), feeling that Meghan was claiming all her father’s attention.Matters worsened as Meghan grew older and her acting career began to blossom — while Samantha’s foundered.According to Roslyn, 71, Samantha is ‘not a nice person’ and also resented Doria, allegedly telling friends her stepmother was ‘the maid because she is black’.Samantha has since had an unhappy life. She was first married to a lawyer from Virginia, but they split up and he took custody of their two children.Her second marriage was also a failure, and her third child, daughter Noel, 19, despises her.She claims to have been a model and actress, though, if we believe her brother, she only ever had one or two bit-parts, courtesy of her father, and one modelling assignment, for a jeans commercial.Thomas Jnr says she also worked as a shop assistant, before joining the U.S. Air Force, but claims that she has sponged shamelessly off her father, contributing to his recent bankruptcy.With a tell-all book about Meghan in the pipeline, Samantha now calls herself a writer and ‘mental health counsellor’. She was diagnosed with MS in 2008.Thomas Jnr’s life has been no less difficult. After working as a lowly-paid Hollywood prop-shifter (again, thanks to his father’s connections), he drifted from job to job, and woman to woman, before marrying Tracy.  On the go: Meghan\u0027s mother Doria was picked up at her California home as she made her way to LAX on TuesdayThough they had two sons, Tyler and Thomas — or ‘TJ’, as he is known — he says the relationship was so fraught that they lived ‘as man and wife’ for only a few months.As Tracy is reportedly a recovering alcoholic, and he has long-standing problems with drink, this isn’t surprising.In fairness, Tracy has sprung to her ex-husband’s defence in recent months, not least when he was arrested for threatening Darlene with a gun. But TJ is less forgiving, saying he feels humiliated by his father’s erratic behaviour, and his outbursts about Meghan, and that his father and aunt Samantha are both ‘crazy’.Given the goings-on in recent days, we might think this something of an understatement — and you can bet your life there is plenty more embarrassment to come from the madcap Markles.Perhaps Meghan is wondering whether she should have invited the whole sorry lot of them. After all, it might have been better to have these loose cannons inside the wedding hall, rather than taking pot shots from outside."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/18/14/4C661F4100000578-5742749-image-a-57_1526650912733.jpg","title":"Smiling fianc e flashing ring Meghan leaves family drama behind","story":"    Meghan Markle and Prince Harry smile and wave as they leave their Kensington Palace home to head to Windsor today.

Please know how much Harry and I look forward to sharing our special day with you on Saturday.\u0027 The actress also appeared to reject criticism by her siblings that she had failed to do enough to support the reclusive Thomas Markle, saying she had \u0027always cared\u0027 for him. However, her mother, Doria Ragland, who will accompany her to the chapel and who is due to meet the Queen today, is tipped for the role. Miss Markle\u0027s future father-in-law, Prince Charles, and her closest male friend, Soho House director Markus Anderson, have also been mooted.Amid criticism from some in the extended Markle family, sources close to Miss Markle yesterday insisted that she and Harry, 33, had offered both her parents substantial \u0027support and advice\u0027 as to how to handle the global interest since they started dating in 2016.And friends told the Mail that contrary to claims by her half-siblings, Samantha Markle and Thomas Markle Jnr, that she had left their intensely private father to deal with the paparazzi on his own, she had been in \u0027frequent\u0027 touch with him by phone and text, including in recent days.It is understood Mr Markle told his daughter personally that he would not be medically fit enough to fly to the UK.    The Prince of Wales is at Buckingham Palace today where he made author and broadcaster Melvyn Bragg,  a Companion of Honour as news emerged he will give Meghan away          Excitement ahead of the wedding is reaching fever pitch today as Americans and Brits pose outside Windsor Castle      It was claimed yesterday that he was recovering after having three stents implanted in arteries following a heart attack at home in Mexico eight days ago, and that he had said it would \u0027take a long time to heal\u0027.

They were also unable to say when Prince Harry would meet his new father-in-law. Although the couple have been dating for two years, the prince has only ever spoken to him by phone.Yesterday\u0027s announcement came at the end of a truly remarkable few days, in which Kensington Palace was accused of failing to get a grip of the situation, leaving Thomas Markle to brief the US gossip website TMZ about his plans.  Even Buckingham Palace courtiers have started looking at the website for the latest updates.  But as the final preparations were put into place yesterday afternoon, Miss Markle and Harry appeared to be all smiles.The couple attended their last wedding rehearsal at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, who are page boy and bridesmaid. Miss Markle looked radiant despite the strain of the past week, wearing a white £285 Boss bodysuit and £7,000 Birks diamond earrings.Although the Queen arrived at Windsor Castle for the weekend while the wedding party was there, she is understood not to have taken part.Friends said last night that despite the drama of the past few days, Miss Markle was excited about the wedding and looking forward to exchanging vows with her prince. One admitted that families could sometimes be \u0027messy\u0027, but that she and Harry knew they had done everything possible to support her parents.\u0027They are just looking forward to the next few days and happy and excited about becoming man and wife,\u0027 the source said.

They will be waved off on their carriage procession through Windsor by members of both families. The congregation will file out of the chapel to see the newlyweds leave before heading to St George’s Hall for the lunchtime reception hosted by the Queen.The carriage procession through the streets of Windsor is expected to take about 25 minutes.7pmThe reception is not being televised and neither is the evening reception at Frogmore House, but viewers will get another glimpse of the royal couple when they leave Windsor Castle at 7pm for the evening do, which is hosted by the Prince of Wales.       Prince Charles, who walked family friend Alexandra Knatchbull down the aisle at her wedding in 2016, will step in for Thomas Markle, it was announced this morningThe Prince of Wales is no stranger to walking down non-relations down the aisle.He gave away Princess Diana\u0027s goddaughter Alexandra Knatchbull at her wedding to Thomas Hooper in 2016, as her own father looked on.At the time some speculated that Lord Brabourne, a close friend of the Prince and the grandson of Earl Mountbatten, was in poor health.Others suspected strained relations between Alexandra, goddaughter of Princess Diana, and her father could go some way towards explaining why a bride from one of Britain’s most established families chose to break with tradition.In 2010 Norton Knatchbull, the eighth Baron Brabourne, abandoned his 31-year marriage to run away to Nassau in the Bahamas with fashion designer Jeannie Nuttall.When this relationship ended in 2014 and he returned to the historic estate –where Noel Coward played the piano at weekend house parties – he was banished from the house to live in a converted barn.                                                       Snipers on the streets: Security forces build a £30MILLION taxpayer-funded ring of steel around Windsor as 100,000 superfans descend on the town for Harry and Meghan\u0027s big daySnipers are on rooftops today with soldiers and armed police patrolling the streets below as a £30million ring of steel today surrounds Windsor Castle ahead of the royal wedding.Police, the Army and undercover members of the security services are ready \u0027do whatever is necessary\u0027 to prevent any attack on Harry and Meghan\u0027s big day, including shooting to kill.The 2.6-mile route the couple will travel from St George\u0027s Chapel to Windsor Castle is lined with sharpshooters on top of buildings and other vantage points. Specialist teams are also patrolling the Thames.Police and soldiers carrying automatic weapons will also line the streets ready to fire if necessary and are already patrolling the roads, which have crash barriers used to stop vehicle-based terror attacks.With the UK\u0027s terror threat level at severe the cost of security for the first major royal wedding since 2011 is expected to reach up to £30million and the bill will be picked up by the taxpayer.It is Thames Valley Police\u0027s biggest ever operation and they are relying heavily on Scotland Yard and MI5 for support.It came as superfans camped on the streets overnight to secure their spots to see the procession through the Berkshire town tomorrow.              Police teams are even patrolling Windsor along the Thames today in an  extraordinary security operation ahead of the royal wedding    Police spotters and snipers are lining the 2.6mile route set to be followed by Meghan and Harry and are ready to shoot to kill            A police officer watches on from the rooftops of Windsor during one of Britain\u0027s biggest security operations for years            Soldiers have also been drafted in to secure a ring of steel around Windsor Castle ahead of the biggest UK royal wedding since 2011            Armed officers are on patrol and MailOnline understands there also undercover officers and MI5 ready to act if needed            Superfans camped on the streets overnight to secure their spots to see the procession through the Berkshire town tomorrowArmed police and specially trained sniffer dogs are patrolling the streets of  the royal town, with squadrons of uniformed officers with machine guns toured the town in rotation.Their colleagues are checking drains, bins and any other potential hiding places for bombs as the Berkshire town was turned into a fortress.Thames Valley Police and the Metropolitan Police - who guard the Royals –  used the dress rehearsal yesterday to assess any potential security threats or bottlenecks and crowd surges.As many as 100,000 visitors are expected to flock to the Berkshire town this weekend - which has a population of 35,000 - to catch a glimpse of the newlyweds.  Wedding planning service Bridebook say it could cost as much as £32million to ensure the event remains safe.The amount is more than double the security needed for the 1981 wedding between Prince Charles and Diana Spencer which was estimated to have cost £4million - which equates to around £12million today.Extra police from around Britain are being called upon to help ensure the event goes off without a hitch, as crowds will fill Windsor to catch a glimpse of the royals.  Since Prince William’s wedding the UK has experienced a surge in terror threats, meaning the cost of Harry’s nuptials outside of the city will be much higher.The couple’s decision to invite more than 2,000 members of the public to attend celebrations at Windsor Castle has also increased security costs. The Queen revealed has said she and the rest of the royal family will pay for the traditional wedding costs like the ceremony, flowers, music and the reception - but security is likely to be paid in full for by the taxpayer.             A police boat cruises the Thames in Windsor today as part of the £30m operation to keep the event secure            Sniffer dogs are checking the streets while police are checking drains and removing bins to stop any attack on the royal wedding            Crash barriers are also in place in Windsor to stop a terrorist attacking crowds using a vehicle  \u0027Prince Charles doesn\u0027t have a daughter so he must be VERY happy\u0027: Social media overflows with praise for Meghan\u0027s \u0027touching\u0027 decision to ask her father-in-law to give her away... although feminists claim the decision is \u0027sexist\u0027Royal fans today spoke of their joy for Prince Charles after it was revealed he will step in for the father of the bride and walk Meghan Markle down the aisle.The Prince of Wales will give his soon-to-be daughter-in-law away when she marries Prince Harry tomorrow at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor Castle.Meghan, 36, asked her future father-in-law to accompany her on the way to the altar after her father Thomas Markle had to pull out following heart surgery.Responding to the announcement by Kensington Palace this morning, royal fans praised the \u0027fantastic\u0027 decision and said they were delighted for Charles.             Royal fans have mostly reacted positively to the news, speaking of their joy for Prince CharlesOne said: \u0027What a lovely thing. Charles himself has no biological daughters but he will definitely be gaining one tomorrow. It will be a very touching moment.\u0027Another from New South Wales, Australia, tweeted: \u0027What a wonderful blessing for them both. Something Charles thought he would never be able to do.\u0027Her mother may not have been comfortable doing this. Whatever the reason, it is fantastic. Many blessings and prayers for both Harry and Meghan.\u0027And a third said: \u0027I knew it would be Prince Charles. I was hoping for her mum to do it, but I guess she wanted to keep things as traditional as possible. Great choice!\u0027However, not everyone was happy with the announcement. Aimee Day tweeted: \u0027No, it should have been her mum to do it. She brought her up and she should do it.             Others are not so impressed by the decision, with some claiming it is a \u0027sexist\u0027 move\u0027In general I think the mother\u0027s should do it anyway. After all, in most situations the mother does everything for their child over the father - in my experience.\u0027And Rachel Douce added: \u0027Disappointing that Prince Charles is walking Meghan down the aisle. Perfect opportunity for the royals to show how modern and not sexist they are and let Doria do it, but no.\u0027Mr Markle was forced to pull out of performing the fatherly duty after undergoing heart surgery in a dramatic upset just two days before the wedding.The actress\u0027s mother Doria Ragland had been tipped to perform the role. But Harry\u0027s father is far more experienced at appearing at big public events amid scrutiny.Wedding-watchers camped outside Windsor Castle in readiness for the festivities said they felt her soon-to-be father-in-law stepping in was a \u0027nice gesture\u0027.The announcement from Kensington Palace on Friday morning came with just 24 hours to go until the big day, with final preparations well under way in Windsor. Windsor visitor Leslie Haynes, from Washington, said: \u0027I was surprised actually. I knew that Prince Charles was in the running. I just assumed it would be her mother.\u0027But it was Meghan\u0027s approval and choice and so we support that, and, as we say, the next King of England is going to walk her down the aisle.\u0027The 58-year-old, who is camping  opposite the castle, said she was \u0027somewhat\u0027 disappointed that Miss Ragland would not accompany Meghan to the altar.She added: \u0027But I have to say that it\u0027s her choice so we\u0027re happy for her. She is going to be the happiest woman in the world tomorrow so how could we be disappointed about that?\u0027Margaret Phipps, 25, from Texas, said: \u0027She has such a close relationship with her mum, so I think it is surprising to some people. But I think it\u0027s a nice gesture. \u0027He (Charles) doesn\u0027t have a daughter that he\u0027d ever be able to walk down the aisle. And it just sort of shows her transition into the royal family.\u0027She\u0027s really becoming a part of that family with him kind of acting as the father figure in situations, so I personally think it\u0027s nice.\u0027Sylvia Horn, 61, from Nashville, said it is \u0027wonderful\u0027, adding: \u0027It\u0027s usually a gentleman that does it.\u0027 \u0027I fully approve since Charles is going to be her father-in-law,\u0027 she said.  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/17/23/4C5B4EE100000578-0-image-a-77_1526596043183.jpg","title":"Meghan Markles mother Doria afternoon tea Queen today","story":"Doria (left, leaving her home in LA on Tuesday, is supporting her daughter through the continuing drama over her father Thomas Markle\u0027s involvement in the wedding and has enjoyed a \u0027jolly\u0027 afternoon with Charles and Camilla (right at Kensington Palace yesterday)  Prince Harry and Meghan Markle looked relaxed as their Range Rover took them from Windsor Castle after the rehearsal          The Queen travelled to Windsor from Buckingham Palace to help the couple with their final wedding preparations and wiull meet Doria later today   Doria Ragland, pictured with Meghan, was whisked off to the royal residence after arriving in the UK yesterdayHarry, as is tradition, will say goodbye to wife-to-be and stay elsewhere with his best man, Prince William.The princes have plumped for Coworth Park, a five-star country house a stone’s throw from Windsor and one that has been the venue for many a royal polo match and his first public kiss with Meghan.Doria Ragland has had the royal red carpet rolled out for her ahead of the royal wedding on Saturday.She has been staying at Kensington Palace, has already enjoyed a \u0027very jolly\u0027 afternoon with Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall, just hours after landing, and yesterday met the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their children.      EXCLUSIVE: Suits star checks out his wedding suit!

Although the couple have been dating for two years, the prince has only ever spoken to him by phone.Yesterday\u0027s announcement came at the end of a truly remarkable few days, in which Kensington Palace was accused of failing to get a grip of the situation, leaving Thomas Markle to brief the US gossip website TMZ about his plans.  Even Buckingham Palace courtiers have started looking at the website for the latest updates.  But as the final preparations were put into place yesterday afternoon, Miss Markle and Harry appeared to be all smiles. The couple attended their last wedding rehearsal at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, who are page boy and bridesmaid. Miss Markle looked radiant despite the strain of the past week, wearing a white £285 Boss bodysuit and £7,000 Birks diamond earrings.Although the Queen arrived at Windsor Castle for the weekend while the wedding party was there, she is understood not to have taken part.Friends said last night that despite the drama of the past few days, Miss Markle was excited about the wedding and looking forward to exchanging vows with her prince. One admitted that families could sometimes be \u0027messy\u0027, but that she and Harry knew they had done everything possible to support her parents.\u0027They are just looking forward to the next few days and happy and excited about becoming man and wife,\u0027 the source said.TMZ yesterday said it had again been in touch with Mr Markle. Journalist Sean Mandell said Miss Markle\u0027s father had told him: \u0027It will take a long time to heal. I\u0027m okay. Staying in the hospital a few more days.

Meghan Markle imagined here wearing the gown she is rumoured to wear on her wedding day, at the Ralph \u0026amp Russo fashion show at Paris Fashion WeekWill Meghan’s wedding dress impact the bridal industry?Meghan, like Kate Middleton, is likely to choose a dress from a British brand in order to curry favour with the public and in turn, boost the nation’s valuable fashion and bridal industries.Despite the Meghan Markle effect being an industry in itself, being valued at £150 million to the British fashion industry in the form of unofficial brand endorsements, the new Royal’s impact on the bridal industry may be more subtle.After Kate Middleton’s marriage to Prince William, some bridal designers decided to replicate the Sarah Burton for Alexander McQueen dress with hopes that all those who had watched the Royal Wedding would want to purchase a wedding dress similar to hers.According to Lori Conley, Senior Vice President of Product and Design at David’s Bridal, the recreated dress with lace sleeves, plunging neckline and full skirt did not sell. ‘We have internal benchmarks we work with to understand traction of a dress. It feel below those.’While women were inspired by Kate’s look, they did not want to feel as if they were in a costume, so bridal designers are expected to take elements from Meghan’s dress after May 19 and incorporate them in their new collections.However, before the 2011 Royal Wedding, 75 per cent of wedding dresses that David’s Bridal sold were strapless, but after, around 65 percent of brides opted for something with more coverage, from straps to full sleeves.          Kate Middleton seen here on her wedding day with her Maid of Honour and sister Pippa Middleton at Westminster Abbey in LondonIn the same way, Kate’s second wedding dress sparked an interest in sashes, Brides magazine Deputy Digital Director Roberta Correia told Racked that bridal designers are still being influenced by this accessory seven years on.‘Long sleeves, V-necks, and lace have been seen all over the bridal runways since, even at the most recent Bridal Fashion Week. H\u0026ampM released a new dress as part of their wedding collection, which looked almost exactly like Kate’s,’ Roberta said.Although there is high consumer interest in what Meghan wears, trend adoption is slower in the bridal industry, but some brands, like minimalist brand Floravere have already announced that they will have styles inspired by the dress ready within days of the Royal Wedding.Floravere CEO Molly Kang said: ‘As soon as she goes down the aisle, we can see what’s going to explode, whether it’s silhouette, fabric, or neckline.’Royal Wedding dressesWhile Meghan has somewhat disregarded the unspoken Royal dress code when it comes to her day-to-day fashion, she is expected to go for a traditional and classic bridal gown for her big day, similar to what other Royal brides have worn before her.The Queen’s wedding dressQueen Elizabeth II wore a timeless dress designed by the favoured royal couturier Norman Hartnell for her marriage to Lord Philip Mountbatten.The Duchesse ivory silk-creation took three months to complete and had a heart-shaped neckline with a scalloped edge, crystals and a 13 foot patterned train. Like all British brides at the time, the Government gave her 200 extra clothing coupons towards her wedding trousseau.          This picture was taken during the wedding of Princess Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh showing the couple at Buckingham PalacePrincess Margaret’s wedding dress Princess Margaret, the Countess of Snowdon and The Queen’s sister, was seen in a non-traditional dress made from silk organza in what was dubbed the most glamorous wedding of its time, in 1960.During her first marriage to Antony Armstrong-Jones, the Princess wore a modern dress with a skirt comprising of 30 metres of fabric, also designed by Norman Hartnell.Critics claimed it was the simplest wedding gown in history, yet beautiful and sophisticated and can be seen as part of a display at Kensington Palace in London.          Princess Margaret and Anthony Armstrong Jones seen here on the balcony of Buckingham Palace on their wedding day with one of the Princess\u0027s bridesmaidsPrincess Diana’s wedding dressAt the time, Lady Diana Spencer’s wedding dress was known as the ‘most closely guarded secret in fashion history’.Designed by David and Elizabeth Emanuel, the meringue style gown was worth £9,000 in 1981 and is now valued at approximately £36,800.For her wedding to Prince Charles, Diana’s dress was made of ivory silk taffeta and antique lace with what has now become an iconic 25 foot train.

The last thing I expected in my life was to be in Buckingham Palace holding a medal called the Companion of Honour. It doesn\u0027t feel like the real world at all.\u0027There\u0027s 65 at any one time yes, you only get in if somebody dies.\u0027He said he did not know who had made space for him to join the elite club, saying it was not something you wanted to discover.Regarding plans for the royal wedding on Saturday, he said: \u0027We haven\u0027t got a street party organised yet - but there\u0027s still time.\u0027           Broadcaster Melvyn Bragg, more formally known as Lord Bragg of Wigton, with Gabriel Clare-HuntHe went on: \u0027The highlight of my career? Getting started. That was the big highlight. When I got a job at the BBC when I was 21 years old I thought \u0027that\u0027s it\u0027.\u0027Retiring. That\u0027s the next big highlight I\u0027m looking forward to in about 10 years\u0027 time! I\u0027ll be doing much of what I\u0027m doing now - writing books.\u0027The former chancellor of Leeds University said he was currently making a programme about the \u0027vital\u0027 teaching of the arts in schools, adding he had a \u0027great concern about the cutting back of arts in universities\u0027.The Labour peer of 20 years and Arsenal fan also touched on the legacy of Arsene Wenger, who managed the club longer than he has sat in the House of Lords.Lord Bragg said: \u0027My son and I went regularly for 20 years and under Wenger\u0027s aegis I saw some of the best club football I\u0027ve seen in my life. So, that\u0027s something to remember.\u0027I\u0027m sad. I think he was very good for Arsenal for maybe 12 to 15 years but he couldn\u0027t bring himself to organise our defence properly. If only he\u0027d organised the defence he\u0027d still be there.\u0027          Actress Julia McKenzie is made a CBE (Commander of the Order of the British Empire) by the Prince of Wales during an Investiture ceremony at Buckingham Palace Also honoured was Paralympic medalist and long jump champion Stefanie McLeod Reid, whose right foot was amputated after a boating accident as a teenager.The 33-year-old from Loughborough will collect an MBE for services to Paralympic sport.Having won three Paralympic and two world medals over a decade of competition, she took gold with a victorious long jump at the World Para Athletics Championships in London in July 2017. She said she is \u0027overwhelmed\u0027 to receive an MBE. Ms Reid, who grew up in Canada and now lives in Loughborough, said: \u0027It\u0027s surreal. Amazing. I\u0027m more overwhelmed than I expected.\u0027There\u0027s such sincerity in (Prince of Wales\u0027s) eyes, he seems to do everyone with the same amounts of pride. He genuinely wants to make this a good occasion for you.\u0027People are really good. That\u0027s the feeling I\u0027m leaving with.\u0027          Paralympian Stefanie Reid is made an MBE by the Prince of Wales during an Investiture ceremonyMs Reid, who undertook broadcasting work at the Invictus Games in Toronto last year with Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in attendance, said: \u0027It was amazing just watching Harry interact and seeing what he\u0027s like behind the scenes.\u0027He loves what he does. It\u0027s not a show, several of the athletes would genuinely count him as a friend.\u0027I wish them all the best. I read they\u0027re most excited about using their lives to make each other better and to challenge each other, and I thought \u0027wow, what a beautiful goal for a marriage\u0027.\u0027Ms Reid said she would be watching the royal wedding after some early-morning training, with her eyes set on securing a place at the Tokyo Paralympics.Dr Peter Florence, who co-founded the Hay literary festival, received a CBE a for services to literature and charity.The festival, held in Hay-on-Wye, Wales, and entering its 31st year next week, was once labelled the \u0027Woodstock of the mind\u0027 by former US president Bill Clinton.Dr Florence said of his honour: \u0027It\u0027s just lovely and this building is so extraordinarily rich and impressive and reminds you of all the incredible work that everybody else who\u0027s being honoured is doing.\u0027An extraordinary range of commitment to the nation.

Actress Julia McKenzie with her CBE presented to her by Prince Charles outside Buckingham Palace\u0027There\u0027s always a sense of holiday and jollity about the big national occasions and given how serious the rest of the world is at the moment this one just seems like a really happy and easy win.\u0027The festival organiser said he never tires of hosting the event and also praised Prince Charles for his support after collecting the CBE from him.He went on: \u0027If the sunshine holds we\u0027ll all be having the most wonderful party.\u0027The great joy is having the Canadian author Margaret Atwood who is arguably the world\u0027s greatest living writer coming to Hay.\u0027It\u0027s a magic thing that for a few days a year that green field in Wales can be a huge focus of attention for people all over the world.\u0027It\u0027s like an infusion of adrenaline of learning, the ideas keep spinning and keep energising you.\u0027Charles has very generously supported the festival. Both he and the Duchess (of Cornwall) have been encouraging for a number of years now.\u0027To channel the weight of heritage with the simple human easiness that he particularly demonstrates is an extraordinary feat and one of the reasons, as heads of state go, we\u0027ve got the best in the business.\u0027"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/18/15/4C660FE400000578-0-image-m-70_1526652079593.jpg","title":"Archbishop Canterbury praises Meghan Markle officiates wedding","story":"     The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby (left) is pictured with American bishop Michael Curry (right) at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor today, ahead of the royal wedding tomorrowAsked about what he thinks of the Prince of Wales being chosen to walk Meghan Markle down the aisle, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, said Charles is \u0027someone of great care and affection\u0027.He added: \u0027He\u0027s a very warm person and that he\u0027s doing this is a sign of his love and concern and support.

Shortly afterwards, when asked how he was feeling, he said: \u0027Great, thanks. How are you feeling?\u0027Meghan O\u0027Shea, aged seven, from Holyport in Berkshire, was among those who chatted with Harry.The prince noted the \u0027H\u0027 in the little girl\u0027s name - like his soon-to-be wife Meghan - and she said he remarked: \u0027Is that like the one I\u0027m going to marry? There\u0027s not very many Meghans with a \u0027H\u0027 around.\u0027Little Meghan said of her namesake: \u0027I think she\u0027s very nice.\u0027 As Harry was returning to the castle, he spotted a friend in the crowd who has made it home from a big cycling trip just in time for the wedding.Dean Stott, 41, travelled the 14,000-mile Pan American Highway in 99 days, 12 hours and 56 minutes, knocking an astonishing 17 days off the previous best. The former special forces soldier trained with the prince for six weeks in 2007 and the pair have stayed close, with the groom-to-be finding time to congratulate his guest on the record-breaking achievement.Afterwards Mr Stott said it was the first time he and Harry had seen each other since he returned, adding that he had not quite realised the magnitude of the wedding. Mr Stott said he was \u0027honoured and privileged\u0027 to be attending the wedding.   Accompanied by his older brother, Harry was met with loud cheers from the crowd as he emerged from the castle wearing a grey jacket, white shirt and slacks          \u0027I just want to go to the pub!\u0027: Harry pointed at the Horse and Groom pub behind adoring fans and photographers in Windsor this evening           Harry and Meghan are pictured among a crowd of well-wishers in the groom\u0027s final public appearance as a single man          Harry holds a teddy bear with a red jumper as he and Prince William greet crowds outside Windsor Castle this evening  Prince Harry walks around in front of Windsor Castle as he greeted well-wishers on his last evening of bachelorhoodAt tomorrow\u0027s service the bride  will walk through the Nave and Prince Charles will be waiting  at the start of the Quire - half way down the chapel - to take her to the altar.A source told MailOnline: \u0027It was something that she made clear she wanted to do when she and Prince Harry started planning their wedding last November\u0027.Many royal fans appear delighted at Meghan\u0027s decision because Charles does not have a daughter - but some critics believe the star, 36, should have plumped for Doria.The dramatic twist came as Prince Philip, 96, confirmed he will be well enough to attend the ceremony after successfully recovering from a hip operation last month. Harry\u0027s father is vastly more experienced than Doria at appearing at large-scale public events amid intense scrutiny. He also performed the duty for Alexandra Knatchbull, the daughter of his close friend, Lord Brabourne, in 2016. Meghan\u0027s father Thomas Markle was forced to pull out of performing the fatherly duty after undergoing heart surgery in a dramatic upset just two days before the wedding.       One member of the adoring crowd gave Harry what is possibly his and Meghan\u0027s first wedding present - a fluffy teddy bear    Outside the Horse and Groom pub, Harry shook hands with fans and spoke to children in the crowd while well-wishers filmed his every move on their mobile phones           Prince Harry is given the teddy bear by one of his well-wishers outside Windsor Castle this eveningRoyal wedding: Meghan Markle\u0027s mother lands at Heathrow airportHeart-stopping moment van breaks suddenly in front of a HGVMike Tindall discusses Harry and Meghan\u0027s wedding on GMBSoldiers leave Victoria Barracks ready for royal wedding rehearsalRoger Moore stars as James Bond in 1973 film \u0027Live and Let Die\u0027Boeing 737 crashes shortly after takeoff at Havana airportPetting farm owner attacked by travellers on her own landTexas governor confirms ten fatalities in high school shootingShocking moment elderly woman doused in hot water from burst pipeHarry and Meghan arrive in Windsor for royal wedding\u0027s full rehearsal\u0027People will be disappointed\u0027: Robert Lacey on Prince Charles decisionRoyal fans camp in Windsor street the night before weddingIn a statement, Kensington Palace said: \u0027Ms Meghan Markle has asked His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales to accompany her down the aisle of the Quire of St George\u0027s Chapel on her Wedding Day.\u0027The Prince of Wales is pleased to be able to welcome Ms Markle to The Royal Family in this way.\u0027Until today Prince Charles was the second favourite at 31 yesterday to walk Meghan down the aisle, with her mother Doria Ragland the favourite at 13.

The Duke was taken to the private King Edward VII hospital in central London on April 3, for surgery to replace his joint with a prosthetic implant.He underwent the planned procedure the following day and left hospital on April 13.The duke, who retired from royal duties in August 2017, has since continued his recovery in Windsor.His appearance at tomorrow\u0027s wedding will please the royal fans, with whom he is extremely poplar.                                                     Last night royal fans were seen camping out outside the castle to ensure a good view of the planned procession, using sleeping bags and even folding chairs after local police banned tents. Yesterday they witnessed a full rehearsal in which a carriage and members of the armed forces paraded through the streets of Windsor. Meghan has pleaded for her 73-year-old father, who is recovering from heart surgery in Mexico after revelations about his alleged collusion with a paparazzi photographer, to be given \u0027space\u0027. In the statement, which she is said to have written herself, Miss Markle, 36, said: \u0027Sadly, my father will not be attending our wedding.\u0027I have always cared for my father and hope he can be given the space he needs to focus on his health.\u0027I would like to thank everyone who has offered generous messages of support. Please know how much Harry and I look forward to sharing our special day with you on Saturday.\u0027 Amid criticism from some in the extended Markle family, sources close to Miss Markle yesterday insisted that she and Harry, 33, had offered both her parents substantial \u0027support and advice\u0027 as to how to handle the global interest since they started dating in 2016.And friends told the Mail that contrary to claims by her half-siblings, Samantha Markle and Thomas Markle Jnr, that she had left their intensely private father to deal with the paparazzi on his own, she had been in \u0027frequent\u0027 touch with him by phone and text, including in recent days.It is understood Mr Markle told his daughter personally that he would not be medically fit enough to fly to the UK.  It was claimed yesterday that he was recovering after having three stents implanted in arteries following a heart attack at home in Mexico eight days ago, and that he had said it would \u0027take a long time to heal\u0027.In return, Miss Markle was said to have told him that she loved him and supported him, regardless of the paparazzi photograph debacle.            A man puts a flag up above a shop featuring Harry and Meghan decorations in Windsor ahead of the royal wedding           People with Canadian flags camp out in Windsor ahead of the wedding of Harry and Meghan tomorrow          A group of royal wedding enthusiasts hold up flags and Harry and Meghan memorabilia outside Windsor Castle  The Royal Standard flies over Windsor Castle showing the Queen is in residence with the tow below a sea of Union Flag bunting today          In the town huge crowds of people have gathered on the eve of Meghan and Harry\u0027s wedding in the grounds of the castlePolice, the Army and the security services are forming a £30million ring of steel to protect the couple and the 100,000 people expected to visit the Berkshire town - but some armed officers took the time to pose with some Meghan fans  Royal fans from Britain, America and around the world are gathering outside Windsor Castle in huge numbers today with many wearing flags, costumes and hats          Sniffer dogs protect the huge numbers in Windsor today as part of the biggest security operation of recent times          One lucky bride, Vicky Compson, got to feel what it was like to be a princess for the day when she walked through the route Meghan and Harry will follow  to her own wedding today          Newlyweds Vicky and Aron Hallam then smiled after sharing a kiss during their reception at the Prince Harry pub in Windsor           Isabelle Sherlock and Charlie Twitchett, both ten, play Meghan Markle and Prince Harry for the day as they leave Fleetwood Methodist Church in Lancashire as  hundreds of primary school children staged their own version of the royal wedding today  Will Shepherd and Sienna Harrison, four-year-old cousins, played Harry and Meghan for the day at a nursery in Orrell, Wigan          School children wave flags on the Long Walk ahead of the wedding of the year tomorrow    Meghan and Harry will spend the evening apart this evening and the next time they will see each other again will be at the altar           Charles and Camilla were pictured leaving Kensington Palace by helicopter yesterday and this may have been when Meghan asked her future father-in-law if he would step in  This is how Meghan\u0027s entrance to St George\u0027s Chapel will unfold tomorrow and how Charles will meet her halfway          Kensington Palace has said that the Prince of Wales will accompany her down the aisle of the Quire of St George\u0027s Chapel (pictured          Prince Charles said today he was \u0027pleased to welcome her to the royal family in this way\u0027, Kensington Palace revealed in a shock statement that also suggested Meghan could enter the church alone and meet Charles half way          Charles is said to be very fond of Meghan (pictured together on Christmas Day at Sandringham) and was happy to help her after her father caused a crisis ahead of her wedding            Royal fans have mostly reacted positively to the news, speaking of their joy for Prince Charles, but others have also said Meghan should have asked her mother Doria Meghan\u0027s mother Doria (pictured left in LA) was expected to give her daughter away.

They were also unable to say when Prince Harry would meet his new father-in-law. Although the couple have been dating for two years, the prince has only ever spoken to him by phone.Yesterday\u0027s announcement came at the end of a truly remarkable few days, in which Kensington Palace was accused of failing to get a grip of the situation, leaving Thomas Markle to brief the US gossip website TMZ about his plans.  Even Buckingham Palace courtiers have started looking at the website for the latest updates.  But as the final preparations were put into place yesterday afternoon, Miss Markle and Harry appeared to be all smiles.The couple attended their last wedding rehearsal at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, who are page boy and bridesmaid. Miss Markle looked radiant despite the strain of the past week, wearing a white £285 Boss bodysuit and £7,000 Birks diamond earrings.Although the Queen arrived at Windsor Castle for the weekend while the wedding party was there, she is understood not to have taken part.Friends said last night that despite the drama of the past few days, Miss Markle was excited about the wedding and looking forward to exchanging vows with her prince. One admitted that families could sometimes be \u0027messy\u0027, but that she and Harry knew they had done everything possible to support her parents.\u0027They are just looking forward to the next few days and happy and excited about becoming man and wife,\u0027 the source said.Royal wedding: Meghan Markle\u0027s mother lands at Heathrow airportHeart-stopping moment van breaks suddenly in front of a HGVMike Tindall discusses Harry and Meghan\u0027s wedding on GMBSoldiers leave Victoria Barracks ready for royal wedding rehearsalRoger Moore stars as James Bond in 1973 film \u0027Live and Let Die\u0027Boeing 737 crashes shortly after takeoff at Havana airportPetting farm owner attacked by travellers on her own landTexas governor confirms ten fatalities in high school shootingShocking moment elderly woman doused in hot water from burst pipeHarry and Meghan arrive in Windsor for royal wedding\u0027s full rehearsal\u0027People will be disappointed\u0027: Robert Lacey on Prince Charles decisionRoyal fans camp in Windsor street the night before weddingThe Prince of Wales is at Buckingham Palace today where he made author and broadcaster Melvyn Bragg,  a Companion of Honour as news emerged he will give Meghan away          Charlies gave away Alexandra Knatchbull, the daughter of his close friend, Lord Brabourne, in 2016.

A police boat cruises the Thames in Windsor today as part of the £30m operation to keep the event secure            Sniffer dogs are checking the streets while police are checking drains and removing bins to stop any attack on the royal wedding          The Quire in St George\u0027s Chapel at Windsor Castle, where Prince Charles will walk Meghan Markle down the aisle tomorrowThe prince and Ms Markle\u0027s reception will be held in the castle\u0027s 180ft (55m) long St George\u0027s Hall, traditionally used for glittering state banquets.The vast hall had to be restored following the devastating fire at the castle in 1992.The chapel, with its intricately carved stonework, magnificent fan vaulted ceiling and beautiful stained glass windows, has seen many royal weddings and funerals.The last royal wedding was for Harry\u0027s cousin, Peter Phillips, son of the Princess Royal, who married Canadian Autumn Kelly in 2008.Harry\u0027s father and stepmother, the Duchess of Cornwall, had their televised religious blessing there in 2005, after their civil ceremony down the road in Windsor\u0027s Town Hall.In 1999, Harry\u0027s uncle, the Earl of Wessex, married Sophie Rhys-Jones, now the Countess of Wessex, at St George\u0027s.Royal newlyweds and their families traditionally pose for photographs afterwards on the vast west steps, as Harry and his new bride are certain to do.It has been the setting for many historic funerals including the Queen Mother\u0027s private committal service following her Westminster Abbey funeral in 2002, and in the same year, Princess Margaret\u0027s small, private funeral.The funeral of the Queen\u0027s father, King George VI, took place at St George\u0027s in 1952.Like Westminster Abbey, the chapel is known as a Royal Peculiar, with the Dean of Windsor responsible only to the sovereign.The church, a place of worship for the Queen and her family, is often at the heart of royal events, with the Windsors gathering there each year for Easter services, and in the past for occasions such as the service to mark the Duke of Edinburgh\u0027s 90th birthday.Within the chapel are the tombs of 10 sovereigns - as well as George VI, the remains of Edward IV, Henry VI, Henry VIII and his third wife Jane Seymour, the beheaded Charles I, George III, George IV, William IV, Edward VII and George V also rest there.                           \u0027Prince Charles doesn\u0027t have a daughter so he must be VERY happy\u0027: Social media overflows with praise for Meghan\u0027s \u0027touching\u0027 decision to ask her father-in-law to give her away... although feminists claim the decision is \u0027sexist\u0027Royal fans today spoke of their joy for Prince Charles after it was revealed he will step in for the father of the bride and walk Meghan Markle down the aisle.The Prince of Wales will give his soon-to-be daughter-in-law away when she marries Prince Harry tomorrow at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor Castle.Meghan, 36, asked her future father-in-law to accompany her on the way to the altar after her father Thomas Markle had to pull out following heart surgery.Responding to the announcement by Kensington Palace this morning, royal fans praised the \u0027fantastic\u0027 decision and said they were delighted for Charles.             Royal fans have mostly reacted positively to the news, speaking of their joy for Prince CharlesOne said: \u0027What a lovely thing. Charles himself has no biological daughters but he will definitely be gaining one tomorrow. It will be a very touching moment.\u0027Another from New South Wales, Australia, tweeted: \u0027What a wonderful blessing for them both. Something Charles thought he would never be able to do.\u0027Her mother may not have been comfortable doing this. Whatever the reason, it is fantastic. Many blessings and prayers for both Harry and Meghan.\u0027And a third said: \u0027I knew it would be Prince Charles. I was hoping for her mum to do it, but I guess she wanted to keep things as traditional as possible. Great choice!\u0027However, not everyone was happy with the announcement. Aimee Day tweeted: \u0027No, it should have been her mum to do it. She brought her up and she should do it.             Others are not so impressed by the decision, with some claiming it is a \u0027sexist\u0027 move\u0027In general I think the mother\u0027s should do it anyway. After all, in most situations the mother does everything for their child over the father - in my experience.\u0027And Rachel Douce added: \u0027Disappointing that Prince Charles is walking Meghan down the aisle. Perfect opportunity for the royals to show how modern and not sexist they are and let Doria do it, but no.\u0027Mr Markle was forced to pull out of performing the fatherly duty after undergoing heart surgery in a dramatic upset just two days before the wedding.The actress\u0027s mother Doria Ragland had been tipped to perform the role. But Harry\u0027s father is far more experienced at appearing at big public events amid scrutiny.Wedding-watchers camped outside Windsor Castle in readiness for the festivities said they felt her soon-to-be father-in-law stepping in was a \u0027nice gesture\u0027.The announcement from Kensington Palace on Friday morning came with just 24 hours to go until the big day, with final preparations well under way in Windsor. Windsor visitor Leslie Haynes, from Washington, said: \u0027I was surprised actually. I knew that Prince Charles was in the running. I just assumed it would be her mother.\u0027But it was Meghan\u0027s approval and choice and so we support that, and, as we say, the next King of England is going to walk her down the aisle.\u0027The 58-year-old, who is camping  opposite the castle, said she was \u0027somewhat\u0027 disappointed that Miss Ragland would not accompany Meghan to the altar.She added: \u0027But I have to say that it\u0027s her choice so we\u0027re happy for her. She is going to be the happiest woman in the world tomorrow so how could we be disappointed about that?\u0027Margaret Phipps, 25, from Texas, said: \u0027She has such a close relationship with her mum, so I think it is surprising to some people. But I think it\u0027s a nice gesture. \u0027He (Charles) doesn\u0027t have a daughter that he\u0027d ever be able to walk down the aisle. And it just sort of shows her transition into the royal family.\u0027She\u0027s really becoming a part of that family with him kind of acting as the father figure in situations, so I personally think it\u0027s nice.\u0027Sylvia Horn, 61, from Nashville, said it is \u0027wonderful\u0027, adding: \u0027It\u0027s usually a gentleman that does it.\u0027 \u0027I fully approve since Charles is going to be her father-in-law,\u0027 she said.  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/18/15/4C657D1100000578-5745179-image-a-17_1526653536757.jpg","title":"Frail Yoko Ono visits John Lennons childhood homes Liverpool","story":"Yoko Ono visited Liverpool on Friday in order to open a new exhibition dedicated to her relationship with John Lennon before spending some time at two of his childhood homes, including Mendips (pictured)          Lennon moved to Mendips, at 251 Menlove Avenue, after his parents\u0027 marriage broke down.

You won’t see a lot of skin. At least you shouldn’t. It would be seen as disrespectful,’ Meier said. She continued to explain that dresses in black or white should not be worn, as white is for the bride and black is still associated with mourning.While light prints and patterns are welcome at a Spring wedding, big and block patterns are unacceptable but international guests will be permitted to wear their country’s equivalent.          Spain\u0027s Prince Felipe seen here flanked by Princess Letizia and Spain\u0027s Queen Sofia, outside of Westminster Abbey ahead of the wedding between Prince William and Kate MiddletonAccording to etiquette experts Debrett’s, Meghan Markle’s boundary-pushing style will allow for some leeway when it comes to traditional Royal Wedding protocol.It may be unusual to see women wearing trousers at a wedding, but Meghan’s own decision to wear a pantsuit at formal events may mean that covered legs could be welcomed on the big day, especially after jumpsuits were approved at Royal Ascot’s Royal Enclosure.Many invitees may also take a page out of Kate’s book and choose a piece by British labels such as Stella McCartney, Burberry, Emilia Wickstead, Erdem or even Marks and Spencer, as Meghan Markle has in the past.Will Royal Wedding guests be required to wear hats?Women often start with the hat when planning their outfits, as Meier explained and they are kept on during a wedding church service. ‘Hats are a sign of festivity for a British wedding. They are kept on inside the church, but people should be careful of the people sitting behind them. It\u0027s not the Kentucky Derby. No huge brims. Nothing too high.’Princess Beatrice’s hat at Prince William’s wedding was regarded ‘ridiculous in so many ways’ by Royal watcher Anne Chertoff.          Princess Beatrice seen here wearing the Philip Treacy hat she wore at the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in 2011When it comes to shoes, open toes, wedges and slingbacks are too informal. Meier said: ‘You want something that is about 4 inches maximum. \u0027The walk in is not going to be easy. There are lots of cobblestones even though there will be different types of carpeting.’In addition to this, handbags should be small as the seating in St. George’s Chapel is very tight, so clutches are recommended.What will men wear to the Royal Wedding?Those who have a military uniform are encouraged to wear it, but most men will opt for a morning suit in either grey, navy or black with coattails. Men will also be expected to wear a waistcoat and a regular tie.For lounge suits, the rule of thumb is the darker it is, the more formal it will look and that rules goes for morning suits too. In the same way, brown shoes are considered less formal than black ones.          Prince William and his wife Kate, Duchess of Cambridge, seen here coming out of Westminster Abbey in London, after their wedding service in 2011What will Meghan Markle wear?Despite the Royal Wedding dress designer being a closely-guarded secret, rumours have suggested that Ralph \u0026amp Russo is the British couturer that has been picked by Meghan Markle. The dress is expected to be a hand-stitched and heavily beaded gown with long sleeves.What will Prince Harry wear?Prince Harry will most likely wear his Household Cavalry British Army uniform and it has been rumoured that he will have to shave his beard because facial hair is frowned upon by the military circle, according to Elle.However, Harry may also go for a morning suit because the wedding is a much more low key affair than that of his brother, Prince William’s. Other rumours suggest that he will wear the Royal Marines ceremonial uniform as a mark of respect to the regiment he took over from Prince Philip.Dancing With The Stars finale: Date, time, finalists and moreThe French Open 2018: Roland Garros dates, schedule and tickets revealedBachelorette 2018: Chris Harrison reveals premiere will have \u0027most ridiculous fight ever\u0027Who was Stephanie Adams?

Her father was a struggling department-store buyer. Wildenstein moved to Paris when she was a teenager.During that time she was in a relationship with the filmmaker Sergio Gobbi. Before her marriage to Alec, she was also linked to Saudi arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi and Cyril Piguet.In 1977, at the age of 31, Wildenstein met Alec on a safari trip to Kenya. Alec was there to kill a lion and Wildenstein asked to accompany him. The pair eloped the following year in Las Vegas.It was a tempestuous marriage. The couple reportedly spent $1 million a month on average and went for his-and-hers eye-lifts a year into their marriage. This marked the beginning of a long list of plastic surgeries.‘I would always find out last. She was thinking that she could fix her face like a piece of furniture. Skin does not work that way. But she wouldn’t listen,’ Alec Wildenstein told Vanity Fair.\u0027I don’t think I’ve known her when she wasn’t healing from something,\u0027 said a friend of Jocelyn in 1998. Wildenstein has frequently denied she’s had work done, saying in 1998 that her looks, which led to her being branded ‘Catwoman’, were natural.          In February 2018, the 77-year-old socialite said that she hasn\u0027t had any plastic surgery done‘If I show you pictures of my grandmother,’ she says, ‘what you see is these eyes—cat eyes—and high cheekbones.’ Wildenstein went on to deny she ever had any work done on her nose.After the couple’s children left home, Alec and Wildenstein ended up having ‘constant’ fights.One night, Wildenstein says she walked in on her husband with another woman and alleges he pointed a gun at her and her bodyguards—something Alec disputed, saying Wildenstein was downstairs when he saw the bodyguards.Alec spent the night in jail after the police were called.The pair’s orce was highly public and messy, with Alec slowly cutting Wildenstein’s financial means.Jocelyn Wildenstein before and after plastic surgeryJocelyn Wildenstein reportedly had her first plastic surgery a year after marrying her husband, in 1978. The pair went in for eye-lifts and the surgery was reportedly the first of many.However, in February 2018, Wildenstein and her now second husband, Lloyd Klein both denied she had any work done.\u0027I don\u0027t understand the whole press and the Catwoman thing because Jocelyn always looked like that,\u0027 Klein told DailyMailTV.Jocelyn Wildenstein reportedly had her first plastic surgery, an eye-lift, with Alec in 1978\u0027She never really did anything to change her face. I have pictures from 16 years old where she looks exactly the same as today.\u0027 However, in April 2018, Wildenstein admitted to having surgeries but stopping for a time during her orce from Alec.\u0027In the beginning, it\u0027s why I stopped correcting my appearance because the articles were mean and would repeat the image that my ex-husband tried to paint of me,\u0027 she told Paper Magazine. What is Jocelyn Wildenstein’s net worth?Jocelyn Wildenstein’s net worth is $16,386,100, according to her Chapter 11 bankruptcy documentation.This is a far cry from the $2.5 billion she was awarded during her orce from Alec Wildenstein. The filing lists that the socialite receives a $900 check a month from Social Security, which it says is her only source of income.Jocelyn Wildenstein bankruptcyJocelyn Wildenstein filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in May 2018, reportedly owing 16 creditors over $6 million. This includes hundreds of thousands of dollars to several building contractors, $70,000 to American Express, over $200,000 to two law firms, and $179,000 to Trump world Tower Condominium.Wildenstein also owes a staggering $4.6 million to Castellan Capital and $700,000 to a New York storage company.Dancing With The Stars finale: Date, time, finalists and moreThe French Open 2018: Roland Garros dates, schedule and tickets revealedBachelorette 2018: Chris Harrison reveals premiere will have \u0027most ridiculous fight ever\u0027Who was Stephanie Adams?

Doria, now 61, was 23 when she married TV lighting director Tom Markle in Sunset Boulevard\u0027s Self-Realization Fellowship Temple two days before Christmas 1979          Doria, meanwhile, despite her early promise, did not go to university but started work selling jewellery, almost certainly to help the family financesSo let us go back in time to when Doria Ragland (she now uses her maiden name) was a little girl.Her mother, Jeanette, grew up in Cleveland, Ohio, the daughter of a bellboy and a lift operator, both of whom worked at the smart, whites-only, five-star St Regis Hotel.Jeanette had been previously married to a professional roller-skater, by whom she had two children — Doria\u0027s half-brother and sister.When he skated out of her life, she was left to bring them up alone. After five years struggling as a single mother, Jeanette fell for snappy-dressing, smooth-talking Alvin Ragland and married again.    Barely had Charles and Diana returned from their honeymoon when, in Los Angeles, Doria was giving birth at West Park hospital in Canoga Park to a baby girlTheir only child, Doria, arrived in 1956 and it was soon after her birth that Alvin uprooted the family and set out to make a new life and better himself across country in California.He had relatives on the West Coast and for a time worked for a real estate business run by his aunt Lillie. Later, by the time Doria was five and he was setting up his modest bric-a-brac and antiques business in central Los Angeles, the marriage was crumbling.At around that time, in Norfolk, England, Diana Spencer was born — not yet Lady Diana, as her father, Viscount (\u0027Johnnie\u0027) Spencer, had not then succeeded to the ancient earldom.Spencer, a former officer in the Royal Scots Greys, had been equerry to both the Queen and her father, George VI, while Diana\u0027s mother, Frances, was the younger daughter of the 4th Baron Fermoy.          Meghan Markle and her mother Doria Ragland leave the Windsor Estate after tea with the Queen           Doria Ragland in the Range Rover which took her from tea with the Queen at Windsor to the hotel this evening          Royal fans took pictures of Harry as he greeted crowds outside Windsor Castle this evening They lived on the Queen\u0027s Sandringham estate in Park House, a lovely Victorian pile that is now a hotel for the disabled. Park House was, in fact, where Frances was born: her late father was a great friend of the King and her mother a confidante of the Queen, later the Queen Mother.The lives of the Spencer family and the royals were entwined and the children played together.Diana was the Spencers\u0027 third daughter but not, alas, the longed for son who would secure continuance of the title. When baby Charles arrived three years after Diana, it was an occasion for a firework display in celebration. As a result, although her mother always denied she was a \u0027disappointment\u0027, Diana carried doubts throughout her life.No such doubts, though, in Los Angeles for Doria, who got on well with her two older half-siblings, Joseph and Saundra, even though it wasn\u0027t long before her father abandoned the family home.Joseph recalls their mother, Jeanette, having to be \u0027both the mother and father of the family, bent on keeping them fed, clothed and together, and succeeding\u0027.Here was a woman whose determination is seen in the family as having been passed down to her daughter, Doria, as well as her actress granddaughter Meghan.For Diana, growing up meant a series of nannies as, by the time she was five, her mother was no longer at home, having fallen for wallpaper heir Peter Shand Kydd.Contrary to popular gossip, her mother wasn\u0027t a so-called \u0027bolter\u0027 but fought in court for custody of her children — only to lose, largely because of the infamous intervention of her own mother Ruth, who sided with her son-in-law.In Los Angeles, Doria\u0027s mother struggled on as a single parent, yet family life in her household was warm and stable.Doria was turning into a bright child who got a prized place at the formerly all-white Fairfax High School in West Hollywood. But in 1971, when she was 15, her education was disrupted by the San Fernando earthquake.The quake destroyed nearby Los Angeles High School, so the two schools had to merge. Doria\u0027s school day was rescheduled to begin at 7am and end at noon.Despite the disruption, she remained one of its brighter pupils, a member of the school\u0027s Apex Club for high achievers.No such academic high-flying for Diana. She was privately educated at boarding schools in Norfolk — and later in Kent — at a time when, even though the Queen Charlotte\u0027s Ball era of debutantes was over, little more was expected of girls from aristocratic families than to find a suitable husband.  Accompanied by his older brother, Harry was met with loud cheers from the crowd as he emerged from the castle wearing a grey jacket, white shirt and slacks          \u0027I just want to go to the pub!\u0027: Harry pointed at the Horse and Groom pub behind adoring fans and photographers in Windsor this evening           Harry and Meghan are pictured among a crowd of well-wishers in the groom\u0027s final public appearance as a single manDiana was not academically strong and left school with no O-levels. But she was far from being \u0027thick as two planks\u0027, as she later self-deprecatingly (and foolishly) described herself.The phrase stuck and was used to denigrate her later during the \u0027War of the Waleses\u0027.Doria, meanwhile, despite her early promise, did not go to university but started work selling jewellery, almost certainly to help the family finances.She also assisted in her father\u0027s store, called \u0027Twas New, and ran a bric-a-brac stall in a Sunday flea market. She even managed to work part-time in a travel agency.At this time, Diana was still at West Heath girls\u0027 school in Kent, excelling at swimming, ballet, tap-dancing and piano. For her, there was no question of having to start work when she left West Heath. Instead, it was finishing school in Rougemont, Switzerland, followed by a cordon bleu cookery course in London.In Los Angeles, Doria was deciding to become a showbusiness make-up artist.As with everything she put her hand to, she did well and found herself training on the set of ABC\u0027s TV drama General Hospital.Also there was the large, cheery figure of Tom Markle, the show\u0027s established lighting director, who was orced with two children.Before long she had moved in with him. But it wasn\u0027t all plain sailing, as his daughter Samantha was far from welcoming. To friends, she cruelly took great pleasure in referring to Doria as \u0027the maid\u0027 on account of her being black.Even in 1979, mixed marriages were not common in the U.S. But despite family uncertainty, Tom and Doria were married. The venue, the Self-Realization temple, was Doria\u0027s choice because she had started to follow the teachings of Yogananda, a Hindu yoga guru.          Harry holds a teddy bear with a red jumper as he and Prince William greet crowds outside Windsor Castle this evening  Prince Harry walks around in front of Windsor Castle as he greeted well-wishers on his last evening of bachelorhoodWithin 11 months, Doria was pregnant with Meghan. It was November 1980.Meanwhile, Diana was living in a flat in Earl\u0027s Court, West London, bought for her by her mother as an 18th birthday present, and sharing it with three other girls. She worked as a nanny and part-time nursery school assistant.In July 1980 she and Prince Charles spent a fateful afternoon together at a barbecue in Petworth, West Sussex. He was the most eligible bachelor on the planet, and within weeks he made it known to friends that he had found the woman he wanted to marry.Exactly a year later, theirs was a typically sumptuous royal wedding, with one sad similarity to today\u0027s event — the frailty of the father of the bride.Earl Spencer had suffered a stroke and almost died. But he was at St Paul\u0027s Cathedral to give his daughter away, though everyone knew she was largely supporting him on their walk up the aisle.And so the parallel lives of Diana and Doria continued.Barely had Charles and Diana returned from their honeymoon when, in Los Angeles, Doria was giving birth at West Park hospital in Canoga Park to a baby girl, whom the happy parents called Rachel Meghan. She was their only child. The date of her birth — August 4, 1981 — was a day the British royals were also celebrating: it was the Queen Mother\u0027s 81st birthday.Tom Markle had decorated baby Meghan\u0027s room with Disney characters and few would have thought then that the marriage would not last. He and Doria seemed happy. But Tom spent a long time at work, sometimes 90 hours a week, and eventually the strain began to tell.Meghan had just had her second birthday in 1983 when her parents split up, although they didn\u0027t orce for another five years.As for Charles and Diana, William had been born in June 1982 and Harry followed in September 1984. But already there were tensions in this royal marriage.Doria and Tom agreed to share custody of Meghan, still spent time with each other and even holidayed together.When Tom worked on a television programme, Doria let Meghan watch it with her, and loved it when their daughter rushed to kiss the screen as her father\u0027s name rolled by on the credits.Work would have been a big problem for Doria but for the help of her mother Jeanette, who stepped in to look after Meghan.As her older step-brother Joseph recalls: \u0027My mother babysat and when Doria finished work, she\u0027d go over to my mother\u0027s house to pick her up.\u0027Small wonder that in later years, after Jeanette suffered a stroke, Meghan would sit with her, talking to her granny, holding her hand and cooking for her. Jeanette died in 2000, aged 71.No such harmony at Kensington Palace. At around the time young Meghan was kissing the TV screen, Diana and Harry were watching a TV programme about Prince Charles which focused on Harry\u0027s father\u0027s affair with Camilla Parker Bowles. When her name was mentioned, Harry asked his mother: \u0027Who\u0027s Camilla?\u0027The split between Harry\u0027s parents when he was eight was the prelude to years of acrimony. When, finally, they were orced in 1996, Diana and Charles also shared custody of their two sons.Harry has subsequently said he doesn\u0027t remember much about it, but friends believe the pain of that time was eclipsed by the death of his mother the following year.In the last months of her life, Diana\u0027s relationship with her own mother also suffered. They were no longer speaking at the time of the Princess\u0027s death.For Diana, the unhappiness in her marriage pulled her towards finding consolation in helping others, from Aids and leprosy victims to those maimed by landmines. She was concerned for people at the margins of society.And in LA, Doria was moving in a similar direction — but hers was a switch in career, from make-up to training as a social worker.These days, she concentrates on the geriatric community, working for Didi Hirsch Mental Health Services in West Los Angeles.Such caring values also dictated Meghan\u0027s upbringing. As a child, Doria wanted to show her there was more to the world than the affluent neighbourhood of Woodland Hills, where they lived. So she took her daughter to see life in the slums of Jamaica and the backstreets of the Mexican city of Oaxaca, where Meghan recalls seeing children playing in dirt roads and hawking chewing gum.Diana took the same approach. As boys, William and Harry accompanied their mother to meet rough-sleepers on the streets of London and the charity staff helping them to survive.As Harry and Meghan say their vows today, who could deny that the linking of this couple from two very different worlds would not be quite so smooth were it not for their mothers."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/18/22/4C688EEE00000578-5746491-image-a-5_1526677266827.jpg","title":"DOMINIC SANDBROOK 20 years ago wedding inconceivable","story":"    Prince Harry and Meghan Markle seen leaving Kensington Palace the day before their weddingAnd after all the red-top tabloid headlines, all the traumas of his early life, all the girlfriends, the parties and the scandals, Prince Harry — seasoned in service to his country — has found happiness at last.Good for him. He deserves it.This being the Royal Family, of course, things are never straightforward. To Buckingham Palace, the events of the last week must have felt like an unfolding nightmare.Even by the soap opera standards to which the House of Windsor often descends, the chaotic shambles of Meghan’s semi-estranged father Thomas — who planned to walk her down the aisle, apparently staged pictures for a paparazzo, seemingly suffered a heart attack, decided to cry off, changed his mind and then cried off again so Prince Charles is now doing the honours — marks a tragi-comic low point.Still, even the smoothest wedding build-up is rarely free from moments of panic, and there can be few married couples in Britain unfamiliar with the phenomenon of embarrassing in-laws.In any case, the monarchy has long had a melodramatic dimension, in which calamitous weddings have played a particularly eye-catching part. And when compared with past royal nuptials, the excesses of the House of Markle look almost mundane. Although we typically like to think of royal weddings as fairytale occasions, the truth is that many were like something from an unusually horrific nightmare.No pampered public schoolboys or Corbyn crazed snowflakes: The Open University MUST be saved, says DOMINIC SANDBROOK DOMINIC SANDBROOK: We are one of the most prosperous, stable, literate, sophisticated and safest countries on Earth.

Historian DOMINIC SANDBROOK says Britain has become a nation of overgrown toddlers with a bigoted mob mentality, intolerance and a raging sense of grievance at every slight As two films are released about the man who united our nation, where is a Winston Churchill when we need one?Think, for example, of the marriage of Henry VIII and Anne of Cleves in 1540: the king an obese monstrosity with a stinking ulcer on his leg, his German bride a ‘Flanders mare’ who seemed completely out of her depth.Not surprisingly, it was never consummated: rather ungallantly, Henry claimed he had been put off by the ‘hanging of her breasts and looseness of her flesh’.The real soap opera stars, though, were the Hanoverians, who specialised in laughably catastrophic weddings. The marriage of Frederick, Prince of Wales, in 1736 is a case in point. Once again the bride was German. At just 16, Augusta of Saxe-Gotha did not speak a word of English and was patently terrified.As she shuffled down the aisle at St James’s Palace she was violently sick, not merely over her own dress, but over her new mother-in-law, Queen Caroline.The most spectacularly disastrous royal wedding of all, though, was that of the future George IV to Caroline of Brunswick in 1795.They first met only three days before the wedding, when George was so disgusted with his bride’s appearance that he immediately called for brandy.At the wedding itself, again at St James’s Palace, George arrived drunk, fell over on the steps of the altar and refused to recite his vows until his father, George III, ordered him to comply.

Most of us prefer to judge Ms Markle by her personality, not by her skin pigmentation.Ironically, the monarchy is much more in tune with the instincts of the nation than its chattering-class critics. After all, one in ten British couples now involve people with different ethnicities, while an estimated 833,000 British children are currently being raised by mixed-race couples.In this respect, one family — the Windsors — is the symbol of a bigger story. And that is precisely as it should be.The nation itself, after all, is nothing if it is not an extended family. And the appeal of the Royal Family, when you forget the palaces and pageantry, derives partly from the fact that when we look at them, we see ourselves.Few people embody that more than Harry himself. There cannot be many families who are unfamiliar with the younger son who struggled to find his niche, the party animal who found a serious side or the playboy who grew up.Indeed, one reason that Harry has such wide public appeal is that he is an immediately recognisable figure. Like a modern version of Shakespeare’s Prince Hal — the wayward prince who grew in stature to become Henry V, victor of Agincourt — he has evolved from the days of Nazi fancy-dress party costumes and Las Vegas stripping sessions to serving in Afghanistan and promoting the Invictus Games for injured military veterans.Harry’s is an impressive and inspirational story, not least since he lost his mother in such traumatic circumstances and had to grow up in the glare of the international spotlight.Indeed, I suspect that Harry’s spectacular public approval ratings — one poll recently found that 81 per cent of us have a positive view of him and only 11 per cent have a negative view — reflect the fact that many people still see him as the shell-shocked little boy walking behind his mother’s coffin.No politician could dream of matching such figures. And that, of course, points to another story. In an era when so many other great institutions, from Parliament to the BBC, seem tarnished and beleaguered, the Firm’s sheer resilience, its tenacious grip on our national imagination, remains enormously impressive.Twenty years ago, after the death of Diana, there was a brief burst of apocalyptic talk about the end of the monarchy. But no one is talking about that now. Indeed, when our national destiny seems so uncertain and our public figures inspire such little enthusiasm, the monarchy stands out as the one unchanging fixture, a bulwark of tradition, a beacon of stability in an age of dizzying change.At a time when the world’s most famous republican office is occupied by Donald Trump, the hereditary principle of monarchy looks in pretty robust health to me. After all, the Swedes, the Danes, the Norwegians, the Dutch and the Belgians all have monarchies, and they rank among the safest, richest, most developed and contented societies on earth. Even France’s President Emmanuel Macron — a would-be Napoleon if ever there was one — once remarked that his countrymen are ‘eternally nostalgic’ for their lost kings. ‘The French elect their president to be a monarch,’ he said. ‘Then they want to cut his head off.’In Britain, thankfully, we gave up beheading our kings in 1649. And although other monarchies, from Germany to Russia, have fallen by the wayside, ours remains the supreme symbol of Britishness both at home and abroad.Cynics sometimes like to present us as forelock-tugging lackeys, brainwashed into subservience.But this is nonsense. We know perfectly well that the Royal Family are all too human, with faults and foibles we can all immediately recognise.But the monarchy is the symbol of something bigger, the nation itself — which is why so many metropolitan liberals, the self-styled ‘citizens of nowhere’ who think themselves above the time-honoured loyalties of place and nation, are intellectually incapable of understanding its appeal.Its magic does not lie in the flags and carriages, although they are part of it.The real magic lies in the blend of the national and the inidual, the patriotic and the personal, the past and the present.Of course, the hard-Left can never understand this.Their minds twisted by extremism, their hearts coarsened by envy, they see only privilege where the rest of us see patriotism.Well, let the naysayers stew in their joyless misery. The rest of us, in our tens of millions, would raise a glass to an institution that has served Britain splendidly for centuries, and to two people who deserve a happy future together.For although this is a great national occasion, we should not forget that at its heart are two young people who are not so different, deep down, from thousands of others getting married this summer.So let’s hope today’s happy scenes banish the memories of the last week.And, if you’ll forgive the lèse-majesté, let’s hope the wedding night goes better than it did for Henry VIII. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/18/23/4C68915100000578-0-image-m-30_1526684382761.jpg","title":"Modern man Harry wear wedding ring marrying Meghan Markle","story":"Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, wearing her engagement ring, hold hands at their engagement photocallWhen the Duke of Cambridge married, he followed in the footsteps of his grandfather the Duke of Edinburgh and uncle the Duke of York.They both chose to eschew the traditional symbol of marriage.Royal brides are given wedding rings made from gold nuggets from Clogau St David\u0027s mine at Bontddu in North Wales - and Ms Markle is expected to follow the tradition.Stand By Me, gospel choir, alternate vows and VERY modern...Perfect for a white hot wedding!

During the Giving Of The Rings part of the ceremony in St George\u0027s Chapel tomorrow, Harry and Ms Markle will exchange bands\u0027With my body I honour you, all that I am I give to you, and all that I have I share with you, within the love of God, Father, Son and Holy Spirit.\u0027When Harry receives his ring from Ms Markle, she will place the band on the fourth finger of his left hand, holding it there, before addressing him with the same words.The Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s wedding ring, a plain, slim gold band, was made by royal warrant holders Wartski and fashioned from a nugget of Welsh gold given to William by his grandmother the Queen as a gift to mark his 2011 wedding.The custom of men wearing wedding rings is said to be relatively recent and is believed to have started during the Second World War when servicemen wanted a memento to remind them of their partners back home.  When the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge married, William chose not to wear a wedding ring while Kate didIts popularity increased as the decades passed and as it became more fashionable for men to wear jewellery.In contrast to other royal men, the Prince of Wales does wear a wedding band, under a signet ring on the little finger of his left hand. There may be an element of social class at play for men who decide not to wear a wedding ring as those from the upper classes are said not to like jewellery.The Queen Mother began the tradition of royal wedding rings being made from Welsh gold after the precious metal was used to make her wedding band when she married in 1923.One nugget of gold was used to make the Queen Mother\u0027s wedding ring, the Queen\u0027s in 1947, Princess Margaret\u0027s in 1960, the Princess Royal\u0027s in 1973 and that of Diana, Princess of Wales in 1981.  The Duke of Edinburgh, pictured on his wedding day in November 1947 with the then Princess Elizabeth, is from the generation which traditionally did not wear wedding ringsThe gold came from the Clogau St David\u0027s mine. There is now only a minute sliver, one gram (0.035oz), of the original nugget left.In November 1981, the British Royal Legion presented the Queen with a 36-gram (1.3oz) piece of 21-carat Welsh gold for future royal wedding rings.The Duchess of Cornwall\u0027s wedding ring was also crafted from Welsh gold from the Clogau St David\u0027s mine and the river Mawddach in the King\u0027s Forest.It was handmade in court style by Wartski and the precious metal was supplied by Cambrian Goldfields Limited."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/19/06/4C69E2B700000578-5747285-image-a-27_1526707411013.jpg","title":"Several fissures turn active Hawaiis Kilauea volcano lava flies 200ft air","story":"    Fountains of molten lava spurted 200 feet into the air from Hawaii\u0027s Kilauea volcano on Friday           In addition to the massive expulsions of lava, the volcano is also firing out ballistics the size of refrigerators          The Kilauea volcano has been erupting for more than two weeks now, forcing thousands of residents to flee their homes          Those who stay behind are faced with apocalyptic scenes of burning towns and lava streams across the ground          Pictured: An aerial view shows a new fissure eruption sending lava streaming down-slope in huge rivers in Pahoa on FridayHeart-stopping moment van breaks suddenly in front of a HGVRoyal wedding: Meghan Markle\u0027s mother lands at Heathrow airportMike Tindall discusses Harry and Meghan\u0027s wedding on GMBSoldiers leave Victoria Barracks ready for royal wedding rehearsalRoger Moore stars as James Bond in 1973 film \u0027Live and Let Die\u0027Boeing 737 crashes shortly after takeoff at Havana airportPetting farm owner attacked by travellers on her own landTexas governor confirms ten fatalities in high school shootingShocking moment elderly woman doused in hot water from burst pipeHarry and Meghan arrive in Windsor for royal wedding\u0027s full rehearsal\u0027People will be disappointed\u0027: Robert Lacey on Prince Charles decisionRoyal fans camp in Windsor street the night before weddingFissures 15, 17, 18, 20 and the newly opened 21st and 22nd crack were spewing lava on Friday, and two more homes have been claimed with officials saying the amount of destruction caused would only increase. In the hardest-hit areas of Leilani Estates and Lanipuna Gardens, at least 325 acres of land has been covered by lava. While initial eruptions were sending lava from 1955 into the community, scientists have now established there is new lava flowing into Puna.USGS geologist Janet Babb told Hawaii News Now fresher lava could reach areas further away. \u0027With fresher, hotter magma, there\u0027s the potential that the lava flows can move with greater ease and therefore cover more area,\u0027 she said. A \u0027red level\u0027 of sulphur dioxide was recorded by Pahoa fire station, which means the gas coming from Kilauea could cause choking and an inability to breathe. Responders and residents still on the island are wearing gas masks to protect themselves from the toxic fumes.           Pictured: Fresh lava flowing on to a house.

He is just besotted and cannot wait to make Meghan his wife.\u0027With Mr Markle, a former Hollywood lighting director, recovering from surgery to fit a heart stent, Kensington Palace announced yesterday that Prince Charles would walk his future daughter-in-law to the altar. Sources close to the prince, who will wear a morning suit, said he was \u0027deeply touched\u0027 to have been asked.\u0027It wasn\u0027t something he raised at all … the couple came to him,\u0027 they said. The source added that Charles had met Miss Markle several times and appeared to have struck up a very \u0027genuine bond\u0027 with her and now her mother.Both he and the Duchess of Cornwall seemed delighted by their meeting with Miss Ragland on Wednesday at Clarence House.Miss Markle has always insisted she wanted to arrive at the chapel on her own, even when her father was involved. She was also insistent that she would not be \u0027given away\u0027.It is believed that, as a orcee in her 30s and a feminist, the future royal believed it wasn\u0027t appropriate. At noon today, Charles will await her at the start of the Quire, halfway down the 15th-century chapel, instead of the steps of the building.Miss Markle will arrive in the castle\u0027s quadrangle with her mother at about 11.25am in one of the Queen\u0027s cars. Miss Ragland, a social worker and yoga instructor, is believed to be the only member of Miss Markle\u0027s family attending.Miss Ragland will then transfer to another vehicle and be driven to the Galilee porch, used by the royal family, where she will arrive shortly before Charles and the Queen.Miss Markle will be joined by her bridesmaids and page boys, including Prince George and Princess Charlotte – and will be greeted at the steps to the West Door, decorated with exquisite spring blooms, by the Dean of Windsor, who will walk ahead of her into the church.Last night Mr Markle told US website TMZ he gave the arrangements his blessing. He said he was \u0027honoured and grateful\u0027 that Charles had stepped in and his daughter had called him personally to tell him.Kensington Palace said: \u0027The Order of Service was produced before it became clear Mr Thomas Markle would be unable to attend the wedding … some aspects will be different to what has been printed.\u0027 Stand By Me will be among the hymns in a modern order of service as Prince Harry ties the knot with Meghan Markle in today\u0027s long-awaited royal wedding.The plans for the ceremony at St George\u0027s Chapel, Windsor, include modern wording of the marriage vows along with the hymn Guide Me, O Thou Great Redeemer which was played at Princess Diana\u0027s funeral. Diana\u0027s sister, Lady Jane Fellowes, will also give a reading.Meghan will not promise to \u0027obey\u0027 Prince Harry, in a contemporary version of the vows using modern language such as \u0027you\u0027 rather than \u0027thee\u0027.The Duchess of Cambridge did not promise to \u0027obey\u0027 Prince William in 2011, and neither did Harry\u0027s mother the Princess of Wales in 1981 when she married the Prince of Wales. However the order of service was produced before it became clear that Meghan\u0027s father, Thomas Markle, would be unable to attend, and still mentions his name. There was not enough time to reprint the 600 copies of the 20-page A4 Order of Service.Although the ceremony in the gothic surrounds of Windsor Castle\u0027s chapel is deeply religious, the service will use the words from the more up to date Marriage Service from Common Worship (2000), which features modern language, such as \u0027you\u0027 rather than \u0027thee\u0027 or \u0027thou\u0027.The prince and his American former actress bride will pledge themselves to one another \u0027for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, till death us do part\u0027.In The Declarations part of the service, they will also promise to love, comfort, honour, and protect one another and be faithful to one another for the rest of their lives.Kensington Palace said \u0027like any couple getting married, Prince Harry and Ms. Markle have taken a great deal of care in selecting all elements for their service.\u0027 Yesterday, Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, who will officiate, said Prince Charles was \u0027someone of great care and affection\u0027. He added: \u0027He\u0027s a very warm person and that he\u0027s doing this is a sign of his love and concern and support. I think it\u0027s wonderful. It\u0027s beautiful.\u0027Bishop Michael Curry, primate of the US Episcopal Church, who will give an address, said \u0027different worlds are being brought together\u0027 by the marriage.   Millions around the world are watching but America has been gripped by \u0027Meghan mania\u0027 – and US broadcasters have gone to extraordinary lengths to provide the best possible coverage for their viewers.With prime broadcasting spots given to British TV, American networks have \u0027annexed\u0027 several guesthouses and hotels around Windsor Castle.NBC is said to have \u0027taken over\u0027 the Macdonald Windsor Hotel, opposite the castle, with a team of around 300.The broadcaster has built an \u0027Olympic stadium\u0027-like studio on the rooftop to achieve the best backdrops and have a view of the castle in the background.Yesterday Meghan Markle\u0027s co-stars from the TV legal drama Suits appeared in the studio to tell viewers back home how she revealed her romance with Prince Harry.Meanwhile, rival networks ABC and CBS are said to have removed windows from rooms at the front of the Harte \u0026amp Garter hotel at great expense to create the best shots.And a two-storey temporary media centre has been set up on the Long Walk in Windsor Great Park solely for US journalists to broadcast to fascinated viewers back home.Broadcasters are devoting huge amounts of air time to programmes before and after the wedding, and most are broadcasting or streaming the ceremony live.In 2011, the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton was watched by 23million Americans even though it was the middle of the night for many in the US.But viewing figures are expected to be much higher for Prince Harry and Miss Markle\u0027s ceremony today.  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/19/09/4C6B371C00000578-0-image-m-4_1526719524790.jpg","title":"Princess Dianas ex butler Burrell accosted security Windsor","story":"    Princess Diana\u0027s former butler Paul Burrell was spotted trying to gain access to a private area in Windsor this morningThis comes after earlier this week Burrell said that Diana will be  at the wedding of her son Prince Harry \u0027in spirit\u0027.Mr Burrell, who was a servant for the royal family for several years, added that the Princess of Wales would have \u0027approved\u0027 of Harry\u0027s fiancee.The former butler to Diana has been accused of cashing in on his time spent serving the royal family after he released a book in 2003 and appeared on the Australian version of I\u0027m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!And he has been back in the spotlight ahead of this week, lining up a serious of media appearances to speak about the pending nuptials.           The television presenter was pictured being accosted by security as he walked through the market town where Prince Harry will wed Meghan Markle later today"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/19/11/4C6BD31900000578-5747567-George_Clooney_and_his_lawyer_wife_Amal_arrive_at_St_George_s_Ch-a-99_1526726201432.jpg","title":"Oprah Winfrey Idris Elba famous faces royal wedding","story":"George and Amal Clooney led a who\u0027s who of some of the world\u0027s top celebrities heading into the royal wedding this morning  George Clooney and his lawyer wife Amal arrive at St George\u0027s Chapel for the royal wedding.

He deserves it.This being the Royal Family, of course, things are never straightforward. To Buckingham Palace, the events of the last week must have felt like an unfolding nightmare.Even by the soap opera standards to which the House of Windsor often descends, the chaotic shambles of Meghan’s semi-estranged father Thomas — who planned to walk her down the aisle, apparently staged pictures for a paparazzo, seemingly suffered a heart attack, decided to cry off, changed his mind and then cried off again so Prince Charles is now doing the honours — marks a tragi-comic low point.Still, even the smoothest wedding build-up is rarely free from moments of panic, and there can be few married couples in Britain unfamiliar with the phenomenon of embarrassing in-laws.In any case, the monarchy has long had a melodramatic dimension, in which calamitous weddings have played a particularly eye-catching part. And when compared with past royal nuptials, the excesses of the House of Markle look almost mundane. Although we typically like to think of royal weddings as fairytale occasions, the truth is that many were like something from an unusually horrific nightmare.No pampered public schoolboys or Corbyn crazed snowflakes: The Open University MUST be saved, says DOMINIC SANDBROOK DOMINIC SANDBROOK: We are one of the most prosperous, stable, literate, sophisticated and safest countries on Earth.

But to say our WWII troops were fighting for European values is insulting bunkum, writes DOMINIC SANDBROOK The era of hysteria! Historian DOMINIC SANDBROOK says Britain has become a nation of overgrown toddlers with a bigoted mob mentality, intolerance and a raging sense of grievance at every slight As two films are released about the man who united our nation, where is a Winston Churchill when we need one?Think, for example, of the marriage of Henry VIII and Anne of Cleves in 1540: the king an obese monstrosity with a stinking ulcer on his leg, his German bride a ‘Flanders mare’ who seemed completely out of her depth.Not surprisingly, it was never consummated: rather ungallantly, Henry claimed he had been put off by the ‘hanging of her breasts and looseness of her flesh’.The real soap opera stars, though, were the Hanoverians, who specialised in laughably catastrophic weddings. The marriage of Frederick, Prince of Wales, in 1736 is a case in point. Once again the bride was German. At just 16, Augusta of Saxe-Gotha did not speak a word of English and was patently terrified.As she shuffled down the aisle at St James’s Palace she was violently sick, not merely over her own dress, but over her new mother-in-law, Queen Caroline.The most spectacularly disastrous royal wedding of all, though, was that of the future George IV to Caroline of Brunswick in 1795.They first met only three days before the wedding, when George was so disgusted with his bride’s appearance that he immediately called for brandy.At the wedding itself, again at St James’s Palace, George arrived drunk, fell over on the steps of the altar and refused to recite his vows until his father, George III, ordered him to comply.          Meghan Markle and her mother, Doria Ragland, arriving at Cliveden House Hotel on the National Trust\u0027s Cliveden Estate to spend the night before her wedding to Prince Harry    A fan of the Royal Family poses in a Union Jack outfit in Windsor ahead of the wedding Although we live in an age of risible hysteria about race and ‘ersity’, especially in the upper echelons of the BBC and in our major universities, most normal people see nothing sensational in the thought of the Queen’s grandson marrying a brown-skinned American. Most of us prefer to judge Ms Markle by her personality, not by her skin pigmentation.Ironically, the monarchy is much more in tune with the instincts of the nation than its chattering-class critics. After all, one in ten British couples now involve people with different ethnicities, while an estimated 833,000 British children are currently being raised by mixed-race couples.In this respect, one family — the Windsors — is the symbol of a bigger story. And that is precisely as it should be.The nation itself, after all, is nothing if it is not an extended family. And the appeal of the Royal Family, when you forget the palaces and pageantry, derives partly from the fact that when we look at them, we see ourselves.Few people embody that more than Harry himself. There cannot be many families who are unfamiliar with the younger son who struggled to find his niche, the party animal who found a serious side or the playboy who grew up.Indeed, one reason that Harry has such wide public appeal is that he is an immediately recognisable figure. Like a modern version of Shakespeare’s Prince Hal — the wayward prince who grew in stature to become Henry V, victor of Agincourt — he has evolved from the days of Nazi fancy-dress party costumes and Las Vegas stripping sessions to serving in Afghanistan and promoting the Invictus Games for injured military veterans.Harry’s is an impressive and inspirational story, not least since he lost his mother in such traumatic circumstances and had to grow up in the glare of the international spotlight.Indeed, I suspect that Harry’s spectacular public approval ratings — one poll recently found that 81 per cent of us have a positive view of him and only 11 per cent have a negative view — reflect the fact that many people still see him as the shell-shocked little boy walking behind his mother’s coffin.No politician could dream of matching such figures. And that, of course, points to another story. In an era when so many other great institutions, from Parliament to the BBC, seem tarnished and beleaguered, the Firm’s sheer resilience, its tenacious grip on our national imagination, remains enormously impressive.Twenty years ago, after the death of Diana, there was a brief burst of apocalyptic talk about the end of the monarchy. But no one is talking about that now. Indeed, when our national destiny seems so uncertain and our public figures inspire such little enthusiasm, the monarchy stands out as the one unchanging fixture, a bulwark of tradition, a beacon of stability in an age of dizzying change.At a time when the world’s most famous republican office is occupied by Donald Trump, the hereditary principle of monarchy looks in pretty robust health to me. After all, the Swedes, the Danes, the Norwegians, the Dutch and the Belgians all have monarchies, and they rank among the safest, richest, most developed and contented societies on earth. Even France’s President Emmanuel Macron — a would-be Napoleon if ever there was one — once remarked that his countrymen are ‘eternally nostalgic’ for their lost kings. ‘The French elect their president to be a monarch,’ he said. ‘Then they want to cut his head off.’In Britain, thankfully, we gave up beheading our kings in 1649. And although other monarchies, from Germany to Russia, have fallen by the wayside, ours remains the supreme symbol of Britishness both at home and abroad.Cynics sometimes like to present us as forelock-tugging lackeys, brainwashed into subservience.But this is nonsense. We know perfectly well that the Royal Family are all too human, with faults and foibles we can all immediately recognise.But the monarchy is the symbol of something bigger, the nation itself — which is why so many metropolitan liberals, the self-styled ‘citizens of nowhere’ who think themselves above the time-honoured loyalties of place and nation, are intellectually incapable of understanding its appeal.Its magic does not lie in the flags and carriages, although they are part of it.The real magic lies in the blend of the national and the inidual, the patriotic and the personal, the past and the present.Of course, the hard-Left can never understand this.Their minds twisted by extremism, their hearts coarsened by envy, they see only privilege where the rest of us see patriotism.Well, let the naysayers stew in their joyless misery. The rest of us, in our tens of millions, would raise a glass to an institution that has served Britain splendidly for centuries, and to two people who deserve a happy future together.For although this is a great national occasion, we should not forget that at its heart are two young people who are not so different, deep down, from thousands of others getting married this summer.So let’s hope today’s happy scenes banish the memories of the last week.And, if you’ll forgive the lèse-majesté, let’s hope the wedding night goes better than it did for Henry VIII. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/18/23/4C68915100000578-0-image-m-30_1526684382761.jpg","title":"Modern man Harry wear wedding ring marrying Meghan Markle","story":"Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, wearing her engagement ring, hold hands at their engagement photocallWhen the Duke of Cambridge married, he followed in the footsteps of his grandfather the Duke of Edinburgh and uncle the Duke of York.They both chose to eschew the traditional symbol of marriage.Royal brides are given wedding rings made from gold nuggets from Clogau St David\u0027s mine at Bontddu in North Wales - and Ms Markle is expected to follow the tradition.Stand By Me, gospel choir, alternate vows and VERY modern...Perfect for a white hot wedding!

When the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge married, William chose not to wear a wedding ring while Kate didIts popularity increased as the decades passed and as it became more fashionable for men to wear jewellery.In contrast to other royal men, the Prince of Wales does wear a wedding band, under a signet ring on the little finger of his left hand. There may be an element of social class at play for men who decide not to wear a wedding ring as those from the upper classes are said not to like jewellery.The Queen Mother began the tradition of royal wedding rings being made from Welsh gold after the precious metal was used to make her wedding band when she married in 1923.One nugget of gold was used to make the Queen Mother\u0027s wedding ring, the Queen\u0027s in 1947, Princess Margaret\u0027s in 1960, the Princess Royal\u0027s in 1973 and that of Diana, Princess of Wales in 1981.  The Duke of Edinburgh, pictured on his wedding day in November 1947 with the then Princess Elizabeth, is from the generation which traditionally did not wear wedding ringsThe gold came from the Clogau St David\u0027s mine. There is now only a minute sliver, one gram (0.035oz), of the original nugget left.In November 1981, the British Royal Legion presented the Queen with a 36-gram (1.3oz) piece of 21-carat Welsh gold for future royal wedding rings.The Duchess of Cornwall\u0027s wedding ring was also crafted from Welsh gold from the Clogau St David\u0027s mine and the river Mawddach in the King\u0027s Forest.It was handmade in court style by Wartski and the precious metal was supplied by Cambrian Goldfields Limited."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/19/06/4C69E2B700000578-5747285-image-a-27_1526707411013.jpg","title":"Several fissures turn active Hawaiis Kilauea volcano lava flies 200ft air","story":"    Fountains of molten lava spurted 200 feet into the air from Hawaii\u0027s Kilauea volcano on Friday           In addition to the massive expulsions of lava, the volcano is also firing out ballistics the size of refrigerators          The Kilauea volcano has been erupting for more than two weeks now, forcing thousands of residents to flee their homes          Those who stay behind are faced with apocalyptic scenes of burning towns and lava streams across the ground          Pictured: An aerial view shows a new fissure eruption sending lava streaming down-slope in huge rivers in Pahoa on FridayHeart-stopping moment van breaks suddenly in front of a HGVRoyal wedding: Meghan Markle\u0027s mother lands at Heathrow airportMike Tindall discusses Harry and Meghan\u0027s wedding on GMBSoldiers leave Victoria Barracks ready for royal wedding rehearsalRoger Moore stars as James Bond in 1973 film \u0027Live and Let Die\u0027Boeing 737 crashes shortly after takeoff at Havana airportPetting farm owner attacked by travellers on her own landTexas governor confirms ten fatalities in high school shootingShocking moment elderly woman doused in hot water from burst pipeHarry and Meghan arrive in Windsor for royal wedding\u0027s full rehearsal\u0027People will be disappointed\u0027: Robert Lacey on Prince Charles decisionRoyal fans camp in Windsor street the night before weddingFissures 15, 17, 18, 20 and the newly opened 21st and 22nd crack were spewing lava on Friday, and two more homes have been claimed with officials saying the amount of destruction caused would only increase. In the hardest-hit areas of Leilani Estates and Lanipuna Gardens, at least 325 acres of land has been covered by lava. While initial eruptions were sending lava from 1955 into the community, scientists have now established there is new lava flowing into Puna.USGS geologist Janet Babb told Hawaii News Now fresher lava could reach areas further away. \u0027With fresher, hotter magma, there\u0027s the potential that the lava flows can move with greater ease and therefore cover more area,\u0027 she said. A \u0027red level\u0027 of sulphur dioxide was recorded by Pahoa fire station, which means the gas coming from Kilauea could cause choking and an inability to breathe. Responders and residents still on the island are wearing gas masks to protect themselves from the toxic fumes.           Pictured: Fresh lava flowing on to a house.

She and six other activists have been arrestedThe activists had persistently called for the right for women to drive, with the ban to be lifted in just six weeks.However, they stressed that this was only the first step toward full rights and for year also called for an end to less visible forms of discrimination.They campaigned for lifting guardianship laws that give male relatives final say on whether a woman can travel abroad, obtain a passport, or marry.Their movement was seen as part of a larger democratic and civil rights push in the kingdom, which remains an absolute monarchy where protests are illegal.All major decision-making rests with the king and his son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.Some state-linked media outlets published the names of those detained, which include Loujain al-Hathloul, Aziza al-Yousef and Eman al-Najfan.Rights activists said Madeha al-Ajroush and Aisha al-Manae are also among the seven detained. Both took part in the first women\u0027s protest movement for the right to drive in 1990, in which 50 women were arrested for driving and lost their passports and their jobs.All five women are well-known activists who agitated for greater women\u0027s rights. Several of the women were professors at state-run universities and are mothers or grandmothers.The Interior Ministry on Saturday did not name those arrested, but said the group is being investigated for communicating with \u0027foreign entities\u0027. It said they were working to recruit people in sensitive government positions and giving money to foreign circles aiming to destabilise and harm the kingdom.The stunning arrests come just six weeks before Saudi Arabia is set to lift the world\u0027s only ban on women driving next month.  Loujain al-Hathloul was another of the seven activists branded \u0027traitors\u0027 who were working for \u0027foreign entities\u0027When the kingdom issued its royal decree last year announcing that women would be allowed to drive in 2018, women\u0027s rights activists were contacted by the royal court and warned against giving interviews to the media or speaking out on social media.Following the warnings, some women left the country for a period of time and others stopped voicing their opinions on Twitter.As activists were pressured into silence, Saudi Arabia\u0027s 32-year-old heir to the throne stepped forth, positioning himself as the force behind the kingdom\u0027s reforms.However, Human Rights Watch said the crown prince\u0027s so-called reform campaign \u0027has been a frenzy of fear for genuine Saudi reformers who dare to advocate publicly for human rights or women\u0027s empowerment\u0027.\u0027The message is clear that anyone expressing skepticism about the crown prince\u0027s rights agenda faces time in jail,\u0027 Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director at Human Rights Watch, saidLast year, Prince Mohammed oversaw the arrests of dozens of writers, intellectuals and moderate clerics who were perceived as critics of his foreign policies. He also led an unprecedented shakedown of top princes and businessmen, forcing them to hand over significant portions of their wealth in exchange for their freedom as part of a purported anti-corruption campaign.In an interview with CBS in March, he said that he was \u0027absolutely\u0027 sending a message through these arrests that there was a new sheriff in town.Activists said writer Mohammed al-Rabea and lawyer Ibrahim al-Mudaimigh, two men who worked to support women\u0027s rights campaigners, are also among the seven detained.   Their movement was seen as part of a larger democratic and civil rights push in the kingdom, which remains an absolute monarchy where protests are illegal and major decision-making rests with the king and his son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (pictured)Al-Mudaimigh defended al-Hathloul in court when she was arrested in late 2014 for more than 70 days for her online criticism of the government and for attempting to bring attention to the driving ban by driving from neighboring United Arab Emirates into Saudi Arabia.Those familiar with the arrests said al-Hathloul was forcibly taken by security forces earlier this year from the UAE, where she was residing, and forced back to the kingdom.In recent weeks, activists said several women\u0027s rights campaigners were also banned from traveling abroad.Immediately after news of the arrests broke, pro-government Twitter accounts were branding the group as treasonous under an Arabic hashtag describing them as traitors for foreign embassies.The pro-government SaudiNews50 Twitter account, with its 11.5 million followers, splashed images of those arrested with red stamps over their face that read \u0027traitor\u0027 and saying that \u0027history spits in the face of the country\u0027s traitors.\u0027The state-linked Al-Jazirah newspaper published on its front-page a photo of al-Hathloul and al-Yousef under a headline describing them as citizens who betrayed the nation.Activists said some in the group were arrested on Tuesday and at least one person was arrested Thursday.They said the detainees were transferred from the capital, Riyadh, to the city of Jiddah for interrogations where the royal court has relocated for the month of Ramadan.Activists said it wasn\u0027t not clear why the seven were arrested now."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/19/13/4C6DF84900000578-5747477-image-m-324_1526732448018.jpg","title":"En route Prince Harry leaves Coworth Park hotel

He is just besotted and cannot wait to make Meghan his wife.\u0027With Mr Markle, a former Hollywood lighting director, recovering from surgery to fit a heart stent, Kensington Palace announced yesterday that Prince Charles would walk his future daughter-in-law to the altar. Sources close to the prince, who will wear a morning suit, said he was \u0027deeply touched\u0027 to have been asked.\u0027It wasn\u0027t something he raised at all … the couple came to him,\u0027 they said. The source added that Charles had met Miss Markle several times and appeared to have struck up a very \u0027genuine bond\u0027 with her and now her mother.Both he and the Duchess of Cornwall seemed delighted by their meeting with Miss Ragland on Wednesday at Clarence House.Miss Markle has always insisted she wanted to arrive at the chapel on her own, even when her father was involved. She was also insistent that she would not be \u0027given away\u0027.It is believed that, as a orcee in her 30s and a feminist, the future royal believed it wasn\u0027t appropriate. At noon today, Charles will await her at the start of the Quire, halfway down the 15th-century chapel, instead of the steps of the building.Miss Markle will arrive in the castle\u0027s quadrangle with her mother at about 11.25am in one of the Queen\u0027s cars. Miss Ragland, a social worker and yoga instructor, is believed to be the only member of Miss Markle\u0027s family attending.Miss Ragland will then transfer to another vehicle and be driven to the Galilee porch, used by the royal family, where she will arrive shortly before Charles and the Queen.Miss Markle will be joined by her bridesmaids and page boys, including Prince George and Princess Charlotte – and will be greeted at the steps to the West Door, decorated with exquisite spring blooms, by the Dean of Windsor, who will walk ahead of her into the church.Last night Mr Markle told US website TMZ he gave the arrangements his blessing. He said he was \u0027honoured and grateful\u0027 that Charles had stepped in and his daughter had called him personally to tell him.Kensington Palace said: \u0027The Order of Service was produced before it became clear Mr Thomas Markle would be unable to attend the wedding … some aspects will be different to what has been printed.\u0027 Stand By Me will be among the hymns in a modern order of service as Prince Harry ties the knot with Meghan Markle in today\u0027s long-awaited royal wedding.The plans for the ceremony at St George\u0027s Chapel, Windsor, include modern wording of the marriage vows along with the hymn Guide Me, O Thou Great Redeemer which was played at Princess Diana\u0027s funeral. Diana\u0027s sister, Lady Jane Fellowes, will also give a reading.Meghan will not promise to \u0027obey\u0027 Prince Harry, in a contemporary version of the vows using modern language such as \u0027you\u0027 rather than \u0027thee\u0027.The Duchess of Cambridge did not promise to \u0027obey\u0027 Prince William in 2011, and neither did Harry\u0027s mother the Princess of Wales in 1981 when she married the Prince of Wales. However the order of service was produced before it became clear that Meghan\u0027s father, Thomas Markle, would be unable to attend, and still mentions his name. There was not enough time to reprint the 600 copies of the 20-page A4 Order of Service.Although the ceremony in the gothic surrounds of Windsor Castle\u0027s chapel is deeply religious, the service will use the words from the more up to date Marriage Service from Common Worship (2000), which features modern language, such as \u0027you\u0027 rather than \u0027thee\u0027 or \u0027thou\u0027.The prince and his American former actress bride will pledge themselves to one another \u0027for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, till death us do part\u0027.In The Declarations part of the service, they will also promise to love, comfort, honour, and protect one another and be faithful to one another for the rest of their lives.Kensington Palace said \u0027like any couple getting married, Prince Harry and Ms. Markle have taken a great deal of care in selecting all elements for their service.\u0027 Yesterday, Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, who will officiate, said Prince Charles was \u0027someone of great care and affection\u0027. He added: \u0027He\u0027s a very warm person and that he\u0027s doing this is a sign of his love and concern and support. I think it\u0027s wonderful.

I’ve been through phases of dressing like a goth, a hippy and a really girly girl. As a student, I read economics and philosophy, then worked for a PR company where everyone dressed in suits. Then, after reading an article that said you should follow your passion according to which part of the newspaper you read first, I pivoted into a career in food with an apprenticeship at Jamie Oliver’s Fifteen restaurant. I’ve worked hot shifts in busy kitchens, and now I spend my time testing recipes, going on food photoshoots and writing about cooking, alongside looking after my two-year-old son at home. But through it all, I’ve kept a very consistent look. I’ve always admired women who reinvent themselves dramatically, but that’s just never been my way. Happily, I’ve always been content in my own skin and I put that down to my mum.Looking back on myself as a little girl, I was so pretty and sweet but I didn’t always feel it. I wore glasses, which I hated, so I ditched them for contact lenses as soon as I could. However, at quite a young age I realised that despite what I looked like, my value came from my inside not my outside. That discovery was thanks to Mum. She really instilled in my sister, Laura, and me that makeup was there for us to use if we wanted it, but that it wasn’t something we should put on for anyone beyond ourselves. As a teenager I would play around with pink pearlescent lipsticks and questionable eyeshadows and it was always a fun part of dressing up – it never felt essential. As a proud feminist, Mum has only ever dressed for herself, and is naturally very beautiful. She has the most vibrant, glowing skin and has never worn a scrap of foundation. I carry her belief inside me, which is that I’m worth more than what I put on my face.Following my apprenticeship, I worked in restaurant kitchens in London and around the world. I’d swapped the corporate world of heels and power suits for a predominantly male environment. I’d still wear makeup in the kitchen but not too much – opening an oven door, for instance, can melt off your mascara. I’d wear chef’s whites, made for men, with my hair scraped back. The chef’s outfit was defeminising and sometimes that was useful, especially on the occasions where I’d have to bring out my inner alpha female. But I also wanted to feel like a woman – and to feel like myself – and a little makeup helped me mark myself out from the boys, even if it was just a lick of mascara, some blusher and a dot of concealer.When I left the kitchens to work for Jamie Oliver on his food team, helping him to write recipes, make his TV shows and make his food look good in pictures, I was introduced to a whole new world of photoshoots, lights and cameras.And, thanks to my work, I’ve had my eyes opened to the fact that there’s more than just one makeup setting – it doesn’t have to always be a natural base and a flick of eyeliner.This was brought home to me in the run up to my wedding, two years ago. John and I married in a beautiful church on an island in north Wales. It was an idyllic setting but I wasn’t sure I’d be able to get a makeup artist to take the trip, so my dear friend Ceri bought me a three-hour makeup lesson in London with an amazing woman called Sasha, so that I could do my own on the day. It was fantastic and so much better than watching a YouTube tutorial. Obviously I don’t often recreate the look I wore on my wedding day (although it was very natural), but thanks to that lesson, I have a few different “faces” that I can bring out, depending on the occasion. And while I’m often happy to embrace the day bare-faced, I do have a go-to look that suits me most days. Having never been a morning person – and now with my son Dylan, two, to look after – I can do the whole thing in seven minutes: light foundation, cream concealer, bronzer, peachy blusher, eyelash curlers, mascara and a smear of lip balm. I’ve done it on the tube and in the back of a taxi.There’s a definite synergy that connects the way I look and the ethos behind my style of cooking. My recipes are full of fresh, vibrant, earthy flavours and that’s reflected in how I present myself. I like clothes made from natural fabrics that feel good on my skin in colours that reflect nature – my love of things that come from the earth pervades every aspect of my life. With the food I make, I try to put joy at the centre of every plate, and that’s how I approach getting ready in the morning. Those seven minutes are probably the only time I spend on myself during the whole day. It’s a ritual that helps me to feel bright and ready to face the day.Photography: Brian Daly and Louisa Parry"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d296d2c2e4b7861b1b71142c0514c65b787e536/0_265_5007_3006/master/5007.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=44a177647e97ed3fba38ce7508d70f1d","title":"chris grayling east coast mainline nationalisation","story":"Struggling to supply a lick of bright paint to his plans for the east coast mainline, Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, settled on the word “iconic”. He told the Commons on Wednesday that the new, publicly owned operator scheduled to replace the failed Virgin-Stagecoach combine next month will be called the LNER. “One of Britain’s iconic rail brands … the London North Eastern Railway,” he said, getting it half right as usual: the original title had a conjunction – it was the London and North Eastern Railway – which gives a truer idea of its scope. Without the conjunction, it might be a suburban transport network that reaches no further than Enfield. With it, you have a notion of the 500-mile line that connects London King’s Cross to the great cathedrals of York and Durham, and skirts the North Sea all the way from Alnmouth to Aberdeen.Does pedantry always come with a liking for railways? Perhaps it does. (I often wonder at my own irritation. In the film Dunkirk, for example, the evacuees from the beaches come ashore in England to entrain in a carriage that obviously dates from the 1950s. Why oh why? ) But if railway enthusiasm can mean pedantry, and pedantry can mean truthfulness, then we might conclude that Grayling spent very little of his youth on the station platforms of Buckinghamshire, where he grew up. He was born in 1962, after all, which means that by the time he went to school in High Wycombe trainspotting was close to vanishing as a mainstream pastime for adolescent boys. He may have been aware that the railway that ran through his town was one of Britain’s last main lines, built jointly by the Great Western and Great Central to connect London more directly with the Midlands and the north he may also have known that, after the railway amalgamations of 1923, the LNER itself sent trains rushing through the Chiltern Hills. But a man who uses the phrase “iconic rail brands” does not seem likely to have been such a boy.I saw what I think of as my first LNER engine in December 1948. I know the year and the month because we were on our way from Lancashire to my grandparents’ golden wedding in Fife, and snow lay thick in the cuttings as our train climbed to the summits at Shap and Beattock. The railways had been nationalised in January that year, and, so far as I knew, as a child born into old London, Midland and Scottish territory, all engines were shabby and black. Then, at Carlisle, my brother pointed out a green engine – “apple-green” was the LNER’s description – that had probably travelled across England at the head of a train from Newcastle. I never saw one so unforgettably green again – it must have been one of the very last to have been painted in LNER colours – though a duller green was eventually adopted as the livery for the express classes on British Railways after an experimental year or two in a rich dark blue.When we moved north a few years later, to a house at the end of the Forth bridge, we found ourselves firmly in the LNER’s old domain. “Iconic” wasn’t then a word in regular use, but it would be true to say that the company had established a reputation for speed and modernity, which it owed to real achievement as well as a gifted publicity department. It was an LNER engine, the Mallard, that held the world speed record for steam traction (126mph near Grantham, 3 July 1938), and 15 years later locomotives of the same streamlined class regularly passed the bottom of our street, with names such as Empire of India, Commonwealth of Australia, Kingfisher and Merlin. Wedge-shaped fronts improved their aerodynamics and lifted smoke clear of the driver’s line of sight, while their distinctive chime whistles made us aware of their coming when still miles away. No other British steam engines took trains so frequently to speeds above 100mph, including the Flying Scotsman but then no other railway had a flatter or straighter mainline.Many children of my generation also witnessed the past in another way. From the late 1940s, writers such as John Betjeman, C Hamilton Ellis and OS Nock published essays and books that implied the golden age of British railways had died with the first world war. They would take a fragment of memory (like mine of the green engine at Carlisle) and from it construct what almost amounted to a worldview: Things Were Better Before. When this nostalgia was combined with an English distaste for state ownership, fostered by publications as disparate as Orwell’s 1984 and the , it left the nationalised railway with few friends and it was no wonder that when John Major talked of railway privatisation he summoned visions of the marvellous old Great Western and its coaches in their livery of chocolate and cream.The company that won the first franchise on the east coast mainline also reflected this affection – in its name, the Great North Eastern Railway, and also in the Victorian coat of arms that embellished the side of its trains, and the handsome blue-and-white crockery in its restaurant cars. None of this old-fashioned elegance, however, could alter the fact that it had overbid for its franchise – which also proved the case with its unloved successor, National Express, so that the service was taken into public ownership in 2009 and held there until the latest over-bidders, Virgin and Stagecoach, came along in 2015.Despite this unhappy record, Grayling is determined that the franchise will be delivered into private hands once again in 2020, this time as part of an experimental partnership with the owners of the track, the public institution Network Rail. The details are so far unspecified. All we know is that we have a brand, LNER, that floats disconnected from any historical reality. At least, unlike its immediate predecessors, it sounds neither like a soap powder nor a bourbon. For this small dignity we should be grateful."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e6dfca7dc97294668095c332db03ed678dd55f0/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a86982d0ac7b1f0a4511def756dc001e","title":"harry meghan republican royal wedding","story":"The royal wedding, as we now know it, was born in 1922. The marriage of Princess Mary to Viscount Lascelles was, it is said, less an arranged union than a forced one. Lascelles bet his friends that if he asked King George V’s only daughter to marry him she’d say yes. Mary was not keen. But the king insisted. Whatever private anxiety there might have been was buried deep beneath the public ceremony.Monarchies elsewhere had fallen foul of popular uprisings Britain’s royals felt they had to work for their privileges. Five years earlier, during the first world war, the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha had rebranded itself the House of Windsor to establish some distance from their German lineage.Mary’s wedding was another opportunity to connect with the public. For the first time in a long time a royal wedding was held at Westminster Abbey, with a full procession and coverage by Pathé News. “It is now no longer Mary’s wedding,” wrote her brother, the future George VI. “But (this from the papers) it is the ‘Abbey Wedding’ or the ‘Royal Wedding’ or the ‘National Wedding’ or even the ‘People’s Wedding’.”Royal weddings are no more about two people being in love than a presidential inauguration is about a politician’s first day in a new job. That doesn’t mean the couple in question don’t necessarily love each other. Only that it is not a prerequisite for the ceremony.When it comes to royal events it is not iniduals but the institution – the monarchy – that really counts. So the nuptials of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are a private ceremony only in the formal sense that it is not an official state occasion. It will be televised, has received acres of newspaper coverage, has 600 guests, costs £32m, and 1,200 “commoners” have been nominated to “join in”.I wish it was private. Then they could have their seclusion and I could ignore it. But then what would the point of that be? “To be invisible,” wrote the 19th-century constitutionalist Walter Bagehot, “is to be forgotten … To be a symbol, and an effective symbol, you must be vividly and often seen.”I for one have already seen enough. I’m a republican for all the obvious reasons. A monarchy establishes inherited privilege at the heart of government and embeds patronage at the centre of power. The royals are a class act. And that’s the problem. I’m not a very passionate republican – many things bother me more than the monarchy. But as principles go it is unwavering. We have a class problem in Britain and the monarchy exemplifies it. If it’s a guilty pleasure I’m after, I don’t turn to betrothals in real-world feudal dynasties: I have Netflix. The political scientist Benedict Anderson described countries as imagined communities. Call me a misery guts, but I’d rather imagine one in which I am born a citizen, not a subject, and others are not born to govern me.I’d be fine leaving the whole thing alone the trouble is it won’t leave me alone. Last week Harry and Meghan showed up in both my kids’ book bags – they’d been invited by their schools to celebrate their wedding by wearing red, white and blue or buying cupcakes or both.This is propaganda through tasty pastry. The purpose of these highly scripted and tightly choreographed weddings is twofold: to renew the monarchy’s sense of legitimacy and to establish its relevance. Those who claim God has ordained that they should rule over everyone else will always have to worry about credibility. The Russian tsar executed by the Bolsheviks was the Queen’s grandfather’s cousin. Her husband, Prince Phillip, was evacuated from Greece as a baby on a warship in a cot made from a fruit box. So she knows a thing or two about what can happen when legitimacy is lost.It is worth noting that the wedding in which the most royal PR capital has been invested – between Prince Charles and Lady Diana – was for the marriage that failed most publicly and calamitously. The uncertain response to Diana’s death was the one occasion in recent memory the institution looked vulnerable. For all that, the monarchy seems safe. Half of Britons think it is good for Britain and even more believe it should continue.Given the parlous state of our political class, the polarised nature of our political culture and the absurd figure we cut on the world stage following the Brexit vote, institutions such as the monarchy can be reassuring for some. A royal wedding provides a semblance of stability and the hope of unity for those who’d favour the certainties of a benign dictatorship over the vagaries of democracy.The royals’ relevance relates to their ability to adapt their elite entitlements to the popular mood. The Queen, for example, used clothing ration coupons to pay for her wedding dress (the government gave her £200 extra). Meanwhile both the Duchess of Cambridge and Markle have university degrees, the first royal brides who can claim such erudition. Being black, Markle is the first who can claim such melanin. These attributes, we’re told, illustrate the institution’s capacity to evolve. If anything they reveal the opposite. Women with university degrees and interracial marriages are neither recent nor rare in Britain. The fact they are remarkable at this level of the aristocracy is itself remarkable.But the weddings I enjoy are the ones where I know the people getting married. I have no more inclination to be interested in this wedding than to wander into a random church on a Saturday afternoon and become engrossed in the ceremony of anyone else I don’t know. I don’t begrudge anyone feeling differently. I understand that all sorts of people see all sorts of things in her, him, them and it. And I get the intrigue over Charles’s late entry as the candidate to walk Markle down the aisle. “A princely marriage is the brilliant edition of a universal fact, and, as such, it rivets mankind,” wrote Bagehot. “A royal family sweetens politics by the seasonable addition of nice and pretty events.”Once upon a time maybe. But at this stage the appeal for many seems to lie in a cross between Red Nose Day and the Eurovision song contest – a camp and kitschy licence to be lowbrow on a national scale. If they can derive pleasure from the elite marriage of strangers, that’s great. I bear no animus towards the happy couple on their big day.I am a republican and a humanist. Indeed, I am a republican because I am a humanist. I wish the iniduals well and the institution ill."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6a97d99d5e479c83c6835d20c3f4bb977126b76/0_0_2848_1709/master/2848.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f47d5b5bee58113d28bf88138bebacb","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"Sea otters, an African forest elephant and endangered Francois’ langurs are among this week’s pick of images from the natural world"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f4fd254159122e51ea952115b76fdaae0df66e81/0_0_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a8c8f79039639a3e0e3e3f67d60ddab9","title":"cannes film festival 2018 search for meaning on the croisette","story":"As the final credits roll at this year’s film festival, a contentious lineup has left audiences with more questions than answersAt the closing stages of this year’s Cannes film festival the guests gather to watch Under the Silver Lake, a shaggy-dog tale that sends Andrew Garfield reeling across an LA suburb in thrall to cults and comic books and movie-star memorabilia. He has some urgent questions relating to a missing girl, the subliminal messages on his records, and some parrot-related mystery the exact details of which I’ve already forgotten. “But what does it all mean?” he wails at one point, and the line sends ripples of laughter through the cinema.Ostensibly the audience is laughing at Under the Silver Lake (David Robert Mitchell’s follow-up to his excellent It Follows), which finally doesn’t amount to a hill of beans. But they’re also giggling at themselves and at the great, pressing question suddenly bellowed down from the screen. What does it all mean? Cannes grows weird during these dying days. The films turn confusing and the punters start flagging, and the boundaries between art and life have a tendency to break down. Every other old man on the street looks like Francis Ford Coppola, and the soldiers with assault rifles might possibly be actors in a publicity stunt. The programme is no help it keeps messing with our heads. In one 36-hour spell it lays on screenings of a film called The Angel, a film called Angel Face and a third called Sorry Angel. If we catch the wrong one, will we even notice?What a curious, fascinating festival this has been – a stumbling first step on the road to redemption – away from the old guard, belatedly into the new century. Gallons of fresh blood have been poured into competition, while the organisers are at least recognising that they need more women in the lineup. So the direction of travel has largely been decided. It remains to be seen how far and how fast we can move.What does it all mean? Don’t ask Jean-Luc Godard, the chain-rattling ghost from Cannes days gone by. Appearing at a press conference via FaceTime, he was asked about his decision to include a clip from Michael Bay’s 13 Hours inside The Image Book, his predictably perplexing latest film. Godard, it seemed, was at a loss. Not only was he unaware of the clip’s inclusion, he claimed to have never even heard of Michael Bay.What does it all mean? Surely the films have the answer, although some of this year’s crop were found wanting. Hopes were high for Spike Lee’s BlacKkKlansman (about an African American cop who joins the KKK), but it’s an underpowered, complacent affair that only explodes into life with its closing footage from 2017’s Charlottesville protests. Elsewhere, Ash Is Purest White was a gorgeous state-of-modern-China romance with too much fat on its bones, while Eva Husson’s Girls of the Sun (about a female Kurdish combat unit) split the audience down the middle. Personally, I found it heavy-handed and cheesy. The fact that a woman can make a big, crude, Hollywood-style war movie might be progress of sorts, but Kathryn Bigelow has trodden similar terrain to better effect and, anyway, it isn’t in and of itself radical.What does it all mean? Never ask Lars von Trier the man can’t be trusted. Ejected from Cannes back in 2011, the one-time enfant terrible returned to serve the festival with its one bona fide shock film. The House That Jack Built stars Matt Dillon as a clench-jawed psychopath (and would-be architect) who claims to have murdered upwards of 60 people. Its gleeful bloody violence provoked mass walkouts. Those who remained found themselves dragged through hell. “Jesus Christ!” yelled the man in the seat behind mine. But not even the messiah could save us from Lars.There were no British titles in competition and so we clambered upstairs to catch sight of Whitney, Kevin Macdonald’s devastating portrait of the pop superstar, apparently beloved by Nelson Mandela and Saddam Hussein alike. Watching Whitney Houston’s decline was like witnessing a slow-motion car crash. The driver swings heedlessly into traffic and is hit again and again until everything’s been knocked loose and scattered. Except that Macdonald brilliantly manages to trace the root of Houston’s problems to her Baptist childhood, uncovering a long-buried tale of familial abuse. One comes away with the sense that the woman might have been doomed from the outset.Outside the Palais is where Cannes almost meets the real world. The red carpet hosts a protest by 82 women calling for more female representation in film another by 16 BME actors highlighting institutionalised racism within the French film industry. Yet both protests play out behind steel cordons, with the crowds kept at a distance. Security has been tightened and tension runs high. Not long ago this place was a free-for-all. There were street vendors and rookie film-makers screening their product inside a van. Representatives from the Troma movie studio would march past, invariably dressed up as zombies and screaming into loudhailers. These days the main drag is largely out of bounds, given over to police bikes and sleek black limousines. The new, improved Cannes would benefit from some zombies.Best in show at this year’s festival? Happily there are a number of titles to choose between and the closing stretch saw the arrival of some tardy instant classics. Keep an eye out for The Wild Pear Tree, a windblown bildungsroman from the Turkish film-maker Nuri Bilge Ceylan, in which an arrogant graduate shuttles between a series of mentors and muses, and Lee Chang-dong’s Burning, which spins a Murakami short story into a simmering thriller spotlighting South Korea’s underclass. I also adored Shoplifters, which follows the fortunes of a makeshift family of rogues before bowing out with a heartpiercing finale. Few directors seed their stories with as much subtlety and grace as Japan’s Hirokazu Kore-eda. His films initially look rather bare and spindly, only to burst into flower like late cherry blossoms.Other pictures screen early and then cling to you for days. It’s now a week since I caught Cold War and I still can’t shake it off. Paweł Pawlikowski’s postwar love story is strung between the eastern bloc and the west, hotwired to the sounds of Polish folk music and seductive American jazz. Cold War isn’t cold it’s positively burning with passion and its lead player, Joanna Kulig, is a star in the making.And then there’s Happy As Lazzaro, Alice Rohrwacher’s time-bending rustic fable roughage for the soul that comes sugared with magic realism. This plays out in a crumbling village mired in a semi-rural past before a sudden reveal pulls the stage-flats away and sends us off in a completely different direction. It might not be the greatest film in the lineup, but its rich humanism seems to speak to the moment – the right film for right now. Maybe that’s enough.In the middle of the week the Cannes heavens open. There are violent cloudbursts across town and forked lightning out over the Med. Then, when the rain has abated, comes more rolling thunder as wheelie-cases are dragged down through town to the bus-stop. One by one, the festival’s guests have begun packing up and shipping out. In the dog days of this festival, there is no sound more melancholic than the rumble of plastic wheels on tarmac. It means that the circus is closing and it’s time to go home.Cannes controversyGaspar Noé played up the coast with his nightmarish Climax and won the best reviews of his career. Lars von Trier played inside the Palais with The House That Jack Built and came away with his worst. Lars wins by a mile.Hollywood hits and missesRamin Bahrani’s Fahrenheit 451 proved idiotic and heavy Ron Howard’s Star Wars prequel, Solo (below), was light, noisy and zippy. So we’re voting with the Wookie.Inappropriate musical cuesBad enough that a gathering of 82 female protesters on the Palais steps is accompanied by Roy Orbison’s Pretty Woman. Still worse when fearsome Cate Blanchett is ushered on to the strains of Just Like a Woman... “but she breaks just like a little girl”. Yeah, right she does.Films in the marketWe’re obviously intrigued by A Dysfunctional Cat and Help, I Shrunk My Parents.

United finished second to City but, unless Chelsea are defeated at Wembley on Saturday, José Mourinho’s side will end the season without a trophy. The nightmare scenario is City’s 19-point Premier League success being followed by Liverpool claiming a sixth European Cup next Saturday by defeating Real Madrid.Two years ago United won a 12th FA Cup and first since 2004 with a 2-1 win over Crystal Palace. Herrera was an unused substitute for Louis van Gaal that day. “Of course when you play you feel more happy but I was still very happy for the team,” the Spaniard says. “It was my first title in England and I knew we were building something good – I said that after the game. And I was right because the next season we won three trophies and this season we are fighting for another.”Herrera’s spell at United has featured an almost constant fight for a starting place. When named by Mourinho in the XI for the 3-2 derby win at the Etihad in April that was his first league start for four months, though he was injured for some of the period. After a fine display Herrera has started seven of their last eight matches, including the semi-final against Tottenham, in which he scored the winner.“When I don’t play, of course I am not happy, but I am also very happy with myself because I give everything, every day, every minute, to be on the pitch,” he says. “If I am on the pitch I’m very calm because I know I’ve done everything to be there. That’s the way to be and the way I’ll feel until the last day of my career.”Herrera, 28, is calm when assessing Mourinho’s management style. “I don’t think if you don’t take your chance it’s the last chance you have in the season,” says the Spaniard, who has made 38 appearances this term and scored twice. “I don’t go crazy when I don’t have my best game and say: ‘Oof, I’ve lost my chance, I’m not going to play again.’“I know some of my team-mates, and some footballers, are up and down. If I play well I’m not very happy and if I play badly I’m not very sad. My age and experience has helped me keep that balance. If you work hard and respect the ones who are playing at that moment but try to give everything you have, whether that’s five minutes or 30 minutes, sooner or later football is fair. I really believe that.”Herrera also offers advice to Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial, who were criticised and dropped by Mourinho following the loss at Brighton two weeks ago. “I don’t like to talk about what other players think because, as we say in Spanish, every person is a world, their own world.“What I can say about them is that they are maybe two of the 20 most talented players in the world. If I could give them advice it’s if you work, then sooner or later football gives back what you have given.”In an FA Cup tie against Chelsea in March last year Herrera impressed when man‑marking Eden Hazard before being sent off after 35 minutes for a second yellow card. He did that job again in the league fixture a month later and was again effective against Chelsea’s best player as United won 2-0 and he scored the second. When discussing how he took the initiative that day, Herrera illustrates why he was talked of as a potential successor to Wayne Rooney as captain.Of the red card in the Cup meeting, Herrera says: “I was never going to hurt the opponent – one of the yellow cards was near the bench they were not going to score a goal.”Despite United’s 81 points in second place being a record deficit to the 100 of City, Herrera is optimistic United can overhaul them next year. “Next season I think the champion can be with 85 or 86 points,” he says.Regarding what the long term may hold for him, Herrera says: “My future is the Cup final. I want to be here next season and unless the club sack me, I will be here in pre-season and fight to keep adding games to my total. In football, what today is black is tomorrow white.Helping United lift the FA Cup with a defeat of Chelsea would make Herrera even more content."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/65395bfd1bb5849346baf1c74b52c01d97033622/0_0_2467_1480/master/2467.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1f3876647acade4e0a5b99c784278c8e","title":"antonio conte chelsea winner lost mojo fa cup final","story":"Antonio Conte, clean‑shaven on the eve of the FA Cup final, digested the question, took a deep breath and then conjured a fresh analogy for an increasingly weary theme. “Last season was a wonderful season because we reached an important success,” the Chelsea head coach said, his mind retreating exactly 12 months to the raucous celebrations with the Premier League trophy on the pitch at Stamford Bridge. “But then you have to understand the way you won. If your car is going at 300km per hour, or if you are winning while going at normal velocity and aren’t risking burning out your engine.”The question, asked before the resumption of hostilities with José Mourinho and Manchester United, had been about whether defeat by Arsenal in last year’s Cup final had, in hindsight, provided glimpses of the unravelling which would follow. Whether Diego Costa’s post-match insistence that he would not be forced to China but would hold out for Atlético Madrid, or that glimpse of a team who had taken their eyes off the ball, were a portent of everything unsettling to come. It said much that Conte’s response, impressively inventive in his second language, was effectively a return to a default position.His sense of dissatisfaction at recruitment policy and perception that the board failed to build on last season’s success infected Chelsea through the second half of his tenure. The drip feed of negativity has lowered the collective mood. At times it is as if he has been goading Roman Abramovich, a notoriously trigger-happy owner. Quite possibly it was only the unpalatable prospect of a hefty compensation payout that stayed the owner’s hand, particularly after humiliations against Bournemouth and Watford. As it is he would have to fork out £9m to dispense with Conte’s services but there is a sense that the orce is imminent.Chelsea are used to chopping and changing. Theirs has been a boom-and-bust approach under Abramovich, and it has still yielded a trophy haul the envy of virtually every club in the country. Those on the inside accept they can be the victims of the kind of emotive, forthright manager they tend to appoint, though Carlo Ancelotti and others might argue it is a tolerance of relative failure that has been lacking.What the board has to contemplate is whether it would be to Chelsea’s benefit to dispense with an elite coach who has claimed major reward at every club he has overseen since 2010 – a promotion with Siena, three Serie A titles at Juventus and, after two years with Italy, last season’s Premier League – transforming a side who had finished 10th into title winners with only three key additions. Can a club condemned to the Europa League attract a candidate of similar status? Probably. Is there scope financially to lure a Luis Enrique or Leonardo Jardim, Maurizio Sarri or Massimiliano Allegri, plus their respective entourages, while also meting out compensation? Maybe, at a push. It might be worth the cost just to be rid of the whingeing.Conte’s constant sniping infuriated Juventus’ hierarchy eventually, for all the club’s dominance in Serie A, though the head coach had a point this time. Adding Álvaro Morata, Tiémoué Bakayoko, Danny Drinkwater, Antonio Rüdiger, Davide Zappacosta and Willy Caballero to ranks depleted by the departures of Nathan Aké, John Terry, Asmir Begovic, Nathaniel Chalobah, Nemanja Matic and Costa hardly constituted bolstering options before a title defence and Champions League campaign. An opportunity was passed up once Chelsea balked at Mino Raiola’s fee to restore Romelu Lukaku to Stamford Bridge, or Juve’s £80m asking price for Alex Sandro.There had been fears of a parting even in the immediate aftermath of the title win. Relations became so strained over the summer that Conte’s backroom staff, who had mainly been living in short-term lets, moved into a local hotel while they waited to discover if they would be retained. An uneasy truce was secured, with a new contract on improved, if not extended, terms papering over the cracks.Even the midwinter additions of Ross Barkley, Emerson and Olivier Giroud did not serve to appease. “I’m a bit of a disaster to convince the club to buy players,” Conte said through a rueful smile in February. “I have to speak more with the managers who are very, very good at persuading their clubs to spend money to buy top players.” That was an interesting message to send to the new arrivals, the recruitment department and the director Marina Granovskaia, who had assumed Michael Emenalo’s duties.Then there was the regular damning of Chelsea with praise for Manchester City, whose emergence under Pep Guardiola, secured until 2021, threatens to block any short-term route to recovery. “They are a club that want to invest and improve,” he said last month. “They did a great job on and off the pitch they were very well prepared for the season.”That unsettling sniping is unlikely to stop. If Granovskaia, with whom the Italian’s relationship is understood to have been particularly frosty at times, can secure someone more amenable to working within the relative financial constraints of Chelsea 2018 rather than Chelsea circa 2004 – Jardim perhaps – there would be fewer headaches all round. Thoughts drift back to the infamous text exchange between Conte and Costa. It was no secret the Italian hoped to be rid of the high-maintenance striker but those upstairs had not sanctioned him to communicate it so bluntly. It was as if he did not entirely trust the board to push through the sale, so forced the matter himself.The schism with Costa did not impress the players. Back in those celebratory scenes a year ago, there was a unity between staff and squad. The endless high-octane training had driven Chelsea, against the odds, to the title. This time round there is a sense of grumbling disquiet. The gruelling sessions left the team 30 points off City. In finishing 10th in 2016, Chelsea had been 31 points from the summit.Many were baffled by the six changes made against Huddersfield this month just as a semblance of momentum was building in the pursuit of the top four. David Luiz has hardly featured since questioning the management after a humiliation at Roma. Eden Hazard has not enjoyed his guest appearances as a false No 9. Willian, who has started once since a stroppy substitution in the Cup semi-final, was asked about his relationship with Conte by ESPN Brazil this week. “Oh boy, do you really want me to tell you?” he replied. “Well, let’s save it for our next interview.” Chelsea will be far more reluctant to lose Hazard or Willian than Conte."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1909918cdc70a2687e49b81db0021e9c3f5444d5/29_283_5145_3087/master/5145.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c5920453ed546abed8053e8c4107b5e","title":"manchester city struggle to make champions league","story":"When Manchester City announced that their women’s team would be embarking on a ground-breaking tour of the United States this summer a glorious treble remained within the grasp of Nick Cushing’s side.It was April and optimism at the Etihad Campus, where Cushing’s players share many facilities with Pep Guardiola’s Premier League champions, was high. Then the setbacks began. First, City lost an FA Cup semi-final to Emma Hayes’s Chelsea and then Lyon knocked them out at the same stage of the Champions League, before Hayes’s team clinched the Women’s Super League title.Now one final, potentially crushing, disappointment must be avoided. With a renascent Arsenal only one point behind City going into Sunday afternoon’s final round of WSL fixtures, they dare not stumble at home to Everton. A slip could permit Joe Montemurro’s players, who travel to Bristol City, to leapfrog into second place and snatch the ision’s last Champions League slot.In March Arsenal beat Cushing’s side in the Continental Cup final, ensuring there would be no repeat of the domestic double secured in 2016, the last full campaign before the game’s switch from a summer to a winter schedule.“It’s been a disappointing season,” concedes City’s England forward Nikita Parris. “But we’re still so close to qualifying for the Champions League. We’ve got a lot of young, developing players so we’re in a good place. Qualifying is massive. We’re determined to do it. It’s what this club needs.”A team apparently running on empty also look in need of a good rest before they face Paris Saint-Germain, North Carolina Courage and Chelsea at the inaugural International Champions Cup in Miami in late July. A training camp in Oregon follows but, for several of Cushing’s players, the American trip comes tightly sandwiched between World Cup qualifiers with England involving away dates in Russia in June and Wales in August.The presence of so many key components of Phil Neville’s squad in their ranks is both a blessing and a curse for City. Tellingly 10 of the starting XI Cushing deployed for the goalless Champions League semi-final first leg against Lyon had been called up by Neville this year, with the Lionesses’ participation in March’s SheBelieves Cup in the United States proving exhausting.For a time before Neville’s appointment City feared losing Cushing to England but the 33-year-old eventually withdrew from the FA’s shortlist, signing a new club contract. Off-pitch turmoil was averted but on it the absence of City’s captain, the centre-half Steph Houghton, with an ankle injury contributed to some vital points being dropped during February.By then the departures last summer of the outstanding England right-back Lucy Bronze to Lyon and the forward Toni Duggan to Barcelona were really being felt. Perhaps inevitably an expertly volleyed goal from Bronze gave Lyon a 1-0 aggregate Champions League win against her old club – the French champions face Wolfsburg in Kiev on Thursday.With City’s new Denmark striker Nadia Nadim struggling, Chelsea have proved the infinitely better-balanced unit. Significantly, the shortlist for the PFA female player of the year comprised five Chelsea stars and City’s Jill Scott. The award was deservedly won by Fran Kirby the Chelsea forward blessed with a rare ability to play between the lines has barely stopped scoring this season.Hayes, who gave birth to a healthy baby boy on Thursday when Chelsea announced that the other twin she was expecting had sadly “failed to make it”, is undoubtedly an exceptional coach but Kirby’s catalytic presence remains the overwhelming reason for the six-point gap separating the top two.This gulf will not have gone down well with City’s Abu Dhabi-based ownership. Ditto the disappointing average attendances of around 1,500 at the women’s 7,000-capacity Academy Stadium. But next season offers a prospective new dawn and, in Keira Walsh, Mel Lawley and Georgia Stanway, Cushing has three of England’s brightest emerging talents.In 12 months that trio could well be preparing for the 2019 World Cup in France having helped City reclaim the game’s glittering prizes. First though a Champions League place needs guaranteeing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dfa0ff616079c36b81f2251428ac735e9f9e70b0/0_0_6252_3751/master/6252.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0e569729519a53180fc5090d4c054dfc","title":"per mertesacker book extract arsenal academy manager","story":"In an exclusive extract from his new book, the former defender explains what he learned during his career and how footballers must do more to condition their bodiesMy experience has taught me that you simply cannot do enough. For example, I was a big fan of yoga from the beginning because I had seen that it improved stability and flexibility.Even at the age of 33 I was one of the most flexible at Arsenal when it came to my back muscles. Hardly anyone came to the yoga sessions that the club offered. Often there were only four of us: Héctor Bellerín, Nacho Monreal and Tomas Rosicky.The youth players who were promoted to the first team smiled at these exercises. They thought we were meditating. They were happy with the ball at their feet but for everything else there was a lack of desire. “I play football and go to training. That’s enough.”But no, it isn’t enough when you want to maintain a certain level for a long time or want to improve.Either you are learning from scratch, from your parents and the teachers and coaches around you, to take responsibility, or you don’t do it at all. This is the kind of dumbing down we must fight against.In the autumn of 2017 an under-18 player came and asked whether we could sit down for a chat. I nearly fell over, I was so surprised. That hadn’t happened in the six and a half years I had been there. He wanted to speak to me about leadership.I used a lot of energy trying to convince team-mates they should do more for their bodies and try new things. But working long term to improve their weaknesses? Hardly anyone.Working with him was a huge success. We always assume that we can run and see properly because nothing hurts. But that is a mistake. Lars showed me that our eyes are a big factor in everything, above all when it comes to our timing.And as my left eye was not really looking at the ball I was always twisting my neck to use my dominant right eye.Football doesn’t really deal with those things, despite the fact they can be decisive. Players would rather lift weights, stand on their own with their dumbbells – but how does that help me on the pitch?During the exercises with Lars one could see quite clearly that my eyes were moving differently when an object was approaching me. My left eye always remained in the middle rather than focusing on the object.He showed me how to make my left eye stronger. I had a patch on my right eye, forcing my left eye to focus on the objects. And after a few weeks I could really notice the difference in games. If there was a high ball from the left I had a much better feeling for where it would end up.With Lars’s help I stayed injury-free for four and a half years. Meeting him changed my life as a footballer.The important thing was to do exercises myself before games as well to adjust the eyes. One example was a kind of push-up for the eyes. You bring a pencil in towards your nose and force your eyes towards the middle. When you do that at the training ground a lot of people think: “What is he doing now? Is he completely stupid?”Mainly I was doing it at home or in the hotel room. I had six or seven exercises that I did, sometimes just before kick-off in the dressing room. I didn’t care what the others thought or if they laughed. But you saw again that something new, something unknown, led to laughter rather than people asking: “What are you doing there?”Footballers are used to working only three hours a day. And out of the three hours they are at the training ground they are on their mobiles for half of that.We have all the money in the world but do not realise how important the body is. A player on average has a seven‑year professional career, 10-15 if everything goes right. You have to do everything possible to be at your maximum.A lot of players don’t even know what maximum is – for them it is about having fun on the pitch. But there is more to being a professional than that.In my new role as Arsenal academy manager I will do everything I can to challenge the young players’ mindsets. I want to challenge them so that they are ready to take on new ideas and protect them from being injured, when it comes to their body and soul.I want to convince them they have to do something to get to the top of the world and I want to be an example for them. For me there wasn’t really a way up but somehow I made it there anyway, because I did everything I possibly could to give me the best chances to succeed.

Four years after the photograph was taken, it was further seared on the collective football consciousness when the author and journalist Simon Kuper used it to illustrate the cover of his award-winning bestseller Football Against The Enemy. Kuper would later regret doing so and apologised to one of the players featured in the photograph on the grounds that it was probably unfair to highlight such an unseemly act when it had been perpetrated by somebody for whom such behaviour was so utterly out of character.The snap in question? Rudi Völler standing in thoughtful meditation with his hands on his hips in the immediate aftermath of one of the most unjust dismissals in World Cup history, while over his right shoulder, his Dutch rival Frank Rijkaard looks to be inspecting the massive grolly he had just violently expectorated and left dangling from the back of the German striker’s bubble perm like a Christmas tree bauble.“If I spit they will take my spit and frame it as great art,” Pablo Picasso once said. Rijkaard’s flob into Völler’s head may have been a masterpiece of a fairly unpleasant genre but was never heralded as great art. It did, however, contrive to make global headlines, earning the defender the nickname “Llama” in honour of the South American camelid’s prodigious ability for hurling projectiles manufactured from saliva. It was an uncharacteristically vile act performed by a man almost universally held in the highest of regard and one for which he later apologised. Völler accepted Rijkaard’s mea culpa and the incident was later put to bed when the pair agreed to break bread – and spread butter – together for a TV commercial, with both their fees going to charity.The rivalry between Holland and West Germany, as they were then known, was and remains notoriously fierce. Its roots are in the second world war and the mutual loathing of both teams and sets of fans intensified after “The Mother of all Defeats”, when the Germans famously triumphed over the Dutch in the 1974 World Cup final.At the 1980 European Championships, the German goalkeeper Toni Schumacher was assaulted by the Dutchman Huub Stevens in another German victory, while the Dutch exacted some measure of revenge eight years later, when Marco van Basten sent Holland through to the final at Germany’s expense on a night when his team-mate Ronald Koeman enraged German sensibilities by pretending to wipe his backside with Olaf Thon’s shirt. The following year they were further incited during a qualifier for Italia 90 in Rotterdam, when Dutch fans unfurled a giant banner comparing the German captain, Lothar Matthäus, to Adolf Hitler. One did not need to be a rune-reader to predict their meeting in the second round of Italia 90 was likely to be spicy.Like most matches between West Germany and the Netherlands it was a bad-tempered affair. Having topped Group D ahead of Yugoslavia and Colombia in second and third place, Völler and his team-mates, who would go on to win the match and the tournament, had earned a berth in a decidedly tricky second-round eliminator against their old foes in Milan’s San Siro. The format of Italia 90 meant the top two teams in each of the six groups progressed to the second round, where they were joined by the four best third-placed teams from the group stages. With Ruud Gullit and Mick McCarthy having agreed, with 20 minutes or so to go, to play out a draw in their final group game at Palermo’s Stadio La Favorita to shaft Egypt and ensure they both went through, the Dutch and Jack Charlton’s Republic of Ireland finished with identical records behind England in Group F. It was the Dutch who drew the short straw that pitted them against Germany, while the Republic of Ireland advanced to play against and beat Romania.The challenge earned Rijkaard a booking from the Argentinian referee, Juan Carlos Loustau. It was his second of the tournament and meant he would miss the quarter-final should Holland progress. Maddened by his entirely deserved punishment, Rijkaard was enveloped in red mist and, as he jogged past Völler to take up his position for Andy Brehme’s free-kick, he spat in the German’s carefully coiffured mullet. Verbals between the pair ensued, at which point Loustau booked Völler, ignoring the German’s incredulity and accompanying invitation to examine the gobbet of spittle that had recently been deposited in his hair.With order of a sort restored and the Germans ambling into the penalty area for the as yet untaken free-kick, Völler appeared to explain to his strike partner Klinsmann that he had been spat at, then took up his position. Floated into the area by Brehme, the ball was nodded towards the edge of the six-yard box, where the goalkeeper Hans van Breuckelen grabbed it, having dashed off his line to do so. Having followed in to contest the ball, Völler appeared to do all he could to avoid clattering Van Breuckelen in mid-air but an incensed Rijkaard attempted to drag Völler to his feet by the ear, then stamped on his foot, prompting the German to fall to the ground.With Van Breuckelen and Klinsmann valiantly attempting to act as peace-makers, Loustau promptly brandished his red card in the direction of Rijkaard, before turning and showing it to Völler too. The hard done by German could scarcely have looked more appalled and to this day remains mystified by the official’s decision to issue him with his marching orders.“Of course it wasn’t nice what Frank Rijkaard did but the match should have continued for me,” he said years later in an interview with FourFourTwo magazine. “I still can’t understand why the ref sent me off and I guess he will take it to his grave. He wanted to make an example of both of us so that the situation would calm down – which did work. There was some venom before between other players but, you know, it’s always problematic between Germany and Holland.”With Völler standing there stoically pondering the injustice of it all, Rijkaard was lurking in the background, studiously clearing his mucous membranes by hoiking up the mother of all grollies. As he walked past Völler en route to the dressing room, he casually turned his head and flobbed the mouthful of slimy gloop he had just harvested from his nasal turbinate straight into his rival’s hair. Völler’s head snapped to the right as he glared at his opponent, then rubbed his hand through his curls in an attempt to locate the offending phlegm, which could be seen dangling from the back of his head. As Rijkaard was being escorted up the touchline towards the dressing rooms by a Dutch team official, Völler broke into a jog, looking for all the world as if he might attack his saliva-spewing assailant and prompt all hell to break loose. Rather disappointingly he chose to be the bigger man and merely cantered past his rival without so much as a sideways look.“Spitting is universally recognised as perhaps the ultimate degradation and it’s bound to result in rather aggressive retaliation,” mused the consultant psychologist Dr Aric Sigman years later, in some nostalgia-based clip show or other. Dr Sigman may well be right but rather intriguingly Völler proved the exception to the rule by refusing to retaliate in any way, aggressively or otherwise, bearing his multiple punishments and degradations at the hands of both referee and opponent with a stoicism that bordered on the truly heroic.“And now, an absolute sensation here in Milan,” declared Moore on ITV, as both footballers left the arena. “One that will do little for the game, I have to say on the night. Both sides reduced to 10 men ... Völler running off to the dressing room, Rijkaard taking a more leisurely pace. And as they went past, there was even a possibility Rijkaard may have spat at Völler, but the place is in uproar now.”On Irish television the incident was replayed time and again, mainly for yuks and giggles. As RTE ringmaster Bill O’Herlihy tut-tutted in a fatherly and faux po-faced fashion, pundit Eamon Dunphy got to work with his new toy, an electronic pen with which he could enhance and illustrate his analysis by drawing white lines, circles, arrows and squiggles on a monitor after pausing the VT with an often aggressive roar of “Stop it there!” at some unseen flunkie in the production suite.It was a technological advance Dunphy would use to comical effect some years later, pausing the action during a highlights package featuring Wimbledon to draw a large circle around John Hartson’s ample buttocks and declare “that is not the arse of a £7m player”. On the night Germany beat the Dutch, his analysis of the incident was peerless and priceless. “Rijkaard launches the spit from here, now stop it there,” he observed, before getting to work with his magic pen and charting the trajectory of the offending gully with an illustrative squiggle. “There it is, Bill. It’s hitting his head there and that’s bad news for Rudi Völler and even worse news for his hairdresser!”Meanwhile on the BBC, a completely farcical turn of events was being treated with the utmost gravity. “Please, parents, turn the videos off now because that is just absolutely scandalous,” intoned Ray Wilkins solemnly, considerately thinking of the children but paying scant regard to the ratings.In a subsequent interview with Simon Kuper Rijkaard was quick to accept all the blame for the incident and equally quick to put paid to suggestions that Völler might have insulted or even racially abused him. “That day I was wrong,” he said. “There was no insult. I always had much respect for Rudi Völler. But I went berserk when I saw that red card. I talked to him after the match and I apologised. I’m very happy that he accepted. I have no bad feeling about him now. We even posed for a very funny advert together years after.”The advert in question was for butter and featured both men sporting wide grins, cream dressing gowns and their trademark (but mercifully saliva free) curly hairstyles while seated at the breakfast table. “A Dutch butter company came up with the idea of a public reconciliation under the slogan ‘Everything In Butter Again’, which is a German proverb meaning that everything is OK again,” said Völler. “The fee was donated by both of us to charity, otherwise I wouldn’t have joined in.” In a rather undignified but amusing manner dignity had finally been restored."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c8d8898129f62b5a9a650a25ea935655bb9a0e0/0_346_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=11c6ab48649e0608d24bd1e5e2004da2","title":"google facebook security data duckduckgo","story":"Over the past month I’ve tried my best not to use Google. I deleted my Facebook account. I’ve gone through all my phone and iPad apps, closing down the “permissions” that give them access to my calendar, camera, contacts and location. And I’ve switched to DuckDuckGo as my (home) web browser. Like millions of others I was astounded not just by the Cambridge Analytica revelations, but the industrial-scale data harvesting by Google revealed in that extraordinary article by Dylan Curran in the .After reading it, I picked a random day in 2014 to find out what Google had on me – and was astonished at the intensity of location tracking and snooping on all my movements.But my trial separation has been tough. I’ve (almost) completely finished with Facebook. But living without Google has been far harder.My partner calls me “iPaddy” for the amount of time I spend on the bloody thing – mostly reading and checking news sites. But a good thing about the iPad is that in “settings” it’s simple to switch out of Google and into DuckDuckGo as your default browser.DuckDuckGo, if you don’t know, is the search engine that promises not to intrude. “It’s sort of creepy that people at search engines can see all this info about you,” it says. Unlike Google, it doesn’t attempt to track you. It doesn’t store IP addresses or personalise your search results according to what past data it has built up on you.But does it work? There is nothing I’ve not been able to find while using it although, as I haven’t put every search request into Google and DuckDuckGo at the same time, it’s not an entirely scientific comparison. Results are displayed and ranked in a similar fashion to Google. There are ads, but you can go into settings and turn them off.The biggest drawback was mapping – DuckDuckGo puts you through to Apple’s service – although images aren’t great, either. Until you are off Google, you don’t realise what a beautiful thing its mapping features are. And my determination not to give away my location means I’m now assailed by pop-up boxes once I click on a site. Last Sunday I searched for films at my local Omniplex cinema. Google would probably know where I was, and send me to the page with listings appropriate to my local area. Now I have to click into the general cinema site, click past the location pop-up request, then manually select which cinema is my local. But these are small gripes and I’m very happy to continue with DuckDuckGo on my iPad.Changing ad settings has been enlightening. We’re warned that if we turn off personalised ads, we get a weirdly untailored experience. You\u0026nbspdo – but so what?Cutting free from Google on a smartphone is another matter. If, like me, you have a company paid-for Android-based phone linked to Gmail, you can hardly hide from Google. But I’m not prevented from turning off location services, and since my phone is the main way it tracks me, it\u0027s a small triumph.I was never a Facebook fan, so deleting it was entirely painless. But it doesn’t let you go without a fight. It said it would hold the door open for me to return, and not delete all my data, should I come back within a short while. It worked. A week later I came back on, as I needed to contact a Facebook group for work. But that has been the sum total of my Facebook life since. But then there’s WhatsApp, which has become the key way our wider family connects. It is, of course, owned by Facebook. Some companies you can’t escape from."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93e834ddfcf276c5a88110c761b6e1afa60efbb2/19_136_3967_2380/master/3967.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=37055a92981ef1850d3358a9594a561d","title":"rare whisky vintage scotch auction","story":"Vintage Scotch dubbed ‘holy grail of Macallan’ auctioned in Hong KongA bottle of single malt whisky has been sold for a record $1.1m (£815,760) at an auction in Hong Kong.The very rare 1926 Macallan scotch whisky was sold an hour after a bottle of the same vintage also changed hands for a slightly smaller seven-figure sum. The whisky bottles, which had not been seen in public since they were last auctioned three decades ago, are described as the “holy grail of Macallan” because only 24 bottles were produced as gifts for the distillery’s most-valued customers. The bottles feature specially commissioned labels by the pop artists Valerio Adami, which sold for $1.1m (£814,000), and Sir Peter Blake, which sold for just over $1m. The Blake-designed bottle sold to a telephone bidder and the Adami-designed bottle was sold to a bidder in the room at Bonhams auction house in Hong Kong. The record sale price works out at £1,080 per millilitre of whisky. Both bidders were undisclosed.The previous whisky sale price record was set in 2017 with the £730,000 sale of a six-bottle lot of Macallan. The previous record for a single bottle was the £466,000 paid for a Macallan M Imperiale in 2014, although an Imperiale contains eight and a half 70cl bottles worth of whisky. Daniel Lam, Bonhams’ head of fine wine and whisky in Hong Kong, said: “These two bottles are the most significant whiskies ever produced in 20th century and truly presented a once-in-a-generation opportunity for collectors to acquire the holy grail of Macallan.“Active bidding came in from around the world but we saw new bidders from South-east Asia, including Vietnam, Thailand and Malaysia, reflecting the growing appetite and appreciation for whisky among Asian collectors.”The whisky, which was bottled in 1986, is presented in specially commissioned cabinets or Tantaluses, based on the traditional ‘brass and glass’ distillery spirit safe. Blake is best known for co-creating the Beatles’ album cover of Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club band in 1967, which was voted by Rolling Stone magazine as the No 1 album of all time. Adami is an Italian artist famous for painting bold, flat forms outlined in thick, black lines, in a style reminiscent of comic art.

It was an eye-opener for him, showing how people who arrived with nothing have recreated a tiny slice of their lives back home, mostly in Syria. “They are thrown together, given a basic shelter. It was humbling to see how important gardening and growing is to them and how much benefit green space gives,” he says.When the Lemon Tree Trust, which is sponsoring the garden, asked refugees what they missed most about home, they talked about the sounds of nature, their gardens, and trees. Many of them asked for seeds. They had begun raising songbirds and pigeons, crafting elaborate fountains from concrete, and carving productive beds from the dusty soil.And while Chelsea may be a world away from the fragile, harsh existence of a Domiz plot, the trust’s CEO, Stephanie Hunt, hopes visitors will be able to relate “gardener to gardener” to the story the garden will tell. “We wanted to elevate the discussion around refugees, and show they are more than the pain and hardship that they have seen – they want to move on, and their gardens bring them joy.”Massey’s show garden uses the same limited set of raw materials that the 26,000 refugees at Domiz have access to – concrete and steel – plus ordinary objects they repurpose, from tin drums to plastic bottles. At the centre is an Islamic-inspired fountain fed by rills of water that radiate from it one of the boundary walls is covered with gutter pipes and cans filled with plants and fig, pomegranate and lemon trees offer shade, scent and food. “Lots of people I met said their gardens are places for escape, so I wanted to create areas where people could sit and listen to running water,” Massey says. “The plants have a strong sensory nature to transport them to other places.”The show garden won’t be a carbon copy of the refugees’ plots. “It has to have a certain Chelsea polish, or it won’t work.” That gloss comes in the form of polished rather than poured concrete, steel cut by laser rather than basic tools, and a palette of plants specially grown by the nursery Hortus Loci.Will the average Chelsea visitor engage with this garden’s message? Massey thinks so, but then, he’s already tested the water: one of the two show gardens he designed at the RHS Hampton Court show in 2016 was sponsored by the UN Refugee Agency. This conceptual garden, called Border Control, highlighted the dangerous journeys refugees make. “It’s nice to see gardens like this at big shows – that it’s not just high-end gardens without much message behind them,” he says.For Massey, it’s been a steep learning curve: he is making his Chelsea debut less than three years after he started practising. He studied animation then went into advertising, but found there was “too much sitting in a dark room”, so retrained as a garden designer. “I have always had a deep connection to the landscape. I grew up in Richmond with the park on my doorstep and spent long summers in Cornwall going a bit feral,” he says.While at Domiz, Massey explored the Mesopotamian plain that surrounds the camp, a bioersity hotspot packed with unfamiliar species. He was accompanied by Dr Sami Youssef, a bioersity expert who had been a refugee in the camp and was instrumental in starting the trust’s growing garden there Youssef had found several previously unrecorded plant species growing nearby. Massey has drawn on Youssef’s knowledge to ensure his own garden uses the right species.“Meeting Sami really underlined that a refugee camp is filled with ordinary people,” Massey says. “Journalists, designers, architects, botanists, farmers, teachers, decorators – all just doing their best to survive.”The Pearlfisher garden, by John Warland, will bring the beauty and fragility of marine life to west London, highlighting the urgent issue of plastic waste in the seas.

I knew all sorts about him, from my mother: that he could knit, for example, and that he adored cricket that he was a social worker and had become the UK’s first director of social services that he was a Quaker, and had been a conscientious objector in the second world war. She also told me that, after the early death of their mother, he had completely failed her and her younger sisters by marrying again very quickly, and more or less abandoning them.It was hard to square her charming portrait of Denis with his failure as a father – and grandfather. For many years, I was haunted by the unbearable sadness of the story, and a desire to better understand what had happened.As it turned out, I was to get my chance: a six-week window at the end of his life to get to know him and solve the puzzle.My mother is the eldest of four. The girls grew up with “all the luxuries and none of the necessities”: a piano, for example, but no curtains. Their mother, Rita, was a great collector of waifs and strays, and their shabby homes (they moved a lot) were always bursting with guests. One of those guests was Marjorie, a young colleague of Denis’s – deaf and very much alone in life. Then Rita died, and Marjorie became Denis’s wife – and the archetypal wicked stepmother.She got rid of all of Rita’s things, including the family dog and, the minute they were old enough, the daughters. Once they had left home, they weren’t welcome back and she didn’t like Denis visiting them. The story made me angry, but with Denis rather than Marjorie. How could he have put Marjorie’s needs over those of his bereaved girls?For my mother, Marjorie was the villain. Like the fathers in the fairytales, Denis was simply mysterious. And yearned for. She put a lot of effort into keeping in contact, sending him letters and birthday cards, and encouraging his rare visits. When he was 70, Denis briefly asserted himself over Marjorie, and invited his daughters and their families to Devon to celebrate his birthday. For me it was an impossibly poignant event. The weather was beautiful, and we picnicked on the beach. My mother and aunts were childlike in their eagerness to connect with their father to please him. Denis, a handsome man with more than a touch of David Attenborough about him, paddled in the sea and got us playing cricket. Marjorie also attended. Shy rather than villainous, her deafness very apparent, she didn’t like the sun and sat away from us in the shade of the cliffs. In contrast, I felt Rita to be everywhere – although her name was never spoken.After the birthday, things returned to as they had been and I didn’t see Denis for seven years. Then in November 1996, when I was 31, my mother phoned to tell me that he was in hospital, dying. He wanted to write a memoir and had requested my assistance, having heard that I had provided such a service to a terminally ill woman a few years before. I said yes straight away. This was my chance to get to know him and maybe get some answers.Denis and Marjorie lived in Exeter. Marjorie, as it happened, was in another hospital having an operation but she didn’t want me staying in their empty house. Quaker friends of Denis’s offered to put me up. I found Denis in a dingy ward, curtained off from the other men. Frail in his hospital gown, he gazed warily at me over his oxygen mask, and I thought for a moment that he didn’t recognise me. But then he removed the mask and reached for my hand. “I’m so glad you’re here,” he said, settling me into the bedside chair. “Have you brought your notebook?”Aware of his impending death, Denis was on a mission. For the next six weeks, he talked slowly, resorting to his mask in between sentences, so it was easy to scribble it all down. Every few days I would type up my scrawls and bring back the printed sheets for his plentiful corrections. As I got to know him, I found myself yearning for a deeper connection – to be more than a scribe. In a bid for intimacy, I told him about the pain of being in love with a man who didn’t love me. He nodded, but said nothing. And then sighed and said, “Shall we get on, then?”It was his memories of childhood that he wanted to capture for posterity. I felt frustrated, wanting to fast forward to events that involved my mother, but I gradually became absorbed in the story he wanted to tell.He had been one of five brothers. His parents had an unhappy marriage. His father, Jack, may have had schizophrenia, or what was then called shellshock, but Denis’s memories were of a kind and caring man. When Denis was four, Jack ran away with him. They went to Suffolk on a motorbike, Denis in the sidecar, thrilled to have been chosen as his father’s partner in adventure. His memory was one of profound happiness, listening to the pop-pop of the engine under the deep green of Suffolk foliage. Then the police found them, Denis was returned to his mother, and Jack was forbidden to darken their door. His mother remarried and went abroad with her new husband, and Denis and his brothers were given charity places at a boarding school.Denis enjoyed school. He played cricket and climbed trees, and fell through the ice of a frozen pond. Sightings of his father were poignant but, as Denis admitted, not necessarily real. Once, when he was playing cricket, Jack materialised on the side of the pitch. Overjoyed, Denis did his best to play well, feeling his father’s eyes on him. When the match was over, he turned towards him – but Jack was gone. I was charmed by this schoolboy, whose vitality triumphed over his sadness and also struck by the theme of abandonment. I felt I was getting an answer to the questions I didn’t dare to ask, an answer that finally took shape during an anecdote about a rare holiday with his mother and brothers in a seaside hotel. One morning, she mentioned almost in passing, that their father had died some time ago. The news stunned him and he went upstairs to weep. It later emerged that Jack had died in France, alone, in poverty.After the recounting of this episode, we spent some time in silence, Denis’s eyes bright blue disks, much fierier than the mottled red of his cheeks. “Death was much harder to talk about, back then,” he said. “They had an awful lot to learn about children’s emotional needs.”“But what about your daughters’ emotional needs?” The question burst out of me, my heart thumping hard. He nodded and tried to speak, but wept instead, full of remorse, and in that moment I forgave him. I hugged him, crying too. I had my explanation. Having been failed as a child, Denis then failed his own children. Emotionally damaged, he inflicted that same damage on the next generation. Looking back, I see the theme of abandonment had played out in my own life. Most obviously, it had led me to working on an oral history project with children in care. Much later, I wrote a novel about a boy whose mother has disappeared.He lived for another year. He made a kind of miracle recovery and Marjorie took him home, and cared for him there. I got his memoir printed and sent a copy to him in the post. I heard that on the morning of his death, he watched England win the Ashes and, ecstatic, leapt out of his wheelchair. “I’m getting better and better, and younger and younger!” he cried. “I can walk! I can skip!”He died mid-skip. When I think of that moment, I see the vital schoolboy I finally got to know so well during those six weeks."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1db28951bc4da99d565e8a4864fba80d77242131/0_233_5457_3274/master/5457.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d8d133e30a886daa10ddd055945844e8","title":"yotam ottolenghi barbecue recipes","story":"Thai skewers, beetroot with pickled chilli and scotch bonnet bass will bring the heat to your garden even if the weather doesn’tEvery year, I end up testing barbecue recipes in the rain, with an umbrella balanced precariously on one shoulder, but this year’s mission coincided with the hottest April week in 70 years. Barbecue sales doubled, supermarkets ran out of burgers, rosé and sun cream, and I leapt on the balmy bandwagon by celebrating the spring sun with ingredients from Mexico to Thailand. I’m keeping my fingers crossed for more scorchers this summer, but there’s enough chilli heat here to keep us all nice and warm, just in case.If you can’t get hold of onglet, which is a great secondary cut of beef that’s perfect for the barbecue, experiment with other cuts such as rump or sirloin.

Mix all the marinade ingredients in a non-reactive container, then add the meat and toss to coat. Leave to marinate for at least two hours (and up to two days).For the dressing, mix the first five ingredients in a small bowl. In a separate small bowl, mix the spring onions, chilli, peanuts and pumpkin seeds. Add half this mixture to the soy sauce mixture and set the rest aside – you’ll use it as a garnish.Drain the meat in a sieve set over a medium saucepan to catch the marinade in the pan discard the aromatics. Put the marinade on a medium-high heat, bring to a simmer and cook for about three minutes, until reduced and thickened to the consistency of a glaze.Line a work surface with a few sheets of clingfilm, then spread the meat out in a single layer on top. Cover with a few more sheets of clingfilm, then use a rolling pin to bash the meat until it is very thin – about 2-3mm thick. Thread the meat on to the soaked skewers (about 80g meat per skewer), then brush with a little oil and grill on the barbecue for about four minutes, turning a few times and basting with the reserved glaze until the meat has deep char marks and is golden brown all over. Leave to rest for a few minutes, then transfer to a serving plate.Drizzle the dressing over the meat, sprinkle the reserved herb and peanut mixture on top, and serve hot.If you’re using shop-bought cooked beets, look for ones with no added vinegar, salt or sugar. Don’t worry if your barbecue doesn’t have a resting rack, but do ensure that you’re cooking the beetroots over the very coolest coals for the first 30 minutes. Use recyclable foil trays if you’re worried about damaging a baking tray.Prep 12 minMarinate 30 min+Cook 40 minServes 4 as a side10 makrut lime leaves, stalks discarded, roughly chopped1 garlic clove, peeled and roughly chopped2cm piece fresh ginger, peeled and roughly chopped 1-2 limes, zest finely grated, to get 2 tsp, then juiced, to get 1½ tbsp90ml olive oilFlaked sea salt525g cooked beetroot, shop-bought or freshly cooked, drained and quartered1 small red chilli, finely sliced on an angle1½ tbsp white-wine vinegar½ tsp caster sugar1 tbsp maple syrup120g creme fraiche1 tbsp coriander leaves, finely chopped1 tbsp dill leaves, finely choppedPut the first four ingredients, three tablespoons of the oil and a teaspoon of flaked sea salt in a spice grinder and blitz to a loose paste. Put the beetroot quarters in a bowl, add half the paste, toss well to coat and leave to marinate for at least 30 minutes, and up to three hours. Keep the remaining paste for serving.Spread out the beets on a baking tray, place this on the resting rack of the barbecue over the coolest coals, close the lid of the barbecue and cook for about 30 minutes, until soft and lightly smoked.While the beetroot is cooking, put the chilli in a small bowl with the vinegar, sugar and half a teaspoon of flaked sea salt. Leave to pickle for at least 30 minutes, or up to three hours.Brush the beetroot quarters with a tablespoon of the oil and the maple syrup, then put them directly on the grill in a hotter area of the barbecue and cook for four to five minutes, turning regularly, until they’re covered in good char marks.Spread the creme fraiche on a large plate and top with the beetroot quarters. Spoon the remaining makrut lime paste evenly over the beetroot, then sprinkle over the herbs. Drizzle over the remaining oil and finish with the pickled chilli and a generous sprinkle of flaked sea salt.This is meant to be enjoyed like tacos, where you pile the fish and condiments into tortillas. The fish on its own, with its deep-flavoured, black garlic marinade, will also work a treat with only a squeeze of lime for company, but the dipping sauce is so good, and easy, it would be a shame not to make that, too. In fact, you may well end up hooked on the stuff and find yourself wanting to eat it with all sorts.4 small sustainably sourced sea bass (250-300g each), cleaned, scaled and patted dry (or sea bream, black bream or similar firm-fleshed fish)Salt2 tbsp vegetable oilFor the marinade30g black garlic cloves (about 15)2 tsp ground cumin2 tsp ground coriander1 scotch bonnet chilli, deseeded1-2 limes, zest finely grated, to get 1 tsp, and juiced, to get 2 tbsp½ tsp soft light brown sugar1 tbsp pul biber (Turkish chilli flakes or ½ tbsp of regular chilli flakes)60ml olive oil1 tsp flaked sea salt, plus extra to seasonCorn tortillasFor the dipping sauce1 scotch bonnet chilli, deseeded and finely chopped1 small garlic clove, peeled and finely chopped5g spring onion, finely chopped2 tbsp lime juiceFor the herb salad10g mint leaves10g coriander leaves2 spring onions, finely sliced on an angleFlaked sea salt, to tastePut all the marinade ingredients in the small bowl of a food processor and blitz to a smooth paste.

May’s other nominees are Diana Barran, Catherine Meyer, the founder of Action Against Abduction who is married to former US ambassador Sir Christopher Meyer, and Amanda Sater, a former party deputy chair.The nominations will tilt the balance of the chamber slightly in favour of May, taking her party’s total of peers from 244 to 253. But no party has a majority in the 780-strong upper house, and the government has been so heavily defeated on some amendments that introducing a handful of more supportive peers will only make a modest difference in getting Brexit through parliament.The DUP will nominate the former MP William McCrea, who has been criticised for sharing a platform in the past with Billy Wright, a loyalist paramilitary. Only McCrea’s name emerged, despite rumours that the DUP was initially offered at least one other nomination.Labour was granted three nominations, and Jeremy Corbyn put forward the former party general secretary Iain McNicol and the race equality campaigner Martha Osamor, the mother of the MP Kate Osamor, as had been expected. The third nominee is Pauline Bryan, a Scottish campaigner and editor of What Would Keir Hardie Say?, a collection of essays once given by Corbyn to Barack Obama.The proposed elevation of Osamor was immediately criticised by a Jewish campaign group after it emerged that she was one of several signatories to a 2016 letter complaining about the suspension of Ken Livingstone and others over antisemitism. Arguing that the suspensions were McCarthyite, the letter said the charges of antisemitism were being used to “silence criticisms of Israel … and undermine Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn”.Gideon Falter, the chair of the Campaign Against Antisemitism, said that elevating Osamor was a “two-fingered salute” to the Jewish community, and that Corbyn’s decision was “telling us not only that he sees her behaviour as unproblematic, but that he sees it as being worthy of the highest honour and a lifelong seat in the House of Lords”.Political peers are nominated periodically at the initiation of Downing Street in a behind-the-scenes haggling process, which in this case began in November, and starts with a debate about how many each party is granted. Names are suggested informally and canvassed before the House of Lords appointments commission to see if they meet the appropriate financial and legal standards before finally being formally submitted.The Liberal Democrats did not make any nominations, although it is well represented in the chamber with 98 peers. Dick Newby, the party’s leader in the Lords, said: “This is a cynical response from Theresa May to losing a string of votes in the Lords in recent weeks.”Lilley, a Thatcherite who has long been a Eurosceptic, was Margaret Thatcher’s trade secretary and then social security secretary in John Major’s government. At the 1992 party conference he sang about his “little list” of benefit fraudsters and was an energetic promoter of the idea that many people on social security were scroungers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18bf979bf88d366c324d691a018b9461582e2f23/0_12_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b3f846d026cd06f73d705c75181ec643","title":"jos buttler england recall","story":"It might seem odd that English sport’s great invisible superstar is back in the Test team on the back of his Indian Premier League status but his selection is bold and sensibleEvery year in the US five people die and 10 million dollars of damage is caused as a result of deep-frying a turkey. This appears to be a festive tradition among bearded flag-draped men with hunting knives and baggy shorts, men for whom freedom’s just another word for caramelising your own arteries and shouting a lot on YouTube.But freedom comes at a cost. Each deep-fried turkey takes seven gallons of superheated fat. A special chain is required to lower it into its hell-cauldron. Moisture is the key issue: a pocket of concealed water inside the turkey can cause it to explode into a roiling spume of flames and fat.All things considered it would probably be more sensible to cook these turkeys in the oven, to play it straight. But then, you don’t get a special chain. You don’t get seven gallons of oil, or great melting mouthfuls of face-scalding fat-soaked bird, so tangy and moist and crispy-skinned you’re already salivating over it now.Bad ideas that look delicious. Delicious ideas that are – despite being delicious – also clearly very bad. Ideas that end up with everyone catching salmonella, the house on fire and England 86 for eight on a nibbly green seamer. There was a note of this in the first sight of England’s squad for the Lord’s Test against Pakistan next week with specific reference to the gripping, oddly decadent selection of Jos Buttler as a specialist No 7 batsman, given licence to wander out, sniff the air and basically make the game up in front of him.There is a degree of natural resistance to this, a sense that to pick Buttler is to devalue decisively the proving grounds of county cricket. Buttler averages 17 in four red‑ball games over the past year. His selection is at odds with all we have heard about the informed methods of Ed Smith, out there crunching his data curves, occasionally emitting a clank of excitement over some outstanding first-innings metrics from the strangely overlooked Cakebread-Thomas of Derbyshire seconds.Instead we have this. Faced with an ailing team and a general anxiety about how to make all forms of cricket more instantly comestible the selectors have reached for the most more-ish option have decided, basically, to just give up and deep-fry the turkey.And yet it is undeniably the right thing to do. Not playing Buttler when you have the chance to play Buttler: that really would be weird. “He hasn’t been picked because of the IPL,” Smith said this week. But he clearly has. Buttler has been picked, in part, because he is famous, because right now he is among the top three hottest, most luminously attractive cricketers in the current edition of the sixth biggest sporting league in the world.This is simply the truth and everyone involved should embrace it, because it’s both entirely sensible and entirely consistent with the England and Wales Cricket Board’s more gimmicky attempts to popularise the game. If we’re willing to junk the basic robustness of the sport via the Hundred, to introduce the new colts cricket rules trailed this week – ditch the lbw law, double-run maxi zones in the field – then it looks like old-school good sense to pick the most pop-famous cricketer in the country as often as possible.The fact is Buttler stands outside the normal rules and numbers. This has been said before about other cricketers. But in this case it’s actually true. He was a ludicrous spectacle in the IPL this year, driving and cuffing and gliding his way to 389 runs off 258 balls at an average of 97, with that familiar, beautifully delicate kind of violence in those whip-crack wrists.It is traditional at this point to suggest batting on pitches where the ball moves, where a flighty fifty can lose a game rather than win it, is a different matter altogether. Plus Buttler has been batting with a self‑made technique in India, adopting that white‑ball power hitting stance, front leg shifted to one side so he can hit in front of square from the same base, sending the ball through the field in a weird flat, scything arc.The thing is, it works. Just as moving up to open has worked, despite the need to adapt instantly to new angles, speeds, pressures. English cricket has no history of producing unorthodox players, certainly not at this global-genius level. But for once it is perhaps simply time to go with it.The real issue around Buttler’s career isn’t his ability to defend against the swinging ball. The absurdity of mature Buttler is that he is essentially a blank in his own country, a Category A sports person in a global game who could probably walk in and buy a plastic bat in the Catford branch of Sports Direct without anyone offering a yawn of recognition.This week the chairman of the ECB told us children just don’t like cricket. This is of course dangerous nonsense. The game is good. The talent is there. But it is also invisible to swathes of the population, just as Buttler has become English sport’s great invisible superstar, hidden away behind the high hedge on the last remaining patch of green.For an industry that spends a lot of time quivering and whining about what it doesn’t have, Buttler is the asset, the talent. Centre stage may be a little left of centre these days. But it’s time to get him out there."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61bde21a7f74c54d62c8cd75f670d355396521ec/0_259_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=19b4adeff0502eef11e46f102b1b4e07","title":"giro ditalia 2018 stage 14  monte zoncolan simon yates live","story":"For the cycling historians among you, the first ever time this mountain stage was included, 2003, was the last time we were treated to the sight of Marco Pantani competing on a mountain stage, but he lost out to Gilberto Simoni, who ended up winning that year’s GC.

Or at least, that’s what it says on the tin. Certainly, there’s a portrait of Lady Hamilton on stage throughout the show, but for most of the 75 minutes it’s Khorsandi who hogs the limelight. We’re left with another erting hour of Shappi chat – about mothering, reality TV, her poet dad – grafted more or less crudely on to a whistle-stop biography of the blacksmith’s daughter turned love of a national hero.It’s never entirely clear why Khorsandi is telling that story in particular, beyond her obvious identification with Emma’s up-by-the-bootstraps life story. The comic makes a compelling case for Lady H as a strikingly modern figure, trapped in and stifled by life as a pawn and plaything of wealthy men. But Khorsandi’s parallels between her life and that of her Georgian-era subject are a bit forced, and Hamilton’s presence in the show – sitting alongside unrelated material about attending children’s parties and turning down literary prizes – can feel arbitrary.The literary award in question was the Jhalak prize for writers of colour Khorsandi reprises – but doesn’t much develop – material on the subject she trialled when last at Soho, 18 months ago. Elsewhere, jokes about Britishness and her dad’s exile from Iran are recycled from previous sets, as is the characterisation of her son and daughter as English and Middle Eastern stereotypes respectively. The newest material covers her recent stint on I’m a Celebrity – as caustic as you’d expect, even if her surprise at how idiotic the show turned out to be seems a mite disingenuous.It’s all likable enough – Khorsandi is nothing if not a convivial host – and there are droll sections on her social unease and on a pragmatic sexual encounter in Amsterdam that fosters her kinship with Hamilton. Another skit, quoting 18th-century reviews of Covent Garden prostitutes, raises a few gasps, and also the thought of how rich the show might have been had Khorsandi fully committed to its historical conceit.

We were tackling a stretch of the Vjosa, a 270km river that begins in Greece (where it is called the Aoös) and flows through Albania and into the Adriatic just north of the city of Vlora. I was on a recce trip for a new southern Albanian break with Much Better Adventures, which specialises in long weekends to wild places in Europe and North Africa. But this trip was not just a fun adventure – rather just part of a campaign to save the river, which is under threat from proposed dams. A documentary film, Blue Heart, out this month, will highlight the fight to protect Europe’s last wild rivers, with help from ecotourism.From May to October, the Vjosa’s canyons are navigable by raft – at thrilling speeds and with waves well over a metre high. We were there in early March, when these narrow stretches of water were too dangerous, so rafted a wider, gentler section: it offered less adrenaline, but gave a flavour of the full trip. Swirling downriver, we seemed to be journeying through an untouched land.Under communist dictator Enver Hoxha, Albania was cut off from the world for nearly 50 years in the postwar era, and still feels like unexplored territory – a rare thing only three hours’ flight from the UK. The river banks rose steeply to snowcapped mountains, and the only other people we saw were a couple of boys riding a donkey.Before the rafting, I met Olsi Nika from NGO EcoAlbania, to find out why this river is so special. “The Vjosa and most of its tributaries are completely undisturbed,” he said. “It is the last big, wild, free-flowing river in Europe outside of Russia.” He and other environmentalists want to keep it this way. “We have a vision to declare a national park, and offer ecotourism: rafting, kayaking, fly-fishing.”New river-based ventures are springing up, such as the Albanian Adventure Resort on the River Osum near Çorovoda, which will offer canyoning, riverboarding and more from next spring. And Albania’s mountains, soaring to 2,800 metres, have huge potential for hiking and climbing. The hope is that sustainable adventure tourism will offer a viable source of revenue for the country.But the environmentalists have a battle on their hands. The government plans to build eight major hydropower plants on the Vjosa, and another 20 or so on its tributaries as part of a massive Balkans hydro project. More than 500 hydropower plants are planned for Albania, among about 3,000 in the wider region. The consequences include loss of habitat and rare species, flooding, coastal erosion and compulsory resettlement, said Nika. “So 2018 is a crucial year for the Vjosa. There will be lawsuits, lobbying, scientific studies and artist-led protests.” As part of the battle, Much Better Adventures is working with Albanian activists and local operators such as the Albania Rafting Group to encourage people to book a trip.Besides rafting, we explored plenty of the rest of the country, taking in coast and historic sites. A highlight was the ancient city of Butrint, a Unesco world heritage site on a spectacular wooded peninsula, between a lake and a channel leading to the Straits of Corfu. After seeing the theatre, baptistry and other remains, we kayaked down the channel to Ali Pasha’s Castle, an island fortress named after the Ottoman ruler.Albania’s 426km of Adriatic and Ionian coastline offers excellent hiking, too. Saranda, the main resort on the Albanian Riviera, is very built-up but you don’t have to go far to find unspoiled beaches and clifftop hikes. We started 20km up the coast at Lukova, which has a few summer beach bars and restaurants, and walked for 90 minutes along the cliffs to Krorez Bay. This beach has golden sand, turquoise water and no tourists. We enjoyed a swim and snorkel, then scrambled up the sheer cliff and hacked our way through undergrowth to the next beach, dramatic Kakome, backed by thickly forested cliffs. (This beach is now privately owned, so walkers need permission to visit – our guides had phoned ahead.)We spent a night at a homestay in Peshtan, a tiny village close to the Vjosa. By day, we hiked to a lookout point where the river meets one of its tributaries – the view was worth braving a rickety wooden bridge over the canyon. By night, we sat under the stars in a villager’s garden, drank raki and listened to a impromptu performance of pleqërishte – polyphonic folk songs by local shepherds. This peaceful way of life would be destroyed by one of the planned dams.At the Benja natural spa, near the town of Permet, we bathed in a warm pool by the river and slathered ourselves in green mud. We had this wonder almost to ourselves but the baths are an important summer tourist attraction. They’re at the mouth of the Langarica canyon, where there are more hot springs and caves. Here, too, a dam is planned – if it goes ahead, the canyon will run dry and the springs will be put in jeopardy.We sampled city life in Gjirokastra (another Unesco world heritage site, for its Ottoman old town), about 55km north of Saranda. It is known for its 17th-century houses and bazaar, and 18th-century mosque. Ismail Kadare was born here and his former home is now a museum – the leading Albanian writer won the inaugural Man Booker international prize in 2005.We squeezed in a visit to Berat, too, (yet another Unesco site) on the way to Tirana. This is not on the regular itinerary, but well worth extending a trip for. Its 13th-century citadel has steep cobbled streets and Byzantine churches Ottoman houses tumble down the hill to the Osum river and climb up the other side. We stayed at the gloriously kitsch Castle Park hotel, a jumble of taxidermy and folk art in woods just outside town, and dined on the usual spread of homemade bread and olive oil, salads, grilled vegetables, cheese, spinach byrek (filled flaky pastry) and crispy lamb.It was a whirlwind insight into a place I’d gladly return to. A country with beaches, sunny climate, scenery and cuisine to rival far more popular Mediterranean destinations, with fewer crowds and at a fraction of the cost. Now is the time to experience its unspoiled beauty – and to help ensure it stays that way. Wait, and it could be too late. As Nika said, “If you put a dam in a river, you kill it forever.”How to do itThe trip was provided by Much Better Adventures, whose three-day Raft, Hike and Kayak Albania trip costs from £350, including accommodation, meals, local transport, guide and activities, but not flights.Getting thereFrom April to October, easyJet flies from Bristol, Gatwick, Luton, Manchester and Newcastle to Corfu from about £60 return Ionian Seaways has a 30-minute hydrofoil from Corfu to Saranda from €38 return.

The deal calls for changes to fiscal policy and a €780 (£680) monthly basic income for poor families.It also spells out a new crackdown on immigration, including a “serious and efficient” programme to drive out migrants who arrive in Italy illegally. The plan calls for more detention centres to be opened in every region, in which migrants could be held for up to 18 months.The agreement calls for an overhaul of the Dublin treaty, so that asylum seekers would be distributed across the EU instead of being required to stay in the country where they first arrive, and it calls for religious leaders to be registered with the state. All camps of “unregistered” Roma would be shut down under the plan.Italy’s general election on 4 March resulted in a hung parliament. Matteo Salvini, the head of the League, and the Five Star Movement’s Luigi di Maio have been locked in negotiations for weeks to agree on a common set of governing goals. The pair have still not agreed on who should serve as prime minister. The new government’s platform is expected to be approved by M5S members late on Friday in an online poll. On Monday, Di Maio and Salvini are expected to meet Italy’s president, Sergio Mattarella, to formalise the launch of the government. Once a prime minister has been nominated and ministers sworn in, the government will face a vote of confidence in the parliament. Both parties ran campaigns that vilified migrants, and Salvini has attacked Italy’s Roma population throughout his political career. It is not clear whether Italy has the legal right or resources to follow through on some of the radical ideas that were agreed, but the League vowed during the electoral campaign to institute mass deportations of asylum seekers to Africa as part of a reshaping of migration policies.Immigration experts said the new agreement meant programmes seeking to integrate new migrants could be closed. “They campaign against any positive actions or programmes, which are the very basis for any minority. This keeps them in a structurally backward position,” said Francesco Palermo, a former senator who was a vocal proponent of Romany rights in Italy. “It is more populist than racist, they feel this is what the voters want, and unfortunately average Italian society is against Roma, against migrants, against sexual minorities.”Kyenge, who now serves as an MEP, has worked for years to try to change Italy’s citizenship laws so that children of migrants can be recognised as Italians. Last year the government failed to pass a law that would have eased the path to citizenship for 800,000 minors who were born in Italy or came as young children. Kyenge said these children were unable to fully participate in schools and in society. “The identity of a person begins when you are little and it is then you must have an opportunity to say ‘I am an Italian’.”The Congolese-born doctor has lived in Italy since 1983, and has been on the receiving end of deeply offensive racist slurs. Roberto Calderoli, a senator and former minister under Silvio Berlusconi, likened her to an orangutan and told her she should be a minister “in her country”. Mario Borghezio, a far-right MEP, said Kyenge would impose a “bongo-bongo” administration on Italy – comments that led to him being expelled from a Ukip-led group in the European parliament. In 2017 a judge ordered him to pay €50,000 to Kyenge for his racist remarks.Kyenge still has bodyguards to protect her when she is in her home country, as a result of racist abuse from politicians. “People want to attack me because of the colour of my skin and many of those are politicians and it is very sad because politicians should give an example,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2423ecb94a8f246671a76b74d73ef79c12511c2/0_76_2291_1374/master/2291.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8d1607ae45ea8e1578c471d747609da","title":"venezuela election sunday nicolas maduro henri falcon","story":"Many fear dirty tricks will keep the unpopular president in power, but the opposition is urging people not to boycott Sunday’s voteAfter denouncing Venezuela’s food shortages and hyperinflation in a speech ahead of Sunday’s presidential election, the opposition candidate, Henrí Falcón, sat in his campaign bus, sucking a throat lozenge – and chewing over his predicament.Falcón ought to be the favorite.

But what most infuriates him is friendly fire: Venezuela’s largest opposition parties are denouncing Falcón as a stooge for participating in an election they say will be a sham – and which they have vowed to boycott.“This makes it a lot more complicated,” Falcón admits. “But we are going to take risks and follow the democratic path. Now is not the time for politicians to go into hiding.”Falcón has been buoyed by polls that show him either ahead or within striking distance of Maduro. He also points to research showing that even on an unfair electoral playing field, it’s almost always better to participate than to stand down. A 2009 study by the Brookings Institution of more than 100 electoral boycotts – from Afghanistan to Iraq to Peru – found that their goal of rendering elections illegitimate in the eyes of the world was rarely achieved. Instead, they left the boycotting parties in an even weaker state.Javier Corrales, a Venezuela expert at Amherst College, says that Sunday’s election presents an extremely rare opportunity for voters to remove an autocrat through peaceful means. Surrendering to Maduro, he says, “is the biggest mistake I’ve seen the opposition make in a decade.”The leaders of the largest of the 20-some parties that make up the opposition coalition claim that electoral conditions are so grossly weighted in Maduro’s favor that voting on Sunday would be pointless.Most electoral officials are Maduro loyalists who, in past elections, have turned a blind eye to vote tampering and the last-minute relocation of polling places in opposition strongholds. The government controls most TV and radio stations which transmit a constant stream of of pro-Maduro propaganda. It is also fomenting the notion that the ballot is not secret and that people who vote for the opposition will lose government jobs, public housing, and vital food handouts.Under the late Hugo Chávez, who ushered in Venezuela’s socialist revolution in 1999, a new constitution and numerous elections placed nearly all government institutions under the control of the ruling Socialist party.\u0026nbspThis concentration of power was aided by a feuding opposition which carried out ineffectual campaigns and electoral boycotts. After Chávez died of cancer in 2013, he was succeeded by Nicolás Maduro who is even less tolerant of dissent.The resulting fiscal crisis has prompted the government to print more money, which has led to hyperinflation and a collapse of the currency.\u0026nbspIt also means that the government can’t import enough food and medicine to meet demand.\u0026nbspMaduro has rejected economic reforms out of loyalty to socialism and because many government officials are allegedly getting rich off the economic distortions – through exchange rate scams and by selling scarce food on the black market.“It matters little whether this threat is real or perceived. Most people can’t afford to risk their paltry food rations to in order find out,” wrote the Caracas political blogger Emiliana Duarte. Maduro’s re-election pitch “pretty much comes down to ‘vote for me if you want food, starve if you want to make a point’”, she said.At a campaign rally in the western city of Barquisimeto, Maduro put it this way: “The Fatherland protects you and gives you everything. And you must give the Fatherland political power.”But just to make sure, the government has banned the two most popular opposition politicians – Leopoldo López who is under house arrest for inciting violence and Henrique Capriles who faces trumped-up corruption charges – from running. Those allowed on the ballot are two lesser-known figures: Falcón and televangelist Javier Bertucci, who is attracting big crowds by turning his campaign events into makeshift soup kitchens.Carlos González, an anti-government activist who heads a Venezuelan business association, says the name on the ballot doesn’t matter: “Jesus Christ could be the candidate and Maduro would still prevail because the system is set up for him to win,” he says. The opposition has taken this argument overseas, convincing the United States, the European Union and several Latin American countries to denounce the balloting as a sham.“Yes, Venezuelans want to vote. But we don’t want to legitimize the Maduro regime and the misery that he has brought to the country,” said Negal Morales, an opposition lawmaker. “To vote would be to take part in a farce.”Some critics contend that the boycott came about after the opposition was outmaneuvered by government negotiators. In discussions over electoral conditions, the opposition drew a line in the sand, demanding a neutral electoral tribunal, a postponement of the balloting until October, and the presence of international observers. After months of talks, the government conceded almost nothing. According to one observer, that left the opposition feeling obliged to save face by making good on its threat to sit out the election.“Maduro wants people to abstain,” Francisco Rodríguez, Falcón’s chief policy advisor, said. “He wants nobody to come out to vote because that’s the only election he can win. And the opposition fell into that trap.”Looking back on that outcome, Genaro Arriagada, the national director of Chile’s “no” campaign, once declared: “Even in a dictatorship, the worst mistake is to not participate.”With that in mind, Falcón has been barnstorming the country to convince people to that their votes matter. A former governor of the western state of Lara, Falcón was once a vocal supporter of the Bolivarian revolution ushered in by the late Hugo Chávez in 1999. But Falcón broke with Chávez in 2008 and has become a fierce critic of Maduro. His blunt campaign slogan is ¡Se va! – Spanish for “He’s leaving”.Speaking to a crowd in a working-class barrio in the industrial city of Valencia, Falcón called Maduro “the president of hunger and misery”. He pointed out that the average monthly salary is no longer enough to buy a carton of eggs and outlined his plan to scrap the bolívar, Venezuela’s badly devalued currency, and replace it with the US dollar.Maduro has said that he is a victim of “economic warfare” waged from Washington his critics blame the cratering economy on mismanagement. Meanwhile a steady stream of multinationals have withdrawn from Venezuela saying that currency controls and shortages make it impossible to do business in the country. This week, the breakfast cereal maker Kellogg’s announced that it was pulling out because of the “economic and social deterioration in the country.”In the crowd at Valencia, one newfound Falcón supporter, Maricarmen Vidal, said she used to work as a cleaning woman in the house of a middle-class family in Valencia. But to escape the economic meltdown, the family moved abroad and she was thrown out of work. Now, she eeks out a living selling tiny bags of sugar and coffee on a Valencia street corner. Vidal says about the only thing she knows about Falcón is that he’s not Maduro – “but that’s enough.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3269547a7c15387881c41f5ddc23fd209ec68957/69_0_2063_1238/master/2063.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02e3c59c0618af81f9e784f5627a3137","title":"china says air force lands bombers on south china sea islands","story":"Exercise described by air force as preparation for ‘the battle’ for the disputed waters China’s air force has landed bombers on islands and reefs in the South China Sea as part of a training exercise in the disputed region, it said in a statement.Several bombers of various types – including the long-range, nuclear strike-capable H-6K – carried out landing and take off drills at an unidentified island airfield after carrying out simulated strike training on targets at sea, the Chinese airforce said.“A ision of the People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) recently organised multiple bombers such as the H-6K to conduct take-off and landing training on islands and reefs in the South China Sea in order to improve our ability to ‘reach all territory, conduct strikes at any time and strike in all directions’,” it said.The statement said the pilot of the H-6K bomber conducted assault training on a designated sea target and then carried out take-offs and landings at an airport in the area, describing the exercise as preparation for “the west Pacific and the battle for the South China Sea”. The notice, published on the PLAAF’s Weibo microblogging account, did not provide the precise location of the exercise. The US has dispatched warships to disputed areas of the South China Sea in a bid to challenge China’s extensive sovereignty claims in the territory, which is also subject to claims by Vietnam, the Philippines, Taiwan, Brunei and Malaysia. The waters are vital global shipping routes and contain what are believed to be significant oil and natural gas deposits.“The United States remains committed to a free and open Indo-Pacific,” Pentagon spokesman Lt Col Christopher Logan said. “We have seen these same reports and China’s continued militarisation of disputed features in the South China Sea only serves to raise tensions and destabilise the region.” Wang Mingliang, a defence expert cited in the Chinese statement, said the takeoff and landing exercises will help the air force “strengthen its combat capability to deal with maritime security threats”.The move comes weeks after US network CNBC reported that China had installed anti-ship and air-to-air defences on outposts in the Spratly Islands that are also claimed by Vietnam and the Philippines, citing sources close to US intelligence.Washington warned Beijing would face unspecified “consequences” over its militarisation of the South China Sea, and said it had raised the issue with China.In an analysis published on its website, CSIS said the location of the runway was believed to be Woody Island, China’s largest base in the Paracel Islands, which is also claimed by Vietnam and Taiwan.China has engaged in years of land-reclamation efforts on reefs it controls in the region and built both civilian and military facilities in the contested area.Chinese military facilities include air bases, radar and communications systems, naval facilities and defensive weaponry including landing strips able to accommodate military planes.Reuters and Agence France-Presse contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54c14350da8d726c795bcd8d4ed933775707153f/0_1969_3983_2390/master/3983.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dc2c94653984f9495b13d44d2b475244","title":"exposed how to disappear from the internet","story":"Worried about what’s out there about you? You’re not alone. But is it even possible to become a digital ghost?Early one morning last year, before the birds were up, Tio Bucard, his wife and children skittered down the path from their home in a tiny French village towards a black SUV, its engine running. As Bucard drove to the local airport, he checked his rear-view mirror every few moments to see that he was still being followed by Frank Ahearn, a 54-year-old American with a peppery beard and wraparound sunglasses. Bucard (not his real name) had met Ahearn for the first time only the day before, in the lobby of a Monaco hotel close to Bucard’s office. Now he had entrusted his family’s safety to this former drug addict from the Bronx. Bucard pulled into the airport’s long-term car park. Then he and the family transferred into Ahearn’s hired SUV. As they pulled on to the motorway, Ahearn joked whether, while the family was in hiding, he could look after Bucard’s £5,000 watch, a Bentley Flying B No 3.The watch was a reminder of more plentiful times. Bucard, who raised capital for a private equity firm, had recently found himself on the wrong end of a bad deal. Problems gathered and the firm began to default on payments. One of the slighted investors had, as Bucard puts it, “a shady past” and angry phone calls soon blackened into threats of physical violence. Fearing for his and his family’s safety, Bucard typed the phrase “how to disappear” into Google. Halfway down the first page of results, he saw Ahearn’s name. A former New York skip tracer – a private investigator who finds people who have “skipped” town – turned professional “disappearer”, Ahearn offers a range of freelance services, everything from helping to restore your privacy on the internet to driving your family across Europe and into a new life.“My idea was to go away for three to four months,” Bucard tells me. “Just until I could raise the funds to pay back my investors.” Not wanting to cause alarm, Bucard told his children they were taking an extended vacation. The day before they fled, Ahearn rented an Airbnb in a far-flung city in his name. When the family arrived at the safe house, Ahearn bought new mobile phones and laptops, then schooled the family on the rules of their new life: do use untraceable text-messaging services don’t use public email servers do pay in cash don’t use Facebook. After a few days, Ahearn left the Bucards in their temporary accommodation and returned to his home in Madrid, where he lives with his girlfriend. In his wallet, he carried Bucard’s credit card.When he landed in Spain, Ahearn tried to imagine what a man of Bucard’s wealth might indulge in while on holiday. Then he began a riot of spending: fine clothes, meals out, a king’s ransom of trinkets. “I had a blast with his plastic,” he says. “And that, my friend, is how to leave a trail of super-cool disinformation.”Money, violence, indiscretion: the motivation for any person who wants to disappear, either physically or digitally, usually wends back to one of these. Whatever the reason and whatever the scale of the ambition – from starting a new life in a foreign country to scrubbing one’s name and address from the phonebook – it has never been harder to vanish. In a world where almost any action outside your garden shed leaves some kind of digital footprint, there is no clear path back to the realm of the unknown.In recent months, the scale of the erosion of our anonymity has become dauntingly clear. In humming, ice-cooled server farms, the monoliths of Silicon Valley gather fat troves of personal information. This much we have known for years – as early as 2010, an investigation found that Facebook apps were routinely collecting information for internet-tracking companies without our consent – even from private accounts. But the recent Cambridge Analytica scandal brought new clarity. Those who downloaded their personal data files found that Facebook and its associated apps had been tracking phone calls, reading messages and plundering phonebooks.This gleeful, grasping attitude to our data is in the social network’s DNA. This year it was revealed that in 2004, while Facebook was still a university campus website on which male students could rate the attractiveness of female students, its founder, Mark Zuckerberg, sent an instant message to a friend in which he boasted that he had collected more than 4,000 emails, pictures and addresses of people who had signed up to the service.“What?” Zuckerberg’s friend exclaimed. “How’d you manage that one?”“People just submitted it,” Zuckerberg wrote. “I don’t know why. They ‘trust me’.”“Dumb fucks,” he added, after a pause.Facebook is not the only harvester of personal information. If Google is the engine that drives the internet, personal information is the oil that makes it purr. Via its Maps app, it knows where you’ve been, how you got there (foot, car, bus, train), how long you stayed and whether or not it was your first visit. The company stores your search history across every device on which you’re logged in, while algorithms reportedly scour your emails for signs that you might be pregnant, engaged or unwell. Google Lens, announced earlier this month, is a visual search engine that provides information about the things you’re looking at through your phone’s camera. Google likely knows your age, gender, hobbies, career, interests, relationship status, every YouTube video you’ve watched, every image you’ve searched for, whether or not you’re depressed and, possibly, even why you’re depressed before you do – and it’s far from the only omniscient god in the digital pantheon. What began as a hopeful, democratic mission to make the internet free for all in the 1990s has, when fed through the late capitalist mincer, resulted in a digital economy that runs on microtransactions of identity. This information, if held by a government, would inspire widespread civil liberty marches.For most of us, the quality and convenience of what we receive in exchange for our secrets is enough that we willingly surrender. But now an increasing number of people are more closely counting the cost – to the point of trying to reclaim our right to be unknown. It’s become a challenge: the woman fleeing an abusive relationship, the elderly victim of identity theft, the stalked celebrity, the school leaver who’s sabotaged their job search with old, embarrassing YouTube videos, already knows just how difficult that can be.When Ahearn finished rehab, aged 17, he had quit pills but was left newly directionless. He took a stopgap job in a New York shoe store. Then, when it closed down, he responded to an advertisement for a private investigator. The job was glamour-less, but Ahearn found it intoxicating nonetheless. He was hired to pose as a stockroom worker for high-end New York stores and catch co-workers stealing the merchandise. He caught 15 employees stealing from one department store, and later busted a 30-man criminal ring at an electronics and furniture warehouse. “Manipulation,” he says. “It’s the first thing I was ever really good at.”Carry out a self-styled “before” audit to see what’s out there. Search for yourself with all name variations, email addresses and residential addresses. You could be shocked by what you find.\u0026nbspAll active accounts must be deleted – not deactivated – if you want to use the internet untraceably. Facebook, Amazon, eBay, Netflix, Tinder: they all have to go. It can be difficult to remember every site you have signed up for, so look in your email inbox for newsletters. Unsubscribe and ask to be removed from their data list the new GDPR update on 25 May 2018 means that sites are legally obliged to do this on request.It’s highly likely that personal data such as home address, email and even your date of birth is being publicly shared online by so-called data broker websites, such as 192. Ask for this information to be removed directly from the site, and they should comply.If you’ve posted on web forums, you can ask the webmasters to remove your posting. If they prove unresponsive, and data brokers or social media companies fail to remove your information on request, then exercise the “right to be forgotten” by a direct request to Google (search for legal removal request).Unfortunately, once removed does not mean for ever removed on the internet. You should actively audit yourself every six months and some of the steps may have to be repeated. And if you can’t quite make all the necessary sacrifices, consider setting up a false email address with inaccurate data, amending personal details such as age, sex, name and location.After a while, the private detective agency allowed Ahearn to work in the office. There he sat next to a skip tracer. “Skip-tracing is the art of finding people,” he explains. “There are two types of skip tracer: passive ones, who use databases and directories to find people and aggressive ones, who carry out social engineering to find their prey.” Ahearn would listen as his colleague extracted information about someone by calling utility companies and posing as the target in order to gain access to their phone records and bank details until, finally, he zoned in on a likely hideout address. Ahearn convinced his boss to give him a go. “I was like wildfire,” he recalls. “A natural.”In 1984, Ahearn left the detective agency and set up as a freelance skip tracer. For a while, business boomed. He would occasionally take short breaks (“Sometimes being so good at something so devious plays on the head”), but then crisis dawned when the laws in America changed, making many of the skip tracers’ techniques illegal. “Life became more difficult,” he recalls. Ahearn moved to Europe, where the laws were less stringent, and then, in the late 1990s, the pendulum swung back. The omnipresence of the mobile phone made it far easier to track iniduals, and the creeping ubiquity of social media ushered in a new golden era for the investigator. “I can find you through your mother’s Facebook, a blog you wrote three years ago, an old LinkedIn account,” Ahearn says.In 2001, he placed an advertisement on a website that provided advice about offshore living. When the website’s owner pointed out that Ahearn’s work finding people might concern its users, who, in many cases, prized anonymity, Ahearn suggested that he write a blogpost on how to disappear instead. “It was a really cheesy article, but it just blew up,” Ahearn recalls. “People from all over the world started contacting me.” Once he had weeded out those iniduals looking for an aider and abetter (“If you’re facing law enforcement, I cannot help you I also stay away from sexual issues”), Ahearn took on his first client: a woman who wanted to escape from her violent partner. “She didn’t want a new identity, just to move away and be sure that the husband couldn’t find her,” he says.In the past 15 years, the techniques Ahearn uses to ghost a client have grown in scope and sophistication. But unlike reputation management companies, which typically try to drive harmful or revealing information down search engine results, he favours the use of misinformation – and not just via misdirecting credit card transactions in a foreign city. “You can’t delete information,” he says. “It’s not going away. It’s a case of manipulating what is already out there.”If Ahearn is the special forces of the vanishment industry, brought in for the most extreme jobs, a sparse, open-plan office on the outskirts of Liverpool is home to the foot soldiers of this burgeoning industry. Here, at Reputation Defender, a team of 30 or so young men and women scour the internet for personal information – phone numbers, dates of birth, addresses, electoral records – that their clients want removed from the internet.Managing director Tony McChrystal began working in online privacy and reputation management before there was a name for the industry. In 2008, when he joined the company, then known as Reputation 247, as one of its first employees, it had just five clients. “We were living hand to mouth, you know, never sure whether we were going to be able to open the doors the following month,” he says. Today, the company is one of the largest in its field McChrystal claims that the UK office receives 70 inquiries a day, mostly from iniduals who want to become unknown on the internet. To date, the company has served more than a million clients worldwide, and last month it was bought by the Washington-based Stagwell Group for an undisclosed sum.In the early years, McChrystal’s clients were typically celebrities, footballers and CEOs: people who wanted specific pieces of professionally damaging information about them – an affair, a failed business deal – pushed down the search engine rankings. In recent years, however, he says that the company mainly works with the kind of “regular” people who might pay for their credit file report every month, and who want a similar reputation or privacy report. For around £600 a year, the company will give you a list of what personal or sensitive information is publicly available. “A lot of the time, they’re scared of identity theft, fraud or even – if their current address is out there – scared of their own personal safety,” McChrystal says. It is surprisingly easy for a criminal to use social media to plan a burglary. “One of our clients’ daughter was on holiday in France recently at the family villa, and she posted geo-tagged pictures on Instagram of the villa alongside pictures of her and her friends wearing expensive jewellery and watches,” McChrystal explains. Within 24 hours of posting, there was a home invasion at the villa and half a million dollars’ worth of jewellery was stolen. “After that, we had to go in and talk about how to manage their privacy settings on their Instagram and Facebook.”Like Ahearn, McChrystal and his team screen the motivations of potential clients. “We probably get two paedophiles call up every day,” he admits. This kind of inidual, McChrystal says, will typically claim they are the victim of mistaken identity: someone who shares their name has been accused of something awful. “That kind of thing actually doesn’t happen very often, so we tell them we will have to carry out a police check, and that’s when the conversation breaks down.” Team members refer to a “Who we serve” document, drawn up by the company’s lawyers, which forbids working with criminals who have been convicted of “anything above a misdemeanour”, as well as fraudsters and those who have been accused of sexual misconduct. “It’s not even up for debate. If you were found guilty of physical abuse, that’s relevant information to me. It shouldn’t be forgotten, you know?”Google agrees. In 2014, the European court of justice ruled that “irrelevant” and outdated data should be erased on request. In the past four years, the company has received more than 600,000 requests (many of which were submitted by the team at Reputation Defender on behalf of its clients) to delist nearly 2.4m results from the search engine. In many cases, Google has successfully argued that the information is in the public interest and that the petitioner does not have the right to be forgotten.In the past two years, however, McChrystal, who deleted his own Facebook account some time ago, has seen a marked increase in approaches from iniduals who are not in danger or want a piece of damaging information covered up, but who simply want to reclaim their anonymity.Emma Jones approached the team last year after one of her closest friends was the victim of identity theft. When Jones Googled herself, she found her name and address posted to various directory sites. “I wasn’t comfortable with my data being on the internet and there being nothing I could do about it,” she says. “I’ve got a young family. I felt exposed.” McChrystal’s team put together a dossier showing all the information on her and her family that was available online, alongside a proposal for how it might be removed or, in the case of social media sites, made private. Jones, who works in marketing, represents a new kind of client: one without a specific privacy problem who has become sufficiently unnerved by recent data breaches that she is willing to spend hundreds of pounds hiring professionals to restore her anonymity.Like many people, she once used Facebook as a way of keeping a record of family life. “I’d upload photos of my children every day. I didn’t care whether or not my friends found them interesting. Now I rarely post pictures of my children – maybe the backs of their heads, but that’s it. It should be their choice, not mine. If my daughter comes to me when she is older and asks me why I put all those photos of her on the internet, I have no comeback.”In recent weeks, a grassroots movement has formed around the slogan Delete Facebook (Zuckerberg claims it has been a failure). For Meg Jayanth, a writer for video games, the Cambridge Analytica scandal pushed her willingly into Facebook oblivion. “I’d been considering deleting Facebook for at least a year, but my data anxieties were outweighed by convenience,” she told me. “Facebook was the way I stayed in touch with friends and family, and I was reluctant to leave it behind. The Cambridge Analytica news tipped the balance for me, not because it was unexpected, but because it forced me to stop rationalising away my use of the service, and act. I was sick of feeling apprehensive for using a service I didn’t even want to use any more.”The process of deleting one’s Facebook account is deliberately arcane. The social network encourages you to “deactivate” your account, rather than “delete” it, to leave an open door if you later regret the decision. Permanent deletion requires a request be made to the company. If you log in within 14 days of the process being under way (easy to do accidentally if you have the app on your phone or linked accounts that require you to log in via Facebook), the company will automatically cancel your original request.For Jayanth, who holds an Indian passport, the recent news that the US state department is asking visa applicants to declare their social media accounts on their forms was a further incentive. “The idea that customs officials might look through your social media, and could potentially make decisions based on whether or not you support the current government is dangerous. That could have a chilling effect on public debate.”Tio Bucard’s experience last year was enough to force a more thorough evaluation of his family’s privacy and safety. They never returned to their house in the French village.“This is something that happens to many of my clients,” Ahearn says. “Disappearing is a trigger that wakes a person up and makes one think carefully about what is next.”Ahearn founded a few offshore companies for Bucard, helping him buy a new house, cars and other essentials. He set the family up with a communications protocol, so they could keep in touch with family and business associates. Bucard and his wife decided to take the children out of the French education system and home school them. They took out private medical insurance to remove their names from the health system. To maintain a life of anonymity is an ongoing act of obsession, a symptom of which is often paranoia. Bucard has kept Ahearn on retainer whenever a new client comes his way, Ahearn runs checks on the person, to make sure they are who they say they are, and not connected in some way to his previous life.Complete invisibility is an impossible goal for anyone outside a witness protection programme (“The creme de la creme,” as Ahearn puts it. “If you have that, you have everything”), even for those who have never signed up for a social media or Google account. In Britain, unless you opt out when registering to vote, your data is collected and made available to anyone who wants to buy a copy.“People see the digital realm as being this separate thing, something close to unreal,” Ahearn says. “But it’s all the same thing. Would you put a picture of your child on a billboard next to a highway alongside your family name? Of course not. But people do it online all the time. And it’s not a problem. Until it is.”Some names have been changed• Commenting on this piece?

Illustration: Michael VineyWhere the hill behind us curves round to face west, there’s a stretch where it steepens sharply and is littered with glacial rocks. Any breeze from the sea – which is usual – bounces up the slope to let a kestrel hover there with spread wings and least effort: perhaps it has a wind-map in its mind of these things.“Windhover” is an old name for Falco tinnunculus (falco being the Latin for sickle, the shape of the wings, and tinnunculus for jingling, as of a bell and onomatopoeic for the kestrel’s rare cry). It is also a name I love, surviving the ecstatic densities of Gerard Manley Hopkins’s much-parsed poem. Pursuing the word’s history online brought me to a lively row over two supposedly ancient alternatives in historic English usage: “windfucker” and “windsucker”. The first is advanced in an online dictionary compiled by an American sociologist and author Douglas Harper (Online Etymology Dictionary, 2001-2018). A criticism that the elongated “s” of old manuscripts has simply been misread has prompted vigorous and erudite exchanges (see Wiktionary: Talk: windfucker).The current balance of the argument seems to be that both words have sound provenance, with the “f” word in use as synonym for “beat” or “strike” – something vigorous, anyway – in the 16th and 17th centuries, and the other as having local usage from Kent to Orkney. Of much more interest scientifically has been a Finnish study in the 1990s, which showed the hovering kestrel’s ability to track voles on the ground below through ultraviolet (UV) reflections from the urine and faeces the rodents use to scent-mark their runways.In northern Europe, and notably in Scandinavia, there are broadly four-year cycles of change that synchronise crashes in the vole population with kestrel migrations over hundreds of square kilometres. When this happens, how do the birds seek out the most promising concentrations of voles?The Finnish researchers used captive kestrels in laboratory experiments to show that they detected vole scent marks in UV light but not in visible light. Then they moved out into field trials over some 100sq km of level farmland.They ided this into areas with and without artificial vole trails of urine and faeces, and without trails at all, and distributed kestrel nesting boxes between them, 15 to each. They watched the foraging, mostly male birds for 24 mornings as they hunted near the boxes the following spring and charted their special attention to the areas with artificial scent trails.Ireland had no voles until the bank vole, Myodes variolus, arrived in the 1920s with German earth-moving machinery brought in through Foynes to build the Shannon dam at Ardnacrusha. They now extend through nearly half the island, mostly in the south and west.Another alien invader, the greater white-toothed shrew, was discovered in 2008, its little bones showing up in disgorged pellets of kestrels and barn owls in Tipperary and Limerick. The shrew is thought to have arrived en famille in the root ball of a big plant imported to an Irish garden centre now, advancing at some 5km a year, it is colonising seven counties.Ireland has been poor in small mammal species, but the two newcomers have threatened those we have, and notably the native field mouse and pygmy shrew. The latter is disappearing altogether where both aliens are present.Such changes have brought what has been called “an invasional meltdown” to the ecosystems of hedgerow and grassland. And for raptors like kestrel and barn owl, it offers a change of diet.Dr Pat Smiddy, an ornithologist and conservation ranger, decided to take some measure of change by analysing kestrel pellets across 650sq km of east Co Cork and west Co Waterford – farmland within the aliens’ known territory. From nest sites in old and ruined buildings, many of which he knew, he collected 1,057 of the pellets.Teased apart for significant bones, every site yielded bits of bank voles, especially where the greater white-toothed shrew was also present. The pygmy shrew turned up mostly where the bigger shrew was absent and never where both aliens live together. Field and house mice and brown rat – traditional kestrel prey – were low in the percentage of remains.This research into Irish kestrel diet, the most comprehensive so far, shows how important the alien mammals have become for birds of prey and the impact of their competition with native furry species. Our birds of prey are changing too, as red kite, golden and white-tailed eagles have been introduced as apex predators, so that a whole new wildlife scenario heads into the problems of climate change.Dr Smiddy’s study is published in the Biology and Environment journal of the Royal Irish Academy.

Photograph: Andrew YatesGetty ImagesTheresa May’s plan to keep Britain aligned with the EU customs union after the end of a post-Brexit transition period has run into resistance from Conservative backbenchers, with former party leader Iain Duncan Smith warning that it should not last more than a month or two.The cabinet agreed this week that the whole of the United Kingdom could remain linked to the customs union beyond the end of 2020 if trade negotiations failed to find a solution that would keep the Irish Border open.Mr Duncan Smith said Brexiteers could accept such a move but only if it was very strictly limited in duration and he warned against agreeing to an extension at this stage in the negotiations.“If they do require to have some kind of backstop, most people will accept that on the basis that it is there for practical reasons but that it is not in any way about the politics, it is wholly about the practicalities,” he told the BBC.“Pre-announcing an extension would be barking mad – you would send a signal to the EU that we don’t know what we want.”Labour’s shadow Northern Ireland secretary Tony Lloyd said the prime minister’s proposal, which she has yet to outline in detail, was no more than a temporary measure which was an inadequate response to the issue of the Border.“If I was an investor looking to invest in my own constituency here in Rochdale, or for that matter anywhere across Northern Ireland, I’d want a bit more certainty about how long this is going to last,” he said.\u0026nbsp“We’ve got to have some real fleshing-out, because no hard border is not just for 2019, 2020, it’s got to be into the long future.”Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said this week that a plan for customs would not be enough to resolve the Border issue, which would require Britain to retain close ties to the single market too. EU negotiators are sceptical about a customs-only solution, pointing out that border checks would still be needed for regulatory purposes.\u0026nbspBrussels has also made clear that its proposed backstop for Northern Ireland, which would see the North effectively remain in parts of the single market, will not be available to the whole of the UK.Brexiteers on the Conservative backbenches are adamant that Britain must not maintain regulatory alignment for goods with the EU after Brexit and that the country must be free to negotiate new, independent trade deals as soon as possible.Following 15 defeats in the House of Lords on the EU Withdrawal Bill, Ms May has nominated nine new Conservative life peers, including a number of former MPs. Since most of the amendments opposed by the government were passed with majorities numbered in the dozens, the appointments will not make a decisive difference to the arithmetic in the upper house.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn nominated three life peers and DUP leader in Westminster Nigel Dodds nominated former mid-Ulster MP William McCrea.\u0026nbspNegotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3500170.1526644221!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"monarchy in the uk the royal family s uncertain future","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLondon barriers decorated with a royal family version of the Top Trumps card game. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will marry on Saturday in Windsor Castle. Photograph: Paul EllisAFPGetty ImagesThe transatlantic soap opera surrounding Meghan Markle’s family has added a touch of drama to a royal wedding that has failed to excite most of the British public, according to a poll this week.The YouGov survey, which was commissioned by the anti-monarchist group Republic, found that two out of three respondents were “not very interested” or “not interested at all” in the ceremony, while 60 per cent planned to have a normal weekend.Prince Harry is the most popular member of the royal family, with an approval rating higher than the queen’s, but he is sixth in line to the throne, behind Prince Charles, Prince William and his three children, so his wedding is of no constitutional significance. It will have an economic impact, however, generating more than £1 billion in tourism, retail, fashion, merchandising and PR value for brands, according to accountancy firm Brand Finance.The company, which specialises in intellectual property and publishes an annual assessment of the brand value of the monarchy, found that brands associated with Markle had already gained a significant boost since her engagement was announced last year.“Meghan Markle is an accomplished actress in her own right, with a global popularity and a strong personal brand. It can be expected that, supported by her association with Brand Monarchy, she will become a powerful ambassador for British brands, especially in her native United States.“Although we are observing only the beginnings of a ‘Meghan effect’, Ms Markle will quickly match or even surpass the Duchess of Cambridge in her incredible influence on the fashion industry,” said chief executive David Haigh.Haigh estimates that the monarchy generates about £1.8 billion for the British economy each year, far outstripping the £300-350 million it costs the state. More than a quarter of a century after the queen’s “annus horribilis” of 1992, when Windsor Castle went on fire, Princess Diana’s tell-all book with Andrew Morton was published, Prince Charles and Camilla Parker-Bowles’s intimate “squidgygate” phone calls were broadcast, and Prince Andrew separated from his wife Sarah Ferguson, the monarchy enjoys solid popular support.“When you talk to people rationally about whether the monarchy makes sense – should we have a monarchy or a republic, should we allow these hereditary people to have a say in the running of the country – when people are talking with their heads, they usually say, no not really. But I think emotionally people act in a different way. They think, oh it’s very nice isn’t it, it’s a great traditional thing and aren’t they nice people, a bit like East Enders. And then the heart kicks in,” Haigh says.Harry and his brother William are more popular than their father and his siblings, especially among the under-40s but it is the queen who, at 92, remains the linchpin of the monarchy. Its supporters are already anxious about the future after she dies.Detailed plans are already in place for the days after her death, including 12 days of public mourning leading up to a state funeral.“I think it’s pretty much tied down. There are various military planning documents that spell out exactly how the funeral will take place. Clearly the BBC and other state broadcasters have preparations for what they do. Most of the plans are predicated on the idea of the queen’s health fading and the announcement of her death being made at a particular time of day, a very controlled way of doing it. That of course is blown sky high if there’s a leak on social media or something,” said one official involved in the planning.“An interesting thing will be what the mood is about how long the BBC plays solemn music, do the newspapers have black edges, when do they start covering other stories. When do normal events start coming back onto the agenda.”After 65 years on the throne, the queen’s reign has been so long that few Britons can remember any other head of state, and the official predicts that, despite her age, the response to her death will be one of deep shock.“I think it’s impossible to overestimate the impact that the queen’s death will have, particularly in the rather febrile world that we live in at the moment. There’s so much uncertainty about Brexit, about international relations, our relationship with the United States, our economy, about our future as a country and our relationship with each other. And the one constant, the one thing that holds it all together is the queen,” he says.“She’s just been so much part of everybody’s life for such a long time, she has maintained this sense of fairness, of honesty, of fair play, of an old Britain that perhaps thinks it’s slightly more important than it is. And I think with her gone, all that is blown out of the water and I think that will hit people almost immediately, that nothing will ever be the same again. I think there’ll be a great baring of souls and fear, in a sense of ‘what happens now?’”The pageantry and deference surrounding the queen, which seems unremarkable in association with her, could feel more like an anachronism under a new monarch. Charles has recovered from his lowest point in the public’s affections after Diana’s death but he remains the most unpopular of the senior royals.This is in part a legacy of his unhappy union with Diana and his subsequent marriage to Camilla, but it also owes something to his record of seeking to influence politicians and his sometimes bad-tempered campaigns in favour of complementary medicine and against modern architecture.The official involved in planning for the succession believes that Charles should make an early gesture towards reducing the scale of the monarchy, bringing it closer to those of Denmark and the Netherlands.“If they’re seen to have too many fripperies, too many luxuries, too many private planes, too many palaces, too many numbing bits of protocol, then that’s where the problems will begin. If they’re sensible, then they’ll immediately trim things back.“The complication is that a lot of it is theirs anyway, and there’s nothing very much that the state can do about it. In a sense, Charles’s Achilles’ heel is his reputation for being lavish, for taking the royal train, for chartering jets, for having six butlers when one would do and having someone to squeeze his toothpaste tube and cut the top off his egg. I think that’s what he’ll need to watch,” he says.“It’s very easy to defend the current monarch and to trot out the line about what she means to Britain’s reputation, what she means for tourism, what she means for our sense of who we are. I think it will be harder to do that for a new monarch, and I think if Charles is sensible, he’ll quite quickly make a couple of gestures, perhaps giving up a palace, perhaps saying that Buckingham Palace is going to become an art gallery to house the royal collection and maybe a state guesthouse but no longer a residence.”A poll last year found that two out of three Britons do not want Camilla to become queen but the official believes she will overcome any remaining hostility to her as they become more familiar with her.“Camilla is in a way the best thing about Charles. She’s very straightforward, she’s down to earth, she likes a joke, she’s got that great, rasping smoker’s cough, she likes a drink. She’s in a sense the person who’s made Charles much less weird,” he says.For Haigh, the biggest threat to the monarchy lies in the personal behaviour of members of the royal family. He fears that the fanfare surrounding Markle’s arrival into the royal family as an American orcee of mixed racial heritage could sound hollow if, like so many recent royal marriages, Harry’s does not endure.“All of the problems that have arisen around Prince Charles and Prince Andrew and Prince Edward and various minor royals, they all come down to their personal behaviour. Whether it’s being accused of taking money where they shouldn’t or giving favours where they shouldn’t or behaving in a bad way or having opinions which are too extreme, there are a lot of personal behavioural issues,” he says.\u0026nbsp“Now I personally think it’s extremely unlikely that Meghan Markle will put a foot wrong. I think the real danger is that for some reason or another they don’t suit each other and eventually they fall out and split.“The other real problem, which is now looming bigger and bigger every day that goes by, is her remarkably dysfunctional family. I must admit that I was really surprised that they completely excluded all her family.“I think if she had invited her family to the wedding, she’d have a better chance of controlling what they do. Instead of which, they’re all going rogue as far as I can see. It’s bonkers.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3501664.1526731076!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"prince harry and meghan markle marry at windsor castle","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                             Prince Harry and  Meghan Markle at St George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle.

Photograph: Chris JacksonAFPGetty ImagesBritain’s Prince Harry and American actress Meghan Markle were pronounced husband and wife on Saturday by the Archbishop of Canterbury in a glittering union that brought a measure of modern Hollywood glamour into the 1,000-year-old monarchy.The star of the TV drama Suits walked unescorted in a pure white, long-sleeved dress to the middle of the 15th-century St George’s Chapel in Windsor Castle, where the heir to the throne, Prince Charles, accompanied her towards his son, waiting at the altar.After exchanging vows to love and to cherish “till death us do part”, Prince Harry (33), sixth-in-line to the British throne, placed a ring of Welsh gold on Markle’s finger before a congregation including Queen Elizabeth, senior royals, and celebrities including US media mogul Oprah Winfrey.“In the presence of God, and before this congregation, Harry and Meghan have given their consent and made their marriage vows to each other,” Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby intoned.“They have declared their marriage by the joining of hands and by the giving and receiving of rings. I therefore proclaim that they are husband and wife.”The marriage brings Markle, three years older than Harry and born and raised in Los Angeles, into one of the world’s grandest royal families.While the ceremony incorporated the traditions of a monarchy that traces its history back to 1066, Markle brought a sense of modernity.She did not vow to obey her husband Harry, unlike other senior male royals, will wear a wedding ring Markle’s father was unable to attend due to reported heart surgery and a black U.S. Episcopalian bishop, Michael Bruce Curry, gave an impassioned wedding address on the “feeling-bomb” of love, quoting black US civil rights leader Martin Luther King.“When love is the way, we actually treat each other like we are actually family,” he said.Tens of thousands of fans lined the route Markle took towards the castle, waving British flags and cheering as her Rolls-Royce limousine drove past.Air traffic controllers for the nearby Heathrow Airport, one of the world’s busiest, closed the airspace over Windsor for the 15 minutes before the ceremony.Hours before, Queen Elizabeth had bestowed the title of Duke of Sussex on her grandson, a step that meant Markle became a duchess when she married Harry.Sunshine and bearskinsUnder clear skies and glorious sunshine, a military band in scarlet uniforms and bearskin hats entertained excited fans gathered behind barriers. Police armed with semi-automatic rifles patrolling streets and watching from rooftops.Among celebrity guests, American actor George Clooney and his wife Amal were joined by former soccer star David Beckham, his fashion designer wife Victoria and James Corden, British host of the American TV chat show The Late Late Show.Other guests included tennis ace Serena Williams, the siblings of Harry’s late mother Princess Diana, singer Elton John, who sang at Diana’s 1997 funeral, British actor Idris Elba, and two of Harry’s ex-girlfriends.The chapel was adorned with white roses, Diana’s favourite flowers.“This is a moment when we can all celebrate the rebirth of the royal family,” said Kenny McKinlay, 60, who had come down from Scotland for the wedding. “It’s a time when all the nation can come together rather than being ided. It’s a day when you can be proud to be British.”The royal couple, who met on a blind date in 2016 and fell in love in a tent under the stars in Botswana, tied the knot in a castle that has been home to 39 English monarchs since 1066.Tens of thousands of fans crammed the narrow roads of Windsor, about 30 km west of London. Visitors had to pass through police search points set up around the castle.Father not presentMarkle’s own father Thomas Markle (73), a former lighting director for TV soaps and sitcoms, pulled out of the ceremony this week, telling the US celebrity website TMZ he had had heart surgery on Wednesday.Confusion over his attendance marred the build-up to the wedding, which had been choreographed for months by royal aides, and his name still appears in the order of service.The service was conducted by the Dean of Windsor with Justin Welby, Archbishop of Canterbury and spiritual head of the Anglican Church, overseeing the exchange of vows.A black US Episcopalian bishop, Michael Bruce Curry, gave the wedding address, while Lady Jane Fellowes, Diana’s sister, delivered the reading.Prime minister Theresa May, who along with other politicians was not invited to the wedding, sent good wishes to the couple, adding: “To all of those joining the national celebration with street parties and other events, have a wonderful day.”In among traditional hymns, a choir performed American soul singer Ben E. King’s 1960s hit Stand by me.After the ceremony, the newlyweds are expected to greet some of the 1,200 members of the public invited into the castle grounds before starting a carriage procession through Windsor.A reception will be held in the castle’s St George’s Hall before 200 guests join the couple at an evening event at the nearby Frogmore House mansion.The couple will carry out their first official engagement as husband and wife next week. -

He hails from Nottingham and comes from an astonishingly gifted family. He won BBC Young Musician of the Year in 2016.View of \u0027s classical music critic Ivan Hewett: Von Paradis was a notable 18th century Viennese pianist and composer. Mozart probably wrote his Piano Concerto no 18 for her. She became blind at an early age but that didn’t stop her musical career. This piece probably isn’t by her – it was probably by the 20 th century violinist Samuel Dushkin. This song has been endlessly re-arranged. It’s the single most popular song by this late 19th – early 20th century composer. It sounds like a piece of Latin church music, but in fact it’s one a set of songs Schubert composed in 1825, all based on poems in Sir Walter Scott’s epic ‘The Lady of the Lake’. This one is based on a prayer uttered by Ellen in front of the Virgin Mary, asking for forgiveness for her father’s sins. All stand for the next hymn: Guide me, O thou great RedeemerView of \u0027s classical music critic Ivan Hewett: Notable not only for striking a Welsh note (appropriate for the wedding of the son of the Prince of Wales) but for its family resonances. It was sung at both Kate and William\u0027s wedding and Diana\u0027s funeral and so its inclusion may well be among the ceremony’s most poignant notes.Prayers are now being led by Archbishop Angaelos and The Reverend Prebendary Rose Hudson-Wilkin from the Nave. The Archbishop says: In the presence of God, and before this congregation, Harry and Meghan  have given their consent and made their marriage vows to each other. They have declared their marriage by the joining of hands and by the giving and receiving of rings. I therefore proclaim that they are husband and wife.The Archbishop joins their right hands together and says: Those whom God has joined together let no-one put asunder.The couple are now officially married!Prince Harry and Meghan Markle hold hands as they are declared married The Duke of Cambridge, in his role as best man, stepped forward to hand over the rings.Prince Harry now places the wedding ring on the fourth finger of Ms Markle\u0027s left hand and, holding it there, says: I give you this ring as a sign of our marriage.

In the presence of God I make this vow.Prince Harry and Meghan Markle before they say their vowsAfter that effusive sermon, next up Karen Gibson and The Kingdom Choir are singing Stand By Me, Ben E King’s 1960 pop song.View of \u0027s classical music critic Ivan Hewett: It’s not a sacred piece, but the words have the just the right sentiment. It’s all about standing by your loved one in testing times, and it was inspired by the spiritual “Stand by me Father” – which itself refers to Psalm 46. The Performers are Kingdom Choir – 20 singers based in South-East London directed by Karen Gibson. The website says “They are a unique group of dedicated men and women, who blend Choral discipline with the raw Gospel spiritual sound – drawn from an inner experience.Cutest pictures of Prince George, Princess Charlotte and more young royals at the weddingThe Most Rev Bishop Michael Curry, the first African-American presiding bishop and primate of the Episcopal Church, gave an address titled the Power of Love at the service in St George\u0027s Chapel.He opened his speech with the words of Civil Rights leader Martin Luther King Jr, who said: We must discover the power of love, the redemptive power of love. And when we do that, we will be able to make of this old world a new world. Love is the only way.The bishop then added: There\u0027s power in love. Don\u0027t underestimate it. Don\u0027t even over-sentimentalise. There is power, power in love.Bishop Curry told the service: There\u0027s power in love. Love can help and heal when nothing else can. There\u0027s power in love to lift up and liberate when nothing else will.Such power could be seen in the service, he continued, saying: Two young people fell in love and we all showed up.The Episcopal Church is the US offshoot of the Church of England and forms part of the broader Anglican Communion. Meghan was baptised into the Anglican Church, which is headed by Harry\u0027s grandmother.All remain seated while the choir of St George\u0027s Chapel sing If Ye Love Me, by Thomas Tallis.View of \u0027s classical music critic Ivan Hewett: Beautifully simple – which it had to be, because Tallis’s ultimate boss – Archbishop Cranmer, one of the architects of the English Reformation – said the old Latin church music had got too complicated and the words could no longer be heard, and composers now had to write simpler, audible pieces in English – without being plain and dull. Tallis pulls it off brilliantly.Next is a reading from the Song of Solomon read by The Lady Jane Fellowes (Princess Diana\u0027s sister) from the Nave. Here, Tristram Saunders examines the significance of the reading.The ceremony is being played through loudspeakers hanging on the side of  Windsor Castle, so the crowds gathered on the streets outside can hear but not  see proceedings. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are holding hands as the wedding ceremony begins.Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in St George\u0026#39s ChapelAt the High Altar, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, is now beginning the declarations. The Archbishop says to the bridegroom: Harry, will you take Meghan to be your wife?

A folkyantique theme dominates in this sequence of pieces.Elgar’s first published piece. Originally written in 1888 as a gift for his future wife Carice. He sold the rights to the publisher for two guineas, which was a really bad move. It became massively popular and could have earned him a fortune.Holst taught at St Paul’s School for Girls and composed this in 1912 for the school orchestra. This movement based on 16 th century English balladParry, a leading light of the so-called ‘English Renaissance’ who was the first director of the Royal College of Music in 1883. He wrote his Lady Radnor’s suite in 1894 for the all-women orchestra conducted by Helen, Countess of Radnor. It’s a kind of Baroque Suite in Victorian dress.Set of dances based on a book of Renaissance dances composed by Peter Warlock (gifted composer who died in 1930 aged 36).Vaughan Williams was a collector of folk-song, and wrote many pieces based on the songs he found. This one is especially beloved, it’s always in Classic FM’s Hall of Fame. More famous and well-known than the tune it’s based on.Elgar’s first really successful work, completed in 1893. It remained one of his favourite works right to the end of his life. He liked it because it was ‘really stringy’ – weird phrase but a musician knows What he means – it completely suits a string orchestra, you couldn’t arrange it for something else.In his early days, Elgar was always complaining about having no money, and wrote this delicious piece in 1899 as a deliberate money-spinner for his publisher Novello. It worked.Meghan Markle and her mother, Doria, on their way to WindsorMeghan waves to photographers as she leaves her hotelHarry looked relaxed as he walked down to the chapel with his brother, the Duke of Cambridge, to loud cheers from the waiting crowd.The pair smiled and waved to well-wishers during the short walk.Prince Harry and the Duke of CambridgeCheers and applause erupted at the West Door as the pair arrived. The bridegroom and his best man were met by the Dean of Windsor.They stopped for a few moments and had a brief conversation, before walking inside.

Meghan\u0027s father - failed to show up for the big day. Ms Ragland was thrust even further into the limelight as her former husband recoiled under a cloud of controversy and reports of ill health, after it emerged he had allegedly posed for paparazzi photographs.He was due to walk his daughter down the aisle, but in a break from UK tradition, it was Ms Ragland who arrived at the wedding venue with the bride-to-be.They arrived having travelled the short distance from the Cliveden House Hotel - whose website describes how the hotel has hosted powerful personalities, debaucherous parties and scandalous affairs for more than 350 years.It was built in 1666 by the 2nd Duke of Buckingham as a gift to his mistress.The privately owned Grade 1 listed stately home is surrounded by 376 acres of National Trust groundsThe accommodation decision is a break with UK tradition, which usually sees the bride travel with her father before he gives her away in the wedding ceremony.Doria Ragland and Meghan Markle Instead, Ms Markle wanted to include both parents in her wedding day. Prince Harry\u0027s press secretary Jason Knauf said: “Both of the bride\u0027s parents will have important roles in the wedding.“On the morning of the wedding, Ms Ragland will travel with Ms Markle by car to Windsor Castle.

But where will they go?Namibia has pulled ahead as the odds-on favourite. The southern African nation is best known among travellers for the enormous Sossusvlei sand dunes of the the Namib Desert, but reports suggest that the couple are looking instead at a safari trip to Hoanib Valley Camp in the country\u0027s north west.Botswana, where they holidayed in the early days of their whirlwind relationship, is also a good bet, (Ms Markle\u0027s engagement ring features diamonds from Diana\u0027s personal collection, and a stone from Botswana), but wherever they go, the newlyweds will be looking for seclusion away from the limelight as they start their married life together.Other possible destinations could include Tuscany, Hawaii, Turkey and the Philippines.Read more about the honeymoon options here.Royal Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan MarkleRoyal wedding live: Prince Harry and Meghan Markle marry -

St John tells us how Jesus shared in such an occasion at Cana, and gave there a sign of new beginnings as he turned water into wine.Marriage is intended by God to be a creative relationship, as his blessing enables husband and wife to love and support each other in good times and in bad, and to share in the care and upbringing of children. For Christians, marriage is also an invitation to share life together in the spirit of Jesus Christ.It is based upon a solemn, public and life-long covenant between a man and a woman, declared and celebrated in the presence of God and before witnesses.On this their wedding day the bride and bridegroom face each other, make their promises and receive God\u0027s blessing. You are witnesses of the marriage, and express your support by your presence and your prayers. Your support does not end today: the couple will value continued encouragement in the days and years ahead of them.Prince Harry and Meghan Markle: The story of their relationship, in picturesSet in the Lower Ward of Windsor Castle, St George\u0027s Chapel is a building of rare beauty, begun in 1475 by King Edward IV.The Chapel, built in the striking English Perpendicular Gothic style of the period, was intended both to be a new and fitting home for the College of St George and the Order of the Garter (founded over a century previously in 1348), and to be a Royal Chapel in which the Sovereign and the Royal Family might worship God and to which they might come on various occasions-some solemn, and many, like today\u0027s wedding or the Garter Service next month, celebratory-to receive God\u0027s blessing and to hear prayer offered in God\u0027s presence.The Opus Dei, or daily round of prayer, is offered by the members of the College who live in the precincts of the Chapel and whose duty it is to pray morning and evening for the Sovereign and the Companions of the Order of the Garter.There are twenty-three services each week, all of which are open to members of the public.Perhaps the Chapel\u0027s most striking feature is the vaulted stone roof of very wide , held up only by the light and graceful walls and the external flying buttresses.Most of the coloured bosses on the roof of the Chapel bear the badges and arms of King Henry VII and those of his servants who helped to build part of the Chapel, finished in 1528.The boss in the roof over the Organ Screen bears the arms of King Henry VIII, who is buried in a vault beneath the Quire of the Chapel.The great coloured glass West Window is one of the finest in England and is said to be the third largest in the country in seventy-five lights, the vast majority of which date from between 1503 and 1509, it depicts a host of warrior saints, archbishops and kings and, in the bottom right hand corner, with hammer in hand the likeness of William Vertue the mason and architect responsible for the building of the Nave and Quire Vault.Those seated in the Quire of the Chapel are able to see one of the Chapel\u0027s greatest treasures, the carved oak stalls dating from between 1478 and 1485.Each stall is a work of art and a triumph of craftsmanship, each unique in its detail.Above each of the Companions\u0027 stalls hangs his or her banner and on the canopy of a Knight\u0027s stall is his helmet and crest and sword of knighthood, symbolically half-drawn from its scabbard to show his readiness to take up arms in defence of the Sovereign and the realm.The Lady Companions do not bear arms. On the back of the stalls are nearly 800 plates which commemorate Knights of the Garter past and present.On the High Altar is a jewelled Cross, given by Queen Victoria, and two silver gilt candlesticks dating from the reign of King Charles II. Also displayed are three gilt dishes of very great size, elaborately embossed one was intended to have been the gift of Mary of Orange, sister of King Charles II, while the other two smaller dishes are the gift of Anne Hyde, Duchess of York, wife of the future King James II.Looking down on the Quire from above is the wooden oriel window installed in the Chantry Chapel of King Edward IV by King Henry VIII so that his Queen, Katherine of Aragon, might watch the ceremonies of the Installation of Knights of the Garter in the Quire below.The window bears the arms of Henry and Katherine and the intertwined Tudor Rose of England and the Pomegranate of Aragon.It has frequently been used as a Royal Pew or watching chamber and it was from this vantage point that Queen Victoria watched the wedding in the Chapel below of her son, the Prince of Wales, to Princess Alexandra of Denmark on 10 March 1863. It was at this same wedding that the fine East Window, created by Messrs Clayton and Bell in commemoration of the late Prince Albert, was first seen.God of love,send your blessing upon Harry and Meghan,and all who are joined in marriage,that, rejoicing in your willand continuing under your protection,they may both live and growin your love all their days,through Jesus Christ our Lord.The service is led by The Right Reverend David Conner KCVO, Dean of Windsor.The marriage is solemnised by The Most Reverend and Right Honourable Justin Welby, Archbishop of Canterbury.The service is sung by the choir of St George\u0027s Chapel, conducted by Mr James Vivian, Director of Music, St George\u0027s Chapel.

It enriches society and strengthens community.No one should enter into it lightly or selfishly but reverently and responsibly in the sight of almighty God.HARRY and MEGHAN are now to enter this way of life. They will each give their consent to the other and make solemn vows, and in token of this they will each give and receive a ring.We pray with them that the Holy Spirit will guide and strengthen them, that they may fulfil God\u0027s purposes for the whole of their earthly life together.Lord of all hopefulness, Lord of all joy,no cares could destroy,Be there at our waking, and give us, we pray,Your bliss in our hearts, Lord,at the break of the day.Lord of all eagerness, Lord of all faith,were skilled at the plane and the lathe,Be there at our labours, and give us, we pray,Your strength in our hearts, Lord,at the noon of the day.Lord of all kindliness, Lord of all grace,Your hands swift to welcome,your arms to embrace,Be there at our homing, and give us, we pray,Your love in our hearts, Lord,at the eve of the day.All remain standing as the Archbishop leads the declarationsFirst, I am required to ask anyone present who knows a reason why these persons may not lawfully marry, to declare it now.The Archbishop says to the CoupleThe vows you are about to take are to be made in the presence of God, who is judge of all and knows all the secrets of our hearts therefore if either of you knows a reason why you may not lawfully marry, you must declare it now.The Archbishop says to the BridegroomHarry, will you take MEGHAN to be your wife? Will you love her, comfort her, honour and protect her, and, forsaking all others, be faithful to her as long as you both shall live?The Archbishop says to the BrideMEGHAN, will you take HARRY to be your husband? Will you love him, comfort him, honour and protect him, and, forsaking all others, be faithful to him as long as you both shall live?The Archbishop says to the congregationWill you, the families and friends of HARRY and MEGHAN, support and uphold them in their marriage now and in the years to come?The Archbishop invites the people to pray, silence is kept and he saysGod our Father, from the beginningyou have blessed creation with abundant life.Pour out your blessings upon HARRY and MEGHAN,that they may be joined in mutual love and companionship,in holiness and commitment to each other.We ask this through our Lord Jesus Christ your Son,who is alive and reigns with you,in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever.The Royal Wedding in numbersFrom the Song of Solomon, read by The Lady Jane Fellowes from the Nave:My beloved speaks and says to me: \u0027Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away for now the winter is past, the rain is over and gone. The flowers appear on the earth the time of singing has come, and the voice of the turtle-dove is heard in our land.The fig tree puts forth its figs, and the vines are in blossom they give forth fragrance.Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away.\u0027Set me as a seal upon your heart,as a seal upon your arm for love is strong as death, passion fierce as the grave.Its flashes are flashes of fire, a raging flame. Many waters cannot quench love, neither can floods drown it.If one offered for love all the wealth of one\u0027s house, it would be utterly scorned.All remain seated while the Choir of St George\u0027s Chapel sing the motetkeep my commandments,and I will pray the Father,and he shall give you another comforter,that he may \u0027bide with you forever,e\u0027en the spirit of truth.The address by The Most Reverend Michael Curry.Karen Gibson and The Kingdom Choir will sing \u0027Stand by me\u0027 from the West End of The Chapel.WHEN the night has come,And the land is dark,And the moon is the only light we see.No, I won\u0027t be afraid.Oh, I won\u0027t be afraid,Just as long as you stand, stand by me.So darling, darling, stand by me,Oh, stand by me.Oh stand, stand by me. Stand by me.If the sky that we look upon,Should tumble and fall,Or the mountain should crumble to the sea.I won\u0027t cry, I won\u0027t cry.No, I won\u0027t shed a tear.Just as long as you stand, stand by me,Darling, darling, stand by me...Whenever you\u0027re in trouble,Won\u0027t you stand by me, oh stand by me.Oh stand, stand by me.

He hails from Nottingham and comes from an astonishingly gifted family. He won BBC Young Musician of the Year in 2016.View of \u0027s classical music critic Ivan Hewett: Von Paradis was a notable 18th century Viennese pianist and composer. Mozart probably wrote his Piano Concerto no 18 for her. She became blind at an early age but that didn’t stop her musical career. This piece probably isn’t by her – it was probably by the 20 th century violinist Samuel Dushkin. This song has been endlessly re-arranged. It’s the single most popular song by this late 19th – early 20th century composer. It sounds like a piece of Latin church music, but in fact it’s one a set of songs Schubert composed in 1825, all based on poems in Sir Walter Scott’s epic ‘The Lady of the Lake’. This one is based on a prayer uttered by Ellen in front of the Virgin Mary, asking for forgiveness for her father’s sins. All stand for the next hymn: Guide me, O thou great RedeemerView of \u0027s classical music critic Ivan Hewett: Notable not only for striking a Welsh note (appropriate for the wedding of the son of the Prince of Wales) but for its family resonances. It was sung at both Kate and William\u0027s wedding and Diana\u0027s funeral and so its inclusion may well be among the ceremony’s most poignant notes.Prayers are now being led by Archbishop Angaelos and The Reverend Prebendary Rose Hudson-Wilkin from the Nave. The Archbishop says: In the presence of God, and before this congregation, Harry and Meghan  have given their consent and made their marriage vows to each other. They have declared their marriage by the joining of hands and by the giving and receiving of rings.

It’s all about standing by your loved one in testing times, and it was inspired by the spiritual “Stand by me Father” – which itself refers to Psalm 46. The Performers are Kingdom Choir – 20 singers based in South-East London directed by Karen Gibson. The website says “They are a unique group of dedicated men and women, who blend Choral discipline with the raw Gospel spiritual sound – drawn from an inner experience.Cutest pictures of Prince George, Princess Charlotte and more young royals at the weddingThe Most Rev Bishop Michael Curry, the first African-American presiding bishop and primate of the Episcopal Church, gave an address titled the Power of Love at the service in St George\u0027s Chapel.He opened his speech with the words of Civil Rights leader Martin Luther King Jr, who said: We must discover the power of love, the redemptive power of love.

and it seems they will waste no time getting started.The newlyweds\u0027 royal wedding schedule sees them undertake a tour of Windsor immediately after their nuptials.Here\u0027s everything you need to know about how to watch it and where to stand in Windsor.Royal wedding day pictures: Best photos from Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#039s ceremony and receptionPrince Harry and Meghan Markle will undertake a carriage ride through Windsor straight after the St George’s Chapel ceremony and before their reception. The journey is designed to allow members of the public to see the newlyweds in person while they are still dressed in their finery, in what is likely to be one of the most photographed occasions of the year.Such a display of ceremonial prowess has been used by kings and queens for centuries to celebrate as much as it has been used to impress their subjects and foreign powers. Be that with gun salutes, marching guards, or golden carriages. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge during their wedding carriage procession in 2011There is no doubt that this royal wedding will pack a punch, just like Queen Victoria\u0027s marriage to Albert which featured a 21-gun salute as she embarked on her carriage procession at St Jame\u0027s Palace.  But it was not until King George VI\u0027s marriage to Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon in 1923 that royal weddings became public affairs they were married to great fanfare in order to lift the spirits of the nation after World War One (and royal weddings have been lavish events ever since).At 1pm, immediately after the service, Prince Harry and Ms Markle will leave Windsor Castle by carriage. They will be driven along Castle Hill, the High Street and into Windsor town centre before returning along the beautiful, tree-lined Long Walk for their reception. The whole procession is expected to take just 25 minutes.Meanwhile, guests from the congregation will wait for the happy couple in St George\u0027s Hall, to celebrate the first of the day\u0027s two receptions.To see the newlyweds up close, the best positions will be on the 2.64 mile stretch that rolls from Snow Hill to the gates of Windsor Castle. This is known as the Long Walk. The length of this section will allow thousands of spectators to catch a glimpse of Harry and Meghan in the final minutes of the procession.  There will be events on the Long Walk  throughout the day, with live screens showing footage from the ceremony.  The most stylish guests from Prince Harry\u0026#039s wedding to Meghan MarkleOn the hilltop above the procession route, the eagle-eyed can find a sweeping aerial view of the carriage ride. Snow Hill will offer fantastic views of the final moments and will be a popular picnic spot on the day, so get there early to reserve a spot.According to legend, King Henry VIII sat on Snow Hill to wait for news of the execution of his second wife, Queen Anne Boleyn. A precedent that has fortunately not been followed since. Prince Edward and his bride Sophie Rhys-Jones pass the crowd inside the grounds of Windsor Castle in an open carriage in 1999Royal fans can also mingle with the residents of Windsor as the carriage passes through the streets of the town centre. Although you should probably arrive at the crack of dawn if you\u0027re after a front-row High Street viewing spot - it\u0027s bound to get busy.With Windsor dressed in bunting and ceremonial decorations – and bursting with local street entertainment – the town will provide a feast for the eyes. Expect big screens showing live footage of the wedding plus an array of food stalls and general facilities will be available at both the Long Walk and Alexandra Gardens.Spectators can also line the entirety of the procession route, on Castle Hill, High Street, Sheet Street, Kings Road, Albert Road and the Long Walk. Disabled viewing spots will be available at the junctions of Victoria Street and Albert Road. The council has advised that visitors should not bring tents, but foldable chairs and umbrellas are fine. Also look out for the weather forecast on the day, and prepare for large crowds with plenty of food supplies, water, and sun cream. Further information will be published on the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead Council website. Of the three parking options on offer, most motorists should make use of the 6,000 designated parking spaces available at the Review Ground, Windsor Great Park, which is located to the south of Windsor Castle and the town centre.  Parking tickets must be booked in advance for a price of £30. These are being allocated on a first-come, first-serve basis. With wedding invitations being sent to more than 2,000 members of the public and many more expected to watch the ceremony on the town\u0027s live screens, it\u0027s a good idea get these sooner rather than later.This car park opens at 4am and closes at 10pm. Though it is next to the Long Walk, motorists will have to take a 25 minute stroll to the nearest spectator spots.  The second parking option is provided by Windsor Racecourse\u0027s \u0027Park and Float\u0027 service, which must also be booked in advance. There are 3,000 spots available for £30, as well as weekend parking packages, and the opportunity to journey into the heart of Windsor on a return boat trip for £10. The third car park can be found at The Windsor Boy\u0027s School, where motorists can park on a first-come-first basis on the day without pre-booking. This is expected to fill-up early in the morning. To accommodate the large number of attendees at Windsor\u0027s public events over the weekend, there will also be a series of road closures, beginning with a 9am - 2pm closure of the procession route on Thursday May 17. Then, from 10pm on Friday May 18 and until late on Saturday May 19, road closures will affect the procession route and surrounding roads. During this time Windsor residents will be able to leave the road closure area, but only emergency services vehicles can enter.Access to the car park on the Long Walk will not be affected by the road closures in place, at any time. Road closures beyond the procession route will take effect from 6am on Saturday May 19 these include Maidenhead Road, Clarence Road, Alma Road, St Leonards Road, Frances Road, Barry Avenue, and Datchet Road. Local authorities suggest that you check this live map of road closures to check what time the roads reopen from Saturday evening onwards. Rail operators will be running a bumper service on the wedding to help everyone get in and out of the celebrations at Windsor, which is expected to be one of the largest one-day events ever held on the local rail network.  Both Great Western and South Western will be increasing train frequency and capacity, with trains running up to four times an hour from London Waterloo and Slough. These services will also benefit from extra carriages to keep up with the expected demand, given that some of the 100,000 expected visitors will arrive by public transport. Windsor is served by two train stations that are within minutes of the town centre and Windsor Castle, making the railway a reliable option for getting to the Royal wedding celebrations: Windsor and Eton Central and Windsor and Eton Riverside.Queuing systems are likely to be in place at London Waterloo, Slough, Staines, and Windsor, while park and walk and park and glide bus services will help people get into town.Great Western Railway services connect Windsor and Eton station to South Wales and the West of England, as well as Reading and Oxford, via Slough. This branch-line service will be running with four carriages running every 20 minutes, from the very early hours of the morning to late on Saturday night. The journey from Reading or Oxford takes around 30 - 50 minutes and 50 - 75 minutes respectively, with a change required at Slough. Cardiff and Swansea are around two and a half hours away from Windsor, requiring changes at Reading and then Slough. London is connected to Windsor via the direct Waterloo to Windsor and Eton Riverside service, which takes one hour. Travellers have been advised not to take the London Paddington - Slough route, in order to ease rail congestion around Windsor. From the Midlands, take a Cross Country service from Birmingham New Street to Reading, and then change at Slough for the Eton Riverside station. This takes around two and a half hours.Train services from the North require changes at London terminals. Almost five hours of train travel await any royal super-fans making their way from Newcastle.  Because it is such a huge event, it is wise to make travel plans ahead of time – so make ticket bookings and travel arrangements well before the big day. Up to date advice on the best routes and how to pre-book your tickets, can be found at: for Great Western Railway here and South Western Railway here.Royal wedding: the best hotels for celebrating Prince Harry\u0027s and Meghan Markle\u0027s big dayThere will be a designated pick up and drop off point on the wedding day at King Edward VII Hospital, St Leonards Road. This will be the termination point for buses towards Windsor, as well as local routes. A full timetable of buses is available at the Royal Borough website, and more information on transport and bus alterations can be found here. Hotels, B\u0026ampBs and guesthouses will be bursting at the seams, so expect no empty hotel rooms in town for the duration of the wedding weekend. Royal fans had only a few hours to book the local accommodation offerings before rooms ran out after the announcement that Windsor would play host for the big day.Many residents and visitors will no doubt find a solution via room sharing service AirBnb, with the average price of a room around Windsor currently standing at £321 for Friday night and £286 for the Saturday night. Such prices look like a bargain, with some of the most expensive hotel rooms in Windsor going for up to £10,000. Alternative locations with more \u0027last-minute\u0027 availability include Heathrow, Bracknell and Weybridge. The council also suggests that anyone wanting help to find accommodation can contact the Royal Windsor Information Centre on 01753 743907 or by emailing: windsor.accommodation@rbwm. gov.uk.The monarchy has embarked on grand processions from coronations, marriages, funerals and other state occasions since the 15th century. Each year, a carriage procession carries the Queen to the State Opening of Parliament and the races at Ascot, although royal weddings and coronations are arguably the grandest occasions.   The last royal couple to undertake a carriage procession in Windsor was Prince Edward and Sophie Rhys-Jones – now the Earl and Countess of Wessex – after their wedding in St George\u0027s Chapel in 1999.Prince Edward and Sophie Rhys-Jones pictured in their carriage after their wedding in 1999It was the biggest occasion in the Berkshire town since since the funeral of King George VI in 1952.More recently, the newly-wed Duke and Duchess of Cambridge travelled through Westminster in a 1902 State Landau after their 2011 wedding, waving at thousands of well-wishers who had packed the streets to catch a glimpse of the happy couple. It\u0027s possible Harry and Meghan could use the same carriage. Steeped in history, the carriage was specifically built for King Edward VII in 1902 and is usually used by the Queen to meet foreign heads of state when they arrive on state visits to Britain.The Prince and Princess of Wales used it to travel back from St Paul’s Cathedral after their 1981 royal wedding, as did the Duke and Duchess of York in 1986. It was also used by the Queen during her Silver Wedding anniversary celebrations in 1972 and in her Silver and Diamond Jubilees in 1977 and 2012.Royal Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan MarklePrince Harry and Meghan MarkleRoyal wedding live: Prince Harry and Meghan Markle become husband and wife - latest newsMeghan Markle\u0026#39s wedding dress: Givenchy\u0026#39s Clare Waight Keller designs the bridal gown of the yearRoyal wedding bridesmaids and pageboys: From Princess Charlotte to the Mulroneys, meet the real stars of the big day Royal wedding guest list: Amal and George Clooney, the Beckhams and Oprah among the celebritiesRoyal wedding live: Prince Harry and Meghan Markle marry - follow procession and latest newsWatch video highlights of Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s royal weddingDuke and Duchess of Sussex: Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s new titles explainedNottingham Cottage: The Kensington home where Meghan and Harry will livePrince George and Princess Charlotte arrive at the Royal weddingBritish-based academic and FBI informant \u0026#39approached Trump campaign advisers about Russia ties before election\u0026#39Hitler definitely died in 1945, according to new study of his teethRoyal wedding bridesmaids and pageboys: From Princess Charlotte to the Mulroneys, meet the real stars of the big day Who is Michael Curry, the ‘stunning preacher’ who stole the show at the royal wedding ceremony?Michael Curry tells guests \u0026#39Love has the power to heal the world\u0026#39, as he quotes Martin Luther KingPrince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s wedding: All the key moments from the ceremony and reception to the celebrationsRoyal family tree: How Meghan Markle will fit into the line of succession to the British throneMeghan Markle\u0026#39s mother Doria Ragland wells up inside St George\u0026#39s Chapel during royal weddingWhere are the Markle family watching the royal wedding?Royal wedding: Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s order of service - follow alongRoyal wedding guest list: Amal and George Clooney, the Beckhams and Oprah among the celebritiesMeet Meghan Markle\u0026#39s family: The diplomat uncle, the yoga teacher mother and the cannabis-growing nephewWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/readmore_card/public/thumbnails/image/2017/04/04/13/netflix.jpg","title":"royal wedding christmas prince netflix sequel meghan markle harry release date","story":"\u0027Must not become a meme\u0027A minor obsession of many a faithful Netflix streamer is getting a sequel. The service tweeted on Friday the perfectly timed revelation that A Christmas Prince would be getting a follow-up, on the eve of the wedding between Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. The teaser for A Christmas Prince: The Royal Wedding shows Amber Moore (Rose McIver) and Prince Richard (Ben Lamb) both watching the royal celebrations.Netflix responds to criticism over \u0027creepy\u0027 A Christmas Prince tweetA clip which also poked fun at the first film\u0027s internet reaction - in short, the many jokes - with Amber\u0027s notes on her own wedding reading: Must not become a meme.  The first film followed Amber, a young journalist, who\u0027s sent to the fictional town of Aldovia to get the scoop on a local playboy prince poised to become king - a plot perfectly summed up by the tagline: “Royalty.

That’s the claim being made by a team of 33 researchers published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal.They are not referring to aliens in a metaphorical sense, but literal aliens from outer space.Since the paper was released on Sunday, a trickle of news coverage has turned into a torrent, with increasingly alarming headlines about octopuses and their extra-terrestrial origins. Octopus discovered making armour out of shells on Blue Planet IIIt will not come as a surprise to many to learn that these claims have been roundly mocked by the scientific community, who have branded the paper – published in Progress in Biophysics and Molecular Biology – as ridiculous and unscientific.What are the claims being made?They suggest the Cambrian explosion, a sudden burst of life that occurred around 540 million years ago, was the result of extra-terrestrial intervention.\u0026nbspThe paper asks whether this event, which saw the rapid emergence of most of the main animal groups that still exist on Earth today, was “terrestrial or cosmic”. Their conclusion is the latter.How do the scientists suggest this would work?Specifically, the researchers propose the idea that alien viruses crashed to Earth in a meteor, infected a population of primitive squid and caused them to evolve into octopuses.\u0026nbspAnother theory they suggest is that fertilised squid or octopus eggs were delivered to Earth by a meteor.Are octopuses aliens from outer space? This peer-reviewed article by 33 scientists argues that the octopus genome is too complex to have evolved naturally on earth and therefore that octopuses probably came...from space\u0026nbsphttps:t.coR7qE77AGrJ\u0026nbsppic.twittervgDC5vgDz6The idea is essentially a\u0026nbspreimagining\u0026nbspof the “panspermia” hypothesis, which suggests that life on Earth was “seeded” by space dust or asteroids crashing into Earth. One of its first proponents,\u0026nbspChandra\u0026nbspWickramasinghe, is one of the authors of the new paper.Why do the researchers look at the octopus in particular?Octopuses are weird. They are molluscs, meaning they are closely related to snails, and yet they are incredibly intelligent.\u0026nbspOn top of their large brains and sophisticated nervous systems, the authors of the new paper list camera-like eyes, flexible bodies and ability to camouflage themselves by changing colour and shape as evidence of their extra-terrestrial origins.So suddenly did these features appear in the octopus family tree that “it is plausible then to suggest they seem to be borrowed from a far distant ‘future’ in terms of terrestrial evolution, or more realistically from the cosmos at large,” the authors write.\u0026nbsp“Such an extraterrestrial origin as an explanation of emergence of course runs counter to the prevailing dominant paradigm,” they continue. This is a strong contender for understatement of the century.What reason is there to doubt the claims being made in the paper?There are plenty of reasons. First off, as Mark\u0026nbspCarnall\u0026nbspfrom the Oxford University Museum of Natural History pointed out in a series of tweets, not one of the paper’s authors is a zoologist.\u0026nbspMuch of the authors’ speculation rests on the idea that the genetics of octopuses and their relatives are mysterious – yet a\u0026nbsp2015 paper published in\u0026nbspNature\u0026nbsprevealed the octopus genome, so this is rather disingenuous.In fact, octopus genes suggest they fit into the generally understood theory of the evolution of life on Earth, and require no alien invasion. They are thought to have split from the squid lineage around 135 million years ago.Molecular geneticist Professor\u0026nbspKarin\u0026nbspMoelling\u0026nbspof the Max Planck Institute Molecular Genetics, who was asked to review the report, concluded that it cannot be taken seriously”.The primary reason for doubt given by Professor\u0026nbspMoelling\u0026nbspis that there is “no evidence at all”.Haven’t I heard something about octopuses being aliens before?Writers are fond of comparing octopuses to aliens due to their unusual appearance and great intelligence. Philosopher Peter Godfrey-Smith, who has written a book about octopus intelligence titled\u0026nbspOther Minds, has described them as “the closest we will come to meeting an intelligent alien”.On top of that, this is not the first time octopuses have been mistakenly labelled aliens by the press.\u0026nbspAn unfortunately worded press release concerning the\u0026nbspNature\u0026nbsppaper describing the octopus genome led to a slew of online news pieces in 2015 about researchers finding “alien DNA” in these creatures.Code of ConductInstall our AppsWe use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

There are also 181 peers sitting as crossbenchers.Lords defeats government to back EU eco-standards after BrexitCorbyn ‘must take chance to keep UK in single market’ after May defeatPeers inflict major defeat on government over single marketLord speaker confirms Trump could speak in parliament despite banLords plan to let Trump address Parliament in defiance of Bercow’s banMs May shelved plans earlier this year to slash the number of peers, after a cross-party report recommended cutting the numbers in the Lords from nearly 800 to 600 in a decade.The Lord Speaker’s Committee recommended limiting any peer’s term to 15 years and adopting a new “two-out, one in” system to accelerate a reduction in size.   However Ms May retreated from the more radical plans, which she said needed “careful thought” and instead pledged to show “restraint” in her appointments.Meanwhile, Ms Osamor’s elevation was described as a “two-fingered salute” to the Jewish community, after the campaigner signed a letter protesting against the suspensions of party members over antisemitism.Gideon Falter, chairman of the Campaign Against Antisemitism, said: “Mr Corbyn has promised action, not just words, against antisemitism in the Labour Party.“Today his actions speak louder than ever. By elevating Ms Osamor to the peerage, Mr Corbyn has sent an unmistakable signal to those in the Jewish community who still harboured some hope that he might change.”I’m a millennial and I’m sick of how entitled my peers areMs Osamor said in a statement that she was “implacably opposed to antisemitism” and had spent her life campaigning against racism and discrimination.Liberal Democrat leader in the Lords, Dick Newby, said the move was a “desperate bid” by Ms May to reduce opposition to her flagship Brexit legislation in the upper chamber.“The fact that she is doing this on the Friday evening before the royal wedding is frankly pathetic,” he said.“This is a desperate grab for power by a regime losing its grip on parliament, public opinion and even its own back benches. The Prime Minister is running scared of the mounting criticism of her disastrous handling of Brexit.“These appointments show the PM isn’t serious about reforming the Lords and smacks of hypocrisy.”Tommy Sheppard, the SNP’s Lords spokesman, described the decision as a “real affront to democracy”.He added: “The Tories are not even trying to disguise this – it is a complete fix.“By creating even more peers in a desperate attempt to force through their chaotic Brexit they are showing a despicable disregard. Even for the Tories this is shabby.’’ UK news in picturesUK news in picturesWorkers from the Covent Garden branch of TGI Fridays on a picket line outside the restaurant as they strike in a dispute over pay.

It emphasises direct democracy and sits in Ukip’s group in the European parliament.Friday’s joint programme makes no mention of the parties’ stance on the EU or the euro, leaving the situation ambiguous. Officials in Brussels are worried that the parties will pick fights with the EU institutions if they get into government in one of the EU’s founding states.League leader Matteo Salvini said he and Five Star leader Luigi di Maio would meet with Italy’s mostly ceremonial president on Monday to form a government if their members signed off on the plan in votes due to be held before Sunday.“Days and nights of work,” he said in a statement on social media. “Do you like it?”The Five Star Movement won the most votes in March’s elections, garnering 32.7 per cent. The Northern League came a narrow third behind the centre-left Democratic Party, winning 17.4 per cent its wider electoral alliance, which included the centre-right, won 37.1 per cent.Last year saw the election of a right-wing government in Austria that included the FPO as a junior partner.

His supporters successfully campaigned for social and political reform and against a corrupt and dysfunctional political establishment.It was the latest surprise in the career of a man who barely survived the murder of his father, the revered Shia religious leader Mohammed Sadiq al-Sadr, and his two brothers, on the orders of Saddam Hussein in 1999.Four years later, after the US invasion of Iraq, he was in danger once again of being killed, this time by American forces who twice besieged him in the holy city of Najaf in 2004.Mr Sadr will be very much the kingmaker – though he will have no official position – in the formation of a new Iraqi government.His coalition, which includes the Iraqi Communist Party, independents and secularists as well as his religious followers, appealed strongly to Iraqis who feel that, with the war won against Isis, they need to rebuild their country.The Iraqi prime minister Haider al-Abadi hoped to win the election – though no party was ever likely to win an absolute majority – by appealing to voters as the leader who recaptured Mosul from Isis last year.He followed this up with a largely bloodless reoccupation of Kirkuk, held by the Kurds since 2003, and the restoration of a large measure of government authority in Iraqi Kurdistan.The political movement formed out of the largely Shia paramilitaries, the Hashd al-Shaabi, which came second in the polls, had, like Mr Abadi, hoped to win more votes through their role in the war against Isis.Coalition led by nationalist cleric takes shock lead in Iraqi electionUS and Iran battle for influence in first post-Isis Iraq electionWomen brace for Iraq’s election after race marked by harassment What would Trump have done about Saddam Hussein? But the drop in violence to a level not seen since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein means that Iraqis are focusing on the theft by the political elite of hundreds of billions of dollars in oil revenues that should have been used to improve the supply of water, electricity, waste disposal as well medical care and education.Mr Sadr has been frequently underestimated as a political leader since he first emerged from house arrest in Najaf at the time of the US invasion.He was described by the western media as a ‘maverick’ or ‘firebrand cleric’, but his views were always more sophisticated and flexible than he was given credit for.The origin of Mr Sadr’s influence was his family’s role as religious leaders and the martyrdom of many of them, beginning with the execution of Mohammed Baqr al-Sadr in 1980.His father led a movement that appealed to the Shia poor of Baghdad and southern Iraq, combining religious revivalism with social and political radicalism. From the start, Sadrism had a strong element of Iraqi nationalism in opposition to all foreign interference in Iraq, be it American, British or Iranian.‘The near future of Iraq is dark’: Warning from Muqtada al-Sadr -In an interview with The Independent in Najaf in 2013 – the first he had given face to face to a Western journalist for 10 years – Mr Sadr spoke graphically of the ill effects of Iraq inviting in different foreign powers to try to solve its problems. He compared this to “somebody who found a mouse in his house, then he kept a cat, then he wanted to get the cat out of the house so he kept a dog, then to get the dog out of his house he bought an elephant, so he bought a mouse”,Mr Sadr created the Shia paramilitary Mehdi Army to resist the Americans. He was later to stand this down during the Sunni-Shia sectarian mass killings of 2006-7, saying that it had been infiltrated by people not under his control.He was denounced by the US as a pro-Iranian proxy, but he has made clear over the years that he opposes Iranian interference as well as that of other countries.The Sadrist success in the election this month will be unwelcome in both Washington and Tehran.The US had done everything it could to back Mr Abadi as a victorious war leader and a sort of Iraqi Winston Churchill – forgetting, perhaps, that Churchill lost the British general election in 1945.Mr Sadr’s influence over an incoming government in Baghdad puts in doubt the future of the 10,000 American troops and military contractors in Iraq, though a Sadrist spokesman said after the election that US training and the weapons procurement from the US could continue.World news in picturesWorld news in picturesSanta Fe High School student Dakota Shrader is comforted by her mother Susan Davidson following a shooting at the school in Texas.

When I interviewed him five years ago he warned against Sunni-Shia sectarianism and foreign interference. He said: “The Iraqi people will disintegrate, its government will disintegrate and it will be easy for foreign powers to control the country.” This prediction was to be fulfilled six months later when Isis took Mosul and the Iraqi army broke up.Mr Sadr said that sectarianism was spreading at street level and “if it spreads among the people, it will be difficult to fight”.Iraqi politics is still largely based on sectarian or ethnic identity – Shia, Sunni and Kurd – but the religious parties that were in the ascendant after 2003 have discredited themselves. The majority Shia community is also more confident, after its military victories last year, that it is firmly in control and is not going to be dispossessed from power.Mr Sadr said that the problem was that the Iraqi psychology had been shaped by a “constant cycle of violence: Saddam, occupation, war after war, first Gulf war, the second Gulf war, then the occupation war”.The election this month, in which so many voters gave priority to social rather than security issues, may show that, as violence ebbs, Iraqis are becoming less traumatised.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Rooms have been renovated, flowers planted in the design of the US flag and the seal of the US embassy has gone up.Security around the building has been upgraded, road signs installed and CCTV cameras set up in the area – all part of the renovations that President Trump says have cost a modest $400,000 (£295,000).After 14 months of rapid preparations, the consulate will be inaugurated to huge fanfare, with about 800 guests and a video address by President Trump beamed live around the world.The consulate building in Agron Road was constructed in 1868It was one of the first houses built outside Jerusalem\u0027s old city wallsThe original building had only two storeys a third was added in the early 20th centuryThe complex currently covers about 6,000 square metresPlans suggest it will be four times as big once converted, by the end of next yearRenovation work so far has cost £295,000The US government leases a second site in Jerusalem, in Nablus Road, providing visa services It will be a largely symbolic affair, however, because up to six more years of work are planned, including a 10ft perimeter wall, an opulent new chamber and several new floors – both upwards and underground – to house the 850 staff moving from Tel Aviv. Timed to coincide with the 70th anniversary of the founding of the state of Israel, the opening has been hailed as the beginning of a new quarter in Arnona, south Jerusalem, for embassies from countries around the world that will spring up there.We will soon see the true nature of Trump’s work in the Middle EastNew law allows Palestinians in Jerusalem to have residency strippedTrump says recognising Jerusalem as Israel’s capital ‘was wonderful\u0027“We might have to build dozens of embassies, and we would need new land ready for that purpose. I asked my ministry to vigorously take action as fast as possible, said construction minister Yoav Galant, The Jerusalem Post reported.Mr Galant even suggested possible names for the embassies area, the Post said. He initially called it “Embassy Town” but then decided he preferred “Trump Town” after the US president, who has deemed the city Israel’s capital. Ministers have already announced a new railway station near the Western Wall will be named after Mr Trump.The plan for the new consular facility was created and approved in little over a year thanks to the finance minister, Moshe Kahlon, exercising his authority to fast-track the process. And there will be celebrations aplenty on Monday.Many of those who know the site best, however, will not be joining in the festivities.When the rebuilding work begins in earnest, the embassy will be created in part by converting the Diplomat Hotel next door, which it also owns. The embassy will use the consulate building in the short term, but sources suggest the Diplomat is slated to house the embassy in the long run.For years, the hotel has been leased out as housing for about 450 elderly immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Now, the building is due to be demolished in two years’ time when the lease expires – and the residents have nowhere to go.Many of these men and women were doctors, musicians and academics in Russia before moving to Israel in the early 1990s, according to The Times of Israel. Some moved straight into the Diplomat and have never had any other home in the country.

The US State Department says the new purpose-built building will be ​​a long-term project.According to Ynet News, the website of Yedioth Ahronoth, an Israeli newspaper, 20 planning companies and two New York firms were hired for the project. The US State Department usually employs selected American firms, but deviated from the norm by hiring an Israeli team, including architect Amir Mann and an Israeli contractor to carry out the work, it said.A five-storey structure was originally planned but to keep costs down the extra floors have not yet been completed, and the ambassador, David Friedman, will make only limited use of the embassy for now, using it for work but not yet moving in full-time.Both the Tel Aviv and Jerusalem consulates will provide passports and US visa services during the transition period.Neighbours have complained that the work, carried out under time pressures, could be environmentally unfriendly and risk going against planning and construction bylaws.But none is as worried as the 450 Russian residents.The job of finding a new home for them is down to Israel’s Immigrant Absorption Ministry.Ksenia Svetlova, a member of the Knesset, of the Zionist Union party, said the ministry has no set plan as to where or how the residents will be moved, and no estimate of potential costs or subsequent budget.She fears residents could be forced out before June 2020, when the lease expires.Just a few days before the historic opening of the beautiful United States Embassy in Jerusalem, Israel.

The pair finally called it a day in 2011.Meanwhile, Meghan\u0027s marriage to US film producer Trevor Engelson ended in 2013 after only two years.\u0026nbspBefore that blind date with Harry she was with Canadian celebrity chef Cory Vitiello.However one expert is convinced that this relationship will go the distance.Harry\u0027s biographer Penny Junor says: Harry\u0027s first reaction when he met Meghan was, \u0027Wow!\u0027 but beyond the obvious physical attraction they are very well suited primarily because they have interests in common.Harry and Meghan are driven by humanitarian issues. They share a genuine and deep interest in making the world a better place. Early on they recognised that quality in one another and very swiftly they got on to real conversations.In the past her charity work has taken Meghan to India and Rwanda, where she has shown an ability to muck in.\u0026nbspShe is currently taking a break while she prepares for her wedding and settles into royal life but the couple\u0027s future is bound to include joint charity projects.Meghan once said: I\u0027ve never wanted to be a lady who lunches. I\u0027ve always wanted to be a woman who works.It is a very modern approach which appeals to Harry, who is closely associated with organisations such as UNICEF and Sentebale, his own charity supporting young people affected by HIV in Lesotho and Botswana.The days when Harry was dubbed The Playboy Prince, known for his hard partying and boorish antics, are a distant memory.\u0026nbspHe spent 10 years in the Army but more recently he has been conscious of the need to find a wife.His biographer is convinced that the Prince, who is now approaching his mid-30s, is ready to settle down.\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoHarry did struggle to find a role in life and was rather wild at times but he has grown up, adds Junor. He is a very different man now.\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoThis is absolutely the right time for him to marry and in Meghan Markle he\u0027s found the perfect match."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/106/590x/meghan-markle-royal-wedding-962067.jpg","title":"Royal Wedding Meghan Markle Prince Harry Royal Family","story":"A generation has grown up watching the monarchy sail serenely on.Despite her 92 years the Queen shows no sign of flagging, Prince Charles seems content to wait in the wings while the young royals led by William and Kate are more popular than ever.The birth of Prince Louis is the icing on the cake. Yet it\u0027s not so long ago that the institution was in crisis.Three of Her Majesty\u0027s children had been through orces, the fallout from the death of Princess Diana was bitter and it appeared the nation would never take Camilla Parker Bowles to its heart.There were allegations that the Royal Family was out of touch, rooted in the past and loathe to modernise. At one stage there were even whispers that the monarchy might not survive.However there has been a minor revolution behind the scenes at Buckingham Palace over the past few decades and nothing demonstrates this more than the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.He might only be sixth in line to the throne but Harry\u0027s choice of bride is another important sign of the monarchy\u0027s desire to shed its stuffy image.Not only is Miss Markle a commoner but she\u0027s an American, a orcee and of mixed race.WIREIMAGE \u0026bull Meghan Markle will marry Prince Harry today in Windsor                Harry and Meghan\u0026rsquos royal wedding in pictures: LIVE photos                Royal Wedding 2018 order of service: What time is the Royal Wedding?In fact she could hardly be further removed from the blue bloods who have traditionally become royal brides.In years gone by she would, no doubt, have been deemed unsuitable just as her compatriot Koo Stark was when she won the heart of Prince Andrew in the 1980s.So it is to the Royal Family\u0027s credit that Meghan has been warmly welcomed into the fold: she already has a Christmas at Sandringham under her belt.Royal commentator and broadcaster Jennie Bond says: This confident, eloquent and elegant young woman is a powerful symbol of how the monarchy is moving with the times.Edward VIII had to choose between his love for a orced woman, Wallis Simpson, and the throne.Prince Andrew was pressured into giving up an American actress, Koo Stark.But Meghan Markle, who is orced, American, an actress and of mixed heritage, has been welcomed into the Royal Family with open arms.She will reflect Britain\u0027s multicultural society as well as the empowerment of women.And that makes the monarchy more relevant, more contemporary and more connected to society - exactly as Harry\u0027s mother Diana once advocated.Race is always a delicate subject but if the Royal Family is to remain relevant it has to mirror society: in Britain about one in 10 couples is now in mixed ethnicity relationships.Prince Harry will marry Meghan Markle at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor Castle on 19 May 2018.                    AFPGetty Images1 of 100Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex (R) and US actress Meghan Markle (L) stand facing each other hand-in-hand In the past Meghan, whose mother is black and father white, has expressed pride in her heritage.Then there\u0027s the matter of her acting background, ning from 2002, which ides opinion.While Kate Middleton has gone from strength to strength since joining The Firm, one criticism had been her lack of previous real-world experience.When she married William her career amounted to only a short time working as an assistant accessories buyer for the clothing chain Jigsaw.In contrast Meghan battled hard to get her break in the notoriously tough acting world before landing the plum role of Rachel Zane in the US legal drama Suits.Earlier there was a stint as a scantily-clad hostess on Deal Or No Deal but through her charity work Meghan has shown that she has brains as well as beauty.She is also reported to have built a personal fortune of more than \u0026pound3.5million.It\u0027s clear that this will be a marriage of equals and Meghan, who voiced her opposition to Donald Trump in 2016, is not crossing the Atlantic merely to play the dutiful wife.Jennie Bond, who was the BBC\u0027s royal correspondent for 14 years, believes we can all relate to Meghan and that\u0027s a key reason why she\u0027s so good for the monarchy.She adds: Meghan is older than most royal brides and is already a success in her own right, with self-made wealth, an established career and a solid track record in supporting charities and causes about which she feels strongly.She has certainly won the love of her Prince but it seems clear that she has also won the respect of the family she is now joining and the nation as a whole.Meghan gives the impression that she is very comfortable in her own skin.Crucially Harry has been allowed to make his own match without all the restrictions that his father faced, which now seem so ridiculous.In Charles\u0026rsquo day there was a tiny pool of potential wives, drawn from the British aristocracy and the other royal houses of Europe.We all know how badly that ended, as he was effectively pushed into marrying the very suitable Diana Spencer who was barely 20 years old but hopelessly ill-prepared for the role.Contrast the na\u0026iumlve and painfully shy Diana with Meghan who is 36 years old, much more confident and thanks to her acting background at ease in front of the cameras.Harry is clearly marrying Meghan for love, not out of a sense of duty and that\u0027s another reason to celebrate.The last thing the Royal Family needs after a period of stability this century is another orce so, although Harry is far down the list of succession, he still carries a burden to marry well.PAMeghan Markle will be known as the Duchess of SussexFortunately there\u0027s a widespread feeling that he and Meghan, who have a shared passion for humanitarian causes, are well-suited.The couple have made it clear that they want donations for their chosen charities in lieu of wedding gifts.Of course Meghan has one failed marriage behind her but that\u0027s no longer a taboo and for that Harry owes a debt of gratitude to his father who fought the establishment so he could marry Camilla Parker Bowles.Everything changed when the Prince of Wales married Camilla, a orcee, says Penny Junor, author of Prince Harry: Brother, Soldier, Son.In the recent past society had very different views about whom members of the Royal Family should marry but times have changed. Barriers have been lowered.Going back further it was a orce that also prevented Harry\u0027s great aunt Princess Margaret from marrying her long-time boyfriend Captain Peter Townsend in the early 1950s.At the Palace there has also been an acceptance that in the 21st century everyone has a few skeletons in their cupboard.It was all rather tame but Meghan did once strip for the cameras in a love scene for Suits.However in modern-day Britain few people will hold that against her. Her own extended family is dysfunctional but she will also gain sympathy for that.Meghan, who is tipped to be given the title Duchess of Sussex, has already set about winning hearts.EPAThe royal couple pictured after announcing their engagementTraditionally members of the Royal Family could be stand-offish and it was protocol not to touch them.In the past the merest brush of a hand on the Queen\u0027s back by a foreign dignitary has been greeted with gasps of horror but Meghan has already turned that notion on its head.She\u0027s delighted children and other well-wishers with warm embraces and won\u0027t change her nature just because she\u0027s marrying into the Windsor family.I\u0027m American, I hug, says Meghan simply.It\u0027s not a calculated move but just another positive trait that she happens to bring to the table.Many who have met her have commented on how normal and down-to-earth she is and the more people feel she is just like one of us the stronger the monarchy becomes.Surveys show that young people especially adore Meghan.Royal weddings always create a feel-good effect, showing the monarchy at its best and demonstrating Britain\u0027s flair for pomp and ceremony.It has been calculated that the nuptials of Harry and Meghan will be worth up to \u0026pound500million to the economy, also creating a mini-tourism boom, while her nationality can only help cement the special relationship between the UK and the United States.But it seems it\u0027s the monarchy itself that is the biggest winner as it seeks to prove that it deserves to be regarded as a modern organisation that is fit to rule the land.On the day of the latest royal wedding the Meghan factor is already breathing fresh life into an ancient institution."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/106/590x/prince-harry-meghan-markle-962070.jpg","title":"royal wedding prince harry meghan markle relationship best moments","story":"Samir Hussein  Rupert HartleyCOURTSHIP: Harry and Meghan steal a cheeky kiss at the PoloHarry and Meghan have never confirmed who brought them together but fashion designer Misha Nonoo is one suggestion, while PR Violet von Westenholz is also in the frame.

Veils, polka dots, puff sleeves, she was always trying new things.Would she have liked Meghan? I think so.She’d have run her eye up and down her because although she wasn’t the sharpest tool in the box academia-wise, she had an A+ in intuition, but the important thing to her would be to know that she loved her son.If you could show her that then that would have been enough.If Diana was alive today I’ve no doubt she would be heavily involved with Meghan and Catherine and her grandchildren – and she would have been a very fun grandma.Want to celebrate Harry and Meghans wedding like a royal?Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Much, much quicker than the growth in exports in EU countries.By then, of course, we’ll have an entire world to trade with, free of restraint.Assuming the Government doesn’t bugger it up by keeping us in the EU’s customs union.So, contrary to what you are often told, the news is all rather good for the UK.And there’s another country where the economy is looking pretty good, too.Donald Trump’s USA. The stockmarket is soaring to record levels. The economy is growing at a more than decent rate.But who have been the main winners of Trump’s presidency when it comes to the economy?Horrible rich white business-men, you might guess. That’s what was said when he won the presidency — he’d look after people like himself.Nope again. Dead wrong. The main beneficiaries have been the poorest of Americans. And in particular the blacks and Hispanics. Unemployment is down, employment is up.There are more black and Hispanic people in work than at any time under Barack Obama’s hopeless administration.Under Obama, the country was paying out record amounts in welfare benefits and food stamps for its black and Hispanic citizens.And if Trump manages to strike some kind of lasting peace deal with North Korea, he’ll deserve the Nobel prize.So here’s a prediction.Despite the toddler temper tantrums among Lefties whenever the name Trump is mentioned, despite the curled lip and sneer from BBC news reporters, the shrieking protest marches from thick-as-mince unwashed millennials, despite all that,I’ll bet you now that Donald Trump gets re-elected.But don’t expect to hear much about any of this on the BBC’s News at Ten.A NEW survey has discovered what British people worry about most.What is it? Maybe the spectre of Diane Abbott being Home Secretary? Global warming? Nuclear warfare? Or the black shadow of death hanging over their heads?Nope. It’s “not being in when a parcel is delivered”.Just how crap a worry is that? And people lie awake at night.Gripped by the terror that the Amazon delivery man might call round with the spare part for the hedge-trimmer when they’re down the shops.SO, you lot – you’re all gammons, apparently.That’s the name given by Jeremy Corbyn supporters to working-class people who voted for Brexit.You are dense lumps of pig meat. Which is often served with a fried egg and some chips. And a bit of pineapple on top.They coined the phrase because some of the Brexiteers seen on Question Time have red faces. OK.Many people have called this “racist”. Sometimes I think there is nothing in this world of ours which couldn’t be called racist by someone desperate to be offended.It’s not racist. But it tells you exactly what the Labour Party thinks of working-class people, doesn’t it?HERE we go again. England fans have been warned not to take the flag of St George with them if they go to support our lads in the World Cup finals in Russia.The police have told them the flag is too “imperialistic” and “antagonistic”.So, every other nation will be waving their flag. Just not us.Mind you, I think I’d give Russia a swerve either way.If the Russki thugs don’t get you, then the police will.And you’ll have difficulty telling them apart. Or you’ll end up looking like one of those glo-sticks children wave around.Wait until the tournament is held in a civilised country.(So that’s Qatar out too then).Listen, it’s just a matter of economics.Making a dress the size of a bleedin’ aircraft hangar costs more than it does to make a nice size 12. It uses more material.So either cut out the seven stuffed-crust pizzas you eat every day for your elevenses, plus the bucket of chicken wings.Or pay the extra price.MORE good news – the Government has voted down attempts to strangle the Press.There will be no new Leveson inquiry.What’s more, it looks like Tom Watson is going to give up on his ludicrous campaign to force newspapers to pay court fees even when they win legal proceedings against them.Tom dreamed this up presumably with help from his best chum, the former fascist Max “Beat me, beat me, Brunehilde!” Mosley.Dead in the water, Watson.THINGS In This World I Don’t Care Much About (No 1): Whether Meghan’s dad Thomas, makes it to the wedding or not.

They’re the ones who provoked the rioters. Told them to break down the fence and kill Jews.But all that gets forgotten when there’s TV footage of Israeli soldiers shooting people. Even if they are bombarded with Molotov cocktails.It’s still the case that the biggest barrier to peace is Hamas, not Israel.LIKE you, I’m working on my hip cleavage so I’ll look dead good on the beach this summer.I’m going to have my bikini bottom glued somewhere just below my armpits, in order to look like Bella Hadid or Genie Bouchard or Alessandra Ambrosio.It all reminds me of the old joke. Young bloke complains that no girls on the beach fancy him. Won’t even look at him.So his friend advises: “Put a couple of potatoes in your trunks. Then they’ll look.”Young bloke comes back the next day and says: “It’s even worse. Now they run away from me.”His friend looks at his trunks and says: “I meant put the potatoes down the FRONT of your trunks, not the back.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Mrs May cannot even rely on her own MPs.Consider what she’s up against:An EU which has spent two years playing games, either to reverse Brexit or extract a fortune from us while nullifying us as an economic threat.Unelected peers, contemptuous not only of the referendum verdict but the democracy that produced it.Tory backbenchers putting their party’s very existence a distant second to getting their own way on Europe.And a Labour Party solely concerned with ousting the Tories, even if it means wrecking our negotiating strategy.The PM’s task is being made impossible.THE problem on some of our train lines is not that they need to be nationalised. It’s that they aren’t privatised enough.True competition would drive fares down and standards up.

When the EU finally decides it is happy for new technology to monitor the Irish border.Never, in other words.It is already sneering it will take till 2085. It will use any excuse.We are told Britain would be free to sign trade deals during that time. But how could we negotiate without the flexibility to diverge from EU rules?We would be nominally “out”, yet forever marching in lockstep with it over trade. “Perpetual purgatory”, as Jacob Rees-Mogg rightly calls it.Theresa May is under huge pressure. But this is not seizing the opportunity Brexit presents. It is defeatism, attempted damage limitation without realising the REAL damage of a half-Brexit.The Cabinet is running scared of Brussels and Tory Remainers, as the EU ratchets up the panic.The alternative is to leave with no deal.

We have to get cracking with fracking, like the US.And the Government must launch a PR offensive to convince a doubting nation it is clean and safe.IT would be insane not to ban combustible cladding on tower blocks after Grenfell.And it should be mandatory to test panels physically.We know the tragedy had several causes.

It needs to change to survive.Prime Minister Theresa May won as many votes last year as Margaret Thatcher did in her prime.She earned the party its biggest share of working-class votes since 1979.The Conservatives are now back ahead in the polls.But across some of the parts of the population that are growing the fastest, the Conservatives are still trailing behind Labour.In last year’s General Election, Jeremy Corbyn’s Little Red Book did not just win over university students.He also won over half of people in their thirties.A recent poll showed only nine per cent of those aged 25 to 39 say they will definitely vote Conservative.The Conservatives are behind among people who rent their homes privately — and there are twice the number doing that as there were in 2000.Nearly four times as many people from ethnic minority communities voted Labour than voted Tory — and those different communities are a growing part of our population.So if the Conservative Party does not broaden its reach, it is finished. It is that simple.That does not mean the Prime Minister should copy Corbyn’s empty promises.Let’s not forget that Labour’s most recent manifesto proposed to raise taxes to their highest level since World War Two.Or that Corbyn’s plans to borrow huge, unprecedented sums of money to embark on a spending spree would put a millstone of debt around the necks of younger people.Or that the only thing he wants to cut is our defence budget — and from the Falklands to Russia, he has a bad habit of siding with Britain’s enemies.The Tories have spent eight years cleaning up the mess Labour left behind. We do not want to repeat their mistakes.We remember the dangerous situation where the Government was borrowing a quarter of all the money it spent.We did the hard yards slashing the dole queues Labour left behind, and now we have got more people in work than ever before.But we can not just rest on our record. There are five big challenges we need to solve if we are going to deserve the votes of Sun readers at the next election.The FIRST is obvious — we have to make a success of Brexit. We should ignore pompous members of the House of Lords who say we should just override the democratic result of the referendum.But we should make sure we listen when businesses and exporters say they want sensible arrangements to keep business flowing between Britain and Europe. That’s exactly what the PM is negotiating.The SECOND is to give young people at least the same chances to get on in life that older people have enjoyed.That means reversing 15 years of falling home ownership and building more homes that young working people can afford.But it also means reforming taxes to focus on growing the number of homeowners, not just expanding the amount of rented property.The THIRD challenge is to build a united Britain and make the Conservative Party feel like the natural home for working people, whatever their race or religion.We believe we must continue to strongly control immigration and stop illegal immigration. But we also believe in making sure everyone can feel part of Britain.We admire those who have come here with nothing and built amazing businesses — and we know that the Conservative priorities of enterprise, family and education are often their priorities, too.Many feel very patriotic about this great country that is now their home. That is why we, as a party, must do much more to reach out to ethnic minority communities.It is why, in government, we must make sure that everyone, no matter their background, gets help to speak good English so they can get a good job and be part of a united country.FOURTH, we need to do much more to help places that have suffered in recent decades. Not just by aiding big cities such as Liverpool, Manchester and Birmingham — some of which are now growing faster than London.But also by tackling deprivation in the neglected smaller towns and coastal communities where opportunities have been hard to come by for years.FIFTH, we must build an economy that really does work for everyone, not just the well-off.It is brilliant that unemployment is at a 40-year low. But wages fell a long way in the last recession and though they are growing, working people have been through a very difficult decade.Policies such as the National Living Wage and tax cuts for the lower-paid have helped those who want to work, earn more and keep more of their earnings.But now we have to find ways to raise average wages and help businesses invest in their workers.Government should be taking more of a role in helping people to retrain between jobs or to work in new industries to reduce the impact of new technology.And we must do more to help working families with everyday costs of living. That means cutting high energy bills and helping working families who face some of the most expensive childcare in the developed world.If we do these things and govern always in the interests of working people, we can beat Corbyn’s tried-and-failed 1970s politics.By becoming the party for working people, the Conservative Party can earn a solid majority and make Britain fairer — and more united.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

At that point I decided to just walk away.”The photograph shows a grey-haired man with his pants down.Holding a piece of toilet paper, he is squatting over a concrete path by a brick wall and looking in the direction of the camera.Steve has since discovered that the man is married, and lives in a well-kept house with a manicured garden not far from the apartment block in the southeastern Brisbane suburb of Greenslopes.Steve wrote on Facebook that the man was a Greenslopes resident but he was “not sharing his name at this stage, unless he continues to do it”.“Hopefully someone (either friend, acquaintance or even his employer) will recognise him,” the commenter said.“I can see no reasonable excuse for his filthy and disgusting behaviour. The fact that he has done this on numerous occasions makes it even worse!”.Steve has distributed the poster in a local letter drop to houses including the one in which the poo jogger lives.Last year, a female jogger in Colorado dubbed the Mad Pooper left a family at their wits end when she repeatedly defecated in front of their home.He said that the man ran past on Mondays, Wednesday and Fridays, but did not stop to relieve himself on the path every time.“He ran straight past on Monday,” Steve said.He and other neighbours had tried to talk to the man, to no avail.Facebook users suggested having a police car outside the apartment block, and another said he hoped the photograph would “shame the police to take it seriously”.But it was pointed out that, at best, the man could be charged with trespass and be served with a notice.“As it is on private property the police cannot really do anything. If he was crapping like this on public property, he could be charged with disorderly behaviour,” a Facebook poster wrote.Steve told news.au he had been hoping police could go and have a talk with the man, but was now hoping the photograph might deter him from doing it again.This article originally appeared on news.au."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000406952490-e1526634010461.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"royal wedding time full schedule events step by step guide may 19","story":"The Royal Wedding Ceremony will be closely watched by the couples family, friends and millions of the general public.

She got her Brexit inner Cabinet to agree that in the event of no trade deal being in place by December 2020, the UK would continue to apply the EU’s common external tariff.The decision goes back to the issue of the Irish border and the “backstop” May agreed last December. This said that in the event of no deal being done, the UK would keep Northern Ireland in line with EU rules on customs, agriculture and manufactured goods.The DUP, the Ulster party on which Mrs May depends for her Commons majority, would never accept a Northern Ireland-only deal. So the Government wants to apply this backstop to the whole UK.The situation is far from ideal. It shows why the Brexit Secretary, David Davis, was right to have such misgivings about the backstop. He argued that by agreeing what would happen in the event of ‘no deal’ the UK was reducing its negotiating leverage.There is also a danger the backstop reduces the EU’s incentive to negotiate a comprehensive free-trade deal.Brexiteer ministers are intrigued by new Home Secretary Sajid Javid’s idea of keeping the customs revenues collected under the backstop in trust, only handing them over to the EU once the final deal is done.The UK’s position in these talks has been weakened by its failure to properly prepare for no deal.The EU knows the UK isn’t ready to walk away so it keeps pushing, knowing the need for a deal means we will almost certainly fold in the end.The final problem is that the UK still doesn’t know precisely what it wants. The backstop is only meant to apply if either a trade deal or technology can’t solve the Irish border problem.But right now there is more agreement in the Brexit inner Cabinet on the backstop — which, officially, they don’t want to happen — than on either of those two options.I understand from those involved in ministerial working groups looking at customs options they are still a long way off any conclusions. I am also told these working groups aren’t coming up with answers but doing “preparatory work to inform a later discussion”.So why aren’t Brexiteers kicking off at all these cans been kicked down the road?Well, as one influential figure, explains to me: “It is all very unsatisfactory but it is what it is.” In other words, given the mistakes that have been made, there isn’t really an alternative.The other reason is the view among several of the most important Brexiteers that they can’t get what they want at the moment, so they should play it long. The thinking goes that it is better to accept more temporary measures than to agree to bad permanent arrangements.But it is being whispered in Westminster that if Brexiteers are to get what they want, they need control of the government machine — and that means one of their own in Number 10.Moving against Theresa May now is simply too risky.Bringing her down could bring Brexit down.But in the past week, the talk of a challenge to her shortly after Britain has legally, if not practically, left the EU has risen in volume.Those around Mrs May want her to fight the next election.They also argue that any leadership contest before the whole Brexit process is done would risk splitting the Tories beyond repair.But this week, the chances of a challenge to Mrs May soon after March 30 next year substantially increased.ALL eyes will be on Windsor today for the Royal Wedding – but in Westminster, Tories are getting increasingly excited about the possibility of some political nuptials.On Monday night, the Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson and Environment Secretary Michael Gove will launch a new group designed to craft a post-Brexit agenda for the party. This joint appearance has set tongues wagging and left Tories wondering if they could one day be joined in political union.Davidson and Gove were on opposite sides of the Brexit referendum and until recently, she was – in private – no fan of his. But that has changed.One ally of hers tells me: “Relations are warmer than they have ever been.” What has brought them together? Fish. Davidson knows it is politically vital for Scottish Tories to secure a clean break from the Common Fisheries Policy.And Gove, whose adopted father was an Aberdeen fish merchant, is an ally against Chancellor Philip Hammond’s desire to use fishing as a bargaining chip in the negotiations.The question is whether this alliance of convenience could develop into something more lasting. Many Tories still dream of Davidson coming south after the Scottish Parliament elections in 2021. They think her charisma, combined with Gove’s radicalism, would be just the ticket.But there are huge logistical challenges to getting Davidson to Westminster before the next election, even if she wanted to. So could she back Gove?I am told she is keeping her options open at the moment. But what is certain is that whoever she did back would get a massive boost.If Davidson is not going to try to be queen, she can be the Tory kingmaker.So one wonders what Bercow, the Speaker of the House, would say about a minister calling someone a “stupid woman”.Yet tellingly, his office’s statement doesn’t deny the claim that he called Andrea Leadsom, the Leader of the House of Commons, that in a private aside on Wednesday.But there are no signs of a public apology from Bercow.It is hard not to conclude that he is determined to hang on to his job whatever damage he does to the role.ITALY, one of the founding members of the EU, is set to be governed by a populist coalition who want to renegotiate key parts of the European project.The biggest threat the new Italian government poses is to the future of the Eurozone. The new coalition’s programme would cost more than 100billion euros. This will put them in breach of the Eurozone’s deficit rules. To add insult to injury, the European Central Bank (ECB) buys a substantial amount of Italy’s sovereign debt.So the ECB would effectively be financing part of this programme.The result will be a backlash in northern European countries. They will wonder why Italy should get away with this. The result: The prospect of proper reform to fix the Eurozone’s structural weaknesses is dead.This is the Eurozone’s problem. Politics makes the reforms it needs impossible. Next time a global financial crisis hits, the Eurozone will have unique vulnerabilities.She said Tory MPs were telling her that both the party and the country needed unity at this moment and noises off didn’t help with that.But I am told the Prime Minister’s appeals on this front are becoming so frequent they are losing their force.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Love is the only way.The bishop then added: Theres power in love. Dont underestimate it. Dont even over-sentimentalise. There is power, power in love.Prince William was seen smirking in front of the Queen and Prince Philip at St Georges Chapel in Windsor as Curry delivered his rousing message.Harry and Meghan saw the funny side and David Beckham was snapped grinning from ear to ear as the address went down a storm at St. Georges Chapel. 9.30-11.00: Wedding guests arrive at the Castles famous Round Tower by coach and enter the chapel through the South Door and take their seats.11.20: Members of the royal family begin to arrive and enter via the Galilee Porch, some on foot others by car.11.45: Possibly around this time Harry and his brother the Duke of Cambridge arrive at the Chapels West Steps, probably on foot walking past the thousands of spectators invited into the grounds of the castle. The moment will give Harry the chance to acknowledge the 200 representatives from charities he is associated with gathered in the Horseshoe Cloister at the bottom of the steps.11.55-11.59: Following protocol, the Queen will be the last member of the royal family to arrive for the wedding service.11.59: Ms Markle arrives at the Chapels West Steps by car, from her overnight accommodation, with some of her bridesmaids and pageboys.She will start her journey, which will take her past some of the crowds in the Long Walk, with her mother Doria Ragland - but when the car stops at the castle her mother will exchange places with her bridesmaids and pageboys.Ms Ragland will enter the chapel by the Galilee Porch and in the absence of Meghans father Thomas Markle Prince Charles will meet her halfway down the aisle.12.00: Service starts.1.00pm: Service ends and the newlyweds emerge at the West Steps of the Chapel. They will be waved off on their carriage procession through Windsor by members of both families. The congregation will file out of the chapel to see the newlyweds leave before heading to St Georges Hall for the lunchtime reception hosted by the Queen.1.05pm: Around this time the carriage procession through the streets of Windsor will begin, taking 25 minutes.7.00pm: Bride and groom departing Windsor castle for the evening reception Frogmore House hosted by the Prince of Wales.The couple are tying the knot at St Georges Chapel at Windsor Castle, which offers a more low key venue than Westminster Abbey, where Kate Middleton and Prince William got married.Meghan and Harrys venue can accommodate 800 guests, whereas the Abbey seats 2,000.Its setting will also offer the couple and their famous friends and family some privacy on what is sure to be a major global news event.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Both sides want a deal. But if the EU also tries to cripple us as a trading power, there are 60 Brexit-backing Tories ready to veto it.The PM has made many concessions to the EU already. She must be more militant.WHY is the grotesquely self-important toad John Bercow still Commons Speaker?For years he has polluted proceedings with his verbose grandstanding, interrupting MPs to rebuke them at tedious length for some minor transgression.His endless convoluted put-downs take up precious debating time.Bercow already faces two bullying accusations which he denies and MPs strangely do not wish to probe.Now, after yet another unhinged rant, he seems to have branded Andrea Leadsom “a stupid woman”. Had a Tory frontbencher done similar, Bercow would have gone berserk.In our view he has now crossed a line.

His speech about love caught everyone in the church by surprise in the church.Some of the faces in the church showed they werent expecting such a rousing address.The whole day has been a blend of tradition, which the American guests will love, and modern elements, such as the choir singing Stand By Me. It shows Harry and Meghan are very much in love and blending their backgrounds.The Royal family was front and centre in the chapel, with the Queen and an unaided 96-year-old Prince Philip cheered as they walked into the chapel this morning.And the US actress mum Doria, who flew into London from the US this week, was seen in tears during the ceremony.She had joined her 36-year-old daughter as they were driven from the chapel from Cliveden House in the drive in a vintage Rolls-Royce Phantom to the chapel.The Prince is today wearing full military uniform for the ceremony, sharing a joke with his brother and best man Prince William as crowds cheered.Kensington Palace confirmed that the royal brothers would be wearing the frockcoat uniform of the Blues and Royals, with the Queen giving her permission for Prince Harry to marry in his uniform.The dress focuses on the open bateau neckline that slightly shows the shoulders, with a figure fitting sculpted waistline.Its made of six seams, with a flowing train and an underskirt made of triple silk organza.It also has three-quarter length sleeves.Givenchy also created the stunning five metre long veil, which is decorated with hand-embroidered flowers representing all 53 countries of the Commonwealth - a design detail requested by Meghan. It is made from silk tulle with the floral decorations made out of silk threads and organza.The workers who made the veil spent hundreds of hours making the intricate design - and had to wash their hands every THIRTY minutes to keep the materials pristine.The front of the veil shows crops of wheat blending into the flora, to symbolise love and charity.Meghans heels are made of aptly named duchess satin and have a pointed toe.And for the mini-mes - Givenchy also designed the six adorable bridesmaids dresses.Each dress is high waisted with short puffed sleeves and a silk ribbon detail at the back, tied into a bow. The dresses were made of a prestigious fabric called ivory silk radzimir.Handily - they came complete with pockets, and pleated skirts.Famous faces including Oprah Winfrey, George Clooney and wife Amal, Elton John and Thomas Hardy were also among the throng of hundreds of guests to pour into St Georges Chapel.Among the arrivals were Princess Dianas brother Earl Spencer, Prince Harrys ex-girlfriend Chelsy Davy and Kates pregnant sister Pippa Middleton and mum Carole.How the Royal Wedding has unfolded so far...Other guests include tennis champ Serena Williams, Lady Kitty Spencer, Chloe Madeley and James Haskell and Meghans Suits co-star Patrick Adams and singer James Blunt.Marcus Mumford of Mumford and Sons, and Princess Dianas butler Paul Burrell were also snapped heading into the chapel today.  David Beckham looked dapper in a grey morning suit complete with waistcoast and tails, while wife Victoria wore a navy dress with long sleeves and bright red shoes as they posed with fans in Windsor.Rugby royalty Jonny Wilkinson, James Haskell and Sir Clive Woodward are all in attendance today in a nod to Harrys role as head of the Rugby Football Union.And Sarah Ferguson cast aside any speculation she would not be invited as she turned up for the service, wearing a dark navy dress.While the ceremony ticked all the boxes for royal tradition, it did include modern flavours to recognise the couples own personalities.In one of the most extraordinary twists, Meghan walked halfway down the aisle by herself, then met by future father-in-law Prince Charles.The US actress own father Thomas Markle had officially pulled out of the wedding after a tumultuous week where it was revealed he had posed in staged paparazzi photos.But Meghan has been able to put the drama behind her - stunning crowds with her dress.Thousands are expected to head to Windsor to greet the newlyweds - with many hoping for the wedding to be sealed with a royal kiss or two.The service at Windsor Castle promises to be a modern affair - with Ben E Kings classic Stand by Me due to be sung by a choir.The couple have also chosen not to obey each other in their marriage vows - and instead will honour and protect.Among the guests will be Prince Philip, with the 96-year-olds attendance having been in question after he underwent a hip operation.Preparations are this morning hotting up at the chapel with the flowers, including white peonies, white foxgloves, white stocks and flowering birch among the bouquets.The wedding ceremony will see Harry and Meghan, newly announced as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, riding together in a two-mile, 25-minute open-top carriage procession through the streets of Windsor.Last night Harry and and best man Prince William greeted jubilant crowds - many covered in Union Jacks and bunting - after waving off Meghan Markle and her mum Doria.Prince Harry and Williams walkabout echoed the pairs impromptu public appearance on The Mall in central London in 2011.Beaming Harry shook hands with royal fans in Winds and said he was feeling great just a day before his wedding.He was asked twice if he was nervous, but the Prince replied: Great, thanks.

However, it is not known whether that will be in the wedding chapel or at the Frogmore reception, or both.Sir Elton holds a special place in Harry\u0027s heart as the singer was a close friend of his late mother, Diana, and penned and performed Candle in the Wind for her funeral in 1997.The Rocketman singer also attended William and Kate\u0027s wedding in 2011 and he has rescheduled two concert dates which were meant to be happening this weekend.Keeping with the British theme, there were rumours the Spice Girls may also sing, with Mel B - Scary Spice - apparently letting slip that the band would be performing at the royal wedding.:: Royal wedding 2018: The ultimate guide However, Mel C - Sporty Spice - then said she was \"joking\".Chart toppers Ed Sheeran, Sam Smith and Stormzy have also thrown their hats in the ring, all expressing interest in playing for the newest royal couple.As Hereford-born Ellie Goulding, a friend of Harry\u0027s, sang at William and Kate\u0027s wedding, it is unlikely she will perform at Saturday\u0027s reception.:: Meghan Markle\u0027s Suits co-stars arrive for royal wedding Some veteran acts could also be entertaining the couple and their friends and family.Another question will be what Meghan will be wearing for the reception.Her wedding dress, which is rumoured to have cost \u0026#163100,000 - paid for by herself - is sure to be the star of the show, just as Kate\u0027s was in 2011.Like her future sister-in-law, she is expected to change into something which is a bit easier to dance in for the reception. As an actress on the red carpet she is used to wearing striking, and sometimes revealing, dresses, so she could well choose something similar for the party.Royal weddings have more British traditions than most, but Meghan is sure to bring some American traditions of her own - especially to the reception.They have already bucked the British tradition of a fruit cake by having a lemon and elderflower sponge, and may well have more dainties at the after-party.In America, during the cake-cutting ceremony the newslyweds feed each other the first two slices of the cake - and often stuff the cake into each other\u0027s faces. The first dance in the UK takes place after the cake-cutting, but in America, the couple usually have the first dance immediately after they are announced into the dining room.Meghan is likely to toss her bouquet into a crowd of single female guests, but whether Harry will follow the American tradition of lifting up the bride\u0027s gown to pull off a garter and fling it into a group of his friends, remains to be seen. In the UK, the father of the bride usually gives a speech, but as Thomas Markle cannot attend, her mother, Doria Ragland, may give a speech.Harry and William, as the best man, will both give speeches as is traditional in the UK.However, what is very untraditional in the UK but very American, is the bride giving a speech.With Meghan\u0027s acting background and experience of giving passionate speeches about charitable causes she supports, she is also likely to give an address.She previously said she is not having a matron of honour as she could not pick between her good friends. However, as it is tradition in America for the chief bridesmaid to give a speech, either - or all - of her her best friends, Jessica Mulroney, Lindsay Roth and Misha Nonoo could give a speech."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/05/2048x1152/skynews-wedding-markle_4314616.jpg?20180519120215 ","title":"royal wedding everything you need to know about meghans dress","story":"Meghan\u0027s veil was held in place by Queen Mary\u0027s diamond and platinum bandeau tiara, made in 1932 and lent by The Queen.The bling continued with a detachable brooch at its centre featuring 10 brilliant diamonds.The new Duchess of Sussex also wore Cartier earrings and bracelet, and her shoes were based on a Givenchy design and made of silk duchess satin.Meghan\u0027s hair was styled by Serge Normant, while her friend Daniel Martin did her make-up.In tribute to Princess Diana, the bride\u0027s bouquet included forget-me-nots - her favourite.Harry also handpicked some flowers for the Kensington Place garden to add to the bouquet, which was designed by florist Philippa Craddock and tied with a silk ribbon.

We told how the Prime Minister hoped to “bury the bad news” she was sending another batch of party loyalists to the bloated House of Lords, which is already stuffed with about 800 peers.  And sure enough, at 4.55pm, nine new Conservatives were ennobled in an announcement overshadowed by the run-up to Prince Harry and Meghan Markle ’s nuptials tomorrow. The Tory cronies who will take ermine include ex-Social Secretary Peter Lilley and former Cabinet heavyweight Sir Eric Pickles, as we predicted. In total, six former MPs become Conservative peers, as does the party’s former deputy chairman Amanda Sater, and SafeLives charity founder Diana Barran. But former Chancellor George Osborne was snubbed. Ex-MP William McCrea, of the DUP , which props up Mrs May’s minority administration, also becomes a peer. The move came after Mrs May was humiliated by 15 Brexit defeats in the un-elected Chamber, where she does not have a majority. Labour was given three new peerages: former party general secretary Iain McNicol, veteran campaign Martha Osamor, mother of Shadow International Development Secretary Kate Osamor, and author Pauline Bryan. Electoral Reform Society Chief Executive Darren Hughes accused the PM of hiding the announcement “behind the euphoria of a Royal Wedding ”.

Robert McLeod lived \u0027off grid’ at St James Bay, 22 miles northwest of the Alaskan capital Juneau, where he was the only full-time resident.  It is believed the former soldier died from natural causes, according to the Daily Record .  After leaving school at age 14, McLeod worked as a gamekeeper before opting for a career in the military, spending two years in the Marines and also became a champion boxer. Robert, who was born in Dunblane, had lived in the United States after moving there with his American-born wife, Mary, in 1970. The couple had four sons together Roderick, Kevin, Sean and Brian who were all born in Scotland but spent most of their lives living in California. McLeod moved to Alaska in 1975 following his divorce and moved from California to work on the Alaska Pipeline.  Eventurally he moved to St. James Bay in the early 1980s. He was known as the unofficial caretaker of the small St. James Bay community, a group of six cabins split up from what was once a 200-plus acre homestead. His son Sean, 52, paid tribute to his father and described him as the `Laird of St James Bay\u0027. “My father was a man with a strong body, strong will and amazingly sound mind,” Sean told the Observer. “Spending months by yourself in a remote cabin could drive some people mad but he liked the solitude and fresh air. He didn’t like the fact that he even had to go to town every six weeks or so for supplies. “He used to tell me `the world is too loud of a place for me – I was born 200 years too late.’” My father was a man with a strong body, strong will and amazingly sound mind,” Sean told the Observer. “Spending months by yourself in a remote cabin could drive some people mad but he liked the solitude and fresh air.

St George\u0027s Chapel, in Windsor, has been adorned with floral displays ahead of the couple tying the knot. The first pictures from inside the historic building show foliage, white peonies, white garden roses and other white blooms adorning the front of the organ loft, towering above the seats. The flowers were a favourite of Harry\u0027s late mum. A central arch will serve to frame the royal couple as a congregation of family, friends and well-wishers watch them take their vows. Follow live royal wedding updates here.  Two large arrangements also sit either side of the High Altar in the Windsor Castle chapel. The display, which also features foxgloves with branches of beech, birch and hornbeam, also extends to outside the chapel, lining the West Steps and surrounding the West Door through which Meghan will enter the church. The display has been carefully crafted by floral designer Philippa Craddock.  This morning it was announced Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will be known as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex as the prince prepares to marry his American bride in a glittering ceremony watched around the world by millions. The Queen\u0027s grandson, who is sixth in line to the throne, will pledge to love, comfort, honour and protect the former actress as they become husband and wife in the historic surrounds of St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor Castle. Hours before the ceremony, Buckingham Palace announced that Harry has been given a dukedom - the highest rank in the British peerage - and Meghan will become Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Sussex.  Harry also received Scottish and Northern Irish titles, becoming the Earl of of Dumbarton and Baron Kilkeel, which means Meghan will become the Countess of Dumbarton and Baroness Kilkeel. Tens of thousands of royal fans have begun to descend on the Berkshire town to catch a glimpse of the bride and groom, as police have effectively created a ring of steel around the castle in a massive security operation. Passengers on the first train out of London Waterloo to Windsor included four women who work as cabin crew for a Canadian airline who said they wanted to be part of history. It\u0027s a once in a lifetime opportunity. We are sending our love from Canada, Cara Bonhage added.  Weather forecasters are expecting wall-to-wall sunshine, meaning the newlywed couple will be able to ride through Windsor town centre in the open top Ascot landau for their carriage procession. Some 250 members of the armed forces will take part in the pomp and ceremony of the celebrations, with regiments closely connected to former soldier Harry lining the streets. Meghan will emerge from the hour-long televised ceremony, which begins at noon, as an HRH and a member of the British royal family after saying her vows.  On Friday evening, a relaxed-looking Harry said he felt great as he greeted well-wishers in a surprise walkabout with best man the Duke of Cambridge outside Windsor Castle. The pair then headed to exclusive Coworth Park country house hotel in Ascot, where the prince was spending his last night as a single man away from his bride as is tradition. Meanwhile 15 miles away, Meghan gave a radiant smile and said she was feeling wonderful as she arrived with her mother Doria Ragland at the luxury Cliveden House Hotel in Taplow, Berkshire. Around 30 members of the royal family including the Queen and the 96-year-old Duke of Edinburgh, who is well enough to attend after undergoing a recent hip operation, will gather in the 600-strong congregation.  The Archbishop of Canterbury, who will marry Harry and Meghan, has spoken of the strong bond the couple share. There\u0027s profound affection between them which is wonderful and a deep understanding and mutual support, he said. You see in the way they respond to each other, caring for each other, which is something you see in many couples but not always. As the Order of Service was published on the morning of the wedding, it revealed Harry will wear a ring - not a given for royal men - and Meghan will not promise to obey her husband in the vows.  The moving, soul classic Stand By Me by Ben E King will be performed by Karen Gibson and The Kingdom Choir, with the gospel singers also delivering Etta James\u0027 uplifting version of Amen/This Little Light of Mine - a favourite in African-American churches. The presiding bishop of the American Episcopal Church Bishop, Michael Curry will give the address. Celebrities including Meghan\u0027s former Suits co-stars Patrick J. Adams and Gabriel Macht are expected to be among the guests, along with the couple\u0027s trusted inner circle of friends. The Prince of Wales will take on the role of the absent father of the bride Thomas Markle, and walk his future daughter-in-law through the Quire up the altar to meet her groom.  There will be sadness amid the joy for Meghan with her father missing her big day. The reclusive former TV lighting director will be thousands of miles away in Mexico after pulling out of attending on medical advice with just two days to go after undergoing heart surgery. Harry too will be thinking of his late mother Diana, Princess of Wales, who died in car crash when he was 12. He has invited her three siblings, Earl Spencer, Lady Sarah McCorquodale and Lady Jane Fellowes, as a way of honouring her. Lady Jane is giving a reading.  Meghan will leave her country hotel with her mother to be driven to Windsor Castle, giving the first glimpse of the bride in her wedding gown. She will walk through the Nave of the stunning chapel on her own, followed by a procession of bridesmaids and pageboys, before meeting Charles at the start of the Quire. William, whose children Prince George and Princess Charlotte will be among the young helpers, will be supporting his younger brother Harry at the altar. The Duchess of Cambridge will be there, making her first public appearance since giving birth to her third child Prince Louis less than four weeks ago.

A white British teenager, dressed in a sari, injured, distressed, her body covered in cuts and bruises. She had been dumped on the Pennine moors in the middle of the night and told to walk home.  Distraught and terrified, she instead made for the Rochdale Crisis Intervention Team’s office to wait for Sara Rowbotham to arrive at work. That was just one harrowing memory from Sara’s 10 years as an NHS sexual health worker in the town where she uncovered evidence of horrific sex abuse being perpetrated against dozens of girls by older Asian men. Her hard work won Sara and her team a Special Recognition honour at the NHS Heroes Awards, brought to you by ITV and the Mirror, which will be screened on Monday.  The Rochdale abuse scandal shone a light on other towns and cities and helped expose other child grooming rings in Telford and Aylesbury. But while Sara is pleased victims are now taken seriously, she says still more needs to be done. She says: “I think every area in the country now has a strategy, a procedure, a dedicated team, so lots of investment has been put into this. Everyone is more aware. “But at the same time I saw a story in the local paper a few months ago where a 12-year-old girl was walking down the street in a state of distress. “Some people came out to make sure she was okay – she was upset because her boyfriend had finished with her. But her boyfriend was 25 and he had groomed her online. So it hasn’t stopped, has it? And the prevention techniques that have been used haven’t stopped that 12-year-old from becoming involved with that perpetrator.”  Tackling the predators should be the main priority, she says. “All they ever talk about is making children and young women resilient to the pressures. They don’t talk about why the hell aren’t we making these men pack it in? “What are we doing to change their attitude and stop their behaviour? Where is the prevention around that? “I don’t think long sentences are deterrent enough. We are still in an environment where predatory men are seeking out children.” For years, Sara and her team banged on the doors of police and social services trying to get help for the girls and action against the men who preyed on them. In 2012, nine men were finally convicted for grooming young girls after an investigation had found more than 40 girls across Rochdale had been targeted and groomed at takeaways in the area.  Some girls were raped by several men, one after another, or taken in taxis to locations across the North of England, plied with drugs and alcohol, and raped. Some of the girls got pregnant. One, aged just 13, had an abortion. Fighting back tears, Sara says: “Those girls had so much potential. What makes me so upset is that I watched them deteriorate because of the terrible abuse they suffered. They could have achieved whatever they wanted, but they didn’t. “Now some of them have substance addictions, severe mental health problems, have had their own children taken into care. What happened to them impacted on their entire futures.” Sara, now 51, had set up the Crisis Intervention Team in 2003, and very quickly realised that Rochdale had a problem with child sexual exploitation. She says: “The first girl who was referred to the team was described as performing sex acts for free to year 10 boys in school hours. “By the time she was about 14 she started to make disclosures about situations she was involved in, like going to parties, taking other girls, getting really drunk, having sex with multiple people at parties, sometimes she would be given money, sometimes she wouldn’t.  “That group of girls got bigger and we were concerned about all of them. “But then, completely separate to that, we met another group of girls who started to say similar names of men. We started to piece things together. It was very rare that a young person would come in and say they had been sexually assaulted or exploited.” The BBC drama, Three Girls, showed how Sara, who was played by Maxine Peake, and her team compiled lists of names, and started to flag up their concerns to police and social services. But their reports fell on deaf ears, as shown in the drama, which also starred Liv Hill, Lisa Riley and Molly Windsor, who won the Leading Actress TV BAFTA last Sunday for her portrayal of one victim. Sara made more than 180 referrals to police and social services, but little or no action was taken. She says: “It just became a case of batting the ball back and forwards. Sometimes social services would do an initial assessment and that was it, sometimes the police would take information for intelligence, but that was it.” "},{"url":null,"title":"james hewitt prince harry rumours","story":"NewsThe truth behind THOSE James Hewitt rumours as they resurface ahead of Prince Harry\u0027s weddingRumours that James Hewitt fathered Prince Harry during his affair with Princess Diana have persisted for decades - here\u0027s what he\u0027s had to say\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByRoss Logan20:21, 18 MAY 2018Updated23:42, 18 MAY 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailWith Prince Harry\u0027s wedding to US actress Meghan Markle dominating the news, the scurrilous rumours about his parentage have surfaced once again. Dozens of social media users each day have pointed out the similarity behind ginger Prince Harry and his late mum\u0027s one-time lover, Major James Hewitt. Mr Hewitt prefers to keep out of the public eye nowadays, but has spoken out twice in the past to categorically deny being the real father of Prince Harry. During a frank and candid television interview last year, he was asked directly if he was Harry\u0027s father. Hewitt replied: No, I\u0027m not.  Pressed over why the rumours have persisted for so long, he said: It sells papers. It\u0027s worse for him [Harry] probably, the poor chap.  Hewitt began a secret affair with Diana in 1986 - which was two years after Harry, now aged 32, was born. Despite this fact, gossip mongers have continued to speculate over who Harry\u0027s father really is, given the resemblance between red-haired Hewitt and the Prince. In 2002, Hewitt told the Sunday Mirror: There really is no possibility whatsoever that I am Harry\u0027s father. I can absolutely assure you that I am not. Admittedly the red hair is similar to mine, and people say we look alike. I have never encouraged these comparisons and although I was with Diana for a long time, I must state once and for all that I\u0027m not Harry\u0027s father. When I met Diana, he was already a toddler.  It is understood Prince Charles also reassured the young Harry that he was his biological father before he started school at Eton in 1998. Supporters of Diana, including her former butler Paul Burrell, have previously spoken out in a bid to quash the rumours. And Diana’s former police bodyguard Ken Wharfe, also denied the rumours, writing: “The malicious rumours that still persist about the paternity of Prince Harry used to anger Diana greatly. “The nonsense should be scotched here and now. Harry was born on 15 September, 1984. “Diana did not meet James until the summer of 1986, and the red hair, gossips so love to cite as proof is, of course, a Spencer trait.” Hewitt and Diana began seeing each other around the same time Prince Charles was said to have begun an affair with Camilla Parker Bowles, now his second wife and the Duchess of Cornwall.  Hewitt defended his romance with the Princess, saying he could be forgiven for falling in love with her because it was so easy. Their affair was exposed five years after it started, shortly after Hewitt, a former tank commander, had served in the first Gulf War. Nowadays, the 59-year-old lives as a recluse in Dorset, but said he has no regrets about falling in love with the People\u0027s Princess. No, I don\u0027t regret that, he said last year I regret some of the things that have been caused by that but not that at all. No way.

The couple shared their touching \u0027balcony moment\u0027 after getting married in a beautiful ceremony at St George\u0027s Chapel, in Windsor. The newlyweds sealed their vows with a smooch as the cheering public waited outside for the happy couple. Church bells rang as the beaming bride and her new husband walked hand in hand. Gently tilting her head upwards, Meghan puckered up and smiled as Prince Harry planted a loving kiss on her lips. During the service, the emotional groom told Meghan you look amazing, I missed you as he saw her in her wedding dress for the first time.  The groom, 33, smiled as his bride walked towards him. Meghan arrived accompanied by two pageboys who held up her train as she walked the chapel\u0027s steps alone. She wore a simple, long-sleeved white dress, with a veil covering her face. The royal bride entered the chapel by herself before being met by the Prince of Wales. Prince Charles accompanied Meghan, 36, while best man Prince William supported his brother.  Meghan arrived at church for her marriage to Prince Harry wearing a stunning gown made by British designer Claire Waight Keller. The bride gave millions around the world the first full look at her spectacular dress as she emerged from a car outside the chapel just before midday. She smiled and waved to fans who had gathered to celebrate her wedding before going up the steps to the church. Her extensive veil, decorated with flowers representing all 53 countries of the Commonwealth, was carried by two of her pageboys. Meghan decided to walk the first part of the aisle solo accompanied by her six bridesmaids and page boys after her father Thomas Markle pulled out of the ceremony at the last minute.   Meghan spent her last night as an unmarried woman with her mum Doria Ragland at Cliveden House, roughly 10 miles from Windsor Castle.  Prince Harry stayed 15 miles away at Coworth Park with William. Harry and Meghan announced their engagement to a flurry of excitement in November 2017, just days after Harry had popped the question over roast chicken.

But there is one traditional promise Meghan Markle will not be making to her husband - to obey.  She\u0027s not the first royal to leave this part out of her vows - and her mother-in-law Princess Diana did the same when she married Charles back in 1981.  However she didn\u0027t start a tradition as other royal brides since, including Sarah Ferguson, decided to leave it in. But Kate Middleton wasn\u0027t having any of it and she, like many other modern brides, cut obey from her promise.  Another modern twist on the vows is that they will refer to each other as husband and wife, rather than man and wife.  The couple will also refer to each other as Harry and Meghan, the names they are known by rather than their given names - Henry and Rachel.  Apart from their names, Harry and Meghan\u0027s vows are identical.  Harry will promise:   I Harry, take you, Meghan, to be my wife, to have and to hold from this day forward for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, till death do us part according to God\u0027s holy law.

It was thought Thomas Markle c ould receive his own family coat of arms as a special wedding gift . While Kensington Palace and the College of Arms declined to comment on the present, courtiers said it is a tradition unlikely not to be followed. The fathers of the Duchess of Cambridge and Sophie, the Duchess of Wessex, both received the gift when their daughters married into the royal family.  However the decision means Meghan\u0027s relations, who have been outspoken in the lead up to the royal wedding , will not be able to boast their own coat of arms, according to the Daily Mail . A source at the College of Arms told the newspaper: Mr Markle will not have his own coat of arms. We were told it would be too \u0027complicated\u0027.  Instead, the Mail claims Meghan will be given her own coat of arms, following the example of the Duchess of Gloucester, Birgitte van Deurs, who married the Duke of Gloucester, a cousin of the Queen, in 1972. For anyone to be given the distinctive heraldic bearing, they need to prove they have an ancestor who was a subject of the Crown. Mr Markle\u0027s ancestors include Mary Smith, a maid who was recorded in 1856 as working at Windsor Castle, where Meghan will be married in May.  After the family receive their coat of arms, Meghan, 36, and Prince Harry, 33, can get their own “conjugal coat of arms.  They are likely to be officially unveiled a few years after they marry. William and Kate’s made its debut in September 2013, just over two years after their April 2011 wedding.

Meghan Markle and her mother Doria Ragland beamed with happiness as they arrived at luxury Cliveden House Hotel to spend the night before the royal wedding together. A relaxed Meghan told fans outside she was feeling “wonderful”. And while the proud mother-of-the bride also looked composed, she must have been pinching herself after three whirlwind days that took her from her modest Los Angeles home to the \u0026shygrandeur of Windsor Castle. Doria, 61, a “free-spirited” yoga teacher and social worker had just had tea with the Queen – her future son-in-law’s granny – and Prince Philip.  On Wednesday she met Charles and Camilla at Clarence House before spending some time with William, Kate and children George, Charlotte and Louis. Tomorrow she will watch her only child Meghan, whom she calls “Flower”, marry a prince and become Her Royal \u0026shyHighness. It’s been a fairy tale ride for the mum and daughter who are so close they call themselves “best friends”. And tonight Doria has her daughter to herself one last time. Wearing a cream dress and black jacket with her dreadlocked hair tied back with a scarf, Doria waved to photographers as Cliveden House managers greeted them. Meghan, wearing a \u0026pound1,350 navy Roland Mouret Barwick dress, told waiting royal fans that she felt “wonderful, thank you”.  The pair were accompanied by a small team of trusted helpers who will prepare the bride for her appearance in front of a global television audience of millions this morning. The pair are staying in a wing of the hotel and a small marquee has been erected over the entrance. Rooms there cost upwards of \u0026pound400 a night. As they arrived at the hotel, it was clear mother and daughter share a unique bond that will survive Meghan’s royal transformation. Harry’s mum had a fragile relationship with her own mother, Frances Shand-Kydd, who walked out on her family when Diana was just eight. But after Meghan’s parents split, when she was six, she grew even closer to her African-American mum, becoming kindred spirits. And their relationship was further strengthened by the vile race hate they faced in 1980s Los Angeles. Doria was born there, to an antique dealer father and a mother who was a nurse.  Her great-great-great grandfather was born into slavery and freed at the end of the Civil War in 1865 when he chose the surname “Wisdom”. Doria went to Fairfax High School, where she was remembered as the bright, friendly teenager with the Afro \u0026shyhairstyle who loved listening to Marvin Gaye and eating at a Mexican taco joint with pals. She began working as a make-up artist in \u0026shyHollywood where she met lighting director Thomas Markle. They wed in 1979 and Meghan was born two years later. The family moved into a house in The Valley, LA. But, talking about her background a year before she met Harry, Meghan revealed Doria was regularly mistaken for the hired help. “The neighbourhood was leafy and affordable,” Meghan said.    “What it was not, however, was diverse. And there was my mom, caramel in complexion with her light-skinned baby in tow, being asked where my mother was since they assumed she was the nanny.” When the couple divorced in 1987 Doria took a job as an air stewardess, meaning Meghan was frequently cared for by her father, whom she clearly still adores. Doria later returned to university and got a masters degree in social work after a BA in psychology. In 2003 the royal bride-to-be got her own degree in theatre and international studies. Doria also fostered Meghan’s social conscience – taking her to visit \u0026shydisadvantaged children in Rwanda, see the slums of Jamaica and experience poverty in Mexico when she was just 10. Harry has already grown close to his fun-loving future mother in law. Last September he flew Doria to Canada to join them at the Invictus Games – where he and Meghan made their love public – and was seen laughing with her at the closing ceremony.  He describes Doria as “amazing” and looks set to hit the dance floor with her at their evening reception. For in a post on her former lifestyle blog The Tig in 2014, Meghan summed up her mum’s personality. “Dreadlocks. Nose ring. Yoga instructor. Social worker. Free spirit. Lover of potato chips \u0026amp lemon tarts. “If the DJ cues Al Green’s soul classic Call Me, just forget it, she will swivel her hips into the sweetest little dance... swaying her head and snapping her fingers to the beat like she’s been dancing since the womb. “And you will smile. You won’t be able to help it. You will look at her and you will feel joy.” Tomorrow Doria will be the one smiling with joy as she drives to St George’s Chapel, Windsor, in another grand royal car with Meghan. And she will be tapping her foot as a gospel choir sings Ben E King’s hit Stand By Me during the unconventional royal wedding ceremony. Doria will continue to stand by Meghan as she begins her new life. But their special bond means Her Royal Highness will always be “Flower” to her mum.

Instead Meghan will be escorted by the Prince of Wales. I have known Harry since he was born and I imagine he wanted his father to be included. But it is a little strange – and I was confused. Wouldn’t it have been wonderful to see Doria Ragland walk her daughter down the aisle of St George’s Chapel? A show of strong solidarity. After all Queen Victoria escorted two of her daughters.  But I am not surprised it’s not the case. I can almost see courtiers frowning at the thought – because that isn’t protocol, that’s not how it is done. Meghan will have to get used to this grinding of the Royal Protocol Machine. Diana knew only too well you can’t fight them. She would have told Meghan, “You can’t win everything.

She arrived as her parents Carole and Michael entered the chapel alongside celebrities from around the world. The Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s sister is reportedly due to give birth sometime in October. Today she wore a green and lilac dress and floral fascinator alongside husband James Matthews. The dress was a \u0026pound495 creation by The Fold. It was a similar colour to that worn by her mother. Pippa was earlier spotted leaving Kensington in west London earlier this morning for the journey west.  It was reported last week the 34-year-old, who married James Matthews in her own May wedding last year, has been left off the invite list for the wedding reception, which will take place after the ceremony. Insiders say Harry\u0027s ex-girlfriend Chelsy Davy will also miss out on the evening soiree at Frogmore House. Instead, both she and Pippa will be sent home after the formal nuptials take place in Windsor Castle.  Last month it was reported Pippa Middleton and her husband, financier James Matthews, are expecting there first child together. The couple shared the news with friends and family members, including Middleton’s big sister Kate Middleton, Duchess of Cambridge, according to reports. The couple exchanged vows back in May 2017 at a lavish ceremony at St Mark\u0027s Church, in London, attended by about 150 guests.  Before marrying, Pippa, a party-planning author, and Matthew dated briefly in 2012. A split resulted in Pippa going on to date Nico Jackson for about three years, but when that relationship ended, Middleton and Matthews officially reconnected.   The couple\u0027s baby news came one day before Kate Middleton gave birth to her third child with Prince William. Kensington Palace announced the arrival of Prince Louis on April 23.

The ginger prince is working a lot of facial hair at the moment, and many people wanted him to get rid of it all ahead of the big day. However the groom wasn\u0027t having any of it and decided to keep it as it is. People on social media have slammed his decision, saying he isn\u0027t allowed to have it while dressed in an Army uniform. But they\u0027re wrong.  As he is no longer a serving officer, Harry doesn\u0027t have to comply with the regulations. The beard also caused a big row in November when he wore a full beard with a uniform of a senior Blues and Royals officer uniform at the Remembrance Day service. British Army rules forbid all beards, except in a few rare circumstances, such as when a soldier is suffering from a skin complaint, or has strong religious reasons for retaining facial hair.          Sikhs are not allowed to cut their own hair, and can thus retain their beards while in uniform, for example. Special Forces or others on covert operations are also permitted to grow beards when behind enemy lines, but they would not wear them on parade. There is also a tradition that allows a very small number of Pioneer Sergeants to wear a beard when on official duty, but members of the Queen’s personal guard have never been allowed to do so   The Queen , Harry’s grandmother, is Colonel-in-Chief of the Blues and Royals, while the Colonel of the Regiment is Princess Anne, his aunt.  It is one of the two cavalry regiments of the Household Cavalry – the other is the Life Guards – and can trace its history back to Oliver Cromwell’s New Model Army of the 17th Century. Throughout the centuries, officers have been known for their clean-cut appearances, although some occasionally grew moustaches and connected side-whiskers, especially when serving in Muslim countries.  The Royal Navy – in which Harry ’s father, Prince Charles, served – has always been allowed beards, but officers are told to shave them off it they are not full enough.

In the same way Prince William and Kate Middleton were given a royal dukedom on their wedding morning, Harry and Meghan have been given a similar honour. Their title means the new form of address for both is Their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. The Queen has also conferred a Dukedom on Prince Henry of Wales. His titles will be Duke of Sussex, Earl of Dumbarton and Baron Kilkeel. As when Kate Middleton got married, Meghan does officially become a princess today - but not in her own right. She will be HRH Princess Henry of Wales.   An official statement from Kensington Palace read: The Queen has today been pleased to confer a Dukedom on Prince Henry of Wales. His titles will be Duke of Sussex, Earl of Dumbarton and Baron Kilkeel. Prince Harry thus becomes His Royal Highness The Duke of Sussex, and Ms. Meghan Markle on marriage will become Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Sussex.  There has never previously been a Duchess of Sussex. The first Duke of Sussex was an eccentric son of King George III and his two marriages were deemed illegal. Prince Augustus Frederick was born in 1773 and died 1843 - and lived in Kensington Palace, which is also Meghan and Harry\u0027s home. Augustus was sent abroad and married Lady Augusta Murray - whom he called Goosy - in secret in Rome in 1793. But the marriage was declared void by George III, who had not given his approval. It was later annulled on the grounds that it contravened the Royal Marriages Act 1772. The prince became the Duke of Sussex in 1801. But Lady Augusta, from whom he separated the same year, did not become the Duchess of Sussex. She called herself princess and demanded a peerage, but never received one. Earl of Dumbarton is a title that has strong military connections. The first to hold the title was George Douglas, a younger son of the first Marquess of Douglas, who was created Earl of Dumbarton in 1675.  A Scottish nobleman and soldier, George was given the title by Charles II in recognition of his military service. When James VII of Scots (James II of England) came to the throne in 1685, the earl was made military commander in Scotland, and it is thought that when the King was deposed, George accompanied him to his court in exile in France.  On George\u0027s death at St German-en-Laye in France, the title passed to his son, also called George, who became the second Earl of Dumbarton. The title became extinct when the second earl died in 1749, meaning it has not been used in more than 260 years. It means that Prince Harry becomes the third to hold the Scottish title, and on marriage, Meghan will become Countess of Dumbarton. Dumbarton is on the north bank of the River Clyde, to the west of Glasgow.

Will she or won\u0027t she? To promise to obey in the vows shows tradition, humility, that a bride will submit to her husband and at no point bother herself with either a dictionary or a lawyer. To omit the word indicates that dread word feminism, the even-more dread word feisty, and also regular rows which, frankly, are in every marriage regardless of who said what. So brace yourselves, tomorrow, to hear Nicholas Witchell\u0027s opinion that was to be expected, Meghan is a very different kind of Royal, but Diana never promised to obey Charles and we all know how THAT ended, don\u0027t we Huw.  It seems like every day we await the Royal wedding is another episode of the Markle Debacle, in which things do not run according to what you\u0027d expect the palace\u0027s plans to be, and therefore a little more like a normal wedding peppered with infighting, drinking and outcast relatives. The latest mismanaged news is that the bride\u0027s father, who was going to walk her down the aisle then decided he was too embarrassing then said he would and then said he was too ill and now appears to be in hospital, is not going to do it after all. Prince Charles is going to do it instead, perhaps because if there is any role he feels comfortable in it is that of an historical anachronism. But for reasons that no-one can quite fathom he\u0027s only going to walk her halfway, with the bride abandoning her mother a the door of the church and doing the first 100 yards on her own and Chuck picking her up halfway, like a last-minute pint of milk. There are three reasons for all the confusion: the Markles all seem to hate each other, the Windsors hate each other as well as everyone else, and Meghan Markle is an independent, feminist, career woman marrying into a family where she cannot be any of those things. Of COURSE the wedding is a mess.  But therein lies any marriage\u0027s biggest risk: change. It\u0027s something that\u0027s inevitable over the course of a lifetime but most of us are resistant when asked to do it in a day. When the change is moving house, a joint bank account, or parenthood it\u0027s bad enough - imagine changing every single thing about yourself, in order to join a family that refuses, under any circumstances, to change. The Meghan we were introduced to after news broke of her romance with Harry was fun. An early starter marriage, some handsome ex-boyfriends, a role in a plot-free legal drama and social media accounts that made her accessible. We saw pictures of her drinking wine, cuddling her dogs, hanging out with celebrity friends in celebrity haunts doing celebrity things. Actual photographs of her with her father, which now seems like the last we\u0027ll ever see of THAT . Meghan the charity campaigner, Meghan the Trump-loather, Meghan who smiled because she had a nice life. And as soon as Harry and her were an item it stopped. Social media accounts were closed, all socialising was done behind closed doors, the acting and endorsements ended and one of her dogs was even abandoned with friends in Canada. She\u0027s had two trips to the supermarket nearest Kensington Palace and soon stopped doing that when she was photographed picking up a loaf of bread. Some change on the part of any Royal in-law is obviously necessary - learning protocol, lowering the hemlines, being camera-ready. But what, exactly, is Harry changing in return?  Well, presumably strip billiards, racist videos and swastika parties are now off the table. But they had been put behind him anyway, so don\u0027t really count. There have been reports he\u0027s started drinking green smoothies and going to the gym, but anyone will tell you that won\u0027t last. And there is nothing else - not one single thing - that will change for Harry as a result of being married. Yes, he\u0027ll get a wife. Maybe children. But the richer, for poorer part of the vows will forever be a private joke, his work-life balance will stay the same and the chances are he\u0027ll still be shooting birds at Sandringham on Boxing Day until, and perhaps even beyond, the point he\u0027s in a wheelchair. Meghan will learn to bow and scrape, to curtsey and hide, speak through others rather than for herself and to not put on a single ounce in weight. Harry will not learn how to deal with her family, as even now they\u0027re almost all being kept locked outside the palace gates. There is no indication he\u0027ll ever meet her father, as news of it would be on a showbiz website before the text message finished its ping. His brother William managed to blend two families together when he married. Granted, the Markles are more likely than the Middletons to steal the spoons and trip over a corgi, but the entire point of marriage is taking the rough with the smooth.  It\u0027s normal to sacrifice things when you marry. Most of us are lucky if we can limit it to sanity. But Meghan seems to have sacrificed almost everything about what and who she is, while her husband has sacrificed... biscuits? The second slice of cake? How every noble of him. Meghan could, and may still be, a modernising and humanising influence on the monarchy. Much will be made of her being able to squeeze Ben E. King and Etta James songs into the wedding music. But all her independence seems, on marriage to the Royals, have been boiled down to two songs off the iPod and some finger food. Of all that we know about Meghan before marriage - AM, if you like - that is all that remains. Meghan post-marriage may still have political opinions but is forbidden from uttering them, will still have relatives but never again speak to most of them, and when we see her smile it will be because she\u0027s on camera, and not necessarily because she\u0027s enjoying herself. Yesterday she drove to her wedding rehearsal in \u0026pound7,000 diamond earrings, and how many of those would it take for YOU to be happy as the junior partner in YOUR marriage?

Elizabeth II made her way to St George\u0027s Chapel, in Windsor, ahead of her grandson\u0027s hotly-anticipated nuptials. The 92-year-old monarch looked typically elegant in a lime green dress and hat. Prince Philip, 96, was pictured earlier this month for the time since he left King Edward VII\u0027s Hospital, in London, on April 13, following a hip operation. He walked into the chapel unaided. Their arrival came shortly after Prince Charles and Camilla arrived at the chapel. Camilla sported a large pink-coloured hat.  Philip attended the Royal Windsor Horse Show on May 11, which is held in the private grounds of Windsor Castle. But the elderly royal did not leave the Range Rover in which he was seated, choosing to remain in the driver\u0027s seat and watch the show through binoculars. The Queen was all smiles at the show and royal aides said they hoped Prince Philip would be at the wedding.  On May 4, Kensington Palace said Harry, 33, would be supported at the ceremony by his grandmother, his dad Prince Charles and his brother Prince William, who is his best man. But when asked if his grandfather Philip would be attending, an aide said: We very much hope so, adding that Buckingham Palace staff would have guidance on that closer to the time. The Queen looked splendid as she led the Windsors into Westminster Abbey for Prince William and Kate Middleton\u0027s wedding in 2011.  Adding a splash of colour to proceedings, she wore an Angela Kelly-designed single crepe wool primrose dress with hand-sewn beading at the neck in the shape of sunrays. Over this, she wore a matching double crepe wool tailored primrose coat. Angela Kelly designed the Queen\u0027s matching hat too, which was handmade with silk roses and apricot-coloured leaves. The Queen also wore Queen Mary\u0027s True Lovers Knot diamond brooch.

Royal Zara Tindall was among many inside St George\u0027s Chapel at Windsor who looked a little surprised as Bishop Curry went to work. We\u0027re going to sit down, we gotta get y\u0027all married! he told Prince Harry and Meghan Markle and their wedding guests. Later he said: Two young people fell in love and we all showed up. As he got into full swing, Sky News journalist Mark Austin said: Lovely moment as the preacher takes the Royals to the edge of their comfort zone  BBC presenter Jeremy Vine said: The preacher is doing 50 in a 30 zone and it\u0027s brilliant. Bishop Curry, 65, is the presiding bishop of the American Episcopal Church.  Bishop Curry is based in Raleigh, North Carolina, - but today he went global. Giving an address titled the Power of Love at the service, the Chicago native opened his energetic speech with the words of Martin Luther King, a devout Christian whose faith shaped his struggle against racial injustice in the US, hailing his views on love as right. We must discover the power of love, the redemptive power of love. And when we discover that, we will be able to make of this old world a new world. Love is the only way, Bishop Curry quoted.      US ABC News anchor T.J. Holmes said: I\u0027m from West Memphis ... and my wedding wasn\u0027t even this black. I\u0027ve learned in my life that anytime a black pastor says I\u0027m wrapping up ... you should get comfortable. But take your time, Mr. Curry. I\u0027m loving this. Radio 1 DJ Matt Edmondson said: SOMEONE GIVE THIS MAN HIS OWN TV SHOW IMMEDIATELY.        Pop star Danni Minogue said: Windsor is waiting. Piers Morgan tweeted: OK, Rev... you need to wrap. One royal reporter noted: This is brilliant from Bishop Curry - some amazing facial expressions all around! Ed Miliband tweeted: Rev Michael Curry could almost make me a believer.      Princess Beatrice and Eugenie were both also seen smiling. We\u0027re going to sit down, we gotta get y\u0027all married! The Mirror reported last week how Bishop Curry is to march on the White House against Donald Trump four days after the wedding today. Bishop Curry will join a Washington protest over what he calls the president’s “dangerous” leadership.     The first African-American to be primate of the Episcopal Church – a US offshoot of the Church of England – he has branded Trump’s America First policy “a theological heresy for the followers of Christ”. And the Most Rev Bishop Curry has also previously blasted a “crisis of moral and political leadership at the highest levels of our government”.     His invitation came months after the Royal Family confirmed Mr Trump would not be invited to the wedding. Described as a stunning preacher by Archbishop Justin Welby the 65-year-old certainly grabs your attention. The bishop, from Chicago, has previously backed gay marriage and transgender rights. In his autobiography he revealed his parents were descended from slaves and sharecroppers.   He was ordained as a deacon in June 1978. He became the first black presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church in 2015.  The Episcopal bishop\u0027s role in the service today was seen as a nod to the actress\u0027s US roots as she married into the British royal family.  Meghan was born in Los Angeles, California, to an African-American mother and was baptised into the Anglican Church ahead of her wedding to Prince Harry. The Episcopal Church is the US offshoot of the Church of England and forms part of the broader Anglican Communion. The bishop\u0027s words rose in a passionate crescendo as he spoke of the link between love and the divine, his style a stark contrast to the sober delivery of the Archbishop of Canterbury, who was officiating.For the royal family, the animated performance would be a departure from the type of sermons they normally see at church services.   The wide-ranging address cited love as the key to curing global problems such as poverty.  Love can help and heal when nothing else can. There\u0027s power in love to lift up and liberate when nothing else will. Such power could be seen in the service, he continued, saying: Two young people fell in love and we all showed up. In a moment of light self-deprecation, Bishop Curry noted he had to soon sit down, gesturing to the couple and adding we need to get y\u0027all married. The ideas of French thinker Pierre Teilhard de Chardin were called upon as the bishop brought his address to a powerful conclusion.

Gospel group The Kingdom Choir will perform the singer’s Stand By Me, along with Etta James’s version of Amen/This Little Light of Mine. And the couple’s modern spin on a royal wedding also takes in very contemporary vows. Meghan will not promise to “obey” when she marries her prince today at St George’s Chapel in Windsor, and the couple will be pronounced as “husband and wife” rather than “man and wife”. They will also refer to each other as “Harry” and “Meghan” as they say their vows, using the names they are known by rather than their given names – and not including middle or surnames. However, there will still be nods to royal tradition, with classical pieces being played while their 600 guests are taking their seats and a rendition of the national anthem at the end.  And there is a poignant tribute to Harry’s tragic mum Princess Diana with the inclusion of the hymn Guide Me, O Thou Great Redeemer – which was played at her 1997 funeral. William and Kate also included the hymn at their 2011 wedding. A spokesman said Harry and Meghan have “taken a great deal of care in selecting all elements for their service”. He added: “This has been a collaborative effort led by Prince Harry and Ms Markle. They have also sought the advice of the Prince of Wales for the orchestral music before the service begins.” The five organ pieces and seven orchestral pieces that will be played as guests arrive include Ralph Vaughan Williams’s Fantasia on Greensleeves, which William and Kate also chose for their big day.  The orchestra, made up of musicians from the BBC National Orchestra of Wales, the English Chamber Orchestra and the Philharmonia, will also play pieces by Elgar and Holst. The bride will arrive to a fanfare from the trumpeters of the Household Cavalry then walk down the aisle – where she will be met halfway by Prince Charles – to the sound of Welsh soprano Elin Manahan Thomas singing Handel’s Eternal Source of Light Divine. An order of service to be given to the 600 guests has an introduction taken from Common Worship, which reads: “A wedding is one of life’s great moments, a time of solemn commitment as well as good wishes, feasting and joy.  “Marriage is intended by God to be a creative relationship, as his blessing enables husband and wife to love and support each other in good times and bad, and to share in the care and upbringing of children.” The 20-page service was printed before the couple knew Meghan’s dad Thomas would not be able to attend, so his name is included in the order.   The service they have chosen is from the Marriage Service from Common Worship and features contemporary language – using the word “you” instead of “thee” and “thou”, and offering the most flexibility in the choice of readings and prayers. While the couple are signing the register, 19-year-old cellist Sheku Kanneh-Mason will perform three pieces with the orchestra. Recent royal tradition has been for brides not to pledge to obey their husbands. Kate did not in 2011 and neither did Diana in 1981 when she married Charles. But the Queen and her sister Margaret did, as did the Countess of Wessex in 1999. Harry and Meghan wanted Diana’s family to play a role so her sister, Lady Jane Fellowes, will deliver a reading from the Song of Solomon, which stresses the strength and power of love. The service will be led by the Right Reverend David Conner, Dean of Windsor, and Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby will officiate as the couple say their vows.  They will also greet the Royal Family as they arrive at the Galilee Porch from 11.25am. Harry and best man William will arrive at 11.40am and greet charity guests outside before entering the chapel as the congregation stands. The Queen is the last to arrive before the bride and will be taken to her seat in the Quire. The chapel was closed to the public yesterday as last-minute preparations were made. London florist Philippa Craddock and her team were decorating the chapel with white roses, foxgloves and Meghan’s favourite peonies, as well as branches of birch, beech and hornbeam. Meanwhile, Windsor town centre was teaming with tourists and fans of the royals waving flags, many preparing to sleep out on the streets to get the best spots for the big day.  Barriers were in place along the procession route with crowds of up to 100,000 expected. Some 5,000 media workers from around the world will broadcast the celebrations to an estimated billion-strong audience. And police were creating a “ring of steel” around Windsor Castle in one of Thames Valley’s biggest operations to date. Armed officers and sniffer dogs have been patrolling the area. Metal barriers have been put up in the Berkshire town to prevent potential attackers from using vehicles, as in the terrorist atrocities committed on London Bridge and Westminster Bridge in the capital.  Police have even asked people not to throw confetti, tweeting: “Please do not throw confetti or any other items at any time during the day, particularly during the procession. “It poses a potential security risk and it’s a bit of a pain to clean up! We hope everyone enjoys the day.” "},{"url":null,"title":"royal wedding day 2018 live","story":"NewsRoyal Wedding Day 2018: Live updates as Meghan Markle and Prince Harry parade around Windsor after sealing love with kissThe bride arrived at church in a dress designed by Clare Waight Keller, which was made to represent all 53 countries of the Commonwealth\u0026nbspShareByNatalie EvansJoshua TaylorAssistant news editorUpdated13:33, 19 MAY 2018News\u0026nbspShareVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay nowMeghan Markle and Prince Harry are in a carriage procession around Windsor after being declared husband and wife.

The preface The Dean of Windsor reads: “In the presence of God, Father, Son and Holy Spirit,we have come together to witness the marriage of Henry Charles Albert David and Rachel Meghan, to pray for God’s blessing on them, to share their joy and to celebrate their love. “Marriage is a gift of God in creation through which husband and wife may know the grace of God. It is given that as man and woman grow together in love and trust, they shall be united with one another in heart, body and mind, as Christ is united with his bride, the Church. The gift of marriage brings husband and wife together in the delight and tenderness of sexual union and joyful commitment to the end of their lives. “It is given as the foundation of family life in which children are born and nurtured and in which each member of the family, in good times and in bad, may find strength, companionship and comfort, and grow to maturity in love. “Marriage is a way of life made holy by God and blessed by the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ with those celebrating a wedding at Cana in Galilee. Marriage is a sign of unity and loyalty which all should uphold and honour. It enriches society and strengthens community. “No one should enter into it lightly or selfishly but reverently and responsibly in the sight of almighty God. “Harry and Meghan are now to enter this way of life. They will each give their consent to the other and make solemn vows, and in token of this they will each give and receive a ring. “We pray with them that the Holy Spirit will guide and strengthen them, that they may fulfil God’s purposes for the whole of their earthly life together. All stand. Hymn: Lord of all Hopefulness Lord of all Hopefulness, Lord of all joy, Whose trust, ever child-like, no cares could destroy, Be there at our waking, and give us, we pray, Your bliss in our hearts, Lord, at the break of the day. Lord of all eagerness, Lord of all faith, Whose strong hands were skilled at the plane and the lathe, Be there at our labours, and give us, we pray, Your strength in our hearts, Lord, at the noon of the day. Jan Struther (1901–53) ‘Slane’, Traditional Irish Melody Declarations All remain standing as the Archbishop leads the Declarations: “First, I am required to ask anyone present who knows a reason why these persons may not lawfully marry, to declare it now.” The Archbishop says to the couple: “The vows you are about to take are to be made in the presence of God, who is judge of all and knows all the secrets of our hearts therefore if either of you knows a reason why you may not lawfully marry, you must declare it now.” The Archbishop says to the bridegroom: “Harry, will you take Meghan to be your wife? Will you love her, comfort her, honour and protect her, and, forsaking all others, be faithful to her as long as you both shall live?” He answers: “I will.” The Archbishop says to the bride: “Meghan, will you take Harry to be your husband? Will you love him, comfort him, honour and protect him, and, forsaking all others, be faithful to him as long as you both shall live? She answers: “I will”. The Archbishop says to the congregation: “Will you, the families and friends of Harry and Meghan, support and uphold them in their marriage now and in the years to come?” All answer: “We will”. The collect THE Archbishop invites the people to pray, silence is kept and he says the Collect: “God our Father, from the beginning you have blessed creation with abundant life. “Pour out your blessings upon Harry and Meghan, that they may be joined in mutual love and companionship, in holiness and commitment to each other. “We ask this through our Lord Jesus Christ your Son, who is alive and reigns with you, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever.

The flowers appear on the earth the time of singing has come, and the voice of the turtle-dove is heard in our land. “The fig tree puts forth its figs, and the vines are in blossom they give forth fragrance. “Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away. Set me as a seal upon your heart, as a seal upon your arm for love is strong as death, passion fierce as the grave. “Its flashes are flashes of fire, a raging flame. Many waters cannot quench love, neither can floods drown it. “If one offered for love all the wealth of one’s house, it would be utterly scorned.” If Ye Love Me All remain seated while the Choir of St George’s Chapel sing the Motet, If Ye Love Me.

And for those of you who won’t be at Harry and Meghan’s big bash, our itinerary takes in every special moment so you can feel as though you are. From early sightings of guests arriving and the first glimpses of the prince and his bride all the way through to their carriage ride as newlyweds, you can follow the day’s strict timetable. While toasting their health and happiness with some bubbly, naturally. 9AM Like Charlie’s arrival at the Chocolate Factory, there will be a frenzy as the lucky recipients of Harry and Meghan’s ‘golden tickets’ begin to gather inside the grounds of the 15th century Windsor Castle for their special ringside seats.  These 1,200 members of the public, specially selected because of their community work, or their triumph over adversity, include representatives of Harry’s charities. They will be joined by 200 schoolchildren as well as 1,240 members of the royal household. Although they are golden invites, they don’t quite get these guests all the way to the promised land. But no doubt they will be dolled up in their wedding finery and happy to witness Harry and Meghan’s big day from outside the Chapel’s walls. 9.30am to 11am It’s an early start for the 600 guests, who will begin to arrive at the castle’s Round Tower at 9.30am – so they will have begun preening at the crack of dawn to look their best for the cameras. Guests, rumoured to include the Beckhams and tennis star Serena Williams, will have first met at the Windsor Farm Shop, founded by the Duke of Edinburgh in 2001, where they will have security checks and show IDs.  They will then be put on coaches to go to St George’s Chapel, where they will enter through the South Door. They have been asked not to bring phones and bulky bags – or carry swords! The guest list is smaller than the 1,900 at Westminster Abbey for William and Kate’s big day in 2011. No doubt Harry and Meghan felt they would enjoy a more intimate occasion. Harry’s good pals Barack and Michelle Obama were not invited. It is thought the awkward etiquette of inviting them and not President Trump was behind the decision.  11.20am The royals begin to arrive, some by foot and others by car – expect Rolls-Royces and Bentleys – and will enter by the Galilee Porch. Stand by to gossip about Beatrice and Eugenie’s fashion choices, especially their headgear.  It is also hoped Prince Philip will be able to attend after his recent hip operation. Protocol decrees the Queen is the last guest to arrive, just before the bride herself. Prince Edward married Sophie, Countess of Wessex, in St George’s Chapel in June 1999. And Harry was christened there in 1984.    11.45AM Brace yourself for whoops and applause as Harry and brother Prince William, his best man, arrive on foot at the chapel’s West Steps, purposefully striding past the hordes invited into the castle grounds. At this stage Harry will have the chance to welcome his charity representatives, gathered in the Horseshoe Cloister at the bottom of the steps.  No doubt his usual cheeky grin will belie a few nerves. William will possibly be relieved not to be centre stage this time round, but perhaps a little nervous about delivering his best man’s speech. Harry memorably called him ‘the dude’ in his own best man’s speech on William and Kate’s big day. Hopefully William returns the compliment. Harry’s long-term pals, ushers Tom Inskip and Guy Pelly, will welcome them inside.  11.55AM This is the Queen’s moment to arrive at the castle, just minutes before Meghan. There will be the usual jostle to see Her Majesty.  Always stunning in bright outfits, she is likely to be applauded nearly as loudly as the bride. 11.59AM Expect a roar to raise the castle turrets as Ms Markle arrives at the castle’s West Steps with her bridesmaids and pageboys. She will have already journeyed with her mother Doria Ragland along the historic Long Walk, to the delight of crowds glued to its fringes.  When the car stops at the castle Meghan will be joined by her bridesmaids and pageboys before she enters the chapel via the Galilee Porch. Meghan will be walked down the aisle by Prince Charles after her own father, Thomas, was unable to be there after having heart surgery. The bridesmaids and pageboys will include Prince George and Princess Charlotte, plus Ivy Mulroney, four, the daughter of Meghan’s best friend, stylist Jessica Mulroney. 12-1PM St George’s Chapel will gently descend into quiet as the service finally begins. The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby will marry the couple. The Rt Rev David Conner, Dean of Windsor, will conduct the service.  The sermon is due to be delivered by The Most Reverend Michael Bruce Curry, 65, the presiding bishop of the American Episcopal Church.  The newly married couple will emerge afterwards on the West Steps, before they set off on their carriage procession through Windsor. 1.05PM The newlyweds may conduct a mini-walkabout with charity representatives before their open-top carriage moves past the crowds, waved off by close family on the chapel’s West Steps.  The procession will then travel along Castle Hill, High Street, Sheet Street, Kings Road, Albert Road and Long Walk for 25 minutes, before it returns to the castle where they will join their guests for the lunch reception at 1.30pm.  3.30PM The lunch and speeches at St George’s Hall are set to end, although 200 guests will remain at the castle to relax and refresh before the second, more intimate, reception hosted by Prince Charles at 7pm for close friends and family. The selection of the evening guests has not been without controversy with Sarah Ferguson, Duchess of York, reportedly upset not to be included. Even Pippa Middleton failed to get an invite, it is said. 7PM The evening reception will be hosted by Prince Charles at Frogmore House in the castle grounds.  You could spot Harry and Meghan leave to travel for dinner.

And EVERYONE picked up on it.          But there\u0027s a perfectly simple explanation for the vicar\u0027s words. This is a royal wedding after all. The inclusion of the words sexual union is all part and parcel of a Church of England wedding ceremony ans features in the preface (or opening prayers).      The gift of marriage brings husband and wife together in the delight and tenderness of sexual union and joyful commitment to the end of their lives. It is given as the foundation of family life in which children are [born and] nurtured and in which each member of the family,in good times and in bad, may find strength, companionship and comfort, and grow to maturity in love.

It\u0027s a bit much for me. I can respect the reason for them bringing it in but there are alarms and they could do random checks. I would be much more comfortable with that than seeing yourself on a screen. But if you haven\u0027t done anything wrong you haven\u0027t got anything to hide.

They will be known as Their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of Sussex , the Earl and Countess of Dumbarton and Baron and Baroness Kilkeel - catchy.  The Baroness Kilkeel is a brand new Irish title, but the other two have been used before. Prince Harry is only the second Duke of Sussex and the original was Prince Augustus Frederick. Born in 1773, Prince Augustus was university educated and campaigned for the abolition of slavery.  But he had a very difficult love life. Like Harry, he didn\u0027t marry for titles or rank but for love. He married twice, but his father George III didn\u0027t approve of either and ruled they were unlawful. He married his first wife Lady Augusta Murray in 1793 in Rome but his dad ruled it void using the Royal Marriages Act. This meant the couple\u0027s two children Augustus and Augusta were not considered heirs to his title.  They separated in 1801. Prince Augustus then married Lady Cecilia Letitia Buggin in 1831, but his father did exactly the same thing.  This means Meghan Markle will officially be the first Duchess of Sussex.  Harry and Meghan will tie the knot at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor Castle today. After the ceremony they will take a carriage ride around the town before heading back to the castle for two receptions.  Follow our live blog for all the details from the happy day.

Merryn Crofts, 21, weighed less than six stone and spent the last three years of her life totally bed-bound with severe ME - an incurable condition that affects 250,000 people in the UK. The youngster was unable to take more than two teaspoons of food before suffering immense gut pain and vomiting, a coroner was told. Merryn, from Rochdale, Greater Manchester. today became only the second person in the UK to have ME - myalgic encephalomyelitis - listed on a death certificate. Despite being classed as a real neurological disease, many think the condition is not real - some even within the medical profession. Merryn\u0027s mum, Clare Norton, sobbed as she told Rochdale Coroner\u0027s Court how her beautiful and energetic daughter was left wheelchair-bound and reliant on tube feeding.  She said: As a child, she was a bundle of energy. She didn\u0027t walk anywhere - she would hop, skip and jump. She was the kind of person that people gravitated towards. They wanted to be her friend. She was very social and loved drama. She was a total fashionista, a typical teenager. Her bedroom was a mess of clothes, hairspray and tan. But she was also stubborn and I think that helped her cope with her illness in a lot of ways. She never gave up. In August 2011, Merryn, then 15, was diagnosed with hives and swelling shortly after coming back from a family holiday in Mallorca. Tests in early 2012 revealed that at some point she had contracted glandular fever - a virus which can trigger ME. Despite dozens of medical appointments - including mental health checks for panic attacks - Merryn\u0027s condition deteriorated as she suffered breathing problems, exhaustion and excruciating hypersensitivity to touch, light and sound. She was eventually diagnosed with ME in the summer of 2012. The would-be theatre star, who was forced to wear an eye mask, also suffered from severe migraines, brain fog, slurred speech and persistent infections. Stomach problems, and problems swallowing, meant that her weight plummeted to just five-and-a-half stone.  Coroner Katherine McKenna was told that Merryn could take on just 100 calories a day because her gut was in so much pain, and that, by 2015, even two teaspoons of nutrients were intolerable. Merryn was eventually fitted with an intravenous nutrition line but suffered intestinal failure and was given a terminal diagnosis in 2016.. She died on May 23, 2017, just days after her 21st birthday. Mrs McKenna today concluded her cause of death as starvation caused by a withdrawal of supportive nutriition, caused by ME. She described Merryn as someone who bore her suffering with dignity and good grace. She said: Merryn had suffered with ME since 2012 which caused severe fatigue, gastointestinal failure, chronic pain, global hypersensitivity, loss of mobility and function. Despite extensive investigations no reason for her gastrointestinal failure which led to her reliance on supportive nutriton was found and it most likely it was caused by her ME. Mum Clare, who attended the inquest with daughter Amy Williams and Merryn\u0027s stepdad Dave Norton, told of her long-standing belief that ME contributed to her death. She said: With ME the key symptom is post-exertional malaise. That means if someone\u0027s energy is pushed beyond what they can tolerate, it will trigger all of their symptoms. The best advice we were given was for Merryn to do just 50% of what she felt capable of. But Merryn didn\u0027t even have 50% to give. She was always crashing, so everything that happened to her kept pushing her further behind.  Pathologist Daniel DuPlessis said that a post-mortem showed low-grade inflammation of nerve roots. It was suggested that this inflammation could have made her bowel hypersensitive to processing nutrients. Dr DuPlessis pointed out that Merryn had inflammation of the ganglia - gatekeepers to sensations in the brain. A post-mortem into the only other UK death attributed to ME, Sophia Mirza, 32, in 2006, also found ganglionitis. ME expert at Salford Royal hospital, Dr Annice Mukherjee, said she was convinced that the illness was responsible for triggering Merryn\u0027s intestinal failure. She said: I haven\u0027t come across a case of ME with life-threatening malnutrition before but I have come across many patients with severe ME that are bedbound that have global sensitivity issues and severe gut issues. But every single patient with ME is different, so I never see the same case twice. The ME Association is at the forefront of improving access to care, treatment and research and removing the disease\u0027s stigma. The charity today called for Merryn\u0027s death not to be in vain. A spokesman said: Firstly, the sympathies of the ME Association are with Merryn’s family today. We hope the result of this inquest provides some closure and allows them to cherish their memories of Merryn. It is essential that Merryn\u0027s untimely death is not overlooked and the urgent need for proper recognition of, and research into, ME is recognised. In our present state of knowledge, we don\u0027t know if ME can kill directly, but there are various consequences of having the illness that can increase the risk of early death. What we do know is this: ME is real. It’s devastating. It leaves people, at best, struggling to work. At worst, it leaves them enduring a tortuous existence, a living death, where they are unable to take their place in society.  One in four are so severely affected that they are housebound, bedbound, and in some cases unable to shower, clothe, or feed themselves. People are taking their lives because they cannot bear the torture this illness brings. Others describe themselves as rotting behind closed curtains. Despite being recognised as a neurological disease, many doctors still don’t know how to diagnose and manage ME/CFS and lack or research means that we still don’t have any effective forms of treatment. This is a completely unacceptable situation for a disease costing the UK economy around \u0026pound3.5billion in lost taxes, healthcare and benefit costs. There is no cure - and the longer it will take to find one unless funding dramatically increases. How many more people have to suffer before ME merits properly funded medical research? Merryn, who loved acting, had dreams of attending a performing arts school in Liverpool and adored musical theatre like Billy Elliott and Wicked. Mental health expert, Dr Ross Overshott, told the inquest that Merryn did not suffer a psychological illness, such as depression or an eating disorder. He said: She was hopeful for the future, she could speak in a very involved way about her hobbies and interests, particularly musicals and films. Before she died, Merryn revealed that she wanted her brain and spinal column to be donated to ME research. They were donated to the ME Association\u0027s Ramsay Research Fund, which conducts research into the causes of the disease.

His lifeless body was found hanged in his room on September 17, 2001, alongside a note that read: “Suicide. The unknown man, described as tall and dark, had checked using an assumed name and left few identifying clues.  An envelope stuffed with with $160 (\u0026pound118) of cash was also found with a message indicating the money was “for the room.” Media coverage of his death speculated possible links to the 9/11 hijackers, due in part to his ‘Middle Eastern’ appearance. The unusual cold case has be central to numerous online conspiracy theories for over a decade. Some speculated that the “John Doe” was part of a team of 19 hijackers whose suicide attacks on New York\u0027s Twin Towers claimed the lives of 3,000 people.  Some thought that he could be a spy or a cult member – as DNA traces initially failed to determine his identity. Those theories have now proved to be false thanks to painstaking forensic work by the non-profit DNA Doe Project organisation.  A team of 20 volunteers spent hundreds of hours running his DNA through a genealogy database in the hope they could discover close genetic matches. The team was eventually able to narrow down the location of his family to Almeda County, California.  “In the end, all the DNA matches and all the family trees and all the research paid off. This took persistence, good solid genealogy and detective work”, a Facebook post by the organisation said. Users of Redddit were instrumental in solving the case. 4,000 of their members scoured web groups in the hope that they would be able to trigger the memories of at least one person who could help. It was also those members who first notified DNA Doe Project about Stevik.  Sadly, the real name of Stevik will not be released to the public out of respect to the privacy of his grieving family. His relatives had assumed that he was still alive and had been avoiding them for decades until they were informed of his death.

Mary Kinninmonth, director of Dundee’s Citizens Advice Bureau, said UC’s online system hampers less computer-literate claimants.She said: “The main things we see are people still having difficulty in making and managing online claims due to lack of confidence and/or knowledge of computer skills.“The helpline is also very difficult to get through to with long waiting times.“Even though the waiting time has reduced, there is still a waiting time – which will often mean people going into rent arrears.”Full service UC rolled out in Dundee in November, following a trial period for new single applicants.The number of Universal Credit issues dealt with by Dundee CAB has risen by almost 50% following the introduction of the full service.Dundee City Council gives UC claimants a reprieve over their arrears, acknowledging the delayed payouts the DWP makes from month to month.A spokesman for the authority said a £250,000 hardship fund for council tenants was created in April 2016, boosted to £450,000 for this year.He added: “We continue to do a considerable amount work to support tenants on Universal Credit.“If a tenant is having difficulties paying their rent a referral to the Council Advice Service is made. Staff there can offer help and assistance.”A spokeswoman for the DWP said claimants can receive advance payments if required from day one.She added: “We have removed the seven-day waiting period from new claims and pay people’s Housing Benefit for two weeks while they wait for their first full Universal Credit payment.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/PA-28105789-843x564.jpg ","title":"dundee announce signing of french midfielder","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee have announced the signing of a French midfielder.Elton Ngwatala has penned a deal at Dens Park and is Neil McCann\u0026#8217s first signing of the summer.The Dark Blues have snapped up the 24-year-old attacking player on a two-year deal despite interest from down south.Ngwatala previously played for Kidderminster Harriers in two spells at the National League North side.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5afc0094a37a7-e1526475640876-928x564.jpg ","title":"dundee boss neil mccann admits hes made mistakes but looks to learn from them","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee boss Neil McCann says he had higher targets for his team this past season but insists an early start can get the Dark Blues where he wants them to be this time next year.A ninth-placed finish in the Premiership fell short of his stated top-half aim but Neil insists he learned a lot from his debut campaign as a manager.He said: “I think you have to self-analyse.“I’ve made mistakes, as a young manager I think that’s normal but, hopefully, if you’re learning from those it will put you in a better position next season.“In terms of going into the last five games, I learned a lot from my squad.“There was huge pressure going into the Hamilton game.“We knew it could have been a total role reversal and our goal difference was poorer so we knew the risk we were playing under but the players were brave and in it together.“That’ll help me 100% next season.

They had used an orange survival bag over an old duvet, sticking their head in under the old fireplace for cover and placing their feet in a thermal shopping bag for warmth.”Gareth said that on Wednesday night the charity helped two women who needed medical attention.He added: “Our outreach patrol was kept busy that evening as we gave out lots of hot chocolate drinks, made two new street friends, issued two sleeping bags, cleansed and dressed one girl’s self-harming wounds on both her lower arms and transported another female street beggar to A\u0026ampE.”On May 12 Gareth said the team gave hot drinks to two homeless people who were sheltering in a church foyer.Five days earlier he helped a 47-year-old Jamaican man sleeping on a bench in Riverside Drive who was heading north.“We were able to supply him with a sleeping bag, hot drinks and advice and directed him to more suitable sheltered location,” he said.Gareth said that, the day before, he had spoken with three rough sleepers who told him they had been refused assistance from the authorities.Mike Cordiner, of the Eagles Wings Trust, said: “There seems to be a rise in the number of people coming to Dundee from other areas. I am aware of someone from Jamaica and a person from Poland currently sleeping rough in Dundee.“If you come from outwith the city the authorities do not find you somewhere to sleep.“This needs to

The police are never out of there,” she said.“Why are they creating a new community campus and putting this right smack bang in the middle?‘‘It’s disgraceful.”Tom Henney, who drew up a petition against the custody unit, said he wasn’t opposed to the SPS proposals.‘‘My opinion is still the same – nobody has any objection to what they’re trying to do but there are other areas better suited for this,” he said.“My biggest concern is if (offenders) get out.‘‘There are drugs, there is crime and it shouldn’t be here.”However, Ann Hutchison, 57, who lives two minutes from Our Lady’s, said she was “keeping an open mind” on the plans.She added: “I’m glad the prison service are out speaking to the community. They should be.”Councillors were also in attendance at the information session, but couldn’t comment directly on the proposals as they are yet to come through the planning system.The SPS’s Tom Fox said it was inevitable that locals were concerned, but added: “Most of these are based on ideas of something that this unit isn’t.‘‘It is not a prison.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5afe9ae43941b-846x564.jpg ","title":"thousands across dundee celebrate ramadan and locals invited to join evening meal","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThousands of Muslims in Dundee have started celebrating the holy month of Ramadan – and locals are being invited to take part to find out more about the festival.Ramadan takes place in the ninth month of the Islamic calendar and commemorates the first revelation of the Koran to Muhammad.Bashir Chohan, head of Dundee Islamic Society, said that as of Thursday, Muslims from 13 nationalities across the city were observing the event.Mr Chohan said: “It is an important event in the Muslim calendar and involves a period of fasting for the next 30 days.“We fast from dawn until dusk when we are allowed to begin eating again.“I have my first meal of the day at 9.30pm when we usually begin eating with a selection of snacks.“We eat all sorts of food at this time from east and west and often begin with a cold drink or a milkshake.”Mr Chohan explained that fasting was for adults with children beginning to take part from the age of about 10-12.He said: “It is up to children and their families to decide when the children can cope with fasting.”Mr Choham said that at night, following the breaking of the fast, Muslims would be going along to the five mosques in the city to pray.“We listen to the Imam reciting from the Koran for an hour and we say special prayers,” he said.“And while at the mosque we serve around 300 to 400 meals a night to visitors.”During Ramadam, Mr Chohan said that Muslims were also expected to be on their best behaviour at all times.“Of course we should always be on our best behaviour but it is particularly important during Ramadan,” he said.“Ramadan is a very spiritual time for us. It is a peaceful time and an opportunity to repair body and soul.“We eat for the rest of the year and it is an order from God to obey his rules and take part in fasting and prayer during Ramadan.”Mr Chohan said that, as always, he would welcome Dundee residents to visit the mosques during Ramadan.He said: “Anyone is welcome to visit our mosques and take part in what is happening during the month.“We would be delighted for people to come along and see what we do and take part if they so wish.“Women as well as men are very welcome to attend. We are happy to share our religious beliefs and traditions with everyone in Dundee.”Ramadan began this year on May 15 and will end on Thursday June 14.\t\t\t"},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7486028.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th\u0026nbspAcademy Awards."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7590066.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"11 things you d only hear in Glasgow","story":"                          There are some things you will only ever hear in Glasgow or Glesga, as us locals call it,\u0026nbspand this is our definitive list of the best."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7608211.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Times Past  Looking back at life Doon the Watter","story":"                          Evocative Images from the Archives of the Herald and Evening Times."},{"url":null,"title":"Celtic fans rush to buy new    Only the Bold    home kit ahead of Scottish Cup final","story":"                          CELTIC\u0026rsquoS new 2018/19 home kit has hit stores -

But the Courier understands the \u0026pound370,000 art installation, still branded by Highland Council as the Gathering Place, will be divided into two sections positioned on either side of the river. The installation is thought to be a mix of stone and wooden construction.There is great excitement among city councillors who have seen two-dimensional design work, and there is apparent consensus that it is aesthetically pleasing and will easily blend into the local, tranquil environment.The \"pier\" project, proposed for a spot by Eden Court, was aborted two years ago due to the scale of public objections to the design.The location for the new proposal is believed to be nearby, slightly further upriver, at the most shallow point on the edge of the Ness Islands.The council\u0027 Inverness city committee delegated powers of approval to the Inverness city arts working group. Its current chairwoman, councillor Isabelle MacKenzie, said she had closely scrutinised the fresh concept adding that it was \"within budget\".Giving little away, she added: \"I can see it appealing to the local community. It\u0027 innovative and there are a variety of ways to use it.\"The artwork is believed to be static and radically different from the previous offering.Fellow city councillor Duncan Macpherson said: \"The whole thing looks good.

Backers also emphasised that if Inverness spurned the project the funding would simply go elsewhere in Scotland.The local authority\u0027 Inverness city manager David Haas said: \"It is in development and about to be revealed to the public.\"I\u0026rsquom confident the new proposal will prove a big hit for the city.

It also set up groups to help tackle loneliness and social isolation.Run as a voluntary not-for-profit organisation, it has experienced dwindling funding over recent years from various sources including Highland Council,Part-time development manager Catherine MacNeil \u0026ndash whose hours were reduced last year as another employee was made redundant in a bid to keep it going \u0026ndash said the organisation was no longer viable as it could no longer meet the annual running costs of about \u0026pound30,000.Its main venue, the Bike Shed in Grant Street, will now be used as a community coffee shop and social hub in a venture involving the Methodist Church and King\u0027 Fellowship.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\"It is sad but at the same time some of the groups we set up still exist and the Bike Shed is still there as a resource, so there may be an opportunity for individuals to pick up the mantle and run with projects,\" Ms MacNeil said.\"I think some groups will manage to continue such as Merkinch Men\u0027 Shed and the Blazing Needles knitting group, but I don\u0026rsquot think there will be new developments in the same way.\"She added she believed it unlikely the summer arts festival would go ahead, having also been cancelled last year.\"There isn\u0026rsquot the funding to make it happen,\" she said. \"That is a huge loss.\"It was so good in terms of profiling the area and bringing in young children as well as providing a platform for so many artists in the area.\"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspShe said it was particularly sad coming within one year of the death of founder member Bette McArdle, a former editor of the Highland News Group and keen advocate of access to arts for all.Merkinch Community Council chairman Dell McClurg said Arts in Merkinch would be greatly missed and felt it was the loss of another service for a neighbourhood which is continuing to grow, with more homes being planned.\"I think it is quite important to keep these things going,\" she said.
