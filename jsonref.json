But there is a group of people for whom that message is designed. And nothing fills my soul more than to think that maybe some kid watching that would say, \u0027Hey, I\u0027ve been thinking about that. I\u0027ve been thinking about praying. Let me try that out.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s like the only way I feel like I can repay what has essentially been a giant gift in my life.\u0027Top honor: On Monday, Chris Pratt, 38, received the MTV Movie \u0026amp TV Generation AwardPratt dismissed the idea that talking so openly about his faith, particularity at a non-religious event, could be a risk in Hollywood. \u0027I think that there\u0027s this narrative that exists out there that Hollywood is anti-Christian or anti-religious, but it\u0027s just not the case,\u0027 he said.\u0027They are kind of not anti-anything. They are kind of pro whatever is authentic to you. \u0027And I like that. Because it\u0027s authentic for me to be pro-Christian, pro-Jesus. That\u0027s my thing. I like it. \u0027And I\u0027ve never had anyone try to shame me, to my face. Maybe they go say it behind my back. But if that\u0027s the case, go ahead. You can say whatever you want about me - to my face or behind my back. I\u0027m not going to change.\u0027Aside from his Christianity, Pratt said that exercise way a major motivator in his life.     The couple that exercise together: Chris Pratt, 39, and girlfriend  Katherine Schwarzenegger, 28, were spotted out for a walk on a sunny Saturday in Los Angeles           Old love: Chris with his wife of eight years, actress Anna Faris, and their son Jack, six , at his Hollywood star ceremony in 2017. They filed for orce last DecemberThe interview with The Associated Press, took place after Michelob Ultra, which Pratt is a spokesman for, announced it was sponsoring seven athletes with disabilities, part of the nonprofit group Achilles International, to run in the New York City Marathon. \u0027It\u0027s hard enough to do a marathon or to do a triathlon. But to do it when you have physical limitations and disabilities, it\u0027s pretty awe-inspiring,\u0027 he said, adding that fitness is \u0027a great common denominator.\u0027The 39-year-old actor, who enjoys biking, running and ocean swimming when at his farm in the San Juan Islands off the coast of Washington state, says that he feels he was \u0027genetically made for... moving refrigerators or something.\u0027\u0027But now I\u0027m doing a job that really isn\u0027t that physically demanding. So having something that I can just shut my mind off and do physically every day is good for me.\u0027The Jurassic World actor added that he is a little self-conscious about his running skills, after breaking his leg as a child left one of his legs crooked, and so he was in awe of actors like Tom Cruise who could sprint flawlessly on screen and did their own stunts.\u0027When I run, I run a little crooked. And if I run at top speed, there\u0027s a high likelihood I will fall down,\u0027 he said.\u0027Tom Cruise. \u0027Mission: Impossible\u0027 - he ran across London, across bridges, over buildings. Yeah, Tom is a great runner. He did all his own jumping, he was flying the helicopter, he really was like - oh, if there\u0027s a question of whether or not I\u0027m the best at this, let me put that question to bed. He\u0027s the best.\u0027But it was Cruise\u0027s reputation that Pratt said he most admired.          The 39-year-old actor, who enjoys biking, running and ocean swimming when at his farm in the San Juan Islands off the coast of Washington state          Pratt has erected crosses on his land \u0027One of the career goals that I have based on Tom Cruise is his reputation as being a really nice, positive guy who works hard. I\u0027ve never actually met him, but I would like - if you\u0027re going to leave a legacy, it\u0027d be nice to have it be that people thought you were nice and easy to work with and you worked hard. I think that\u0027s pretty cool.\u0027Prat split from his wife Anna Faris last year, but has found love again in Katherine Schwarzenegger, 28.They came out as a couple in June and have been spotted enjoying a sunny Saturday day in Los Angeles last weekend.Proving that couple that exercises together stays together, they enjoyed a walk. At one point the beautiful 28-year-old daughter of Arnold Schwarzenegger and his ex-wife Maria Shriver reached out to lovingly stroke her beau\u0027s arm. Chris and Katherine are reportedly serious, a source dished to People, even though they\u0027ve only been together a few months \u0027They\u0027re both serious about the relationship and hopeful for the future,\u0027 the source revealed. \u0027Chris doesn\u0027t just date to date, and neither does Katherine.

Orla Kiely, pictured in 2014, said she started the company while she was caring for her newborn son, RobertThe designer has collaborated with Heal\u0027s, the Tate and Harrods and her fashion brand has become a favourite among royals.  Kate Middleton has been seen wearing the label\u0027s dresses on several occasions, for example in February this year when she wore a floral outfit to London\u0027s National Portrait Gallery. Her sister Pippa has also used the brand, wearing a Kiely cardigan when she watched tennis at Wimbledon with her brother, while Carole Middleton wore a blue printer Orla Kiely dress when she went to visit the newborn Prince George in 2013. Ms Kiely and her husband Dermott Rowan, 60, who started the business from a first-floor flat in London, remained its directors.      The company, which Irish designer Orla Kiely founded with her husband Dermott, was known for its colourful floral pieces (pictures posed by models)             A selection of Orla Kiely-designed items including handbags and cushions seen in London     Radios and garden chairs were among the items to feature an Orla Kiely floral designMr Rowan helped to run the financial side of the business while Ms Kiely focused on designing, she said. She would look over the designs herself with her handwritten word \u0027approved\u0027 written on numerous drawings at a recent exhibition.Describing her personal style she said that \u0027colour and pattern are at the heart of everything\u0027. After taking a degree in print for fashion, she took an MA in knitwear at the Royal College of Art and later worked as a consultant with Marks \u0026amp Spencer In 2010, she featured on an Irish postage stamp, and in 2011 she was awarded an OBE.

The flower-like graphic she created in the Nineties became the company logo and featured on almost every product she made — most iconically on the line of laminated handbags which propelled her to fame.Her prints and patterns also made their way onto womenswear, with the Orla Kiely clothing line worn by everyone from Alexa Chung to Kirsten Dunst, but particularly championed by the royals.  Although Orla Kiely\u0027s prints are a royal favourite (pictured left Carole Middleton and right Kate Middleton) they had become \u0027licensed too widely\u0027 meaning the graphic prints were on everything from £300 dresses to £2 hand towelsIn fact, her prints became so reconisable that she was recently celebrated in an exhibition at the Fashion and Textiles Museum in London.But this signature also was her undoing.You know the feeling of turning up to a party and someone\u0027s wearing the same dress as you? For a while you didn\u0027t need to be at a party to find an Orla Kiely print — you\u0027d match your friend\u0027s kettle, or the car in their driveway. Because Orla licensed her print too far and it started to appear on everything - from £30 blinds to £7.49 coasters to £2 hand towels. Those graphic prints were everywhere on everything, and women simple didn\u0027t want the same print on their biscuit tins and their blouse - it appeared on the back of buses and even a Citroen DS3. Because the prints never changed, too, you\u0027d also never want or need to replace that biscuit tin, or those blinds or towels.The pity is that her clothes were beautiful, mainly thoughtfully cut dresses and shirts in pretty feminine prints. But they were too expensive for what they were — £300 for a black smock dress was typical — when you know you could buy a cushion bearing the same print for a fraction of that.  Orla licensed her print too widely, with the blocky 1970s designs featuring on £30 blinds to £7.49 coasters and £2 hand towels  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/20/11/34898F0E00000578-6188809-image-a-40_1537441135471.jpg","title":"Sky sold auction giants Comcast 21st Century Fox","story":"Rupert Murdoch\u0027s Fox and Bob Roberts\u0027 Comcast will now enter a three-bid auction for Sky  - one of the first for a decade          The wrestling match to takeover Sky has gone on for two years and is expected to reach £26billion          Rupert Murdoch, 87, who is married to Jerry Hall, 62, is in the middle of moving assets with the takeover of Sky eventually leading to the broadcaster being taken on by Disney\u0027Don’t hate me, but I’m all set for Christmas Day already\u0027:...Protests mount over Unilever’s plan to go Dutch with...Share this article    Mr Murdoch is expected hand the reigns to his sons Lachlan and James (left to right) - with James tipped to head to Disney while Lachlan will run his father newspapers and Fox News          Rupert\u0027s legacy to his sons could see James (left) move to Disney and Lachlan to run a smaller Fox and News Corp, but this plan is under threat      "},{"url":null,"title":"Marine Le Pen undergo psychiatric test capable understanding","story":"    Marine Le Pen, 50, is facing charges in a court in Paris, relating to a series of tweets in which she posted ISIS propaganda pictures, including the remains of U.S. journalist James FoleyThe Paris court today declined to confirm it had ordered the evaluation but said the assessments were a normal part of such probes.The 50-year-old politician has been charged with \u0027violent messages that incite terrorism or pornography or seriously harm human dignity, and that can be viewed by minors.\u0027Macron to meet Trump, Iran\u0027s Rouhani at UN in New YorkFrance to create a memorial museum for victims of terrorismMacron´s former aide quizzed by French senateShare this articleIf found guilty she could be sentenced to up to three years in prison, and receive a fine equivalent to more than £65,000.

Onset for the disease is usually 65 and older.There is no cure for Alzheimer’s disease currently, though various medication and management strategies may help to alleviate symptoms on a temporary basis. Not much is known about the cause of the disease, though about 70 percent of the risk is believed to be genetic. Other risk factors are believed to be hypertension, depression and head injuries.Named after German pathologist and psychiatrist Alois Alzheimer in 1906, the disease currently impacts approximately 29.8 million people worldwide as of 2015.World Alzheimer\u0027s Day 2018: All you need to knowInternational Day of Peace 2018: All you need to know about the UN-designated dayGame of Thrones star Peter Dinklage tells Jimmy Kimmel about the prank he plays on setNew Robyn album Honey: Swedish pop singer announces first solo album in eight yearsEd Sheeran tour revealed as Shape of You singer is announced as Sziget festival headlinerPast Mercury Prize winners revealed ahead of the 2018 Hyundai Mercury Prize awards ceremonyPS Vita: Sony to cease production of handheld PlayStation console in 2019Who is Alexander Povetkin?

Orla Kiely, pictured in 2014, said she started the company while she was caring for her newborn son, RobertThe designer has collaborated with Heal\u0027s, the Tate and Harrods and her fashion brand has become a favourite among royals.  Kate Middleton has been seen wearing the label\u0027s dresses on several occasions, for example in February this year when she wore a floral outfit to London\u0027s National Portrait Gallery. Her sister Pippa has also used the brand, wearing a Kiely cardigan when she watched tennis at Wimbledon with her brother, while Carole Middleton wore a blue printer Orla Kiely dress when she went to visit the newborn Prince George in 2013. Ms Kiely and her husband Dermott Rowan, 60, who started the business from a first-floor flat in London, remained its directors.      The company, which Irish designer Orla Kiely founded with her husband Dermott, was known for its colourful floral pieces (pictures posed by models)             A selection of Orla Kiely-designed items including handbags and cushions seen in London     Radios and garden chairs were among the items to feature an Orla Kiely floral designMr Rowan helped to run the financial side of the business while Ms Kiely focused on designing, she said. She would look over the designs herself with her handwritten word \u0027approved\u0027 written on numerous drawings at a recent exhibition.Describing her personal style she said that \u0027colour and pattern are at the heart of everything\u0027. After taking a degree in print for fashion, she took an MA in knitwear at the Royal College of Art and later worked as a consultant with Marks \u0026amp Spencer In 2010, she featured on an Irish postage stamp, and in 2011 she was awarded an OBE.

The flower-like graphic she created in the Nineties became the company logo and featured on almost every product she made — most iconically on the line of laminated handbags which propelled her to fame.Her prints and patterns also made their way onto womenswear, with the Orla Kiely clothing line worn by everyone from Alexa Chung to Kirsten Dunst, but particularly championed by the royals.  Although Orla Kiely\u0027s prints are a royal favourite (pictured left Carole Middleton and right Kate Middleton) they had become \u0027licensed too widely\u0027 meaning the graphic prints were on everything from £300 dresses to £2 hand towelsIn fact, her prints became so reconisable that she was recently celebrated in an exhibition at the Fashion and Textiles Museum in London.But this signature also was her undoing.You know the feeling of turning up to a party and someone\u0027s wearing the same dress as you? For a while you didn\u0027t need to be at a party to find an Orla Kiely print — you\u0027d match your friend\u0027s kettle, or the car in their driveway. Because Orla licensed her print too far and it started to appear on everything - from £30 blinds to £7.49 coasters to £2 hand towels. Those graphic prints were everywhere on everything, and women simple didn\u0027t want the same print on their biscuit tins and their blouse - it appeared on the back of buses and even a Citroen DS3. Because the prints never changed, too, you\u0027d also never want or need to replace that biscuit tin, or those blinds or towels.The pity is that her clothes were beautiful, mainly thoughtfully cut dresses and shirts in pretty feminine prints. But they were too expensive for what they were — £300 for a black smock dress was typical — when you know you could buy a cushion bearing the same print for a fraction of that.  Orla licensed her print too widely, with the blocky 1970s designs featuring on £30 blinds to £7.49 coasters and £2 hand towels  "},{"url":null,"title":"Zac Goldsmith worth 300m drivers 19 year old Toyota Prius","story":"    The politician, well known for his green credentials, was seen pootling about in the environmentally friendly - and extremely dirty - electric car in London today          Mr Goldsmith, MP for Richmond Park, admirably drove the black Prius with mud covered side doors and a paint-scraped bumper despite being the second wealthiest MP in parliament          The 43-year-old regained his seat in Richmond last year after losing it in a by-election when he stood down as a Conservative and then stood as an Independent in 2016          The son of billionaire businessman and financier Sir James Goldsmith, Zac ran an unsuccessful campaign to become mayor of London against Sadiq Khan          Mr Goldsmith, a long-standing Eurosceptic and well know supporter of Brexit, announced his support for leaving the European Union after David Cameron called a referendum          He is currently championing a campaign against the illicit wildlife trade alongside Environment secretary Michael Gove  "},{"url":null,"title":"Summer spending spree high street retail sales rise again","story":"    Retail sale were up by 0.3 per cent in August compared to July while the amount spent was 5.6 per cent higher than a year earlier (pictured is the year on year change in both cash spent and amount bought in the shops)           Despite the financial woes effecting big high street names like House of Fraser, spending in department stores also reached a record proportion at 18.4 per centSpending online continued to increase to reach a new record proportion of all retailing at 18.2 per cent.Despite the financial woes effecting big high street names, spending in department stores also reached a record proportion at 18.4 per cent.ONS senior statistician Rhian Murphy said: \u0027Retail sales remained strong in the three months to August, with continued growth across all sectors.Theresa May defends her Chequers plan and demands the EU...Official report into timetable chaos that ruined train...Share this article\u0027Food and household goods stores particularly benefited from the warm weather when compared with last summer.\u0027The figures for the month of August were a little more mixed, with food sales falling after strong sales earlier in the summer, and clothing sales declining following a strong July, as suggested by clothing retailers.

I’m not sure how true it is, but I think that regardless of whether he did do it or not, it’s one of those albums that mixes very traditional Caribbean approaches to music and jazz.Saxophone player Cedric “Im” Brooks features really prominently throughout the album, and hearing him play, it’s like Rastafari devotional music but with jazz improvisation and spoken word on it. There’s a lot of historical chanting, talking about aspects of history like Jamaican colonisation and the independence movement. And it was the first time I’d heard an album that had all of these things: traditional aspect as the basis of it, the nyabinghi rhythm, the very advanced jazz soloing in the midst of all this, and spoken word that reminds you of Gil Scott-Heron.Even before I started Sons of Kemet, I was listening to it constantly. It wasn’t that I wanted to replicate the music specifically, but to replicate the atmosphere of the music, not as a commodity but almost for a devotional purpose. I was influenced by the atmosphere of it – I want to make something as epic as this sounds, in the same spirit. When I’m writing for Sons of Kemet, I want to write music that is in some way connected to the past, but is in some way looking forward.Shortlisted Hyundai Mercury Prize album: A Fever DreamAlbum that inspired me: The White Album (1968) by the BeatlesPicking The White Album by the Beatles is not very original, but it’s a big fat classic. This album has a sense of amazing creativity. I remember reading that Paul McCartney said that when they wrote together, they never had a bad session. And that sounds amazing – as a songwriter, that never happens!You can tell the whole record is festering with ideas. It’s insane, you can hear the fact that they’re writing continuously, it’s just pouring out of them, and that is so inspiring. On Helter Skelter, they accidentally invent heavy metal – it’s like, here’s heavy metal for you, bye! And every song seems to be written for a different set of instruments, like they’re so full of ideas and creativity that they just pick up anything, do something amazing with it, chuck it away and pick up the next thing. I love that. My parents introduced me to the Beatles, and I think it was appealing because, as a child, there are so many moments that are quite scary, actually. There’s Revolution 9 on there, which, if you’re a child, is really disturbing with those disembodied voices and strange sounds. It sounds like people are in trouble. Even something like Helter Skelter or While My Guitar Gently Weeps, there’s a strange sadness and darkness to it. In Rocky Raccoon, someone gets shot and in Bungalow Bill, he shoots an elephant right between the eyes. It’s scary. There are obviously moments of beauty, of silliness, of joy and so many emotions, but that feeling of “the world is a scary place full of unknown things” really comes to life on this record. As I get older, my ears change and I can appreciate why it was so affecting, and it makes me think about my own music and how I can steal their atmosphere. It’s very influential.Shortlisted Hyundai Mercury Prize album: Novelist GuyAlbum that inspired me: Boy in Da Corner (2003) by Dizzee RascalBoy in Da Corner inspired me to make my last album. I can’t remember the exact first time I heard it, but I remember how I felt. The beats didn’t sound like anything else. They put that album under the umbrella of grime but I still don’t think it sounds like the other beats that you’d affiliate with that music. It really stood out to me. I thought: I want to make something on that level.It was one of those albums that was everywhere. You’d hear the songs on the radio – I used to listen to pirate radio when I was young and sometimes I might hear Dizzee Rascal’s bars. It wasn’t so much the lyrics or the things he’d talk about – I didn’t really care about that when I was younger – but the beats.When I was making my last album, it was a big influence. It wasn’t necessarily that I wanted to replicate the sound, but I wanted to actually be that fresh. I wanted to make something new, completely new. That was my main thing. When I was producing my album, I was thinking: how can I make something that doesn’t sound like anything else? If I’m making an album, I don’t listen to any other music. I’ve taken in so much music in my life already that I just want to let whatever is seeping out of my pores come out.I’ve never met Dizzee Rascal in person but I have messaged him in the past to tell him: “I respect you man, and big up.” He was cool about it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9cf00e56fd504a3665add2da587d9b975c4119e6/0_0_3764_2259/master/3764.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b781d9b64c850f5e2b54bab91a1dbfe","title":"quiz how well do you know the hyundai mercury prize","story":" Only one artist has won the prize twice, while one has been shortlisted six times and never won.

Here are 10 of the most mind-meltingly, brain-bogglingly, heart-stoppingly creative records to have ever been nominatedPrimal Scream (1991) For the two albums that came before Screamadelica, Primal Scream were just another fey and jangly Scottish indie band. Enter DJ and producer Andrew Weatherall, who harnessed Bobby Gillespie and co’s interest in London’s buzzing late-80s acid house scene and helped turn it into a euphoric, hedonistic and era-defining record. Loaded is the hit, Slip Inside This House the inspired cover version and Don’t Fight It, Feel It the definitive instruction on how to do ecstasy-inspired raving properly.Spice Girls (1996)A short list of people who grew up listening to the Spice Girls: Little Mix, Charli XCX, Katy Perry, Adele. And Spice was the wildly enthusiastic in-yer-face dance-pop record that – thanks to enormohits Wannabe, Say You’ll Be There and Who Do You Think You Are – launched Ginger, Posh, Scary, Sporty, Baby and the “girl power” slogan into the mainstream quicker than you could say “zig-a-zig-ah”.Massive Attack (1998) Deep, dark, doomy and graceful, Mezzanine is trip-hop’s crowning glory. Teardrop is the most famous track, but Inertia Creeps, Risingson and Angel are just as harrowingly atmospheric. Made at a time when the mood within the Bristol band was terse, Massive Attack’s third album pongs of alienation, isolation and fear, and the trio became a duo shortly after the release when Andrew Vowles, aka Mushroom, jumped ship (or was pushed off).The Streets (2002) On which 23-year-old Birmingham boy Mike Skinner takes the sound of two-step UK garage and decorates it with often funny, frequently poignant and always relatable raps about, as he puts it on Has It Come to This?, a “day in the life of a geezer”. Booze, drugs, clubs, pubs, PlayStations, heartbreak, the quantity of fried tomato a fry-up requires – it’s all on there, still sounding fresh. Put on your classics and have a little dance. Dizzee Rascal (2003)Until the release of Skepta’s Konnichiwa in 2016, Dizzee Rascal’s Boy in Da Corner was the grime album. Released when the genre was still relatively young, it’s a frighteningly raw and angry take on the realities of growing up as a working-class kid in east London. Looking at the artist Dizzee has become, it’s hard to remember the shy teenager who raps so furiously about knife crime (Stop Dat), underage sex (I Luv U) and everyday violence (Seems 2 Be) over ice-cold beats that reflect the hopelessness of his situation. But he’s there, and he’s a genius.MIA (2005) There’s a lot to get your head round on the debut album from the London via Sri Lanka rapper. The title: MIA’s dad’s codename when he was in the Tamil Tiger militant group, given to the record in the hope he would one day Google himself and see what his daughter had made (he did). The sound: multicultural trans-global party music that nicks bits from all over the world, most notably hip-hop and dancehall. The lyrics: explorations of politics, culture, food, sex, war and revolution. Truly invigorating.The xx (2009)Listen to this debut album now, and you might think you’ve heard it all before. But none of London Grammar, Banks, Alt-J, Lorde or James Blake sounded like that before xx. Really, the only band that sounded remotely like the xx before the xx were late-70s Welsh post-punks Young Marble Giants. But the genius of the London band’s update on YMG’s minimal guitar sound is the use of cutting-edge production to create 11 spooky mini-epics that tell late-night tales of love, lust and longing.PJ Harvey (2011)From the moment she announced Let England Shake on the Andrew Marr Show in April 2010, telling the presenter: “My biggest fear would be to replicate something I’ve done before”, you knew Polly Jean Harvey’s eighth album would be special. Suspicions were confirmed when, 10 months later, an ambitious portrayal of the horrors of world war one and its aftermath appeared, featuring lyrics about soldiers falling “like lumps of meat” (The Words That Maketh Murder) and a country whose “fruit is deformed children” (The Glorious Land) in songs that took in folk, rock and pop, mostly made with guitars but with dashes of harp and sax in there too. PJ wasn’t done there though, and asked war photographer Seamus Murphy to make a video for every track to complete a fantastically creative vision.FKA Twigs (2014)Four years since Tahlia Barnett released her debut album, there’s still nothing quite like it. In a way it’s doomy alt-R\u0026ampB but just like, say, Bjork in her pomp, there are so many risks, ideas and moods on LP1 it would be unfair to label it. There are sad songs (Pendulum), sexy songs (Two Weeks), romantic songs (Hours) and vulnerable songs (Closer), a mega list of producers (Clams Casino, Sampha, Twigs herself and more) and a whole load of vocal experimentation. Yet it comes together because FKA Twigs, alien pop star extraordinaire, is right at the heart of all of it.J Hus (2017) The way J Hus’s debut brings together grime, garage, bashment, dancehall, afrobeat and early 00s hip-hop is as exciting as British music gets. Tunes like Bouff Daddy, Did You See and the title track are carnivals of ideas, and the east Londoner is comfortable rapping sensitively, playfully or aggressively over any style he’s given. The focus, though, is always on his extraordinary life that’s featured a multiple stabbing. It’s the unique sound of modern multicultural London."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b14a37f8b0b09b8186c3d23922d1405d875d27fa/350_88_550_330/master/550.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8fe9e53b844ec2ff56046ca2ee9335ea","title":"jack kerouac letter to mother recounts on the road adventures","story":"Written 10 years before the book that defined the Beat Generation, appeal for a $25 sub is now on sale in California for $22,500He may have been the godfather of the Beat Generation, a self-styled crazy hobo mystic who hit the US’s highways looking for himself, but Jack Kerouac wasn’t above asking his mother for money to tide him over on the epic journey he immortalised in On The Road.In a letter from 1947, written at the height of the travels that would form the basis of his classic roman a clef published 10 years later, Kerouac begs his mother, Gabrielle, for $25 to help him get from Denver to California.The handwritten note, dated 29 July, was written when Kerouac was 25, and is being sold through online bookseller Abebooks by Pasadena-based rare book dealers Whitmore for $22,500 (£17,000).The letter betrays a vulnerability in the young Kerouac perhaps overlooked by those who only know him as the free-wheelin’ author of counterculture classics. Opening the note, written in pencil, he begins “Dear Ma”, and gives Gabrielle instructions on how to wire the money to him from a Western Union branch near where she works in Brooklyn.However, despite saying he needs it because “hitchhiking is impossible across the desert and mountains”, Kerouac isn’t exactly living in squalor in Denver, writing: “I’m staying in a swanky apartment with showers and food and everything. But I want to get going so I can make a lot of money sailing in the Pacific and come home in the Fall and finish my book.”In a particularly tender line, Kerouac writes: “Gee, you can’t realise how much I miss you, and the house, and writing in my room. But I’ll be back in a few months and we’ll save some money.”Signing the letter “Jacky”, with three kisses, Kerouac also regales his mother with some of the adventures in Denver that were later detailed in On The Road: “Boy, it’s been a lot of fun around here … I had about 10 girlfriends went up to the mountains saw an opera ate swell food, venison steak.” Despite – or perhaps because of – all that, he says “I haven’t a cent left”.The Denver episode is an important one in the Kerouac legend, as it was the first real road trip he took and was rehearsed in On the Road. Denver was also the home town of Neal Cassady, the “side-burned hero of the snowy West” who was part best pal, part muse to Kerouac.In On the Road, in which Kerouac’s mother Gabrielle appears as the aunt of his alter-ego Sal Paradise, he directly references this letter: “I sent my aunt an airmail letter asking her for fifty dollars and said it would be the last money I’d ask after that she would be getting money from me, as soon as I got that ship.”When Kerouac did get to San Francisco to visit his friend Henri Cru, who appears in On the Road as “Remi Boncoeur”, his planned merchant seaman career never materialised. Kerouac ended up working as a security guard on a construction site.According to Whitmore Rare Books, the note “undermines the notion that the road trip was aimless. As he charts his path west, he plans out money and transportation, telling his mother about the need for efficiency if he’s going to meet his goals”.The text of the note was included in a volume collecting Kerouac’s letters in 1995, edited by his biographer Ann Charters, but has not been sold before.

The store is Tesco’s attempt to fend off the German discounters Aldi and Lidl.“There’s clearly not much to do on a rainy day in Chatteris that’s why so many people are here,” said Robert, a local resident who said he had come down “to see what all the fuss was about”.Lewis said the group planned to open 10-15 Jack’s stores over the next six months. The next shop will open in Immingham in Lincolnshire. Tesco has not yet confirmed other locations, but according to the Grocer magazine shop assistants are being hired for further outlets in Rubery, south-west Birmingham, St Helen’s, Castle Bromwich, Edge Hill in Liverpool and Middlewich, Cheshire. About half will be converted Tesco outlets, while others will be next to existing Tesco stores and some on new sites. Tesco has hired the former Aldi executive Lawrence Harvey to run Jack’s.The new chain is a bid to win back shoppers lost to the discounters, who now account for more than £13 out of every £100 spent in UK supermarkets – twice as much as five years ago.By 10:30am it was all but impossible to get into the store car park with shoppers leaving their cars on verges in their eagerness to sample the new shop.Customers were offered a glass of prosecco or orange juice and a cupcake as they entered plus a free Jack’s bag and other goodies. Vans with illuminated signs, parked at each end of the fenland town’s bypass signposted its arrival.Those who had braved the weather were certainly in the mood to shop. The Aldi-style fresh bakery was doing brisk business, with 50p baguettes flying off the shelves, along with croissants and brownies.Large numbers of staff wearing bright nametags were on hand to help shoppers find items.Mingling with the locals there were a lot of staff from rival supermarkets examining the prices. Prices of Jack’s products almost exactly mirrored those in the nearby Aldi store.Several shoppers said it reminded them of shopping 20 or 30 years ago. “I’m not sure how I feel about the packaging. It looks like it has come out of the 1950s. It looks a bit out of date to me,” said one woman in her 50s who declined to give her name.Like many of the other shoppers in Jack’s she said she normally shopped at Aldi, a two-minute drive from the new Jack’s store. “I came to give it a go to see what it was like. I don’t know if I’ll be back I may,” she said.In comparison to the hectic trading in Jack’s, the nearby Aldi was a picture of calm. Several customers shopping there had already been at Jack’s to collect the free bag but had not bought anything and then headed to Aldi instead.“We thought about going down there,” said one elderly couple looking for sultanas, “but Aldi’s are our store and I think will be sticking with it.

It plans to float one-quarter of the stock, nearly 57m shares, and expects these to start trading around 8 October.The flotation is one of only a few major initial public offerings before the UK’s departure from the EU in March, and will test investor appetite to back British companies. The IPO marks a remarkable turnaround for a business that has gone bankrupt seven times in its 105-year history. Palmer told Reuters the level of interest from investors in the IPO had been “unprecedented”.He said Aston Martin had increased its stock of engines and components in case the UK crashed out of the EU without a deal. It now holds five days’ supply of engines and components, rather than three days’ worth. Aston Martin makes all its cars in Britain and imports two-thirds of its engines and car parts from mainland Europe.Other carmakers have warned about the impact of any customs checks introduced after Brexit, which could disrupt production and exports.The average cost of a car from an EU country could rise by £1,500 in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the UK’s automotive trade body has predicted.The carmaker is majority owned by Italy’s Investindustrial and Kuwait’s Adeem Investment and Primewagon, which have agreed not to sell their stakes for 180 days after the IPO.Aston Martin will publish a full prospectus later on Thursday.

Get yourself down to Paternoster Square, just behind St Paul’s Cathedral, on Saturday. The auctioneer promises to get the process wrapped up by the evening so, with a bit of luck, you’ll be home in time to watch the Anthony Joshua fight on your newly acquired TV station.That’s not wholly accurate, of course. For starters, 21st Century Fox and Comcast, who have been slugging it out for months, will be the only bidders allowed in the auction. And, disappointingly, the Takeover Panel will not require Rupert Murdoch from Fox and Brian Roberts from Comcast to turn up in person at its office to catch the auctioneer’s eye. Instead, investment bankers will relay offers via secure phone lines. But it’s a real auction with real deadlines. Three rounds maximum. Cash only. Best price wins, assuming Sky’s board and shareholders then give a thumbs-up, which is highly likely.It’s an unusual way to sell a company worth £26bn-ish but a showdown is a sensible way to resolve matters. Neither bidder has declared its offer “final” so let them to show their hands with a clock ticking. All parties, including Disney, which is now the force behind Fox, have agreed to the rules so, unless one side shouts “final” by 5pm on Friday, Saturday’s big match is on. The market expects excitement. The current best bid on the table is Comcast’s £14.75-a-share, versus a market price of £15.81.As with a conventional auction, both bidders will have to make two calculations. How high is it prepared to bid and how high does it think its opponent will go?Nice cars, famous brand and James Bond drives one. But can Aston Martin, a company with a bad habit of going bust often in the 20th century, really be worth £4bn-£5bn?That’s the price range for the upcoming flotation and it owes everything to the idea that, having undergone successful repairs under private equity ownership for the past decade, Aston Martin can now offer strong competition to the likes of Ferrari in the luxury car market.Good luck to the ambitious chief executive, Andy Palmer, especially as the firm is a big employer in the West Midlands and south Wales. But floats are about assessing risks, as well as opportunities, and the bottom line here is that Aston Martin made profits of only £76.8m last year. That was a huge improvement on the previous loss of £144m but, in order for the float price to make vague sense, you have to assume acceleration for years and years.That is precisely what Aston Martin is promising, it should be said: the firm wants to boost production from 6,300 cars this year, to almost 10,000 in 2020 as it enters the SUV market, to 14,000 in “the medium term”. Terrific if it happens, especially as the average selling price last year was £150,000 a car. But it assumes Chinese millionaires, or somebody, will be buying serious quantities, which is an untested proposition.The other red flag is the mere fact of private equity ownership. The Kuwaiti and Italian crew at Aston Martin have been loyal backers since buying the business from Ford in 2007 so can’t be blamed for wanting to cash a few chips now. But, as a breed, private equity tends to push valuation to the maximum. As with the executive pay arrangements, this float looks over-revved.In the circumstances, Aberdeen Standard Investments was generous to give Bonderman its backing for one more year. He’s had 22 years already.

The web project and Instagram feed started by Philipp Schütz, Wongel Abebe and Nafkot Gebeyehu, reveals an intimate view of the city.Terefe Berlie Asmare moved to Addis Ababa in 1980 and spent much of the next decade driving. He worked at a garage in the Ethiopian capital by day, and studied engineering by night. At weekends he would roam the countryside in his father’s car, with a tent bought from the German embassy in the boot, and a Konica in his pocket.“I always took the camera with me,” he says, standing in the garden of Addis Ababa’s iconic, though fading, Wabi Shebele hotel, which is still owned by the family of Haile Selassie, Ethiopia’s last emperor. Asmare, now in his 60s, documented his road trips extensively, being one of the few people he knew with a camera – he was the lucky owner of the world’s first commercial autofocus. “There were no photographers at that time,” he recalls. “So I did most of the pictures myself, often with a self timer.”In one carefree shot he leans cockily against his Mazda car in view of Lake Langano, a spot popular with Addis Ababa’s middle classes then and now. His white socks are pulled up high and a red baseball hangs nonchalantly from his fingers. It’s a world away from the land of famine and war that foreign photojournalists etched in the popular consciousness of the 1980s.Terefe’s photos – he believes has more than 1,000 from this period – might have disappeared were it not for Vintage Addis Ababa. A website that started in July 2017 as a Tumblr page, the project Vintage Addis Ababa invites Ethiopians to share old photos from family archives as a part of an effort to document the lives of various people throughout the country’s tumultuous 20th century of empire, war and revolution.Vintage Addis Ababa is the brainchild of Philipp Schütz, a Swiss publisher and photographer based in the city, of Wongel Abebe, an Ethiopian photographer, and of Nafkot Gebeyehu, a documentary photographer. The project peels away the popular cliches to reveal a more innocent city with an intimate and familiar past.Schütz says, referring to some of the 1,800 plus photographs they have amassed so far: “They look exactly like my parents’ family archive, of the photos of my grandparents in the 1950s.” He and Abebe were surprised by the enthusiasm with which the city’s residents accepted the idea. “It was totally unexpected,” he says. “We’re not digging out 100-year-old photos. These are just everyday, family, stories from a time which a lot of people still remember.”Abebe thinks the project taps into a latent frustration with the way the Ethiopia has been represented over the years. “People are sick and tired of the famine and all that,” she says. “This is about how people want to be remembered.” Many of the photos they have received were submitted by friends and relatives wishing to commemorate their departed, or ageing, loved ones.Photographs belonging to the late Kassa Gebru, an engineer-turned-businessman who built Addis Ababa hotel in the 1950s, were given to Abebe by his daughter, who felt he deserved recognition for founding the city’s first venue for live jazz.The project also appeals to the occasional nostalgia some Ethiopians feel for their past, even for a period like the 1980s, a decade stained by bloodshed and economic privation under the communist regime known as the Derg.“I was a bachelor,” says Asmare. “I spent most of my time travelling and I really enjoyed it. In Addis there was less traffic because nobody had cars – the Derg had banned imports – and on Saturday nights there would be parties in Ras hotel, in Ghion hotel, and of course here in Wabi Shebele. When I look at the photos in my albums it’s like a dream.”“Genet’s father was very strict, like most fathers at the time. She wasn’t allowed to go out of the house besides go to school she was expected to come straight home afterwards and would be in trouble if she didn’t arrive within 30 minutes after home-time.” Girls at the time were expected to be timid and walk with their heads tucked down. They weren’t allowed to leave their house for just recreation. “One time, a few girlfriends and I took a photo as we celebrated a friend’s graduation at Addis Ababa university, as she earned her business degree. I had to hide that picture for years so my father wouldn’t see it.”Vintage Addis Ababa is part of a broader trend towards revisiting and rethinking Africa’s recent history. Schütz was inspired by a project that digitises old Ugandan photographs, though his focus was narrower and with more emphasis on family and private lives.Calling to mind the work of the late Malian photographer Malick Sidibé, and Burkina Faso’s Sory Sanlé, both of whom captured the colourful optimism of post-independence west Africa, these photos of mid-century Addis Ababa evoke a similar mood. They chart the evolution of fashion, hairstyles, and even the city’s physical environment, making Vintage Addis Ababa a rich exercise in cultural history. Some of the districts seen here have long since disappeared, or, like the old Italian quarter known as Piassa, are now on the brink of demolition.The project started out as a website aiming to reach as many Ethiopians as possible, but it is soon to be published as a book. The team also hope the idea will eventually spread to other Ethiopian cities.As it stands, Vintage Addis Ababa offers a glimpse into the past but only a fleeting one. “We don’t want to be misleading,” says Abebe, of the project’s title. “You can never represent the whole of Ethiopia in pictures.”“We learned everything, starting from shooting and marching, to office administration and finance,” she remembers. After an intensive training that took well over a year, the women were graduated by the emperor himself. The newly inaugurated women army never went to a battlefield. “We were always invited to shows and asked to make appearances at official events,” Tsehay chuckles, “We were treated more like celebrities.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b59ab1d0442a5293d5895a7564da8def3edbd8f0/0_216_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4256cdaaa63382d8961e6dd69a120c71","title":"dont walk this way why hong kong reopened a pedestrian street to cars","story":"When residents complained the noise from a pedestrianised street was causing sleeplessness and psychological distress, city authorities reopened it to cars. Was there a better way?Trying to walking through the pedestrian zone of Sai Yeung Choi Street South, walkers were always shoulder-to-shoulder, bumping into every other passing person. There was simply no way to avoid fellow pedestrians.Hong Kong’s Mong Kok area – “busy corner” in Cantonese – is a sea of people, shops and chaotic energy in the heart of the city’s most densely populated district.Within that, Sai Yeung Choi Street South was the street that never slept. After it was pedestrianised in 2000, the only islands in the sea of people were buskers, singers and dancers, all competing to drown each other out. Commonly known as “noisy street”, you could hear it long before you saw it.Complaints from residents led the government to restrict the pedestrianisation scheme to weekends and public holidays. Finally, this summer, it was scrapped entirely after more than 1,000 noise complaints motor vehicles were allowed back 24-7.With the buskers gone, vehicles are now the noisiest things on the street. The number of people seems the same, though – they’re just squashed onto the pavement to allow the cars through.“It had become a sort of poor man’s nightclub where competing performers, dancers and karaoke singers were blasting their music at 90-100 decibels,” says Carine Lai, senior researcher of Civic Exchange, an independent Hong Kong public policy thinktank. “To make things worse, there were residential buildings upstairs, so people were complaining of sleeplessness and psychological distress.”But Lai and others feel that closing the pedestrianised section of Mong Kok is not a long-term solution and does not address the root issue of street management problems in Hong Kong.“Whenever there were conflicts in the pedestrian zone in Mong Kok, the government always refused to consider alternatives or improvement measures, but simply avoided it by closing the street instead of finding better ways to manage it,” says Kathy Ip, the secretary general of Hong Kong Public Space Initiative.As cities around the world close central streets to cars to mark World Car-Free Day,  Cities is looking at the joys and trials of urban walking.The US humourist and writer David Sedaris tells us about walking in cities from Raleigh to Reykjavik. Will Self explains what he learns from perambulations in London, there’s Fran Lebowitz in New York, Helen Garner in Melbourne, “natural navigator” Tristan Gooley in Portsmouth, and writers on Delhi and Newcastle, Cairo and Wellington.Laura Laker casts a critical eye on the performance of Vision Zero, the global city scheme to eliminate traffic deaths.

The government needs to devise a holistic plan, instead of piecemeal approaches towards street management.”Paul Zimmerman, the CEO of Designing Hong Kong, a nonprofit devoted to improving urban planning in the city, describes the Mong Kok closure as “an absolute failure in walkability”. “The case has dramatically highlighted the failures in Hong Kong’s regime of street management,” he says. “These need to be resolved.”Hong Kong is renowned for its multi-layered pedestrian networks – at street level, below ground and above ground. These provide the necessary capacity in crowded high-density areas, and provide options that are especially relevant during typhoon season and throughout the city’s hot and humid summers. They also provide great connectivity to mass transit stations.“Pedestrians always come as a second thought during development,” adds Ip. “For a better living environment in Hong Kong, the needs of pedestrians should be the priority over the traffic.”Although it has been slow to come, there are some signs of change. Last year the government announced its commitment to strengthening Hong Kong’s position as a world-class walkable city.So far, projects have focused on ensuring the majority of future residences and workplaces are situated within walking distance of transportation nodes, services and other amenities, which will be connected by pedestrian-friendly or pedestrian-only walking environments such as precincts and station squares. Areas to benefit from this include the Kai Tak development area, Kwun Tong North and Hung Shui Kiu.The retrofitting of densely developed urban areas has also been a priority. A number of quick-win pedestrian improvement measures – such as footpath widening and pedestrian signals – have been installed in the Kowloon Bay and Kwun Tong business areas. The government also worked with Transport for London on a HK$3m (£293,000) project to display street signs showing maps and walking guides in the city’s bustling Tsim Sha Tsui shopping district.Pedestrianisation schemes in other parts of the city – busy neighbourhoods like Causeway Bay, Central, Jordan and Stanley – have been less controversial than Mong Kok. The temporary transformation of a 200-metre section of Des Voeux Road in Hong Kong’s Central Business District into a pedestrian precinct was also well received, with 50,000 people enjoying street soccer, a library, gym, picnic area and music.Planners like Ng believe the government should trial these types of schemes more frequently. “I don’t think the government or authorities should just close a pedestrian zone down,” says Ng. “I think our government needs to be more courageous and experimental in allowing the community to experiment with trial and error.”David Sim, a creative director of Gehl Architects, and his team have worked in China for 10 years designing pedestrian routes in cities like Beijing, Chongqing and Shanghai. “I think it’s important to experiment with this kind of urban change,” he says. “The city and its citizens need to be taken on a journey, and that might be easier if you take smaller steps. It might start with an exceptional event to give people a one-off, new experience – like a street party or sports event – then continue as a more regular but still temporary change, and as the culture and behaviour evolves, the changes can develop further and perhaps become more permanent.”Sim is quick to add that projects can be quite modest too: “Even a low cost project can make a dramatic difference to urban life. It can actually be cheap to be nice to people.”We’re eager to hear your thoughts and experiences of walking in cities.

Alexa’s light bar twinkled like Knight Rider’s sentient car, Kitt. “I’m fine, how are you?” she answered flatly. When I repeated the question, just to see what this baby could do, she said, marginally less sullenly: “Great! Ready to help.”The main thing about robots and voice-activation software in general is that, as per the creepy Joaquin Phoenix movie Her, they imperil us by generating actual emotions: in my case, fooling me into bonding with a 10in-high cylindrical speaker. It’s true that a few years ago, when I first bought a Roomba robotic vacuum cleaner, I was inclined to apologise to it when I got in its way. It’s also true that when Alexa’s perimeter flashes red to indicate poor signal health, I feel a surge of emotion.The problem is not the emotion itself, nor the anthropomorphising of an inanimate object I can look at the spine of a book and feel my heart leap, just as a child can remove two salt and vinegar crisps from a packet and enthusiastically make them converse.Instead, the problem with Alexa is that the overwhelming emotion it generates is negative. When it’s working, it’s invisible. But it is subject to frequent glitches, at which point one starts to take Alexa more personally. More than once in the last fortnight I have found myself yelling, much louder than the receptivity of the speaker requires: “Alexa, play BBC Radio 4,” followed by: “What is wrong with you?”It has had the same effect on my kids. A visitor to my apartment, wanting to test out Alexa’s range, asked her to play an obscure local UK radio station, which she seamlessly did – and then it promptly got stuck on. “Alexa, stop!” said my daughter, later that day, apparently uninterested in news of train delays in North Yorkshire. Alexa didn’t stop. “Alexa, stop!” she repeated. At the third, ignored directive there were baffled tears.“She’s not listening,” I said, and realised this was not the right response. “It’s a computer, like the phone. There must be a signal problem.” There are so many positives to the Echo: my kids can play music without\u0026nbspinterfacing with a screen, or breaking in half yet another CD I can travel much further in my listening habits than I would with a more hands-on device. But as I hear my family snap, growl and cry at the cone in the corner, it seems possible that the cost is a mildly\u0026nbspabusive relationship."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64f386a0135d525cd9f813ea079b50065d353674/0_41_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e95df969f352c6ace5e0e0b2c3d0036","title":"brexit eu theresa may salzburg she seeking impossible","story":"Substantial Brexit progress was never on the agenda for the EU’s Salzburg summit in Austria, so its absence comes as no surprise. More revealing is what the gathering says about the balance of power: European leaders can send Theresa May away humiliated and empty-handed, and still imagine they have done her a favour.May was given 10 minutes to address her fellow heads of government over dinner last night, but no subsequent discussion was permitted because, formally, Brexit terms are negotiated with Michel Barnier and the European commission. Any British hopes that those lines might blur at Salzburg and more productive channels might then open up behind Barnier’s back were dashed. Concluding the summit, Donald Tusk, the European council president, re-affirmed member state solidarity behind the commission process. He also said bluntly that the economic aspect of May’s Chequers blueprint for Brexit “will not work.”None of this looks like the diplomacy that was promised by those hardline Eurosceptics who insisted that the EU needed the UK more than the UK needed Europe. There would be cake to have and cake to eat the negotiations would simply be over the colour of the icing. Instead, the raw arithmetic of 27-to-one asserted itself. The prime minister’s advocacy of the Chequers plan has become a plea for mercy, although Tusk politely pretends the relationship is more balanced than that. European leaders can see how little room for manoeuvre May has in parliament and with her party.The timetable for Brexit talks has been stretched to swerve around the Conservative conference coming up in Birmingham, but not by much. Talk of an emergency summit in November, allowing some slippage from a scheduled deadline in October, sounded more provisional from the EU side than it does when UK officials have been organising their diaries.The British side had also hoped that some friendlier theatrics might have been staged at Salzburg to present May as the tough negotiator – some choreography of clash and concession to advertise the prime minister’s effectiveness. But there is a gap between what EU leaders think is a compromise with May (hinting that some kind of bespoke deal could yet evolve from Chequers) and what May can exchange for hard political currency back home. And on the substance – specifically the Irish border impasse – they cannot pretend there is progress if there is none.May’s weakness in Westminster still gives her one point of leverage in the negotiations – the alternative to dealing with her with little time to spare, is dealing with someone worse with no time at all. The prospect of, say, Boris Johnson emerging as his party’s champion from the rubble of a collapsed Brexit process is sufficient to focus minds in Brussels.Some EU officials and leaders see the risk that constructive British engagement with the European project could die along with May’s premiership. They see a messy Brexit provoking a lurch into something more like marauding, anti-Brussels, Trumpian nationalism. A faction of the Tory party is already saddling up for that journey.There is also the prospect of another referendum coming into focus over May’s shoulder although she pretends not to see it. In the past 24 hours, both the Maltese and Czech prime ministers have made encouraging noises about Britain reconsidering the whole Brexit enterprise – and being unanimously welcomed back into the fold. That might be overstating it. Across the EU there are many pools of sorrow at the UK’s 2016 decision to leave, but there are also now strong currents of impatience. Much goodwill was frittered away in the period when Tory ministers were making ludicrous Brexit pronouncements at home and offering nothing sensible abroad.There is also anxiety about the integrity of the European project that discourages anything that might look like a reward for splitting the union. This view – short-sighted, perhaps, but potent – holds that Euroscepticism must be seen to end badly for the country that has taken it furthest. But the punitive urge is not paramount. In Berlin and Brussels, the capitals that still largely set the tone on Brexit, the emphasis is on getting the UK safely off the premises, not on finding ways to hurt us or keep us in.For now, May is the person with whom European leaders have to do business. But, more important, given the alternatives, she is also the person with whom they want to do business. The EU collectively has no interest in undermining or humiliating the prime minister. At the Salzburg summit it didn’t look much like May was getting any favours, but these things are relative. From the continental point of view, she was shown patience, she was indulged.Ultimately the EU cannot give May what she really needs, which is a Brexit model that will simultaneously satisfy the whole Tory party and win support from a majority in the Commons, without inflicting harm on the country. They cannot give her that because it doesn’t exist, never did, never will."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c22742b0be416044aa4c05f09c6403adc6dabf64/77_282_3466_2080/master/3466.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=37fef95b6c06fda153bb5f9e189d1dc9","title":"refugee children face long delays accessing education in uk","story":"Report finds schools unwilling to take refugees over fears their results will be affectedRefugee and asylum-seeking children face long delays accessing education after arriving in the UK, in many cases because schools are reluctant to offer them a place over fears they will lower GCSE results and affect school league tables.Research by the children’s charity Unicef, seen exclusively by the , found not a single region in the UK had successfully met the 20-school-day target for finding places for all the unaccompanied asylum-seeking children (UASC) in their care.The report, which is the first to provide a comprehensive national picture of the educational experience of children arriving in the UK, says young people trying to get into secondary schools and further education face the longest delays, with up to a quarter waiting for more than three months for a place and some up to a year.Other delaying factors include complex online applications, the fragmented school admissions system and a lack of expertise within authorities to help with cases as a result of cuts to the number of specialist UASC teams. Temporary housing and time-consuming age checks to make sure refugees who present themselves as children are in fact school-age are also issues.The report identifies a shortage of places for children with special educational needs (SEN) – more than a third of Syrian children arriving in the UK have autism, mobility or hearing issues – though Syrian children are found places quicker than other groups thanks to a well-organised resettlement scheme.Academies and selective grammar schools are “particularly problematic”. In the case of academies, which are overseen by Whitehall rather than local authorities, an application has to be made to the education secretary, Damian Hinds, to direct a school to accept a pupil, rather than to the local authority in the case of community schools, which is quicker. The report’s author, Catherine Gladwell, of the Refugee Support Council, said concerns that a recently arrived child with little English might lower league table results were misplaced because such pupils are exempt from inclusion in school and local authority league tables for two years.She also said that what was happening in the UK was in fact encouraging when seen in a global context. “Children do have a right to education regardless of immigration status. The problem is to do with the implementation of policies.“The most remarkable thing we saw was the enormous enthusiasm for education among these children. If you give these children education you are giving them a key to unlock a more positive and hopeful future.“But we found challenges in every region, both at the point of access and once they are in schools. There’s an awful lot of good practice out there – if that good practice can be promoted and replicated there’s real reason to be optimistic.”Once refugee and asylum-seeking children are in education there are further obstacles. Their learning can be impeded by trauma and mental health difficulties, bullying and a lack of awareness and expertise among some school staff.One secondary schoolteacher said: “Last year I had five year 11 boys that were all UASC ... I didn’t know that some of them had experienced such huge trauma, I didn’t know what they had suffered on their journeys, didn’t know about their nightmares … I didn’t know what was going on in their heads.Another professional described trying to help a girl who had witnessed the hanging of her grandparents in Syria to deal with the resulting trauma.Small numbers of newly arrived children are put into inappropriate alternative provision, including pupil referral units (PRU) designed to cater for children excluded from mainstream school. “In the worst scenario, yes, it happens,” said one worker. “It’s outrageous, really unacceptable. I visited and there were kids kicking off and swearing and kicking and shouting.“It happened against all of our advice … But it’s to do with covering your back because at least if they’re in a PRU you can say they’re in education. My experience is that it has a really negative impact on their learning.”Financial pressures on schools and local authorities combined with the growing number of pupils requiring a secondary school place are playing a part in the delays.The report’s findings are based on responses to freedom of information requests to 205 local authorities in England, Wales and Scotland, as well as in-depth interviews with a focus group made up of 86 children.A quarter of the children in the focus group said they had experienced bullying since starting school. Mental health issues also emerged as a key barrier, leading to problems with concentration in class, absenteeism because of nightmares and insomnia, self-harm and suicide attempts.The Department for Education has been approached for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5112a2e27c5de556f3439ba019e25f9c64feeead/0_114_4722_2833/master/4722.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4096254249dcbbdae4e46eef50129c7a","title":"max mara milan fashion week","story":"Classic works of literature were name-checked and updated in a show that put outerwear centre stageLooking back to look forward has become a bit of a ruse in fashion. Yet few designers tend to go as far back as Max Mara, which revisited the 800BC Greek myths for its spring-summer show in Milan that was partly about women, partly about the weather, but was mostly a class in classical mythology.The brand’s head designer, Ian Griffiths, had spent the summer reading male-centred legends, rewritten from a woman’s perspective. Among a handful of books, he name-checked Margaret Atwood’s The Penelopiad and Homer’s The Iliad, told from the viewpoint of Odysseus’ long-suffering wife, Penelope.Atwood has become something of a cultural touchstone, not least in fashion, where even the smallest flash of red is attributed to the robes worn by the women in The Handmaid’s Tale. But if her righteous retelling of The Iliad was about women and power, it would also prove to be a window into the Max Mara woman’s psyche in 2019.The collection shown on Thursday morning was aimed at “that slick, well-dressed woman that’s one part warrior, one part ocean goddess – but not in a hokey way”, with a focus on silhouette rather than colour. Skirts and jackets, the Max Mara twinset, came pinched at the waist. Elsewhere, blazers were reimagined to boxy shapes or looser fitting, and sat below the knee. The layering had more of a spring bent, with light woollen jackets worn under open macs.Midway, there was a flurry of polka dots. “I wanted to concentrate on texture and not print,” Griffiths said. “So I chose an elemental gestural spot.” A polka-dot trenchcoat version worn by Halima Aden, the Somali-American model who became the first woman in a hijab to appear on a Vogue cover, caused the most chatter, though the fact that most of the models wore headscarves and sunglasses with cords attached – “modern armour in the city” – erted any further attention.The most obvious allusions to the female warrior were the power shoulder – with a single arm jutting out from under coated tops, peplum vests or peeking out from under one of the coats – and the gaiters. These protective overshoes are designed for a damp ramble in the Lakes, or for going to war, but here they were reimagined in luxe, tight-coated fabrics.Much has been made recently of whether Naomi Campbell has the right to patent her walk, and many models at the show appeared to imitate her hands-on-hips swagger. It was in keeping with the general intimidating vibe.Having fleshed out a new code that places women not just at the forefront, but in a role once occupied by men, Griffiths moved closer to home by paying homage to the French stylist Anne-Marie Beretta, who in the 1980s created Max Mara’s tailored suits, which played with proportions, collar size and asymmetrical lines. “Our own legend,” laughed Griffiths.As for the weather, that’s where the bonded trenchcoats came into play. “Summer is not summery anymore – you need a raincoat, a trench, un imperméable” he said backstage. “It rained in Milan all of July … by the end of summer our gardens were dead.”The coat, Max Mara’s bread and butter, was also due an appearance, especially given that it contributes largely to the company’s rumoured net worth of $2bn (£1.5m). And so it was that the show opened with a long navy trenchcoat, and closed with the model Gigi Hadid wearing one, and the front row visibly relaxed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc7ee9349394eb08405f37f85e983e1c8fb715fc/0_0_5040_3360/master/5040.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5183a1f552d212577822dd977101728a 700w","title":"20 best music documentaries ranked rock pop","story":"We rate the best films on the music scene down the decades, from Bob Dylan to Blur, Anvil to Amy WinehouseCharming Belgian TV presenter Marcel Vanthilt tries to get to grips with the New York rap scene.

Car-crash highlights include Damon Albarn falling off a speaker and John Peel expressing amusing indifference to their music.Canvey Island pub-rock combo Dr Feelgood get the movie treatment from The Great Rock’n’Roll Swindle director Julien Temple.Asif Kapadia’s Oscar-winning film about Amy Winehouse expertly stitches together everything from home movies brimming with hope to end-of-the-line concert appearances when the jig was truly up.The unsung voices behind the stars finally get their due in this story of backup singers including Darlene Love and Judith Hill.Wim Wenders has always been drawn to misfits, from Patricia Highsmith’s Ripley in The American Friend to Harry Dean Stanton as the eternal wanderer in Paris, Texas. He brought his taste for the outsider experience to this film about the Cuban ensemble making its first trip to America.Turmoil is a gift to the music documentary. Wilco were up to their eyes in it soon after the photographer Sam Jones started filming them: they shed two of their members and got dropped by their label. Out of the chaos, a great album (Yankee Hotel Foxtrot) and a revealing film emerged.The recent Nick Cave documentaries One More Time with Feeling and 20,000 Days on Earth showcase a mature and reflective artist. For unsparing grit and grime, there’s Uli M Schueppel’s black-and-white film of the Bad Seeds’ 1989 US tour, heavy on the boredom and frustrations of life on the road.Michel Gondry documents the on-and-off-stage sights of a 2004 Bed-Stuy bash thrown by Chappelle, who bussed in members of the public from his home town of Dayton, Ohio. Performers include Kanye West and Lauryn Hill the political commentary is low-frequency but consistent, with Fred Hampton Jr, son of a murdered Black Panther and chairman of the Prisoners of Conscience Committee, telling the crowd: “Hands up, eyes open, fists clenched.”The wild creativity of the folk musician Daniel Johnston turns out to be inseparable from his woes as he struggles with bipolar disorder. He sings! He preaches! He attacks his manager with a lead pipe! Through it all, the director Jeff Feuerzeig maintains a sympathetic eye.Part-documentary, part-staged reality (a technique that the film’s co-director, Jack Hazan, had pioneered in his David Hockney doc A Bigger Splash), this inserts a fictional roadie into the real world of The Clash on tour. A scorching and often ugly portrait of a band at a full pelt and a country in decline.There is no shortage of Rolling Stones documentaries, from Godard’s One Plus One aka Sympathy For the Devil and Robert Frank’s little-seen Cocksucker Blues to Martin Scorsese’s more recent Shine a Light. But the cream of the crop, the absolute Exile on Main Street of the bunch, is the Maysles brothers’ account of the band before, during and after the horror of Altamont.Lyrical filmmaker Paul Kelly finds Lawrence, lead singer of indie gods Felt, glam pasticheurs Denim and Casio-pop pioneers Go-Kart Mozart, somewhat on his uppers. He faces eviction from his council flat as he records a new album. Yet in his refusal to sell out, Lawrence is an enduring symbol of artistic purity. Explaining his resilience, he says: “No one else has got this far, and failed.”Alongside Some Kind of Monster and DiG!, this is another slice of cringingly frank mid-noughties verité, the key difference being that the group in question, a Canadian metal outfit, came within sniffing distance of fame without ever quite making it big. A reunion tour provides a near-as-dammit real-life equivalent to Spinal Tap.Penelope Spheeris directed the first film about the American response to punk, with interviews and performances from Circle Jerks, X and Black Flag, the menace of the latter tempered by dumpy frontman Darby Crash, known to cover himself with peanut butter and e through broken glass to disguise the fact that his band couldn’t play. Quality control stayed high for Spheeris’s follow-ups, Parts II (about metal) and III (homeless punks).This film diary of the Sex Pistols’ fateful 1978 US tour zig-zags between the Stateside vaudeville and interviews from back home with establishment figures closing their ears to the yelps of punk (“I’m not going to listen to what they say until they learn to enunciate clearly and speak properly in the Queen’s English”). A grimly compelling highlight is the footage of Sid Vicious and Nancy Spungen lolling in bed like the anti-John-and-Yoko.Two bands for the price of one: The Dandy Warhols take the fast train to fame and adulation while their brothers-in-psychedelia, The Brian Jonestown Massacre, languish in semi-obscurity, their integrity intact, their sanity perhaps less so. Ondi Timoner boiled down a staggering 1,500 hours of footage to create this study of luck and self-sabotage in rock’n’roll.Metal behemoths Metallica quietly fall apart in this long but spellbinding documentary which finds them plagued by indecision and uncertainty as they grapple with their incomparable success. With one band member gone and another entering rehab, the band members submit to a “performance enhancement coach” who insinuates himself creepily into the creative process.DA Pennebaker’s fingerprints are all over music cinema (Monterey Pop, Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars). But his masterpiece follows a restless, searching Bob Dylan as he tours Britain in 1965, confronting journalists, holding court among some peers (Joan Baez, Alan Price), sneering at others (sorry, Donovan) and, with the Subterranean Homesick Blues cue-cards sequence, helping to invent the pop promo.Part of the alchemy of a great music documentary is catching the subject at exactly the right moment, and Alek Keshishian couldn’t have trained his cameras on Madonna at a better time. In the midst of the inventive and influential Blonde Ambition tour, he finds a self-possessed genius who is a magnet for controversy, as well as for other stars: Warren Beatty announces that Madonna “doesn’t want to live off-camera”, Antonio Banderas resists her advances, Kevin Costner gets roundly insulted. But this thrilling film, split between black-and-white for off-stage and colour for on, gives the lion’s share of screen time to the squabbling, excitable dancers who comprise the singer’s extended family."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c4bdf5f8f8266c4aeaa0bae1883b02be0e420db1/268_542_6147_3688/master/6147.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=43a202744318979766ae94bf6c11412b","title":"cary fukunaga exclusive interview new james bond director netflix maniac","story":"He is replacing Danny Boyle, but the Californian may not be the safest pair of hands – he’s no stranger to walking from projects and his latest series, Maniac, is a mind-bending trip into psychotropic drugs‘Have I done psychotropic drugs?” Cary Fukunaga considers the question and laughs. “Yeah. Just an aesthetic amount, which is basically just enjoying yourself.” He hasn’t had the full, guided experience, he says, “where your mind is turned inside out. But I wouldn’t mind. I’m curious about it.”This curiosity is evident in the 41-year-old director’s new TV show, Maniac, which centres on pharmaceutical drug trials and takes viewers inside the minds of their human guinea pigs and off into fantastical realities. Fukunaga excels at such world building, from his gothic-tinged Jane Eyre to child soldier drama Beasts of No Nation, not to mention the debut season of the noir horror True Detective.No doubt these skills are what helped seal the deal when the producers of James Bond signed up the director after Danny Boyle dropped out at the last minute. The announcement came just days after our interview. So what clues can Maniac, as well as Fukunaga’s other work, give us as to what we can expect of 007’s 25th outing?Well, there will almost certainly be some intriguing gadgets. The retro future of Maniac boasts chess-playing android koalas, tiny sanitation robots and a depressed computer. Technically, the show is a remake of the 2014 Norwegian series of the same name, which Fukunaga hasn’t seen. “Not out of any disregard,” he says. He just liked the conceit of “a show with delusions”.The original Maniac concerned a mental institution. But in early talks with Emma Stone, who stars in the new version, launching this week on Netflix, the pair decided to stay away from anything that could be seen as making fun of mental illness, instead anchoring it on drug trials that aim to eradicate unnecessary human pain. Stone plays Annie opposite Jonah Hill’s Owen – damaged souls who, once strapped in, become other characters in other worlds, whether they like it or not. Amid all the surrealism, Maniac is littered with moments of real trauma. The first trial sees the guinea pigs taking a pill that makes them relive the most devastating moment of their lives. It’s not unlike people’s experiences with ayahuasca, which supposedly purges users of their demons (as well as the contents of their stomachs). Fukunaga says such substances didn’t influence the show at script stage but, before shooting began, he read an article about the therapeutic use of psilocybin and LSD studies. He was fascinated.“All of these things that open up gateways in the mind – there must be something there. The mind is so complicated, we don’t understand it at all yet,” he says, citing studies exploring how the trauma of previous generations can affect us. “Say your grandmother was in the Holocaust. That gets imprinted on the DNA. The maze to understanding how we carry all these things – I think it’s amazing.”Maniac allowed Fukunaga to work through his own issues, too. Almost all of the concepts on screen, as well as dialogue, come from conversations he had with co-writer Patrick Somerville. “It’s Patrick and I wrestling with our internal demons,” he says. “We’re almost working out our own understanding of ourselves.” So their conversations about therapy for a show about therapy were genuinely therapeutic? “In terms of me being fixed now, no. But it was definitely illuminating.”Fukunaga has always looked for answers in his work, and one can’t help wondering if the Bond template can accommodate such yearning. Will he be able to avoid friction with the famously controlling 007 producers, who have allowed directors little leeway in stamping their iniduality on the franchise, as Boyle appears to have found to his cost? We shall have to wait to find out. Like Boyle, Fukunaga has been known to walk from projects, but filming begins in March next year with a release planned for February 2020, assuming all goes smoothly.Fukunaga was raised in California, the son of a Japanese-American father born in a second world war Japanese internment camp and a Swedish-American mother. They orced when he was four, and his father went on to marry an Argentine woman, while his mother married a Mexican-American. From that point on, he straddled their worlds, moving about, spending periods in Mexico, absorbing cultures. As a teenager in Berkeley, he wished he was black instead of “the weird half-Asian kid, which didn’t seem like something to grab on to. I discovered Roots and Malcolm X. It was a golden age of hip-hop.”In Maniac, Annie and Owen become various characters in other times and places via pills that send them to alternate realities in their minds. Does that come from his own early searches for self? “It’s more about the different people we carry inside of us. I don’t think there was a black man inside of me,” he says with a laugh. “I was trying to find an identity, more than anything. Trying to figure out what my identity was.”Due to his eclectic roots and upbringing, he didn’t know where he belonged, and felt outside of himself. Writing stories helped, and his early films – immigration drama Sin Nombre then Jane Eyre – were “starting to scratch the surface of identity. And eventually you start looking deeper.”The first scripts of True Detective, about two cops on the trail of a serial killer in Louisiana, had already been written when Fukunaga was hired, but he brought his own aesthetic – most famously episode four’s six-minute tracking shot, which earned him an Emmy for outstanding directing. Not that he got caught up in the show’s success: by that point, he had isolated himself in a house with no internet access, writing Beasts of No Nation, which he’d been planning for 15 years, as well as his adaptation of Stephen King’s psychological clown-horror novel It.Fukunaga had been hired to work on the screenplay for It in 2012. As with the later Maniac, Fukunaga and co-writer Chase Palmer put a lot of their own childhoods into the screenplay, updating the novel’s setting from the 1950s to the 1980s. But in 2015 he jumped ship. “The writing was on the wall that it was going to be a difficult collaboration.” What did the writing say? “There were so many messages on that wall,” he says. “It was a neon sign by the end.” A non-disclosure prevents him from elaborating, but he did recently suggest that studio executives feared they couldn’t control him. Why did he think that? “You could just tell by the way they were acting.”It troubles him. “You’re still a human being, you still have feelings,” he says. “Especially if you’re a creative person. You’re sensitive. You get labelled in ways that aren’t you, and that’s frustrating.” More frustration followed, when he spent a year and a half adapting Caleb Carr’s Victorian-set serial-killer novel The Alienist for television, only to leave that after 18 months because of budgeting and scheduling problems. The final product, he says, was very different to what he had been developing.Clearly, Fukunaga doesn’t settle for anything less than exactly what he wants. It is sometimes difficult for him to articulate what he’s looking for, he says, but it’s there – a feeling or a vision. He talks about a scene in Beasts of No Nation in which he wanted the family to come out of a church on a grassy hill, with a specific idea in his head of what that church and hill looked like. He hunted for it. “I had a motorcycle and I would go out by myself on the weekends and just look around. You’re like a bloodhound, there’s a whiff: ‘Just over that ridge, hopefully there’s that thing I have in my mind.’ And the spooky thing is, sometimes you find it. We found that church. It existed.”All of this brings to mind Stanley Kubrick, also famously allergic to cutting corners. It’s no surprise then that Fukunaga is an enormous fan. After True Detective aired, he was hired to adapt and direct Kubrick’s unmade Napoleon film as a Steven Spielberg-produced mini-series for HBO, under the guidance of Kubrick’s long-time executive producer Jan Harlan. “We want to carry the torch in a way that embodies the spirit of what he was trying to achieve,” says Fukunaga, visibly excited. In a couple of weeks he will head to the library in Kubrick’s St Albans home to continue work with Harlan.“I’ve been there once before,” he says. “You can become jaded, working in this industry for so long, but there are moments like, ‘Holy fuck. I’m on holy, holy ground.’” Well, quite: Kubrick is buried there in the garden. He nods. “Jan brought me to his grave and introduced me to him,” he says, awed. “That was a momentous occasion.” No need for the psychotropics.• Maniac is on Netflix from 21 September."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a5db320e10cb17ccdcf65dff1d049405aa31ecf/403_57_1046_628/master/1046.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b6d74ce2036964ca4473bda46d0d32d5","title":"liverpool impress ronaldo ridiculousness and cows cows cows football weekly extra","story":"Max is joined by Barry Glendenning, Lars Sivertsen and Jonathan Wilson to discuss the Champions League, Ronaldo’s red, the timekeeping skills of cows and Mark Hughes’s elusive smileJoin the conversation on Facebook, Twitter and email.

For me the highlight was Liverpool’s late victory against Paris Saint-Germain to maintain their brilliant unbeaten start to the season.I said in my opening column that I believed Liverpool would be the team to mount a serious title challenge to Manchester City this season. Well they’ve certainly proved that with six wins in a row, and while I understood but disagreed with Gary Neville’s comments that they should sacrifice the Champions League for the Premier League, I think it will be very difficult for Liverpool to win both in the same season. They certainly have a very strong, dynamic and now consistent starting XI but I question if they have the depth in the squad to do it, although you definitely can’t write them off after they reached the Champions League final last season with some fantastic performances. I think the only real challengers in the Premier League are Manchester City so it might come down to the head-to-head between them in a few weeks’ time.I always love watching Roberto Firmino, Sadio Mané and Mohamed Salah combining but they are only able to be that effective on the counterattack because of the hard work of players such as James Milner and Naby Keïta behind them, who are constantly pressing in midfield to win the ball back. Milner, Keïta and Georginio Wijnaldum are really diligent players who act like servants to the front three. I would not say any of the Liverpool midfield are stars, whereas other teams have players such as Kevin De Bruyne or Paul Pogba who are not expected to sacrifice themselves for the team so much.Then there is the defence, which has only improved since Virgil Van Dijk signed. Joe Gomez is an exciting player who plays almost like he has a Cuban cigar in his mouth – he reminds me a lot of Rio Ferdinand because he is quick, very good on the ball and passes it well through the midfield lines. I was pleased to see him get into the England team because we need more defenders who aren’t afraid to do that alongside John Stones who I think epitomises the “creative” centre-half.The Liverpool front three all have different qualities but if I had to pick one it would be Salah. He has everything – he can score with both feet, he’s quick and can beat a player but has also stayed really humble. He has a great back story as well, having not always succeeded and having had to come back from failure in the Premier League.It’s really hard when you’ve hit those kind of numbers the previous season but just because you don’t replicate them it doesn’t mean you’re not doing the same things. That’s what is so good about Liverpool – when Salah isn’t scoring then Firmino or Mané, or even Daniel Sturridge is. It was the same with Barcelona when they had Lionel Messi, Luis Suárez and Neymar and you could always rely on one of them to score. Maybe that has been the problem with Tottenham Hotspur because if Harry Kane is not scoring, there aren’t as many seasoned goalscorers to step up. I think there has been a bit of an overreaction to their third successive defeat but I’m not surprised they have hit a bump in the road.Spurs always seem to fall just short as challengers for the league – I remember in 2016 when they were chasing Leicester and failed to win crucial games towards the end of the season, including that feisty affair against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. It is better to get a bad run out the way early than have it later on.Tottenham decided against going for Wilfried Zaha in the summer, although there are no guarantees Zaha would have suited them and excel in the way he currently does at Crystal Palace. He’s already had a move to a big club and it was a disaster. I’ve met Wilfried a few times and he is a very normal and simple guy. He has a lot of family down in Croydon but absolutely failed at Manchester United – or was not given the opportunity to succeed, whichever way you choose to look at it – so that shows it’s not always a case of being a big fish in a big pond. Often it works out to be a big fish in a smaller pond, which Zaha is at Palace.If you look at Ruben Loftus-Cheek, who was at Palace on loan last season, now he is back at Chelsea he can’t get a game. Then there’s Marcus Rashford, who I think should leave Manchester United because I don’t think it’s going to get any better under José Mourinho. He needs to go somewhere he can be a bigger fish.It was interesting to see Zaha’s comments about needing more protection because I think that is something players need to be more forthright about. Pep Guardiola mentioned it last season when there was an awful tackle on Leroy Sané and the minute you raise the issue in the media, I think referees pay attention and start trying to protect players.People have said Zaha should take it as a compliment but that’s not easy when you’re being chopped down every two seconds. As a quick, tricky player, I’ve been told that I don’t go down enough because I’ve always tried to stay on my feet or I don’t win clever fouls around the box. But when you are quick, the fastest way to be stopped is by being fouled so it happens to me a lot, even if I don’t always maximise the opportunity. What Zaha is saying is that exciting players such as him need more protection and I think he is right to say so and hopefully we will see him benefit from being vocal.It has been a great week at Juventus preparing for our first league game on Sunday. Even better news off the pitch is that Sky acquired the rights to the Serie A women’s league so there will be a live game every week on TV. This is a big step in Italy and an indication of a growing appetite for broadcasters and fans to showcase the women’s game. Exciting times.

Bernd Leno’s shirt, hanging on a shoogly peg.The big news for Arsenal is the long-awaited debut of goalkeeper Bernd Leno. He’s one of eight changes to the team, replacing Petr Cech. Lucas Torreira makes his first start for the Gunners, shoring up the midfield alongside Mohamed Elneny, who appears for the first time this season. For the record, the three starters left standing from last weekend’s victory at Newcastle are Sokratis Papastathopoulos, Nacho Monreal and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang.It’s been nearly a quarter of a century since Arsenal won a European trophy, Alan Smith, Parma, all that. There was some serious talent on display in Copenhagen that night of the 1994 Cup Winners Cup final: Smith, Paul Merson, Tony Adams, Lee Dixon, Nigel Winterburn, David Seaman, Thomas Brolin, Faustino Asprilla, Roberto Sensini, Gianfranco Zola. Ian Wright missed out through suspension. God I feel old. What point was I trying to make? Ah yes.They’ve had some near scrapes with triumph since. The 2006 Champions League final against Barcelona, principally, and the 2000 final of this competition’s predecessor, the Uefa Cup, against Galatasaray. But poor old Arsene Wenger was destined never to win a cup on the continent. For a wee while earlier this year, the fairytale swansong was on. But Atletico Madrid had too much savvy in the semis, and that was that.Wenger’s successor, however, is a man who knows exactly how to go about the Europa League. Unai Emery has won it three times with Sevilla only Giovanni Trapattoni can claim a similar haul in Europe’s secondary competition. So could this be the start of something special? Well, there’s a long way to go, of course. About 100 games of Uefa’s bloated format if memory serves. But a fast start tonight will get folk dreaming of glory.And there’s a fair chance of that. Tonight’s opponents Vorskla Poltava will be no pushovers, qualifying after finishing third in Ukraine last season. But the Gunners have a fine home record against teams from Ukraine: two wins over Shakhtar Donetsk, two wins over Dynamo Kyiv, and a draw against Kyiv during a campaign which saw Valeriy Lobanovskyi’s side make it to the semis of the Champions League.

A cross comes in from the right, and Kepa unconvincingly pushes it behind with two forwards onrushing.79 mins: Willian overhits a corner, which goes out of play. Chelsea should have put this game way out of PAOK’s reach, but having missed so many chances seem to be losing belief and making poor decisions. Then Morata has the ball in PAOK’s half and Willian makes a good run beyond the defence, but no pass is forthcoming.77 mins: Willian fizzes a left-foot shot wide from 25 yards.75 mins: This is Chelsea’s least convincing period of the game. They’re still creating chances, but without Jorginho they’re not keeping the ball as well, or moving so fluidly through the gears and up the pitch.72 mins: Pedro lashes a curling shot from just outside the area, saved by Paschalakis. Willian picks up the loose ball and from the most ludicrous angle tries to score, and fails.69 mins: PAOK take off Shakhov and bring on their not-quite-fit top scorer, Aleksandar Prijovic.69 mins: Pedro has recovered, and his fine pass finds Morata running clear. This time he’s fractionally offside, and thus lifts the ball beautifully over the keeper and into the net.68 mins: Pedro runs into Vieirinha, winning a free kick on the left but more importantly looking a bit sore.65 mins: A double change for Chelsea sees Fábregas come on for Jorginho, and Azpilicueta replace Alonso.62 mins: The corner is flicked on at the near post and somehow fizzes through the six-yard box without anyone getting a killer touch. Rudiger got a foot to it, but didn’t really change its trajectory. PAOK make a substitution, bringing Warda on for Pelkas.62 mins: Another chance! Morata brings the ball to the edge of the area and slides it to Alonso, who cuts inside one defender’s desperate e and then shoots into another one’s.60 mins: There wasn’t much to that – Rudiger put out an arm to keep his opponent at bay, and his hand brushed Pelkas’s face.59 mins: Pelkas and Rudiger compete for the ball, and the PAOK player goes down holding his face. The referee is miles away, and waves play on.57 mins: Another Chelsea chance! Pedro wins the ball on the right, keeps it in and crosses. Barkley’s header has plenty of power but hits Morata, and the rebound falls to Willian who blazes over!53 mins: The game continues to be played almost entirely in PAOK’s half, but either the home side can’t get out of it or Chelsea can’t get far enough into it.49 mins: The first chance of the second half: Barkley plays in Pedro on the right, who cuts inside into traffic and passes back to Barkley, who shuffles it on to Willian, who shoots low straight at the goalkeeper, who doesn’t let it bobble under his body this time.The players are back out. Will Chelsea get the loads more goals their performance so far has deserved? It’s time to find out!Looks like there were freebies up for grabs in the Chelsea end pre-match. But the best thing about their pre-match crisp hand-out is the complete lack of interest. It’s rare to see a club chairman being so profoundly ignored.45+1 mins: The goalkeeper thing is catching! I mean, the lack of catching is catching. The ball comes in (there’s a bit of shirt-pulling by Barkley in the box, missed by the referee) and Kepa comes out and pushes it lamely into the air. It’s cleared, though, and with that the referee blows his whistle.45 mins: PAOK have won a few free kicks over the last few minutes, and they’ve just won another, on the left wing. Could they magic up a just-before-half-timely goal?41 mins: Jabá taps the ball through Alonso’s legs and is pushed over for his troubles. PAOK’s moment of the match so far.40 mins: Paschalakis has caught a corner! He just came out and caught it in his hands!40 mins: Chelsea’s good players are looking really terrific. Willian, Pedro, Alonso, all great. Barkley and Jorginho as well. It’s extremely one-sided, but not dull.39 mins: And another! From the corner Morata heads the ball across goal and just wide of the far post.38 mins: Chelsea miss another great chance! It’s a lovely break, Willian playing a fabulous blind pass to Alonso on the left, Alonso playing a fabulous sighted pass to Pedro, and the Spaniard, clean through, sidefooting lamely at the goalkeeper.36 mins: Another Chelsea corner. It nearly curls in at the far post, with the goalkeeper again all at sea. But then it doesn’t.33 mins: PAOK have their best spell of possession of the match so far. It ends within three seconds of them finally entering Chelsea’s half.29 mins: Chelsea move the ball down the left really very well indeed, but Willian’s cross is too hard, and behind everyone, and the threat ends.27 mins: Another shot from Morata, who dummies past a defender, shifts the ball onto his left foot and drives the ball over the bar.25 mins: This is extremely one-sided. Still, Chelsea need a second goal because it only takes a second to score etc and so forth.22 mins: Jaba runs with the ball into the Chelsea half, looks up, sees nobody is offering support, carries on, looks up, carries on, looks up and finally wins a throw-in. He turns and screams at his team-mates because of their lack of assistance.19 mins: Another chance! Rudiger picks out Morata with an excellent pass over the entire PAOK team, and the striker’s first touch is excellent. The second, sadly, sends the ball across goal and wide with his left foot.16 mins: The crowd whistles and howls as Chelsea continue to hog the ball. The move fizzles out when Alonso’s chipped pass bounces out of Willian’s reach.15 mins: A second Chelsea corner, this one headed clear at the near post.14 mins: Now Chelsea win a corner, and Paschalakis comes off his line but gets nowhere near it. The ball is headed wide at the far post, and anyway the referee gives a free kick for some slight foul on the goalkeeper.12 mins: PAOK win another corner, though Christensen seems aghast that the linesman decided he touched the ball. This time Varela wins the header, but the ball flies well over the bar.10 mins: Chelsea threaten again! Pedro crosses from the right and Morata, at the near post, heads wide of the near post when well positioned. That could very easily have been 0-2.9 mins: PAOK have changed formation, switching to a front two. They are yet to threaten the goal.The ball breaks kindly to Barkley in midfield, and he carries it forward before playing in Willian, totally unmarked to his left, and his first-time shot squirts under the goalkeeper and bobbles in!3 mins: Jabá, whose squad number is an outlandish 98, wins a free kick on the right, from which the ball is headed behind for a corner. They play the ball back, and then when it is played into the area Pelkas fouls Ross Barkley.2 mins: The action so far has largely involved Chelsea repeatedly passing the ball amongst themselves, and then back to Kepa.1 min: And they’re off! Chelsea get the game under way.The players are out of the tunnel, and have completed their pre-match formalities. The PAOK side is currently in a huddle, something Chelsea don’t seem to consider necessary.The players are in the tunnel. There are a lot of mascots.“It seems Chelsea’s visit has made PAOK somewhat nervous judging by the quantity of bog roll on the table,” notes Ian Copestake.“He played for Aston Villa,” writes Krishna of José Ángel Crespo. “Perhaps you could give puzzles that can’t be answered with a simple google search.”Yeah, but what can’t be answered with a simple Google search? That’s cheating. A peek inside the dressing-rooms at Toumba Stadium. Looks like lots of comfy chairs crowbarred into an awkwardly small space with a total absence of handy clothes hangers and nearby storage space.The Europa League is a very important competition. it’s an unusual competition because at the moment we don’t know all our opponents. Eight new teams will arrive in the second round. It’s a very important competition and I think very difficult.We have changed five players in the starting XI, but we have a lot of matches in a few days so it’s important to change. Not too much, but to change.Angus Domnhall reminds me of another competitive game Chelsea played in Greece. They drew this one too:Uefa in their press kit point out that “Chuba Akpom, José Ángel Crespo and José Alberto Cañas have all played in the English Premier League”. This is true. Akpom made four substitute appearances for Arsenal (total game time: 28 minutes), Cañas made 19 league starts for Swansea, but I defy anyone (bar supporters of the team involved, and even they might struggle) to know off the top of their heads which Premier League side Crespo played for. This from the ’s match report: Here’s some team news from the Toumba Stadium:I note that PAOK’s website assures us that the club “has taken all the necessary measures in order to guarantee a football evening of the highest level”. This is highly encouraging. “We ask every spectator to avoid actions that might result to heavy bans,” they add. This is slightly less encouraging, though perhaps a wise precaution for a club that started the season with a two-point domestic deduction because of the chaotic conclusion to their home game against AEK Athens last season, when after a goal was disallowed their owner invaded the pitch with a gun holstered on his hip to bark threats at the referee. “It is,” AEK’s coach, Manolo Jimenez, concluded, “the kind of thing you expect to see in a Clint Eastwood movie.” PAOK’s nickname is Dikefalos tou Vora, or the Two-Headed Eagle of the North, which is far too interesting to be the kind of thing you expect to see in a Clint Eastwood movie.Match pointer dept: Chelsea have never won, or for that matter lost, a competitive game in Greece. They drew a Champions League round of 16 match at Olympiacos 0-0 in 2008, and a Cup Winners’ Cup game at Aris Thessaloniki ended 1-1 in 1970 (PAOK’s slogan, “One City, One Team”, seems a bit rum given that there are very clearly two major teams in Thessaloniki). And PAOK have never lost to an English side at home, having drawn against Tottenham in this competition in 2011 and beaten Arsenal 1-0 on their way to knocking Arsène Wenger’s side out of the 1997 Uefa Cup.Anyway, here were are. Welcome. Let us enjoy this football evening of the highest level together.Simon will be here shortly for this 5.55pm (BST) kick-off.Meanwhile here’s Sachin Nakrani on a key member of Maurizio Sarri’s squad who hasn’t made the trip …"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1e704d80e671bd72465bacae3e85ccc0b01ff2f/0_1_2280_1368/master/2280.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dadd7871a664cca1ce383162aed8ebde","title":"richard gere baby blessed thanks to dalai lama danny dani dyer","story":"You want to give your yet-to-be-born child the very best in spiritual enlightenment.

It is one of several flats carved out of a former commercial building, measures 4.9m by 4.5m (15ft by 16ft) and has one door and two windows.An analysis of properties listed on popular property websites found there were four homes for sale in London for less than £125,000.The studio is described as an “investment opportunity” in a “central location” by the estate agent Bairstow Eves. But anyone wanting to buy and move into the property will have to evict the existing tenants, who are paying about £600 a month to live there.Despite being nearly four times the median UK wage of £28,677, the £100,000 asking price for the studio has been reduced from £130,000. Since the Brexit vote, prices in London have been flat or falling slightly, although the biggest declines have been in the upper end of the market, with much smaller drops in outer London boroughs.The online estate agent HouseSimple, which compiled the data, said: “Over the past few months, London property prices have noticeably cooled, and many sellers are dropping their prices to attract buyers. But there is still an affordability issue in London, particularly for people on average UK wages.”It calculated that someone on an average salary would have to save for a deposit of nearly £20,000 and secure a mortgage of three times their earnings in order to be able to buy the studio flat.The research excluded houseboats and shared ownership properties. The other properties listed at or below £125,000 in the capital are all studio flats on the edge of the city, apart from a one-bedroom flat listed for sale to “cash buyers only”.Sam Mitchell of HouseSimple said: “The death of the £100,000 property in London was inevitable, but with just four properties on the market at under £125,000, this will very soon be the new price floor for the capital’s property market.“This research highlights the need for properties at the lower end of the market. Shared ownership and help to buy have helped people on average incomes get a foot on the ladder, but both schemes have their critics.“It can be complicated to sell a property if you only have a small stake in it, and expensive to increase your stake, as there are additional costs to consider. While help to buy has been criticised for actually pushing up house prices and providing a vehicle for developers to inflate new build values.This three-bedroom, well-maintained family home is within walking distance of the town centre.Fancy a 200-year-old cottage with lots of character and stunning views in a beautiful Scottish village?

But she tried to downplay their unexpectedly strong criticisms of her Chequers plan.“I have always said these negotiations were going to be tough,” May told reporters. “And at various stages of these negotiations, tactics would be used as part of those negotiations.”May had hoped that EU leaders would give her Chequers plan a warm reception – or at least not actively criticise it – 10 days before she has to face a restive Conservative party at its annual conference next month.But the response of Tusk left May on the defensive, and boosted her political critics at home. “Chequers goes pop,” declared Jacob Rees-Mogg, the chairman of the hard Brexit ERG group, on twitter and he later argued that the prime minister now needed to abandon her plan and instead pursue “a Canada plus free trade deal”.Tusk had forewarned her in their lunchtime meeting,\u0026nbspgiving her an hour to prepare for a press conference in which she appeared nervous and angry, where she was forced to repeat that her proposals could still form the basis of future relationship negotiations at the EU’s October summit and a likely emergency summit in November.May repeatedly defended Chequers, which proposes that the UK share a common rulebook for goods and services after Brexit, because that would help ensure that trade could flow freely across the Irish border. “Our white paper remains the only serious and credible proposal on the table for achieving that objective,” she said.The prime minister also said she would presenter a counter-proposal to resolve the impasse over the Irish backstop, an EU proposal stipulating that if a free trade agreement cannot be signed after Brexit then Northern Ireland would remain in the customs union, creating a trade border down the Irish Sea. But she would not say when the proposals would be made public.The British PM tried to shift the burden for future concessions on to her EU counterparts, saying a deal could be reached “if political will is there on the other side”.The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said of Chequers: “We all agreed on this today, the proposals in their current state are not acceptable.”Critics on the right of the Conservative party repeated their concerns about Chequers before the summit ended. David Davis, the former Brexit secretary, said in a speech on Thursday lunchtime that the EU “will demand more concessions” beyond Chequers to get a deal.“Concessions on free movement, financial contributions and ECJ jurisdiction. The final deal is likely to look an awful lot like membership,” Davis claimed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad397571043a3dd084b4e6efa65886a5931f7a4e/0_569_3761_2257/master/3761.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a621fe69f2bfd4a75ae07fc0bcfb4211","title":"donald tusk demands answer to irish border question next month","story":"European council president rejects UK plan as French president ditches diplomatic nicetiesDonald Tusk, the European council president, has ratcheted up the pressure on Theresa May by rejecting the Chequers plan and warning of a breakdown in the Brexit talks unless she delivers a solution for the Irish border by October – a deadline the British prime minister had already said she will not be able to meet.The stark threat to unravel the talks came as the French president, Emmanuel Macron, broke with diplomatic niceties and accused those of backing Brexit of being liars. “Those who explain that we can easily live without Europe, that everything is going to be all right, and that it’s going to bring a lot of money home are liars,” he said. “It’s even more true since they left the day after so as not to have to deal with it.”The comments came at the end of a leaders’ summit in Salzburg, where May had appealed for the EU to compromise to avoid a no-deal scenario. She had been hoping to take warm words over Chequers into Conservative party conference.Tusk, who moments before his comments had a short meeting with the prime minister, told reporters that he also wanted to wrap up successful talks in a special summit in mid-November.But, in a step designed to pile pressure on the prime minister, he said this would not happen unless the British government came through on its commitment to finding a “precise and clear” so-called backstop solution that would under any future circumstances avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.“Without an October grand finale, in a positive sense of this word, there is no reason to organise a special meeting in November,” Tusk said. “This is the only condition when it comes to this possible November summit.”The deadline of the weekend of 17 and 18 November on the Irish issue is a looming threat to May, who had told the Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, earlier in the day that she did not think it was possible by the October summit for her government and the EU to come to a compromise on the issue.The EU has proposed that Northern Ireland in effect stays in the single market and customs union as the rest of the UK withdraws. The prime minister insists she will not sign up to such a plan, which she claims would economically and constitutionally “dislocate” the UK.Tusk also offered a withering assessment of the economic proposals in the Chequers plan, under which the UK would have a common rulebook with the EU for goods, and benefit from frictionless trade and an independent commercial policy through a bespoke customs arrangement.“It must be clear that there are some issues where we are not ready to compromise and first of all this is our fundamental freedoms and single market and this is why we remain sceptical and critical when it comes to this part of the Chequers proposals,” he said.Macron dismissed May’s suggestion that Chequers was the only solution other than a no-deal scenario.He said of the white paper: “It was a good and brave step by the prime minister. But we all agreed on this today, the proposals in their current state are not acceptable, especially on the economic side of it. The Chequers plan cannot be take it or leave it,” he said.The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, agreed during her press conference that “substantial progress” was needed on the UK’s withdrawal agreement by the next European council meeting in October in order to pave the way for it to be finalised at a special summit in November.Merkel said there was “still a large piece of work” on the separate issue of future trade relations with the UK. The EU27 was “united that, in the matter of the single market, there can be no compromises”, she said.“No one can belong to the single market if they are not part of the single market.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d202b7e48e3e4730a4b7093aa70f90a0137909e4/0_296_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=21907202e798a083c0b7c4183ee45c88","title":"huge rise in ambulance callouts to deal with spice users","story":"Figures prompt concerns from paramedics and police that some areas may be engulfed by synthetic cannabinoidsThere has been a dramatic increase in ambulances being called to deal with people who have taken the dangerous synthetic cannabinoid spice, with paramedics in some areas of England dealing with six times as many affected people compared with last year.The figures have prompted concern from paramedics and police that some areas may be engulfed by the substance, which has become a persistent problem among homeless communities.The warnings come despite it being reclassified as a class B drug more than a year ago. Anyone found to be in possession of it could face up to five years’ imprisonment.Data from West Midlands ambulance service showed a surge in call-outs linked to spice and black mamba (another name for the drug). Numbers went up from 2,890 call-outs between January and July 2017, to 3,233 in the same period a year later.Figures from South Western ambulance service NHS foundation trust (SWASFT) painted a similar picture. Between August 2016 and July 2017, 157 calls were about the synthetic cannabinoid, compared with 960 from August 2017 and July 2018.SWASFT said it had seen a “significant rise” in the number of patients experiencing symptoms from taking spice, but incidents remained a small proportion of the 900,000 annual calls they get.“The effect on the patient can vary considerably our staff often treat legal high users who have suffered seizures, heart attacks and strokes. Some patients are left with long-term illnesses whilst others never wake up,” he said.Police and charities have also warned that use of the psychoactive substance is a big problem.“The reason spice use has gone up is that we have lots of people who are very hurt and not enough resources and time out there to understand what we are working with.”Spice is a manmade chemical with mind-altering effects. It was initially marketed as having effects similar to those of cannabis but is believed to be stronger. Usually the chemicals are sprayed on to plant materials to make it look like marijuana. Those who take spice can experience a faster heart rate and a feeling of confusion. It has been linked to a rising number of emergency department visits and to some deaths.Nick Buckley, the chief executive of the antisocial behaviour reduction charity Mancunian Way, said: “Spice is still a huge problem but it’s not hitting the headlines any more. Its use is epidemic among the rough sleeping community in Manchester city centre. It is the drug of choice.”Buckley said the influence of spice on the vulnerable could be immense. “One gentleman I saw was in his 30s and was almost foaming at the mouth. He was lying on the floor and some teenagers were taking pictures and laughing and trying to provoke him. Members of the public were calling the emergency services and trying to get him to sit up.”Harry Sumnall, a professor in substance use at the Public Health Institute at Liverpool John Moores University, said evidence suggested the harms of spice had not decreased but there was no good data on it. “It’s so regionally specific and tends to be a greater focus of attention where street homelessness is more visible,” he said.Data exclusively obtained by the  through freedom of information requests revealed that the number of police crime reports in which spice is mentioned has risen fivefold from 234 in 2015 to 1,157 last year. Of the 2017 reports, 725 were for drug offences and 432 showed spice was mentioned in relation to other crimes such as violence with injury.In Derbyshire, the number of crime reports mentioning spice went from eight to 101 in three years.The force has launched a large-scale operation to tackle the issue. Warrants have been issued and 11 people arrested on suspicion of supplying class B drugs.Data from the British Transport Police showed references to spice went from zero in 2015 to 80 last year. ”A large part of the rise can be linked with the introduction of the Psychoactive Substances Act and the fact that cannabinoids were added to the Misuse of Drugs Act in December 2016.Last year spice was reclassified as a class B drug following advice from the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs.Simon Bray, the National Police Chief Council’s policing lead for new psychoactive substances, points out that its use is also growing in prisons. “In some prisons the use is quite heavy and that is because not all prisons have the same controls over how it gets in,” he said.“To deal with it we need all agencies to tackle it. It’s harmful stuff and it does impact on the brain and has a tendency to make people violent in some cases,” he added.Ball said: “I remember speaking to one young man about what he wanted from spice and he said: ‘It makes me feel like my head has been cut off.’ He was seeking a sense of dismemberment.“We have got to a place in society where money is being withdrawn from basic life-giving services. We are a very stressed sector trying to deal with very traumatised people. It’s the perfect storm.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1dda3955a1c808b01a32300f262d19a22b67e297/818_392_3550_2130/master/3550.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b215fe0a976a2c15b84150aaf1a94b96","title":"im hard left hard remain grassroots bid for labour brexit seachange","story":"Constituency groups could force Jeremy Corbyn to agree to a ‘people’s vote’ at the conferenceFew people in Labour have heard of Michael Chessum, the self-described “hard-left, hard-remain” campaigner, who concedes he is an unusual frontman for a campaign that could transform the Labour party’s Brexit policy.“Last year the faces were Chuka Umunna, Heidi Alexander, I can’t really believe that this year, it’s people like me, it’s weird,” he says in his shared south London office, surrounded by anti-Brexit paraphernalia and protest signs.Chessum’s group, Another Europe is Possible, is just one of a number of grassroots organisations that have forced the party to have a conversation about Brexit that it has long delayed.More than 150 constituency Labour parties have submitted Brexit motions for debate at the party’s conference, which begins in Liverpool on Sunday, with the vast majority calling for a vote on the final deal.It is the result of an intense and unprecedented ground campaign by a coalition of grassroots groups. One Labour official said the number of motions on Brexit was so vast that they could have difficulty devising other motions for debate on other topics.Last year in Brighton, delegates followed Momentum’s direction to save the leadership’s blushes and blocked any potential vote on Brexit. In Liverpool, delegates will arrive with an unprecedented mandate from members to put a second referendum on the table after a campaign led by the pro-Corbyn grassroots.“The numbers are completely crazy. I thought we’d get 50,” one pro-remain MP said.Many campaigners and MPs hope the efforts will resonate beyond the party conference in ways that could have a major and unforeseen effect on the parliamentary arithmetic.“It gives MPs some cover,” another MP said. “Some have resisted voting on anti-Brexit amendments because they will get grief locally for seeming to be disloyal. But if their CLP has put this motion forward, it gives them the freedom to vote with their conscience.”Chessum, a member of Momentum’s first steering committee, said he wanted to transform the pro-remain cause within the party into one that was explicitly leftwing, tribally Labour and pro-Corbyn.“I am a diehard remainer and a diehard member of the hard left,” he said. “There is no bespoke Labour Brexit on the table. There is no time, even with a general election.”Chessum argues he is giving the leadership space to change its position, rather than closing it into a corner. “The Labour right loves ‘Corbyn v the membership’. That’s not what this is.”The group is technically cross-party and has worked with other leftwingers and Greens. For the summer, it has been working in co-ordination and hosting phone banks for another explicitly Labour group run by Mike Buckley, a former aid worker and community organiser, who founded Labour for a People’s Vote this year.“There was nothing to rally behind,” he said. “The people talking publicly about having another referendum, however well intentioned they are, they are not going to gather the majority of Labour party members behind them because they are seen as being anti-Jeremy.”Both groups have regional organisers and have relied on sign-ups and their existing networks, in local parties and Momentum groups, some relics of the 2016 referendum campaign. Among the organisers is Alana Ivanova, a Momentum campaigner who started a petition to get the grassroots group to adopt a second referendum.Ivanova said campaigners hoped to tap into new Labour members’ passion for party democracy. “Brexit is a major test for that,” she said.Ana Oppenheim, another organiser, said many members did not know how to use the party’s existing democratic levers. “Now the left’s in control, it’s a chance to use them for something we believe in,” she said.For all the groups involved, there is no roadmap. The summer’s efforts have involved a painstaking task of identifying pro-European members in more than 600 local parties, through a mix of local contacts, friends of friends, and online signups, and getting them to champion a motion through their CLP.Buckley said that organising local parties has been “surprisingly difficult” and relied on local knowledge. Both groups have links with the main cross-party campaign People’s Vote, but maintain a public separation. Another mainstream group, Best for Britain, the anti-Brexit campaign that has the financial backing of billionaire philanthropist George Soros, has given £70,000 to Another Europe is Possible.Pro-European MPs have aided the groups in the background, helping them make connections, but have deliberately not led the campaigning.Though the groups are mainly run by young activists, it is older Labour members who have been the focus of some of the summer campaigning, because they make up the bulk of new members active in CLPs.The group that has most successfully used this tactic is the energetic pro-remain youth group For Future’s Sake (FFS) – a cross-party campaign which has close links to the official People’s Vote movement.Its young organisers have made provocative videos, deliberately designed to appeal to older members, placing the arguments about Brexit in the context of progressive political movements in British history, including the campaign for women’s suffrage and fighting the poll tax.FFS’s Liron Velleman has been co-ordinating its campaign on the ground to get CLPs to submit motions. “We get young people to sign up and then encourage older people from the CLP to get involved in the fight,” he said. “We tell them, our generation needs yours.”Previously unreleased data showed the average age of Labour party members and supporters who joined after 2015 is 51, and the most common age of this cohort to be 66. The project’s summer 2017 survey of Labour members revealed an average age of 53, with the most common age being 70.Now the local party organisation is over, campaigners from the main groups are turning their attention to the party conference itself. The first hurdle is ensuring Brexit is a topic on the agenda at conference, as one of eight topics chosen by members.Last year, Momentum steered its delegates to vote for other topics, including housing, NHS and the railways. That will not be repeated, its national co-ordinator, Laura Parker, said. “Last year, the context was very different. Now, it’s absolutely inevitable there will be a discussion on conference floor, I can’t conceive there won’t be – we’re 200 days away,” she said. “Without a doubt, there has to be a debate.”Momentum has not backed a new referendum and there is clearly some caution about doing so. Parker’s instincts are pro-Europe, but she is wary of restricting the Labour leadership’s political flexibility.“We are waiting to see what motions come to conference floor,” she said.Once Brexit is confirmed as a topic for debate in the ballot, delegates from those CLPs will meet trade union representatives and Labour’s Brexit secretary Keir Starmer on Sunday night to thrash out a compromise motion that could go to a vote.Amanda Chetwynd-Cowieson, an FFS co-founder, said the groups would be co-ordinating. “The one cast-iron agreement across all the groups is that a people’s vote is the way to solve the crisis,” she said.Some senior Labour sources cautioned that it was now uncertain if delegates would be responsive to either Momentum or any of the other campaign groups.“Delegates are totally unbiddable now,” one said. “Last year, there was some degree of predictability that most delegates would at least do what Momentum instructed, but that is no longer the case.”Key to the success of any motion or compromise is the support of trade unions. Campaigners have been closely watching both the Unite conference and the subsequent Trades Unions Congress, where union leaders accepted or put forward motions that could be a blueprint for the Labour outcome.One of the “big three” unions, GMB, has already officially backed a new referendum, after polling its members. Smaller unions have also been key players, most notably TSSA and its general secretary, Manuel Cortes, and Community, a centrist union with many Brexit-voting members whose industrial membership recently backed a vote on the deal.Unite, Labour’s most generous donor and the UK’s second largest union, left the door open to backing a second referendum at its conference, with a leadership statement saying it was “open to the possibility of a popular vote being held on any deal, depending on political circumstances”.That statement is now the most likely model for a Labour compromise. “The key voice in the room will be Unite,” one senior union source said.The third major union, Unison, the largest in the UK, has remained studiously neutral. “They will be in the room at conference, they might act as honest brokers, but they don’t want to be forced to take a position,” the source said.The final outcome may ultimately be a fudge, the party’s governing national executive committee could offer a policy statement, keeping a referendum on the table without endorsing it. Starmer and the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, have trialled that line in recent months.However, even if the NEC offers a statement, delegates could still push for an additional vote and a more radical motion.In the end, there is little will at the top of the party to prevent a Brexit debate taking place. “We would look ridiculous,” one source close to the shadow cabinet said. “The headlines last year were bad, but this would look terrible to outsiders watching.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/026150efba3e2b57a67df7aec9883946571457d1/0_277_5024_3015/master/5024.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=61ad41ef3275e2afb13fd61c86907768","title":"labour could win 15m more votes by backing brexit referendum","story":"YouGov says endorsing ‘people’s vote’ would bring net gain in general electionLabour could win more than 1.5 million extra voters if it backed a second referendum on Brexit, potentially delivering the party a Commons majority, according to new polling for the campaign group People’s Vote.Labour’s policy on Brexit will be a central issue at its conference in Liverpool, which kicks off on Saturday, with more than 100 local parties urging the leadership to back a referendum on any final Brexit deal.The poll is aimed at allaying the anxieties of Labour voters in pro-leave constituencies, who fear that opening up the possibility of revisiting the Brexit vote could alienate their supporters.While the organisers stress the complexities of asking such hypothetical questions, they argue that the large sample size – more than 10,200 people were asked in late August and early September – plus the heavy margins support the idea of an electoral boost if Labour changes policy.YouGov calculated this to mean such a policy change would see the party gain just over 1.5m votes overall, with an extra 1.7 million people supporting the party and around 200,000 withdrawing their support.If this new support was evenly distributed across constituencies – which is very unlikely – the extra 2,400 votes per area would win Labour about 66 more seats in all, just enough for a majority if other seats were not lost, based on the 2017 election.The former YouGov president Peter Kellner, who analysed the data for People’s Vote, said that while some Labour MPs argue backing a second referendum could cost the party net votes, the poll figures do not bear this out.“In other words, the non-Labour voters that the party could win over outnumber the Labour voters that the party risks losing by almost nine to one.”Labour’s official policy on a second Brexit referendum is to not completely rule it out, but to argue strongly that a better option would be to hold a general election, allowing the chance for a Jeremy Corbyn-led government to negotiate a departure.People’s Vote is holding a march in Liverpool on Saturday to mark the start of the Labour conference, titled the “People’s Vote March For the Many”.David Lammy, the Labour MP for Tottenham, who will be one of the speakers, said a second referendum was “the right thing for the party to do if it is to stand up for the communities, public services and young people who will be hit first and worst by the kind of Brexit that people like Michael Gove, Jacob Rees-Mogg and Boris Johnson want to impose on us”.He added: “But what these figures show is that supporting a people’s vote is also the right thing for the party to do if we it wants to win a general election. This should concentrate some minds at our conference in Liverpool next week.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e06f6ffaf05e58422e035153db133ac4cc173daf/0_0_3989_2394/master/3989.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b21c952402aef9cee4c1608437ed0886","title":"not enough time to hold referendum on final deal before brexit","story":"Constitutional experts say 29 March departure date would need to be delayed to make time for a ‘people’s vote’A referendum on the Brexit deal would take at least six months to organise legally, making it very difficult to have a second vote before the UK is scheduled to exit the EU on 29 March next year, constitutional experts have said.As EU leaders including the Czech prime minister, Andrej Babiš, called on Theresa May to change firm government policy and put a vote to the people, academics said there was not enough time if article 50 is enacted as scheduled.There are indications that a delay to the enactment of article 50 could be acceptable to the EU, but without this agreement time stands in the way of a second referendum, experts believe.“It is just possible to hold one within six months, but the shorter the timescale, the higher the chance of the question or other aspects of the referendum being challenged over their legitimacy,” said Prof Robert Hazell of the constitution unit at the department of political science, University College London.Fresh legislation, testing of the question by the Electoral Commission and a 10-week regulated period for a campaign are all required before a referendum can take place, he pointed out.David Cameron’s Brexit referendum took just over a year to get to the ballot box.The UCL researcher Jess Sargeant, who is about to publish a report on a second referendum with Alan Renwick, the deputy director of the constitution unit, said that even if all elements of the process went smoothly and speedily, “the total period from start to finish would be 24 weeks”.The first hurdle is the requirement for primary legislation, which would be highly contentious and require due process in parliament.“With political will, legislation can be rushed through on significantly reduced timescales,” says Sargeant in a blogpost on referendum timetables.But, she warned: “The government’s narrow majority, dependent on DUP support and subject to internal party isions, makes the situation highly unpredictable.”Hazell pointed out that if such a law was passed, then the Electoral Commission would have to advise on the “intelligibility” of the referendum question, a process that usually takes 12 weeks.The commission would than designate lead campaigners to both sides, which adds more time.And finally, under the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act (PPERA), a 10-week campaign period is specified.Five referendums have been held under PPERA, three of which were enabled through primary legislation, including the North East England assembly ballot, the alternative vote referendum in 2011 and the 2016 Brexit vote.The AV referendum, which took the shortest time, took nine months. The Brexit referendum took just over a year from start to finish.May said her government would never accept a second referendum on Brexit. But a report, published on Tuesday (pdf), and backed by the author of article 50, Lord Kerr, argues it is not too late to have one. The report by campaigners for a second referendum, the People’s Vote, said one way to condense the timetable would be to “cut and paste” the legislation that was used for the 2016 referendum.It also said that given the urgency of the matter, politicians could fast-track legislation through parliament to enable a swift vote.UCL points out that with political will, the legislative process can be shortened. In 2005 the controversial Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) 2005 received royal assent within three weeks of its introduction.The People’s Vote said politicians would e judged harshly if they denied calls for a second referendum on the grounds that it would be too difficult to arrange in the short time remaining.“History will not, in our opinion, be kind to any politician who hides behind purely logistical arguments, legalese or arcane parliamentary procedure in order to deny people a vote on the outcome of these Brexit negotiations at such a fragile and crucial moment for our country,” said Kerr.

Back in the UK, both remainers and leavers had pronounced her Chequers’ proposals to be dead in the water, but the prime minister had still travelled to the informal EU summit in Salzburg hoping for a stay of execution. A few luke-warm words and some insincere air kisses at the very least, until after she had survived the Conservative party conference. Her current range of vision really is that limited.Instead she got a lesson in plain-speaking brutality. No attempts to sugar the pill, as EU leader after leader took it in turns to dismiss Chequers and to mock the UK over its lack of progress in its Brexit preparations. Even the Dutch thought they were better prepared for a no-deal Brexit than us. It was left to Donald Tusk, president of the EU council, to deliver the coup de grace. The Chequers’ deal was unworkable because it undermined the integrity of the single market. And, by the way, its solution to the Northern Ireland border was just fantasy.Moments after being given the bad news in person, May had to face the UK media. The room in which the press conference was held was small and airless, but the prime minister was already sweaty when she walked in. More than that, she looked angry and terrified. Alone and out of her depth, her eyes darting across the room, searching for one friendly face. There wasn’t one. There hadn’t been one in the two days she had been in Austria.May did what she always does when she’s up against it. She went into denial. Stick her fingers in her ears and pretend absolutely nothing had happened. Nothing had changed. She began by highlighting the important work on people trafficking and national security that had been discussed before – almost as an afterthought – getting round to Brexit. Ah yes, Brexit. “Our white paper remains the only serious, credible proposal,” she said nervily. “And I am confident we shall reach a deal.” Nothing really had changed. Madness.There were a few seconds of silence as everyone took this in. It almost felt intrusive to observe the prime minister visibly falling apart. A public humiliation on the epic scale of both her refusal to accept the reversal of the dementia tax during the general election campaign and her car-crash leader’s speech at last year’s Tory party conference. Then May composed herself as best she could and invited the kicking she knew was coming her way. Bring it on. Everyone else had had a go so she might as well let the media have theirs. The martyrdom of St Theresa.Her head swivelled back and forth frantically several times as she tried to pick out Laura Kuenssberg. She just couldn’t get her eyes to focus. Eventually, May spotted the BBC’s political editor, sitting where she had been all along, in the front row just a couple of feet from where she was standing. As the inevitable questions came, challenging her version of reality, the prime minister couldn’t help but disconnect and go full Maybot. She wasn’t there, no one was there. All she had to do was to hang on for the next 10 minutes and the ordeal would be over.“I’m negotiating hard to give the British people what they voted for,” she said mindlessly, playing for time. Except she wasn’t. Almost no one had voted for the level of helplessness that was all she apparently had to offer. If the EU did have concerns, she continued, reluctantly admitting that – just possibly – there were objections to her Chequers plan, then she wanted to sit down and hear them. The last 24 hours were now a total blank. She had completely forgotten she had spent them sitting down listening to the EU’s concerns.The digging became ever more fevered as her facial expressions became more contorted. Too much more of this and she would have become a dead ringer for Munch’s The Scream. She did have a counter proposal but everyone would have to wait until she had thought of what it was. In any case, the EU were really just kidding – they did like to have their little European jokes – and would come round and see sense in the end. Just wait and see.As quickly as decently possible, May made her excuses and left, keeping her head down, fearful that she might burst into tears if she made eye contact with anyone. If the shame didn’t get her, then the pity would. She had been laid bare. The naked prime minister. Sans eyes, sans teeth, sans everything."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee61a508fbb05e89860b90df5a6a76dcd1a7d245/2_0_1996_1198/master/1996.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9f8a1d9d9aa434aa82ded94a7faaf01c","title":"558m year old fossils identified as oldest known animal","story":"Oval-shaped Dickinsonia lifeform existed at least 20m years before the ‘Cambrian explosion’ of animal lifeA fossilised lifeform that existed 558m years ago has been identified as the oldest known animal, according to new research.The findings confirm that animals existed at least 20m years before the so-called Cambrian explosion of animal life, which took place about 540m years ago and saw the emergence of modern-looking animals such as snails, bivalves and arthropods.The new fossils, of the genus Dickinsonia, are the remains of an oval-shaped lifeform and part of an ancient and enigmatic group of organisms called Ediacarans. These creatures are some of the earliest complex organisms on Earth, but their place within the evolutionary tree has long puzzled scientists. Suggestions as to what they were have ranged from lichens to failed evolutionary experiments to bacterial colonies.Now, by identifying the remains of organic matter on newly discovered Ediacaran fossils as ancient cholesterol, the scientists have been able to confirm Dickinsonia was an animal, which makes it the oldest known animal.“It is the exact type and composition of that fat that was the giveaway that Dickinsonia was in fact an animal,” said Jochen Brocks of the Australian National University, one of the authors on the study. He added that the study solves “a decades-old mystery that has been the holy grail of palaeontology”.The fossils were discovered on two surfaces on a cliffside in the remote wilderness of north-west Russia by PhD student Ilya Bobrovskiy, who is lead author on the paper, published in the journal Science.﻿“I took a helicopter to reach this very remote part of the world – home to bears and mosquitoes – where I could find Dickinsonia fossils with organic matter still intact,” Bobrovskiy said.“These fossils were located in the middle of cliffs of the White Sea that are 60-100m high. I had to hang over the edge of a cliff on ropes and dig out huge blocks of sandstone, throw them down, wash the sandstone and repeat this process until I found the fossils I was after.”Charlotte Kenchington, a palaeobiologist based at the University of Cambridge, said: “It’s really, really unusual to have preservation of organic matter in the Ediacaran. The really neat thing about this study is that they’ve analysed both the sediment around the fossil and the fossil itself. “The biomarker signal of the sediment is very different to the biomarker signal of the organic matter associated with the fossil. This gives you a huge deal of confidence in the results.”Emily Mitchell, also of the University of Cambridge, who works on Ediacaran animals preserved in the UK and Newfoundland, described the find as “incredibly exciting” but said there is still a huge amount that we don’t know about the Ediacarans.She said: “Now we know that animal life started before the Cambrian, in the Ediacaran. That’s very clear now in a way that it wasn’t 15 years ago. But they still look very different to modern animals. The transition between Dickinsonia to even the animals you find in the Cambrian is still quite a large one – we’re still not clear how that happened, for example.”This is not the first study to suggest some Ediacaran creatures were animals. Recent studies have shown that rangeomorphs, a bizarre group of branched organisms, were also animal-like. “It’s quite exciting to see multiple, different lines of evidence all suggesting that various Ediacaran species were animals,” said Mitchell.Ultimately, Brocks said, understanding “what these strange-looking Ediacaran creatures really were ... is essential if we want to understand the emergence and evolution of our own earliest ancestors.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12729792ec0f09fae072876156f28bc4ae1a7994/0_407_6211_3727/master/6211.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cb442aa0fd25fcefb72d699c39f87efa","title":"mdma makes octopuses more sociable","story":"Normally antisocial sea creature becomes friendly and tactile after being given the drug, scientists sayWhat happens when you give an octopus MDMA? It sounds like a question that might flit through the meandering mind of someone who had been dabbling in psychedelics. But now the matter has become the focus of an unlikely-sounding scientific experiment to uncover the ancient origins of social behaviour.By showing that the normally antisocial sea creature became friendly and tactile after being given MDMA, also known as ecstasy, scientists believe they have made a link between the social behaviours of humans and a species from which we are separated by more than 500m years of evolution.Gül Dölen, a neuroscientist at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and the lead investigator on the study, said: “People are like, ‘Have you got any pictures of octopuses holding glow sticks?’ which I kind of ignore because that wasn’t really our objective. MDMA is a great tool for investigating whether or not an octopus can become social.”The answer was a definitive yes: the creatures’ normal hostility towards each other vanished and they became touchy-feely. The findings suggest that the brain chemical serotonin, which floods the brain after a dose of MDMA, has been a trigger for social behaviour since very early in evolutionary history.Octopuses are notoriously clever. They can learn to navigate mazes and unscrew jars to obtain food. Aquarium staff have reported catching roving octopuses raiding neighbouring tanks for food at night-time.Under normal circumstances, though, octopuses are deeply antisocial, and treat each other with aggression – sometimes to the point of eating each other. “Even during mating the male will just leave his sperm and depart as quickly as possible, because if he sticks around she’ll attack him,” said Dölen.The study, published in the journal Current Biology, studied the behaviour of octopuses in a tank with three connected chambers: one empty, one containing a plastic action figure, and a third with another octopus in a cage.Four octopuses were placed in a beaker of diluted MDMA, which they absorbed through their gills. While on the drug, all four spent far more time in the chamber with the caged octopus than they did without the drug.Others stretched out all eight arms and just floated around, doing what the researchers described as “water ballet”.The findings are surprising because the octopus brain is radically different to our own: the central brain surrounds their throat and the majority of neurons, which appear to work semi-independently, are distributed through the arms. Until now, much research into the biology underpinning social behaviour has focused on sophisticated brain circuitry. The latest work suggests a more prominent role for basic brain chemistry, and in particular the brain chemical serotonin.Prof David Nutt, a neuropsychopharmacologist at Imperial College London, said the findings added to evidence for emotion and empathy existing in a broad range of species. “This just proves that this is not some peculiar human characteristic, it’s not even a mammalian characteristic, it’s a characteristic of brains,” he said. “It also shows that serotonin has a hugely important role in mediating social interactions right across species.”Dölen said the findings may open opportunities for accurately studying the impact of psychiatric drug therapies in a wide range of animals distantly related to people, adding that the study of psychedelic and other recreational drugs is no longer viewed as a “risqué topic”.“Serious scientists are jumping in and saying we can learn a lot from these tools,” she said. “I hope that this is one of the studies that pushes us in that direction and it’s not one of those weird things that only ravers know anything about.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3bdcdeb7a36c280cac4a411f4fd24794cdcee59e/0_16_1430_858/master/1430.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14f622485c23d082e73477852a865ec9","title":"danny cipriani left out england rugby squad","story":"• Gloucester fly-half left out following assault conviction• Chris Ashton included despite serving suspensionDanny Cipriani has been left out of the first England training squad since his convictions for common assault and resisting arrest.

He also added that: “If a guy gets in trouble all the time you’ve got to have second thoughts about it.”Jones does not name his squad for England’s autumn internationals until 18 October – this is a three-day training camp in Bristol where the players will, among other things, get accustomed to their new defence coach, John Mitchell – but while Cipriani’s hopes of retaining his place are not over, his omission would suggest his chances are damaged.Tuilagi meanwhile, is rewarded for showing some semblance of early-season form – he has started all three of Leicester’s matches and scored a fine try against Newcastle – and is included by Jones for the first time since he was sent home in disgrace after a late-night drinking session last August. He has not played for England since a replacement appearance against Wales during the 2016 Six Nations and not started since the summer of 2014 but Jones’s decision to cast his eye over him makes obvious sense with exactly 12 months to go until the World Cup.“It’s the first time in the three years I’ve been in England that Manu’s been fit,” said Jones. “He’s put together a series of games and we’re looking forward to him continuing on that run. He’s got the opportunity to come in and show us what he’s got.”Ashton’s selection is not surprising in that Jones had hinted at including him a couple of weeks ago but he is currently in the middle of a seven-week suspension for a tip tackle during pre-season and will not have played a competitive match this season before Jones names his autumn squad. Ashton was included in Jones’s August training squad however, in what constituted an immediate recall following his summer move from Toulon to Sale.Among the other notable inclusions is Michael Rhodes, Saracens’ uncapped South Africa-born flanker who may make his debut against the Springboks in England’s opening autumn fixture on 3 November. Billy Vunipola is in the squad, as are Zach Mercer and Joe Cokanasiga but their Bath teammate Sam Underhill is a surprise omission. As are the Exeter pair of Luke Cowan-Dickie and Sam Simmonds – though the former suffered a rib injury at the weekend and the latter missed out through illness.The Wasps pair of Joe Launchbury and Brad Shields are both included despite carrying injuries while Danny Care, George Kruis and Jack Nowell all return the squad. Dan Cole is still not in the squad though, nor is James Haskell following his summer move to Northampton.Jones added: “It’s a chance to get the players thinking about England and the way we want to play for England and the way we want to beat South Africa. These players have the opportunity to press their chances for selection ahead of the first Test so they will have to be enthusiastic and ready to give their best.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48df59ccc97759e76d793941b3090dc30a7e68bf/32_0_5248_3149/master/5248.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ee6dd1a71ce1d6138f3ff8a395464e3","title":"johanna konta out pan pacific open donna vekic","story":"• British No 1 beaten 6-3, 7-5 by Croatian in second round• Konta lets 4-1 lead slip in second set in TokyoJohanna Konta let a significant lead slip away in the second set as she slumped to a straight-sets defeat by Donna Vekic in the second round of the Pan Pacific Open.The British No 1 was knocked out of the US Open in the first round by Caroline Garcia last month and her fragile confidence was again evident in Tokyo. She had dropped only two games in thrashing the qualifier Gabriela Dabrowski in the first round but, having led Vekic 4-1 in the second set with a double break, Konta lost six of the last seven games to go down 6-3, 7-5.Croatia’s Vekic, ranked two places below Konta in the current rankings at No 45, struggled with her serve in the first set but the British player was unable to take advantage and dropped her own twice.Konta looked to have turned things around in the second set, cutting out the errors and establishing a seemingly-decisive lead.

Or maybe yesterday, I don’t know.” The opening of Albert Camus’s 1942 novel L’Etranger is one of the most instantly recognisable in modern European fiction. Ben Okri’s adaptation begins with the same lines and holds faithfully to Camus’s voice and vision, lifting swathes of the novel almost untouched.Okri seems to refrain from adding a contemporary political edge, perhaps to honour the original while leaving its colonial sensibility open for modern audiences to pick up. The downside is that it feels like an abridged version, rather than an adaptation with its own distinct vision.Sam Frenchum plays Meursault, a French Algerian living in Algiers, dressed as the consummate Frenchman, in a three-piece suit. Frenchum has an entertaining, dead-eyed ennui as he recounts his murder of an Arab, his trial, his lack of remorse and his existential philosophy. The Arab he kills appears on the side of the stage in the second part but is not a haunting presence, merely a distantly looming generic figure, forever designated to otherness.Absurdist physical humour is brought to the fore in Abbey Wright’s production: Meursault’s neighbour, Salamano (Uri Roodner), staggers around with a mop for a dog. Characters move on and off the stage with the synchronised movements of a sinister musical, and the lighting is eloquent: Meursault is spotlit in intense, interrogative moments, while a beach scene is created simply but sensationally with a golden light cast across the empty stage.With a set designed by Richard Hudson, there is a noirish effect with long shadows, swirling cigarette smoke, and hunched figures in grey. Some scenes are performed in slow motion, others turn into frozen tableaux.For those seeking a more critical response to Camus’ story, there is a breathtaking six-minute film in the basement of the theatre called The Insider, written by Okri and directed by Mitra Tabrizian, which tells the story from the dead Arab’s perspective, and is the perfect accompanying piece."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef9c4b4b13694974d867400014eafe3120fbed59/0_195_6016_3609/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3d4b6704395a9de8a8d1c5de097e3532","title":"tablet 2 in 1 laptop stylus student university","story":"Matt’s daughter already has a laptop for university, but will a lighter device with a smartpen be better for taking notes?My daughter will be starting university and already has a more-than-adequate laptop for essay writing and Netflix. But rather than carry it to and from lectures all the time, we wondered if it would be worth investing in a tablet or smaller 2-in-1 laptop with a stylus for note taking. Or do you think it would be better to stick with a small screen laptop? MattThere are two issues here that go well beyond product choice, and can only be decided by you and your daughter. The first is whether a change in circumstances – going to university – requires the adoption of a new technology, whether it be a tablet or stylus or both. I’m assuming that your daughter doesn’t use either of these, or you would already know the answer.The second issue is how a new device fits in with the ones she already uses. The days when everybody did everything with a desktop PC have long gone, and most people use a mixture of microprocessor-powered devices. These include smartphones, handhelds, tablets, Chromebooks, laptops, all-in-ones, desktops, workstations, games consoles and NAS servers, sometimes supplemented with smartpens and digital watches, cameras and recorders.For example, it wouldn’t be very useful to run a system that comprised a 6in smartphone, a 7in or 8in tablet and a 10in laptop. If you were starting from scratch, I’d suggest a 6in smartphone, a 10-12in touch-screen convertible and a desktop PC or all-in-one with a 24in or 27in screen. That’s the kind of system I use myself. There’s not much overlap between the three devices, and you get the maximum value out of each one.You should also think about integration. I’m assuming your daughter has a Windows laptop, because Apple users always mention it. If she has a MacBook Pro and an iPhone, she could easily integrate an iPad or, preferably, an iPad Pro with a Smart Keyboard. Those wouldn’t be obvious choices for someone with an Android smartphone and a Windows laptop.I’m not saying you shouldn’t buy any particular product, just that you should think about how they all work together.At one time, lots of us used styli with handheld organisers or PDAs (personal digital assistants) like the Palm and Pocket PC devices that were popular before smartphones swept the market. There were two reasons for this. First, we didn’t have capacitive screens that worked well with fingers. Second, the user interfaces required more precision than finger ends allowed. The stylus was really a mouse substitute. User interfaces had to be redesigned to make programs finger-friendly. This also added something you didn’t get with a stylus: the ability to use more than one finger at a time.While the Pocket PC and Windows XP Tablet Edition provided pretty good character recognition, the stylus has never really been comfortable for extended note-taking. People try it but most of them soon give up. In my case, I switched to a Livescribe smartpen, which has the advantage of recording talks and interviews while you handwrite notes on special paper. (Other smartpens are available.) After that I went back to using reporters’ notebooks while recording things with a separate digital recorder.More recent research from Princeton University found that students who take longhand notes learn better than the ones who take notes on a laptop.I’d therefore suggest your daughter sticks with the familiar notebook and pen paradigm, and perhaps adds a digital recorder. (You can record things with a smartphone, but recording for several hours a day runs the battery down.)My occasional need to turn cursive handwriting into text was solved by speech recognition on Android smartphones or Chrome browsers. (Other speech-to-text systems are available.)Tablets have been around for decades – the GridPad was launched in 1989 – but consumer sales only took off when Apple launched the iPad in 2010. However, sales peaked in 2014, and the market has declined since then. Some regular users will stick with them because they’ve adapted to various apps, and they are terrific for toddlers, but most of us have given up on the idea that tablets can replace laptops.The tablet market has also been disrupted by the growth of Windows 2-in-1s and convertibles. They aren’t great tablets, but they work well enough to replace dedicated tablets while still functioning as laptops.Perhaps even more damage has been done by the growth in smartphone screens: even Apple has launched an iPhone with a 6.5in screen. Apps and websites now cater so well for big smartphones that tablets are becoming increasingly irrelevant.Perhaps your daughter could try this minimalist system and see how it goes. She will soon find out whether she needs a bigger screen and a better keyboard while out and about.You can get a lot done with a smartphone, a mini-keyboard and voice recognition. However, it’s not good for writing essays because you just can’t see enough words on the screen, and editing – moving blocks of text around – is painful. If your daughter needs to do any writing or serious research on campus then there’s no substitute for a 10in or preferably larger screen. In this case, the options include tablets, Chromebooks, and Windows 2-in-1s and convertibles.In reality, there’s not that much difference in price. Cheap tablets are generally awful, and by the time you’ve bought a decent keyboardcase, you might as well have bought a proper 2-in-1.Good Chromebooks are about the same price as Windows laptops, and may sport much the same hardware, but most of them don’t have touch screens. The main advantages are the elimination of maintenance, such as installing updates, and possibly better battery life. The inherent lack of functionality should not be a problem because the Chromebook is supplementing a laptop, not trying to replace it.Windows 2-in-1s have the advantage of being portable, they can double as tablets, and can still run the full Microsoft Office and other software for working on the go. And your daughter, I assume, already knows how to use one. The main drawback is the maintenance, but that’s not a problem if the device works correctly when using an external hard drive for Windows updates.One alternative is the 10.6in Samsung Galaxy Book SM-W620, which includes a keyboardcase and S Pen for £399.97.All of these machines have Full HD (1920 x 1080 pixel) screens.Have you got a question?

So I can say it’s just normal, like any other year, we haven’t recorded any mass killing,” said Churchill Collyer, the deputy director of the wildlife department.Officials added that since the start of the year, a total of 63 elephants had died across the country and there had been no noticeable increase in elephant poaching.About 40,000 African elephants are killed every year for their tusks, according to conservation groups. The elephants are illegally traded as part of a multibillion-dollar industry that extends from Africa to Asia and beyond.Botswana, which has Africa’s largest elephant population, is on the frontline of the battle against the illicit ivory trade.This week, the country’s authorities took journalists to the vast Chobe national park in the north-east, which has more than 100,000 elephants – the country’s largest concentration of the animals.Several hours spent flying over the reserve, which borders Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe, showed six elephant carcasses, four of which appeared to have been poached.“This is almost more than six months since it was killed,” said Collyer of one animal with dried, perforated skin and missing tusks.About 12 miles (20km) away, another decomposed carcass was found, but when EWB led rangers to it the tusks were still intact, suggesting it was not killed for ivory.“The cause of the natural death could either be from old age, from diseases, from starvation during the drought season,” said anti-poaching deputy brigade commander George Bogatsu, a six-year veteran of the fight against poaching.He stood next to the carcass with an assault rifle slung over his arm and a handgun tucked into the side pocket of his camouflage trousers.The animal was one of those counted by EWB as poached. EWB said in a statement that “an unusually high number of elephant carcasses were seen by the survey team”.“Our current survey adheres to the highest international standards,” it added.Some in the conservation community have suggested EWB made such alarming claims because of “vested interests”.Survival International’s Stephen Corry said he expected more reports “stirring up panic over the increasing threat of poaching” as groups raise cash ahead of a conference in London on the illegal wildlife trade next month.But EWB insisted that “given the high number of elephant carcasses seen during the survey, EWB felt it a moral and patriotic duty to immediately report this … EWB’s sole concern is for the wildlife and the natural heritage of our wonderful country.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03f2f9bee53d893cd7b46ab840a68ee083a822c0/0_9_776_465/master/776.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=212ae3a51bea9d95ee61336af3ccd550","title":"canada racism past civil rights charles daniels bashir mohamed","story":"Archives shed light on incidents of racial discrimination and the country’s civil rights pioneersAn amateur historian in Canada has highlighted a forgotten story of racial injustice, and one of the country’s earliest segregation lawsuits, in hopes of bringing recognition to civil rights pioneers.In 1914, Charles Daniels bought a pair of tickets to see King Lear at Calgary’s Sherman Grand Theatre, but when he attempted to take his orchestra-level seat, he was told by ushers to move up to the balcony level, where other black patrons were seated.Theatre staff told Daniels that his presence made the white patrons uncomfortable. Daniels protested – refused offers of a refund, and left.“The fact that this happened in 1914, in Calgary, Alberta, blew my mind. It broke the whole narrative that these kind of things only happen in the United States,” said Bashir Mohamed, a civil servant who has been scouring the provincial archives in Edmonton for the last two years, and wrote about Daniels’s case in an essay for the Sprawl, a Calgary journalism site.Daniels’s story has re-emerged amid a belated recognition across Canada of past injustices that have been largely absent from the national conversation on race.At the time, the incident at the theatre was widely covered in local papers, with one running the headline: “CALGARY ‘NIGGER’ KICKS UP FUSS – Wants to Attend Theatre With ‘White Folks’ But Management Says No.”Daniels retained a lawyer, sued the theatre over its policy of segregation – and won the case. He was awarded C$1,000, worth more than US$17,000 today. During the trial he had said: “I think the humiliation is worth that amount.”Mohamed said he had started research the history of black Canadians after reading an online commentator claiming that Canada does not have the same history of racial discrimination as the US. “When I was going through school, I never learned about this black history. But I always assumed there was something there,” he said.Since then he has documented Canada’s racist place-names, the extensive presence of the Ku Klux Klan in western Canada, the effects of segregation and the fights of early – but largely forgotten – civil rights activists.“I think it’s very important work … because there isn’t as much written about people of African descent within Alberta,” Jennifer Kelly, a University of Alberta education professor, told the CBC.Daniels’s story has been told before, over the years and in different publications. But few Canadians are aware of the pioneering theatregoer, whose successful fight against discrimination predated the broader civil rights movement by decades.“We have photos of Martin Luther King being arrested. We have mugshots. We have photos of Rosa Parks sitting on a bus. We have photos of her mugshot too,” he said.But in Canada, the victims of racism were often seen as secondary to the story, he said: in Daniels’s case, newspaper reporters spoke with theatre management, but never Daniels. No images of Daniels were ever published.“We don’t see photos of the black-only sections of the theatre. We don’t see photos of black patients being denied care, even though we know all those things happened,” said Mohamed. “Because these photos don’t exist, it’s hard to see these things as real that affected real people.”Other civil rights activists are only recently gaining mainstream recognition in Canada. Viola Desmond, a black woman who refused to leave a whites-only area of a movie theatre in 1946, is to become the first Canadian-born woman to appear on the country’s $10 bill.Amid a broader debate about Canada’s colonial heritage, some cities have removed of now-controversial historical figures, such as John A Macdonald, the country’s first prime minister and a notorious racist.“There’s been this resurgence across Canada and the United States of people reclaiming their history,” said Mohamed, pointing out that Edmonton’s Oliver neighbourhood is named after Frank Oliver, the former federal minister who championed policies barring black immigration to Canada and successfully lobbied for the forced removal First Nations from their treaty lands.“It’s led to really critical discussions of who we celebrate. And who we’ve forgotten.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7074da8e60bbe2b8cd72fc4781b90fe546dab34a/0_334_4619_2772/master/4619.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ae44bac0464d5da7b1bedbc00137b075","title":"danish mayors vow to ignore citizenship handshake rule","story":"Rightwing government wants to make handshake mandatory in naturalisation ceremoniesOpposition is growing in Denmark to plans by the ruling rightwing coalition to deny citizenship to any immigrant who declines to shake hands with their local mayor during a revamped naturalisation ceremony – a measure widely seen as targeting Muslims.“It’s absurd that the immigration minister thinks this is an important thing to spend time on,” said Kasper Ejsing Olesen, the mayor of the central town of Kerteminde. “Shaking hands does not show if you are integrated or not. I think I will probably find an excuse and the deputy mayor will come to work that day.”Another mayor, Ole Bjørstorp of Ishøj, said the demand was unreasonable and unconstitutional. “I’m obliged to take into consideration the fact that we have freedom of religion in Denmark. That’s the decisive factor for me,” he said.The proposal to include a mandatory handshake in the new citizenship ceremony was tabled by the Conservatives, a member of the three-party coalition, and the far-right Danish People’s party (DPP), on whose parliamentary support the minority government depends.It has the backing of several prominent government figures. “A handshake is how we greet each other in Denmark,” the hardline immigration minister, Inger Støjberg, of the Venstre party, the senior coalition partner, said this month. “It’s the way we show respect for each other in this country.”Some Muslims do not shake hands for religious reasons, preferring instead to place a hand on their chest in a gesture of polite greeting. The practice has caused problems in several countries including Denmark, where in 2015 a taxi driver won DKK10,000 (now about £1,200) in compensation after being sacked for refusing to shake his female employer’s hand.In Switzerland last month, a Muslim couple were denied citizenship because they refused to shake hands with members of the opposite sex at interviews. In Sweden a woman was awarded SEK40,000 (£3,400) after her job interview was cut short when she refused to shake hands with a male interviewer. France’s top court ruled this year that an Algerian woman’s refusal to shake hands with male officials at a naturalisation ceremony was reason enough to deny her citizenship.Denmark’s immigration and integration policies have shifted significantly to the right in recent years, accompanied by a rise in anti-Islam rhetoric from even the left-leaning Social Democrats, who have called the religion a barrier to integration and said some Muslims did not respect Denmark’s judicial system and some Muslim women were choosing not to work for religious reasons.Parliament has broadly backed the new citizenship bill, which introduces a naturalisation ceremony at which applicants must sign a document pledging to uphold the constitution, commit to core Danish values and “act respectfully towards representatives of the authorities” – which the conservative parties insist means shaking hands.The DPP’s immigration spokesman, Martin Henriksen, said a handshake amounted to “a compromise about acting with respect. That, in our view, certainly means shaking the hand of the mayor or other person conducting the ceremony.” He said he expected parliament to back the proposal.The Conservative party spokesman, Naser Khader, said this month: “The package includes a ceremony at which you make a statement of loyalty and shake hands.” He said he did not expect problems. “Some people would give their right arm for citizenship. I’m sure they’d also give their hand.”The Social Democrats have said they believe a handshake is important and “completely natural”, but the party’s leader, Mette Frederiksen, has expressed doubts about the need to make it mandatory.“We make too many laws in Denmark,” she told the state broadcaster DR. “The ceremony is what’s important to me. If there turns out to be problems with the handshake, we should discuss legislating then.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28d5891947777bef0c1a781698681feefe934584/0_97_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=61eeb392dc65f6ce8bf7bfeaef2319b1","title":"dream come true moon jae in korean leaders mountain pilgrimage","story":"South Korean president’s visit to North concludes with highly symbolic trip to Mount PaektuMoon Jae-in, the South Korean president, stepped into the shallow waters of Heaven Lake, regarded as the spiritual home of the Korean people, bent down and scooped up a glassful of water.Kim Jong-un, his North Korean counterpart, watched from a distance. Moon was fulfilling a long-held dream to visit Mount Paektu, which straddles the border between North Korea and China. At the summit the two men held hands and thrust them into the air as they posed for a photo with their wives, the lake in the background.The highly symbolic trip capped a three-day visit by Moon to North Korea, the first by a South Korean leader in 11 years. After two days of talks, Kim pledged to close a missile testing site that was crucial to North Korea’s development of intercontinental ballistic missiles, and offered to shut the country’s only known nuclear complex in exchanged for unspecified “reciprocal measures” from the US.Observers said these measure fell short of expectations in Washington. But inter-Korean relations continue to grow closer, and the trip to Paektu highlighted the close relationship between the two leaders.Kim hopes to restart negotiations with the US, and hopes to have a second summit with Donald Trump as soon as possible, Moon told reporters when he returned to Seoul. Kim also invited secretary of state Mike Pompeo to Pyonyang, Moon said.“Chairman Kim expressed his wish to finish complete denuclearization at an early date and focus on economic development,” Moon said, adding that details would have to be worked out between North Koreans and the US.But US officials have made little progress with the most basic of discussions, such as having North Korea provide an inventory of its nuclear which would become the basis for future talks. Moon said North Korea is ready to accelerate the denuclearisation process, but only if the US makes reciprocal measures, which have not been defined.If negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang continue to hit roadblocks, it could jeoprdise inter-Korean exchanges since sanctions will likely remain in place. It did not stop Kim from trying to win over the South Korean president, sending him two tons of pine mushrooms, a delicacy.Moon is an avid hiker and during his first meeting with Kim, in April, he had expressed his desire to visit the mountain, the highest on the Korean peninsula at 2,500 metres (9,000ft).“I have a dream that I have not been able to fulfil for a long time, which is trekking Mount Paektu,” Moon said at the time. “I believe Chairman Kim will make that dream come true for sure.”The trip to the summit on a sunny morning was less of a trek than a photo op. Both Kim and Moon wore black overcoats and black leather dress shoes, and they travelled to the top by cable car. Outings like this have helped build trust between the two men, something Kim still lacks in his relationship with Trump.The mountain is featured heavily in North Korean propaganda, and Kim has made trips to its summit after nuclear tests or major announcements, most recently when he declared the country’s nuclear arsenal complete. North Korea’s two previous leaders, Kim’s grandfather and father, are said to have been born in its shadow. This has been used to bolster the Kim family’s claim to a sacred bloodline, though the account has been disputed by some.Paektu is also a significant symbol in the South, where it is mentioned in the country’s national anthem. Although Moon could have visited the summit sooner from the Chinese side, he had wanted to go by “stepping on our soil”, Kim Eui-kyeom, a South Korean presidential spokesman, said at a briefing.Moon was scheduled to fly back to Seoul on Thursday afternoon and he will meet Trump in New York next week during the UN general assembly, and Moon said he has a private message from Kim to deliver.

He was badly beaten, kept in a military barracks without proper medical attention and then produced in court to face treason charges. His driver was shot dead.Clutching a cane on Thursday, Wine said he still felt pain and walks “with hardship”, adding that he plans to say more at a press conference on Saturday. The longtime opposition leader Kizza Besigye, who has been arrested many times, said on Twitter it was likely that Wine would “be blockaded at home till further notice”.In a statement police said that Wine, who faces trial on the treason charges next month, had been “peacefully escorted to his residence”. “We wish to thank him for cooperating with the police,” the statement said. “We urge all people to remain calm. We urge the hon member of parliament to honour the laws of the land and fully comply with his bail conditions.”Earlier in the day, police and soldiers sealed off roads, erected barricades around the airport and moved into opposition strongholds in Kampala. Demonstrations have been banned and TV networks told not to report live on Wine’s return.Analysts say the 36-year-old politician poses the most significant challenge in years to Museveni, who leads a country with one of the youngest populations in the world.The former reggae singer, who was elected to parliament last year, has emerged as a powerful voice with his calls for young people in the east African country to stand up and take over from a “failed leadership”.Earlier this week Wine told the  he wanted to prove that the “power of the people is greater than the people in power”. “If I think about the dangers that face me, it is crazy to go back. But I want to be home. There are 40 million people who need hope so I will go and meet them no matter what,” Wine said.On Thursday he told AFP: “To the youths and underprivileged of Uganda, this is your struggle and I am ready to take the leadership role. Uganda is ready for change and this is not the time to let down that call.”Security forces were also deployed overnight to outside the homes of opposition leaders. Police escorted Medard Ssegona, Wine’s lawyer and member of parliament, from his home to his office at parliament.Musician friends of Wine who attempted to travel to Entebbe to welcome him home were also held by police. Witnesses said soldiers and police deployed along the entire length of the road between Kampala and Entebbe town, about 30 miles south.Many of Wine’s songs deal with social and political issues, calling for ordinary young people to act to improve their lives and their country. He has compared himself to France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, and made no secret of his presidential ambitions. However, the singer is controversial and has faced repeated accusations of homophobia.More than 80 artists, activists and politicians signed a statement condemning his treatment in detention. There were also protests in other countries in Africa, the UK and the US.Analysts say it is likely that the Ugandan authorities did not expect him to return when they allowed him to fly to the US.Nick Cheeseman, professor of democracy at the University of Birmingham and an expert in African politics, said Wine will have to reach more voters if he is to mount a serious challenge to Museveni.“You need more than charisma and a bit of a following among the urban youth. You need a nationwide structure and a lot of money. Uganda remains a predominantly rural country,” he said.Museveni, who took power in 1986 and is a key US security ally, has become increasingly authoritarian. The 74-year-old president is able to seek re-election in 2021 because parliament passed legislation last year removing a clause in the constitution that had prevented anyone over 75 from holding the presidency.Demonstrations following Wine’s detention last month were repressed by riot police and other security forces. Three people died and around 100 were arrested.The US, EU and UK have been critical of the treatment of Wine, a sign that long-standing support for Museveni may be ebbing as observers worry about growing instability."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3636045.1537456782!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"orla tinsley documentary led to surge in donor card requests","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Irish Kidney Association confirmed the spike following the broadcast of Orla Tinsley: Warrior on RTE One on Monday.There were more than 5,000 requests for organ donor cards in the three days following an RTÉ documentary featuring cystic fibrosis campaigner Orla Tinsley. The Irish Kidney Association confirmed the spike followed Orla Tinsley: Warrior, which aired on RTÉ One on Monday. It was followed directly afterwards with an audience discussion on the Claire Byrne Live programme.The Irish Kidney Association said requests for donor cards came “via free text” and requests to the association’s website. It said many inidual requests were for multiples of donor cards.The organisation also received many further requests via email and by phone to its headquarters. Irish Kidney Association chief executive Mark Murphy said that “on a normal day” the association receives between 20 and 50 requests for organ donor cards.“The public’s interest in organ donation has dramatically spiked since CF campaigner Orla Tinsley’s documentary was aired on Monday,” he said. “Such a level of public response has not been seen for almost a decade.“Orla’s courage has moved the public in such a powerful and visceral way to support organ donation.“This gives hope to the 600 or more people on transplant waiting lists and their families and demonstrates, once again, how powerful inidual stories shared by people who have been touched by organ failure and organ donation can capture the public’s empathy.“We hope that the public will continue to have that vital discussion about organ donation with their loved ones and let their wishes be known.” The documentary was filmed over 14 months in New York and charted Ms Tinsley’s struggle while her cystic fibrosis worsened as she awaited a life-saving double lung transplant, which she finally secured following a number of false alarms.Members of the public can request an organ donor card texting DONOR to 50050, or via the Irish Kidney Association website www.ika.ie.The “digital organ donor card” is available from the Google playstore or iTunes. “Your wishes can also be recorded when applying for the new format drivers’ licence and code 115 will be put on your new licence,” said Mr Murphy."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Taoisech confident of support for Ireland as EU leaders take dim view of Chequers planSarah Louise Mulligan describes herself as \u0026lsquoa huge president Trump fan\u0026rsquo and criticises media and politiciansMiche\u0026aacutel Martin and Ministers believe PAC may have undue influence on electionGuidelines to come into effect immediately for the forthcoming presidential electionLeaders discussed Commission proposals to beef up the EU\u0026rsquos border agency, Frontex, with 10,000 border guards to be deployed to assist member states facing crisis migration problemsHospital staff broke news of man\u0026rsquos death to family saying he had been found \u0026lsquopulseless\u0026rsquoFamily home a place of coercion for some women, according to Safe Ireland chief executivePublic response to programme \u0026lsquonot seen in a decade\u0026rsquo, says kidney associationCourt told teen regularly goes missing and may be in sexual relationships with older womenMinister says some may not have appreciated seriousness of orange weather warningAutomatic reel broadcast before bulletin on woman killed after caravan blown over cliffCash taken after security van driver threatened while second man waited in getaway carMinister says memo to Government \u0026lsquoin coming weeks\u0026rsquo on what do next about Tuam site\u0026lsquoChildren in pain today, in pain tomorrow and in pain until this surgery provided\u0026rsquoLuas disrupted until Friday and 25,000 without power while Storm Bronagh to impact tonightEdmundas Dauksa faces single charge of murdering Ingrida MaciokaiteBrexit is a \u0026lsquolose, lose, lose\u0026rsquo damage limitation exercise, Simon Coveney says"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3635602.1537445610!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"detailed backstop proposals urgently needed varadkar tells may","story":"Speaking at an EU leaders summit in Salzburg, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said that the Irish Government is preparing for the possibility that the EU and UK fail to agree a Brexit deal. Video: EU Commission\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                             Theresa May and Leo Varadkar attend a bilateral meeting during the informal summit of European Union leaders in Salzburg, Austria on Thursday. Photograph: Leonhard FoegerReuters The UK needs to put detailed proposals on the backstop on the negotiating table urgently, the Taoiseach told the British prime minister today.Time was short, Mr Varadkar is reported to have warned, insisting they need to get to discuss legal text.Meeting this morning on the fringes of the Salzburg European Summit Mr Varadkar told Mrs May that although the UK and the EU’s task force have both presented some proposals at this stage, the British proposals are only an outline.Irish and EU negotiators have yet to see specific details from the British side and there is a need to get into detailed discussions urgently. The Taoiseach told Ms May his objective remains the same: to achieve a legally operable and robust backstop within the Withdrawal Agreement, that ensures no hard border on the island of Ireland.Ms May is understood to have expressed doubts about whether it will be possible to conclude the discussions by the October summit but said she was keen to bring negotiations to a conclusion as soon as possible.The EU leaders are expected this afternoon to agree to a new November Brexit summit but to emphasise that October remains the target for resolving most of the issues around the Withdrawal Agreement, what chief negotiator Mr Michel Barnier has called the “moment of truth”.Irish sources said the meeting had been “useful”. In the discussion on Northern Ireland Mr Varadkar emphasised the need to get talks underway between the parties.Meanwhile Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney has said Brexit is a “damage limitation exercise” for everyone involved and a “lose, lose, lose” situation.He also suggested on Thursday Britain’s standing in the world would be diminished because of the loss of solidarity and support from EU members.“For the EU we will undoubtedly be weakened without the British economy and the British political system advocating for globalisation, providing a bulwark against protectionism, and making sure the single market works fairly for everybody,” he told the PwC tax summit in Dublin this morning.“Britain has been the champion of all these things and the EU without Britain, in my view, is a weaker place,” he said.“From an Irish perspective, it’s a lose too,” Mr Coveney said, noting the considerable amount of contingency planning for different eventualities that was being put in place.Later Mr Coveney said the Government was willing to be flexible on the “backstop” - which has ground down EU-UK negotiations on a Brexit treaty - as long as it meets commitments given by London.Answering questions at the media announcement of public information event to get businesses ready for Brexit, the Tánaiste called for an “intensification” in negotiations between the EU and the UK around a legal text on the so-called backstop guarantee to avoid a hard border in Ireland.Describing talks as being at “the business end of negotiations,” Mr Coveney said it was always going to be difficult to conclude talks but said the decision of the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier to rewrite its proposed text on the backstop was an attempt to address the UK’s concerns.Despite agreeing in last December’s political agreement to include the backstop in the Brexit treaty, the UK has rejected the EU’s proposed text because it would keep Northern Ireland in the EU customs union and parts of the single market and create a border between the North and the rest of the UK.An intensification of negotiations was required, instead of “political commentary and political lobbying,” said Mr Coveney, “so we can get into the nuts and bolts of trying to resolve the UK’s problems here.”The Tánaiste rejected a suggestion, as reported by news wire Bloomberg this week, that some EU members may press Ireland to drop its opposition to corporate tax reforms in return for the bloc backing the Government on Brexit. This was “not some kind of quid pro quo,” he said.“To link the two is simply not accurate,” he said.He remarked that there were “enough challenges with Brexit without creating new ones that aren’t there.”“It is far too serious and too significant an issue its own right for that kind of conversation to be taking place,” he told reporters.Mr Coveney was speaking at the Government’s announcement of a series public information meetings, which he called “Brexpos”, to be held in Cork, Galway, Monaghan and Dublin next month as part of a revamped Brexit response plan called “Getting Ireland Brexit Ready.”The Government’s preparations for a potential no-deal Brexit “should not be interpreted as a reflection of the state of play in the negotiations or in any way prejudge the outcome,” he said.“We have got to move ahead with preparations to ensure that we have an appropriate response to various different scenarios that may unfold,” he said.The plan includes initiatives already announced by the Government, including a €300 million Brexit Loan Scheme that provides financing of between €25,000 and €1.5 million to businesses affected by Brexit.Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation Heather Humphreys did not answer a question about how much had been drawn down under the scheme, launched at the end of March.She said that 151 applications for loans had been made and that of those 132 were eligible, of which 10 had been sanctioned. She would have more up to date figures by the end of September, she said.Clarity about the border issue must be agreed before any further discussions on Brexit go ahead maintains former taoiseach Bertie Ahern.Anything else “will be a disaster” and he issue “needs to be tied down” he told RTE’s Today with Sean O’Rourke show.Mr Ahern said Ms May will have to make concessions, but she would not admit that before the forthcoming Tory conference. “We might have to make some concessions. Every week that goes by weakens our position. The British have successfully dragged it out.“She’s done one hell of a job of dragging it out.”He also said that “the DUP isn’t as stringent as people say. They are realistic people. They know it has to be a frictionless border. They know there has to be give and take.” The sensible thing for the UK to do is to stay within the Customs Union, he added.An agreement needs to be tied down for a frictionless, open border, with freedom to trade between north and south with no regulations. There are still five weeks to reach an agreement, said Mr Ahern.But he warned that the nearer the deadline approaches the greater the prospect of compromise. If the British government wants the same terms for the rest of the UK as have been proposed for Northern Ireland then why do they want to leave the Customs Union, he asked. Ms May is playing a short-term game, he added.It is important for the EU coalition to maintain its support for Ireland. No future discussions should be allowed go ahead until there is “absolute clarity” about what will happen on January 1st 2021. “If this issue is allowed to be pushed into the future relations discussion it will be a disaster,” he warned.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Nick BradshawPresidential hopeful Sarah Louise Mulligan was ejected from a meeting of South Dublin County Council on Thursday as she made her pitch to councillors for a nomination.Ms Mulligan, after speaking for about 10 minutes during which she pledged to highlight issues such as child abuse, suicide, and elder abuse during her presidency, asked councillors: “Are you not sick of politicians?”“Because I am,” she continued. “They’re all talk and no action.”Councillor Mark Ward, chairing the meeting, at that point told Ms Mulligan that her permitted speaking time had elapsed. However, Ms Mulligan said she would “not be silenced”.“Don’t you silence me,” she said. “I’ve got every right to stand up and speak. I can speak for Ireland.”Ms Mulligan then took issue with a remark from councillor Dermot Looney, who suggested that Ms Mulligan would not be speaking for the people of Ireland.The meeting was suspended moments later as Ms Mulligan shouted at Mr Looney, and approached him, demanding an apology in a raised voice. She said it was “disgusting behaviour”.Earlier, Ms Mulligan rebuked councillors for whispering as she was speaking. “I hear a lot of whispering and I’d like you to respect me,” she said.During her pitch for the Aras, Ms Mulligan said the presidency had “lost touch with the everyday person”.“We need a president who is in touch with the everyday person,” she said. “We need a president who is in touch with the most vulnerable in out society. I want to be the voice for the voiceless.“I would use my platform to openly communicate with the young people of Ireland, highlight the early signs of symptoms and help young people who are contemplating suicide.”She said she would work with Minister for Health Simon Harris on the issue.Ms Mulligan described herself as “pro- life” and said she would commit half her salary to the opening of crisis pregnancy centres.At another point, she said she would donate half her salary to houses for the homeless.Ms Mulligan also described herself as “a huge president Trump fan”, and took issue with how she is portayed in the media.“Don’t always read what you see in the papers,” she said. “I’m no blonde bimbo. The Irish media likes to make me out to be a Marilyn Monroe impersonator. Did you see the Tonight show? I didn’t get a word in edgeways.”She also said she would accompany Joanna Jordan, who recently lost a High Court case seeking to overturn the result of the referendum to repeal the Eighth Amendment, to the European Court of Justice.“She has 500 pages of evidence where she tried to prove the about referendum was rigged,” she said. “I hope to travel to the European Court with Joanna Jordan because I don’t believe this beautiful country voted to murder babies.”Read more news, analysis and comment from the race to the \u0026Aacuteras"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3635944.1537453404!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"tg4 apologises after cgi clip shows caravan kicked off cliff","story":"TG4 have apologised after an auto-scheduled clip featuring a monster kicking a caravan into the sea aired before a news bulletin about a Swiss woman who was killed when her caravan was toppled by Storm Ali in Galway.

REUTERSLisi NiesnerTaoiseach Leo Varadkar has said other EU leaders have told him a Brexit deal that does not work for Ireland will not be acceptable to them.He was speaking at the end of the two-day informal summit in Salszburg, at which leaders of the remaining 27 EU states agreed that the UK government’s Chequers blueprint for Brexit will not work in its present form.“All the EU leaders who spoke gave me their absolute support in standing behind Ireland, and saying that an agreement that doesn’t work for Ireland doesn’t work for the EU. I am leaving here very reassured,” Mr Varadkar said.He dismissed as a serious “tactical error” those in the UK who appeared to be counting on isions emerging among the 27.The same was true, he said, of comments by the Hungarian President Viktor Orban who had suggested that a group of EU leaders were seeking to “punish” the UK.Mr Varadkar, who had a bilateral meeting with British Prime Minister Theresa May this morning, said that she promised she would shortly be bringing forward proposals on the backstop, “but we haven’t seen anything in writing.”He would not be drawn to comment on suggestions that these would address means of putting some regulatory controls on the Irish Sea. “There was a pattern of verbal briefings promising that certain things would happen,” he said, “and when the documents arrive they are not quite what we expected”.Mrs May, who reiterated her determination not to see two customs territories emerge in the UK, is understood to have expressed doubts about whether it will be possible to conclude the discussions by the October summit. But she told Mr Varadkar she was keen to bring negotiations to a conclusion as soon as possible.The Taoiseach said: “I can understand when people start using terms like ‘a border in the Irish Sea’...but nobody is trying to dispute the constutional status of Northern Ireland.”He emphasised the importance of sticking to the October summit deadline for agreement. “I would like to have the deal agreed in principle in October and formalise it at a special summit in in mid-November,” he said.He spoke of a willingness to compromise. “Everyone does have to compromise,” Mr Varadkar said, but added there could be no compromise on four principles: a transition period, protecting the Common Travel Area and the rights of Northern Ireland citizens after Brexit and having a legally operable backstop.“But of course on language, detail, how you actually achieve those things I think any reasonable person who wants to get an agreement as to be willing to compromise.”In their discussion of the political declaration on the future relationship between the EU and UK, supposed to accompany the legally binding Withdrawal Agreement, leaders reiterated their belief that the Chequers White Paper could not provide the basis of such a relationship.That was particularly so in terms of its economic proposals, signing up to only part of the single market and complex customs procedures, which France’s President Macron described simply as “unacceptable”. He said that Mrs May’s “take it or leave it” attitude to these aspects would not work.Mr Tusk told the final press conference that although “Everybody shared the view that while there are positive elements in the Chequers proposal, the suggested framework for economic cooperation will not work. Not least because it risks undermining the Single Market.”Mrs May acknowledged that she had had a “frank bilateral” with Mr Tusk an hour before her end-of-summit press conference in which she was forced to defend. She tried to downplay their unexpectedly strong criticisms of her Chequers plan. “I have always said these negotiations were going to be tough,” May told reporters. “And at various stages of these negotiations, tactics would be used as part of those negotiations.”The Taoiseach also refused to follow the lead of Malta’s PM Joseph Muscat , who called for a second referendum in the UK. “I don’t think it’s my place or my position as prime minister of a foreign country to be telling the UK what to do.” But Mr Muscat had done so? “I know he did, but I’m not going to,” the Taoiseach replied.But Mr Vardakar left on a confident note: “I think we are going to get a deal.”European Council president Donald Tusk said it would be decided in October whether there had been sufficient progress in the Brexit talks to call a special summit in November to finalise a deal.“Everybody shared the view that while there are positive elements in the Chequers proposal, the suggested framework for economic co-operation will not work, not least because it is undermining the single market,” he said.French president Emmanuel Macron said the Brexit plan proposed by British prime minister Theresa May was unacceptable in its current form and that he expected new proposals from Britain in October to sort out pending issues.“It was a good and brave step by the prime minister,” said Mr Macron. “But we all agreed on this today, the proposals in their current state are not acceptable, especially on the economic side of it. The Chequers plan cannot be take it or leave it.”The French president, who has taken a hard stance on preserving the European Union’s united front in talks on Britain’s departure from the bloc, said Brexit showed other countries that leaving the EU had negative consequences.“Those who explain that we can easily live without Europe, that everything is going to be all right, and that it’s going to bring a lot of money home are liars,” said Mr Macron. “It’s even more true since they left the day after so as not to have to deal with it,” he added, referring to top Brexit proponents.Meanwhile, Mr Tusk said the “moment of truth” in the Brexit negotiations would come at the next full summit in October. “In October we expect maximum progress and results in the Brexit talks, and then we will decide whether conditions are there to call an extra summit in November to finalise and formalise the deal,” he said.Mr Tusk said that at a working lunch of the EU27 without Mrs May present, the leaders had reconfirmed their “full unity”. He added that there could be no withdrawal agreement without a “solid, operational and legally-binding Irish backstop”.Mrs May said the UK would “shortly” be coming forward with new proposals on the “backstop” arrangements for the Border.The prime minister said she had had a “frank” exchange with Mr Tusk, who had “confirmed the commitment of the other 27 member states to reaching a deal as soon as possible”.She said two key issues remained to be resolved: “We both agree there can be no withdrawal agreement without a legally-operative backstop. But that backstop cannot ide the United Kingdom into two customs territories and we will be bringing forward our own proposals shortly.“On the economic partnership, there is no solution that will resolve the Northern Ireland Border which is not based on the frictionless movement of goods. Our White Paper remains the only serious and credible proposition on the table for achieving that objective.”Mrs May said there was “a lot of hard work to be done” to secure agreement. “If the political will is there on the other side, I’m confident we will reach a deal.”She later defended Chequers to journalists, saying that it remained the only proposal on the table.“I’m negotiating and I’m negotiating hard in the interest of the British people, and negotiating to deliver on what the British people voted for in the referendum. I am also clear that if we’re going to deal with the commitments we’ve made in relation to Northern Ireland, we do need to ensure that there is no hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland,” she said.“We need to do that in a way that maintains the integrity of the United Kingdom, to do that we need to have the frictionless movement of goods across the Border, the only proposal on the table at the moment that will deliver on that frictionless movement of goods . . . is the proposal that we have put forward in the White Paper.” – Additional reporting PAReutersDeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

He has done a first class job and I think from my perspective, he has won the trust of the people and performed with distinction.”Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan also warned against the PAC influencing the Presidential campaign.“We are in an election campaign and I would expect the committee will not in any way interfere or adversely impact on what is going to be a very intense election,” said Mr Flanagan, who was also attending the Ploughing Championship.Meanwhile, PAC chairman Sean Fleming said its members would discuss the issue next Tuesday but that questions would be kept strictly to how money is spent and will not be directed toward President Michael D Higgins personally.Ahead of Thursday’s meeting of the Committee, its members received correspondence from Martin Fraser, secretary general to the Government, who is also the official accounting officer for the spending related to the Presidency, outlining his concerns.“I believe your proposal to have a meeting on the issue appears to be unconstitutional and to undermine the principle of the political impartiality of the Civil Service,” Mr Fraser wrote in the letter, a copy of which has been seen by The .He noted in particular Article 13.8.1 of the Constitution which states the president is not answerable to either house of the Oireachtas or to any court “for the exercise and performance of the powers and functions of his office or for any act done or purporting to be done by him in the exercise and performance of these powers and functions”.Mr Fraser said it would be “impossible not to breach this constitutional provision” were any members of the PAC or public servants “to ask or answer” questions on the issue of expenditure.As regards the impartiality of the civil service, he said its members could not become involved in an election.“I cannot accept your suggestions that the campaign period has not yet started,” he wrote. “It is absolutely clear that a campaign for the office of the presidency is fully underway.”The proposed meeting, he continued, could only address questions relating to one of the candidates, the incumbent.His letter drew some ire from the Committee, with Fianna Fail TD for Sligo Leitrim Marc MacSharry in particular saying he was “annoyed in a major way” by its content which, he said, was an attempt to influence the business of the PAC.“The tone of the letter did bother me. It goes on to say that if we do this it would in some way undermine the impartiality of the civil service and I resent that suggestion,” he said.“Thanks Mr Fraser for the advice. I think it’s flawed I think it’s incorrect.”The subject of the spending relating to the office of the President has been raised in the run up to the election, particularly in relation to details not being available under the Freedom of Information Act.Its general expenditure is, however, audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General but this only takes into account how money is spent and not the decision making process around why it is spent.The Cage Séamus McCarthy told the Committee that the office of the president’s spending had always come in under budget.Labour deputy Alan Kelly asked that the Committee seek legal advice on whether or not there would be implications around examining the question of spending. He also questioned the hurry to address the issue, noting the potential for “political capital” it might engender, and suggested it be delayed until after the election.Fianna Fail TD Shane Cashless said he did not agree such a meeting would compromise the democratic process.Mr Sherlock declined the request to seek a legal opinion and the Committee voted to proceed with the subject on Tuesday, ahead of the forthcoming election campaign.A senior constitutional lawyer has said the Committee should defer the planned hearing and seek legal advice.Dr Conor Mahony of University College Cork told RTÉ that in his view the actions of the committee border on unconstitutional."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3635656.1537433967!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"america can no longer carry the world on its shoulders","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDonald Trump: Each of his broken treaties and tariff rounds can be read as a nudge towards that destiny: a bid to make America normal again. Photograph: Olivier DoulieryEPATo become a “normal country” is the dream of more than one republic. The world is familiar enough with the German case. Having atoned for the war and put Europe first, its next step as a common-or-garden nation is to pursue its narrow interests without embarrassment.Because he is so peculiar, we cannot credit that Donald Trump’s project is the normalisation of his own country. For all their shock value, that is what his foreign policies amount to: the restoration of the US as a selfish state among selfish states, not an overworked governess with the entire free world as her mewling wards.This realpolitik can be self-defeating. It misses the national interests that are served through such nominally high-minded works as the Paris climate accord. But it is still more coherent than its critics. Liberals chafed at American power until its threatened retreat, at which point Nato and the Washington Consensus on trade became sacraments to be saved from populist menaces. As for mainstream Republicans, at least Trump does not go in for mystical hokum about the US as a special nation ordained to uphold freedom.Realism has more going for it, though, than internal coherence. It also fits the external conditions. To lead a world order takes a nation in the full plumage of its powers. That is a better description of the US in 1948 than 2018, much less 2048. Trump’s infidelity to the postwar system is disquieting, but perhaps he is doing through choice what future presidents will have to do through necessity.Pax Americana is not the natural order of things. It is a phase born of the most extreme circumstances. The US accounted for a third of the world’s output when it set up the Bretton Woods institutions, revived Japan and secured Europe. Because its absolute power remained so awesome, we forget that its relative position began to decline soon after. It now accounts for about 20 per cent of global output. It does not have the wherewithal to underwrite the democratic world forever. At some point, a president was going to construe the national interest in narrower terms. The most recent three were elected on a pledge to do so.Whether Trump-as-statesman understands the relative decline he has lived through – he was born in 1946 – Trump-as-politician understands something just as relevant. The taxpayer still awaits the peace idend that was said to be in the mail when the Berlin Wall turned to debris.The US has spent most of the post-cold war era in expensive conflicts in another hemisphere. These “forever wars” rolled on as the home land endured a financial crash and the kind of infrastructure that should be beneath the dignity of the nation that built the Hoover dam.The two trends – relative decline and domestic exhaustion – have created the best atmosphere for realpolitik since the post-Vietnam years. The difference is that this time it should last, as China and other powers trim America’s room for manoeuvre.There is no demand for isolation. There is plenty for a focus on interests over values. Trump’s is the first (and therefore the worst) attempt to service that demand. There was no need to humiliate allies as blameless as Canada or to impose, as his government did this week, new limits on the annual intake of refugees. But the underlying logic of selfishness will outlast him.Realists smell a chance to temper the crudities of America First into a serious, interest-led, foreign policy. The foremost among their academic tribe, John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt, each have books out to encourage their nation’s retirement from “liberal hegemony”.Even if the coming realism turns out to be an over-correction, a correction was due. Not long ago, George W Bush could describe freedom as the “design of nature” and Barack Obama could, with equal nonchalance, say that the arc of history bends towards justice. The arc of history does not bend towards anything.There are things to miss about these presidents – their personal class, their seasoned cabinets – but this teleological gibberish is not one of them. The postwar record suggests that ideals get the US into trouble more often than cold calculation does.Richard Nixon said that a leader can, at most, “give history a nudge”. He or she cannot alter the course of history so much as quicken a trend that is already in train. The structural trends of the world demand a more self-interested US over time.Each of Trump’s broken treaties and tariff rounds can be read as a nudge towards that destiny: a bid to make America normal again. His successors will do it better. But they will do it. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2018"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/09/20/TELEMMGLPICT000175177307_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqpz6JWYZZvemSsqXamJ3u61KhJ3hCnQ35BuwW6vfCccA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"black dancer english national ballet says has criticised traditionalists","story":"Precious Adams previously said her dark skin had prevented her from getting partsA black ballerina has been targeted by dance traditionalists after revealing she will no longer wear pink ballet tights on stage. American-born dancer Precious Adams has announced she will now wear brown tights when performing, as she believes they allow her to look her best on stage.And despite criticism from many in the ballet industry, the first artist at the English National Ballet said the company had welcomed her decision, ushering in a new tradition for the industry\u0027s dancers. The 23-year-old, who is currently performing in Lest We Forget, told the Evening Standard that she always wants to look her best in front of an audience and brown tights were the obvious choice to match with her skin tone. “When I was a student I never really thought about the uniform - it was just pink tights and pink shoes,” Miss Adams said.But since turning professional she realised the tights no longer “made sense” for her. “It changes the aesthetic, you want there to be continuation between your upper and lower body and there’s a big disconnect if I put pink tights on,” she said.“I want to look my best on stage. I’m not colourblind and I think it ruins the line of my body.”Precious Adams performed in Swan Lake for the English National BalletDespite this, she said traditionalists had often questioned her decision, claiming it was “incorrect” ballet uniform.“They’re like ‘But pink tights, that’s what ballet is’,” Miss Adams said. “They think me wearing brown tights in a tutu is somehow incorrect.”One social media user went as far as to brand her decision “a disgrace to the tradition of ballet”. But the ballerina, originally from Canton, Detroit, did reveal she has the support of ENB director Tamara Rojo. “Times change - it’s just a natural evolution for these things to be questioned.“Tamara’s really changing the company. It’s incredible working under her. She wants us all to be human. Dancers aren’t robots, we’re not clones. Everyone is an inidual, and she tries hard to play to people’s strengths.”American-born dancer Precious Adams has announced she will now wear brown tights when performingFive years ago, Miss Adams gave an interview to The Moscow Times in which she said that her dark skin had prevented her from getting parts.She explained that looking back she had been naive when speaking in the paper, and that the interview had caused her “problems”. “I knew what I was going into when I went to school in Moscow.

For denouncing the horrors of Daesh in tweets, the \u0027justice system\u0027 is putting me through psychiatric tests! Just how far will they go? she said in another tweet, using the Arabic acronym for Isil.This regime is really starting to be frightening, she wrote in a further post, suggesting that the case was part of a government plot to discredit her.Later the leader of the National Rally (formerly the Front National), who lost to the centrist Emmanuel Macron in last year\u0027s presidential election, spoke to journalists in the corridors of the National Assembly to say she would not attend any evaluation.“I’m waiting to see how the magistrates plan to force me to do it,” said Ms Le Pen.The court order was dated 11 September and requested that the tests be carried out as soon as possible to determine whether the 50-year-old is capable of understanding remarks and answering questions.Ms Le Pen also argued that obligatory psychiatric evaluation was usually reserved for sex offenders and paedophiles.Murdered US journalist James Foley\u0026#39s parents accused Ms Le Pen of using their son’s \u0026#34shamefully uncensored\u0026#34 image for political gainAt the time, Mr Foley\u0027s parents accused Ms Le Pen of using their son’s shamefully uncensored image for political gain.Ms Le Pen later deleted the photograph from her account and claimed she did not know it showed Mr Foley when she tweeted it. She said she removed it immediately after his family complained.Mr Foley, a freelance reporter, was abducted in Syria in 2012 and beheaded in August 2014.Ms Le Pen had shared the images in response to a French journalist who drew a comparison between Isil and her anti-immigrant, anti-Islam, eurosceptic party.Jeremy Hunt indicates UK may support ICC referral over Rohingya atrocities as he defends Suu Kyi\u0026#39s \u0026#39difficult position\u0026#39 Man Booker Prize judges tell authors: stop being so long-windedSergei Skripal \u0026#39hitmen\u0026#39 linked to GRU officer\u0026#39s plot to assassinate Montenegrin Prime MinisterRussian authorities invalidate local election for first time in 16 years after last-minute ballot stuffingPheasant shooting to be banned on public land in WalesUS orders Chinese state media to register as foreign agentsOfsted has lost two thirds of its inspectors amid complaints that  job has become like a \u0026#39treadmill\u0026#39Jeremy Corbyn: Labour government may give Nicola Sturgeon power for second independence referendumComment: Checkmate for Chequers – and a miserable day for Theresa May Hizbollah chief boasts of moving \u0026#39high-precision\u0026#39 weapons under Israel\u0026#39s noseThree killed during drug distribution centre shooting in Maryland, AmericaChris Grayling under pressure to resign after failing to accept any responsibility for rail timetabling chaos\u0026#39It will not work\u0026#39 - EU leaders reject Theresa May\u0026#39s Chequers proposal for BrexitFears for hundreds missing after ferry capsizes in Tanzania Comment: Michael Palin in North Korea hits our screens tonight.

In one occasion, a firefighting brigade suddenly appeared and evacuated an entire polling station without any signs of fire or smoke. In some cases, polling stations counted more votes than voters registered at them. On Wednesday, Russia’s Central Election Commission, recommended election authorities in Primorye invalidate the vote.We\u0027re talking about systematic, well-planned violations that led to the result we’re seeing,” Commission member Boris Ebzeyev told the Interfax news agency. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov supported the move, saying that “legitimacy, transparency, cleanness and fairness” of elections is much more important to Mr Putin than victory of a candidate he backs. The new vote is scheduled to be held in three months’ time. It is still unclear whether both Mr Ishchenko and Mr Tarasenko are going to run again. On Wednesday, Mr Tarasenko told reporters he would not run if there was a new vote, but then backtracked at a rally of his supporters. Mr Ishchenko said he is planning to сontest the decision to invalidate the election in court.Jeremy Hunt indicates UK may support ICC referral over Rohingya atrocities as he defends Suu Kyi\u0026#39s \u0026#39difficult position\u0026#39 Man Booker Prize judges tell authors: stop being so long-windedSergei Skripal \u0026#39hitmen\u0026#39 linked to GRU officer\u0026#39s plot to assassinate Montenegrin Prime MinisterPheasant shooting to be banned on public land in WalesUS orders Chinese state media to register as foreign agentsOfsted has lost two thirds of its inspectors amid complaints that  job has become like a \u0026#39treadmill\u0026#39Jeremy Corbyn: Labour government may give Nicola Sturgeon power for second independence referendumComment: Checkmate for Chequers – and a miserable day for Theresa May Hizbollah chief boasts of moving \u0026#39high-precision\u0026#39 weapons under Israel\u0026#39s noseThree killed during drug distribution centre shooting in Maryland, AmericaChris Grayling under pressure to resign after failing to accept any responsibility for rail timetabling chaos\u0026#39It will not work\u0026#39 - EU leaders reject Theresa May\u0026#39s Chequers proposal for BrexitFears for hundreds missing after ferry capsizes in Tanzania Comment: Michael Palin in North Korea hits our screens tonight.

In 2012, CGTN established operations in Washington DC, building a sleek broadcast center and hiring away journalists from NBC, Bloomberg and other Western news organisations.Xinhua has also occupied prime advertising space in New York’s Times Square.Most recently in 2016, the state media outlet paid for a video to be played on a giant screen promoting China’s role and standing in the South China Sea, where the country has engaged in territorial disputes with other Asian nations.Paid inserts of state-run newspaper China Daily now as well appear in major newspapers including the New York Times and the Washington Post. Newspaper boxes distributing the state paper have popped up in US cities from Honolulu to Washington.The company that distributes the paper is already registered under FARA.The Foreign Agents Registration Act was enacted in 1938 in efforts to combat a flood of German propaganda leading up to World War II.The purpose is to insure the government and general public is aware of the source of information and identify of various iniduals or organisations “attempting to influence US public opinion, policy, and laws,” according to a government website about the law.The US-China Economic and Security Review Commission, which provides recommendations to US lawmakers, has suggested the law be strengthened to require all staff of Chinese state media to inidually register under the act. Jeremy Hunt indicates UK may support ICC referral over Rohingya atrocities as he defends Suu Kyi\u0026#39s \u0026#39difficult position\u0026#39 Man Booker Prize judges tell authors: stop being so long-windedSergei Skripal \u0026#39hitmen\u0026#39 linked to GRU officer\u0026#39s plot to assassinate Montenegrin Prime MinisterRussian authorities invalidate local election for first time in 16 years after last-minute ballot stuffingPheasant shooting to be banned on public land in WalesOfsted has lost two thirds of its inspectors amid complaints that  job has become like a \u0026#39treadmill\u0026#39Jeremy Corbyn: Labour government may give Nicola Sturgeon power for second independence referendumComment: Checkmate for Chequers – and a miserable day for Theresa May Hizbollah chief boasts of moving \u0026#39high-precision\u0026#39 weapons under Israel\u0026#39s noseThree killed during drug distribution centre shooting in Maryland, AmericaChris Grayling under pressure to resign after failing to accept any responsibility for rail timetabling chaos\u0026#39It will not work\u0026#39 - EU leaders reject Theresa May\u0026#39s Chequers proposal for BrexitFears for hundreds missing after ferry capsizes in Tanzania Comment: Michael Palin in North Korea hits our screens tonight.

A substantial minority of Labour supporters voted Leave in 2016. Many Labour MPs fear that support for a referendum could cost them votes at the next election.“YouGov’s figures do not bear this out. Of the YouGov respondents who currently support Labour and voted Leave in the Brexit referendum, only 6 per cent put Brexit at the top of their concerns and say they would not, or be less likely to, vote Labour if the party backed a popular vote.“This is just two per cent of all Labour supporters, or just over 200,000 voters\u0026nbspin all.”All 27 EU leaders believe May\u0027s Brexit trade plan \u0027will not work\u0027The best comments from the Reddit AMA with Alastair Campbell\u0027It\u0027s ok to change your mind over Brexit\u0027, explains new short filmLabour could stop Brexit from destroying Britain\u0027s heartlandsProsecco exports from Italy to UK fall for first time in 10 yearsMacron urges EU leaders to stand firm against May in Brexit talksHe explained that once these voters were subtracted from those gained by a pledge to back a new referendum, the net increase is some 1.5 million\u0026nbspvotes.Mr Kellner added: “Like all such hypothetical exercises, different ways of asking the questions and doing the sums will yield different results.“But the nine-to-one gulf between the non-Labour target voters and the at-risk Labour supporters leaves no doubt that by backing a popular vote on Brexit, the party would end up making significant gains in votes and seats. In a tight general election, it could make the difference between returning to government and remaining in opposition.”With those figures layered on the whole country, Labour would stand to gain around 60 seats across the UK.People\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit dealA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina

by the group Represent Us, drilled down into specific constituencies by polling in 107 marginal seats across the UK with a majority of less than 3,500.Across the 82 seats in England and Wales it found Labour would leapfrog the Tories in vote share with a pledge to back the new vote, going from a point behind in 2017 to a point in front, down in large part to stealing support from the Liberal Democrats.That would indicate Labour holding its 35 most marginal seats in England and Wales and winning a further 16 from the Conservatives – despite at least 38 of these having backed Leave in 2016.Backing a new referendum would also allow Labour to minimise potential losses against a dominant SNP in Scotland, according to the ICM data.Dozens of motions have been tabled ahead of Labour’s conference in Liverpool in a bid to get the party to vote on backing a new referendum on Brexit, with several unions having already thrown their weight behind the idea in the run up.There is also set to be a rally for a People’s Vote on Sunday in Liverpool right outside the party’s main conference event.The Independent understands that the leadership will likely stick to its commitment to keep the option of a vote on the table, without giving explicit support to one.Labour MP for Tottenham David Lammy urged his party to back a new referendum, saying: “What these figures show is that supporting a People’s Vote is also the right thing for the party to do if we want\u0026nbspto win a general election.“This should concentrate some minds at our conference in Liverpool next week.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account

Sketch.New research suggests voters see parties that are markedly left or right wing as less competent than those closer to the centreClick to followIndy PoliticsCorbyn could face obstacle of inherent biasJeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party will be at a disadvantage if it goes into the next general election being seen as extreme, according to a new study.The research suggested that parties seen as “fairly” and “very” left- or right-wing are less likely to be seen as competent – by 9 per cent and 15 per cent respectively.It means the same would apply to the\u0026nbspConservative Party if it moved to the right under the\u0026nbsppossible future leadership of Boris Johnson or Jacob Rees-Mogg.The research, by Professor Rob Johns of the University of Essex and Ann-Kristin\u0026nbspKölln\u0026nbspof Aarhus University, finds that the “competence penalty” is the same for extreme parties of the left and the right. By contrast, “centre left”, “centre” and “centre right” parties are all seen as equally competent.\u0026nbspI left Labour for the Lib Dems because Corbyn isn\u0027t radical enoughSenior Corbyn ally criticises activists over Iran and Saudi ArabiaProfessor Johns suggests two likely reasons for the link between moderation and competence: that moderate parties are seen as readier to compromise, and that they are more realistic about what can be achieved.“Our results suggest that a Labour Party in Jeremy Corbyn’s ideological image faces a disadvantage at election time. As in 2017, this can be partly overcome by the considerable popularity of specific left-wing policies. Nevertheless, the widespread view that the party is well to the left does take a toll on its reputation for governing competence. The same will be true of the Conservatives if, as may well happen in the post-Brexit shake-up, they are perceived as drifting further to the right.”Professor Johns said he recognised that Labour had exceeded expectations in the 2017 election, and that there might be “advantages to a clear and strong ideological message”.\u0026nbspBut his research was designed to separate perceptions of ideology\u0026nbspfrom other perceptions of the current parties: “The true effect of ideological stance on perceived competence has always been hard to pin down because there are too many other factors at play – for example, the personality and capacity of leaders like Tony Blair and Jeremy Corbyn themselves – that might have driven their parties’ competence ratings. The best way of isolating the impact of ideology is to hold those other factors constant in a survey experiment.”UK news in picturesChris Evans’ wife Natasha Shishmanian has given birth to twins, a boy and girl affectionately nicknamed “Ping and Pong” throughout the pregnancy.Storm Ali has hit the British Isles bringing winds of up to 100mph.

Respondents were given random descriptions of two hypothetical parties – whether the party was in government, its issue priorities, its current poll rating, the sex of its leader, how united or ided it is, and its “political outlook”.\u0026nbspThis last item consisted of seven categories ranging from “very left wing” to “very right wing”. Finally, people were then asked to choose which of the two parties they thought was more competent. The analysis found the most extreme left-right labels carried a significant “competence penalty”.\u0026nbspRespondents were also asked to place themselves of the left-right scale, and tended to rate parties closer to their own position as more competent. But, regardless of their own position, they also tended to rate the party closer to the centre as more competent.Professor Johns said: “Being seen as a competent government-in-waiting is central to the Corbyn strategy.

Used fur products would be exempt.The council is considering an exemption for products used for religious purposes, such as fur hats worn by Orthodox Jews,\u0026nbspas well as for items made from pelts legally taken under the authority of a California fur-trapping license.Major fashion companies, including Michael Kors, Armani and Gucci, have also moved away from using fur. Earlier this month, Burberry said it would stop selling real fur.\u0026nbspActivists have condemned the fur industry as inhumane, arguing that the animals are subject to brutal conditions and torturous deaths.However, Keith Kaplan, a spokesman for the Fur Information Council of America, said that while full-length coats of sable and mink may not be as popular as they once were, fur is still found in around 70 per cent of the world’s latest autumn fashion collections.“If consumers weren’t buying it, fashion houses wouldn’t be designing it, and manufacturers wouldn’t be making it,” he said.He also disputed as “bogus” claims by animal rights groups that the methods employed by the fur industry are inherently cruel and inhumane.Retail fur sales globally accounted for $35.8bn (£27.2bn), and the fur industry employed more than one\u0026nbspmillion people in 2014, the latest year figures were available from the industry, Mr Kaplan said.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMPs to ban import of animal furResponding to news of the ban, Humane Society International (HSI) called on the British government to work towards making the UK the first country in the world to ban the sale of animal fur.Farming fur was made illegal in the UK in 2000, and EU law bans fur from domestic cats, dogs and hunted seals. However, Britain imports fur from other species including foxes and rabbits.Claire Bass, HSI UK’s executive director, said:\u0026nbsp“A cruel product like fur has no place in the City of Angels, and we applaud the Los Angeles City council for taking a moral stand.“Now it is time for the UK government to show equal compassion and listen to the vast majority of British people who want the UK to become the first country in the world to fully ban the sale of animal fur.“Our government has stated its ambition for the UK\u0026nbspto be ‘a world leader in animal welfare’, blazing a trail as the first country to outlaw the cruel and unnecessary fur trade would show that this ambition will be delivered with actions, not just words. The sale of cat, dog and seal fur is already banned here so now let’s finish the job and ban fur full stop.”Additional reporting by agenciesEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/07/15/251230075-files-this-photograph-taken-on-september-12-2017-shows-rohingya-refugees-arriving-by-boat.jpg  width= 2048  height= 1536  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/07/15/251230075-files-this-photograph-taken-on-september-12-2017-shows-rohingya-refugees-arriving-by-boat.jpg","title":"un myanmar rohingya genocide united nations","story":"Created with Sketch.Click to followThe IndependentInternational Criminal Court to investigate Myanmar’s Rohingya deportationsThe International Criminal Court (ICC) has launched a preliminary investigation into the Rohingya crisis to determine whether the mass deportations of Muslims from Myanmar into Bangladesh was a crime against humanity.Chief prosecutor Fatou Bensouda\u0026nbspsaid\u0026nbspif the evidence collected in the initial probe was sufficient, it would pave the way for a full-blown investigation.Myanmar\u0027s military has been accused of a horrifying list of\u0026nbspviolations, including rape, murder, torture and the burning of Rohingya villages, leading about 700,000 people to flee to neighbouring Bangladesh.Ms Bensouda said she will look at reports of “a number of alleged coercive acts having resulted in the forced displacement of the Rohingya people, including deprivation of fundamental rights, killing, sexual violence, enforced disappearance, destruction and looting”.Suu Kyi defends jailing of journalists who covered Rohingya killingsICC rules it can investigate crimes against RohingyaJournalists covering Rohingya crisis jailed for seven years in MyanmarAlthough Myanmar is not a member of the Hague-based court, Bangladesh is.

Iran oil: OPEC says Tehran \u0026lsquoVERY important\u0026rsquo even AFTER US sanctionsMany refiners in Japan, the world\u0027s fourth-biggest oil consumer, say they are also resigned to completely halting imports from one of their historically important suppliers, unlike during a previous round of sanctions when they only reduced imports from Iran.Iran is an important supplier of oil to Japan, accounting for about 5 percent of its crude imports, and Japanese refiners, together with the government, will try to maintain its good relationship with the Middle Eastern country, said Tsukioka, adding that the U.S. sanctions will not cause a major impact.Tsukioka said in July that Japanese oil refiners would likely stop loading Iranian crude oil from mid-September, with final shipments to arrive in the first half of October.And Iran\u0027s Naftiran Intertrade Co Ltd, a trading arm for state-owned National Iranian Oil Co, owns a 15.4 percent stake in Chennai Petroleum, which has two refineries with a total combined capacity of 230,000 barrels of oil per day (bpd).Mr Tsukloka said \u0027each firm is taking the same stance\u0027 on halting Iranian loadings (Image: getty)United India Insurance has informed Chennai Petroleum that its new annual policy that is set to take effect from October will not cover any liability related to processing crude from Iran, the three sources said.\u0026nbspThis has forced the refiner to cancel a scheduled loading of 1 million barrels in October, they said.Indian insurers do not fall directly under the sanctions, but need to hedge their own risk on the Western reinsurance market, which will not accept Iranian exposure.It is quite complicated.. reinsurers are quite apprehensive about extending cover for Chennai Petroleum, said one of the sources, who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue.                \u0026lsquoSanctions could trigger war,\u0026rsquo Iran issues chilling warning                US sanctions on Iran are \u0027unproductive\u0027 and \u0027wrong\u0027Chennai Petroleum\u0027s reduced demand will further cut India\u0027s imports from Iran to about 10 million tonnes in October, lower than previous estimates reported by Reuters. .Reinsurers have said they can not provide full 100 percent cover.

Heres what you need to know.After a marathon session of talks at Chequers on July 6, Theresa May managed to secure a Brexit plan which will be assessed by the EU.Her Brexit plan will see the UK remain closely tied to Brussels.It also includes the creation of a new UK-EU free trade area for goods, with a common rulebook.This rulebook could limit the UKs ability to strike trade deals with countries such as the US, for whom securing market access for American farmers would be a big prize.Mrs May has agreed to an amendment that would stop Britain being tied to Europes customs union after we quit the EU.In dramatic scenes in the House of Commons on July 17 2018, Mrs May managed to see off a damaging attempt, winning by just six votes.Mrs May was then defeated on a separate amendment to her flagship Trade Bill, which will require her to seek continued UK participation in the EUs system for regulation of medicines after Brexit.Now her Cabinet is required to ensure that the UK can continue to participate in the regulatory network operated by the European Medicines Agency.Mrs May hopes to get an agreement hammered out at a series of summits with EU leaders this autumn, and bring it back to Parliament for approval.A deal on the UKs withdrawal agreement was expected to be agreed in time for the summit in October, along with a statement from both sides on the future relationship.However, a number of senior figures have said this deadline may slide into November.Once a deal has been agreed, MPs will be asked to approve it.In a Panorama interview in September 2018 she said MPs had a simple choice between her Chequers plan or no deal.She told the BBC current affairs programme: I think that the alternative to that [the Chequers plan] will be not having a deal.Opposition to the plan in the Conservative Party centres around the European Research Group of Hard Brexit supporting MPs led by Jacob Rees-Mogg.His voice had been among the loudest voicing their objection to the plan and he urged MPs “chuck Chequers”.Up to 80 Tory MPs are prepared to vote against Theresa Mays Chequers plan, Steve Baker, a former Brexit minister and ERG backer has warned.A group of about 50 Tory MPs have met to discuss how and when they could force her out of her job, the BBC reported.Also voicing his opposition to the Chequers deal has been Boris Johnson.He said Theresas Mays had wrapped a suicide vest around the British constitution and handed the detonator to Brussels.The former Foreign Secretary later claimed Mrs Mays disastrous plans for the Irish border would leave Britain at a loss.Boris Johnson said the European Unions fallback position for the Irish border would mean Northern Ireland was annexed by Brussels.Along with former Brexit secretary David Davis, Mr Johnson resigned in protest following the Chequers meeting.Several other MPs also quit their ministerial posts over the issue, including Steve Baker, Maria Caulfield, Ben Bradley and Robert Courts.The party will vote down any Brexit deal brought back from Brussels by Theresa May, according to shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry.The Corbyn ally said the party will oppose it to try to force an election by Christmas.Speaking to the FT she said a deal which meets her party’s tests was “not going to happen”, and therefore the Prime Minister would be forced to quit.Without the support of the opposition party, it would need just a handful of Tory rebels to vote against her to see it defeated.Theresa Mays initial plans brought her on side with those Conservatives who favour a soft Brexit.The Prime Minister has also been seeking grassroots Tory support for the plan.Among those voicing support for the Prime Minister has been Environment Secretary Michael Gove, who was a prominent member of the Leave campaign.He said he was confident that the Prime Minister will go into the Conservative Party conference and beyond, securing a good Brexit deal for Britain and continuing to ensure the country enjoys good economic growth and we take advantage of Brexit.A plan may have been cooked up but it still needs to get past the EU — and the continent’s leaders are showing no sign of compromise.Angela Merkel is already rubbishing our proposal.The Napoleonic Emmanuel Macron thinks he’s a political messiah, and he’d rather see us punished than give up on his federalist promised land.And Michel Barnier’s dangled “concessions” amount to a demand for total UK capitulation.With that level of zeal and stubbornness, it’s no wonder we voted in our millions to leave.We must now go to Brussels with an offer that guarantees control of our borders and sign our own trade deals.But we mustn’t for a second think that they’ll just say yes to it, nor can the PM let them fatally weaken it.It is galling that ministers have spent more time fighting between themselves than preparing for a “no deal” exit.But it isn’t too late.New technology can ensure that Whitehall and our borders are ready for a clean break, which considering the strength of our economy and our companies is nothing to be scared of.The PM has dumped many of her earlier Brexit slogans. But she should remember one in particular now.No deal really is better than a bad deal, and we must still prepare for it."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/MPNK_EP1_C5_SCREENGRAB_004.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"kim jong un five litres free beer monthly revealed michael palin documentary","story":"These are just some of the singular and strange insights that Monty Python actor Michael Palin gained on his visit to the worlds most secretive state.His experiences form the two-part Channel 5 documentary series, Michael Palin in North Korea, which will air on September 20.In it, he reveals how men in the country are given rations which they can exchange for booze.There are a huge number of bars in Pyongyang to choose from, according to Simon Cockerell, who has been taking Western tour groups to the hermit nation since 2002.He told the Atlantic: I would say the average Pyongyang man would drink beer fairly frequently—at least once a week.Beer culture is something still developing—it is mainly still men going to a bar after work, drinking a couple of beers, and then going home.Palin was woken on his first morning by eerie music booming across the entire city.He described the haunting noise as “the worlds most unusual wake up call” as the same piece of music - called Where Are You Dear General? - was loudly repeated throughout the streets at regular intervals.Other cities you think of screaming sirens but there is none of that at all. This noise, you couldnt avoid it.Speaking at a pre-screening he described the experience of no one recognising him from his travel shows or Monty Python.They didn’t know what a great star meant and basically to them I was a really old bloke and with their reverence for age the minder would rather delightfully would take my arm and say Are you feeling tired?In the second episode, there is a small sequence, and we were stuck in this airport and just to pass the time, our Director Neil, had brought along some footage of Monty Python and showed one minder the fish slapping dance.And her only comment at the end was, “Was that a live fish?”Palins journey begins by boarding a train from Beijing to Pyongyang - North Koreas capital. Not yet under the microscope of their full-time minders, the change in the landscape is remarkable.A shore dominated by Dandongs high-rises faces greenery and scattered buildings across the Yalu River on the North Korean side.Immediately, everything looks dferent, its as  weve stepped back inside, Palin says.His first taste of North Korean hospitality arrives in the form of a series of border guards, all intent on checking and rechecking his documentation.Palin makes it clear early on he is not going to allow an oppressive totalitarian dictatorship quash his famous sense of humour.I was asked - did I have a bible with me? I would normally say yes, absolutely, Im a good Christian man, but no, thats the wrong answer here.The second taste comes during a lunch taken on the 200-mile train journey comes with a side order of Korean propaganda as the television touts images of nuclear weapons.Off the train he meets his two guides - who turn out to actually number eight.He finds himself in a city missing many staples of the west - there are very few cars, and absolutely no adverts save for party propaganda.State controlled newspapers are covered with news of the historic meeting between north and south which were occurring at the time, and Plain says he sensed a eagerness for more openness among the populace.Palin points out how, until recently, the city would have been a soulless landscape of grey Soviet-style apartment blocks.In a simple and effective solution, Kim Jong-il commanded the whole lot was painted bright colours.Palin provides no shortage of humour titbits, including one point when he finds himself mystied watching the robotic movements of the traffic controllers - all of whom, he notes, are young women.Theres rumour that Kim Jong-un picks them himself, he says.He visits a local school and marvels at the childrens ping pong skills.Its like a factory farm for ping pong players, he says.Viewers can also look forward to the drunken antics of May Day - an annual day off for North Koreans.The celebrations allow a powerful insight into what Palin says are normal people, living in an unusual place."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/dk-graphic-page14may.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"jacob rees mogg column theresa may brexit","story":"The Prime Minister will head to the continent on Thursday to visit Salzburg — like Bath, a world heritage city — to discuss her Brexit or Chequers proposals with other leaders of European governments.To date the EU has been officially dismissive of the main elements of Chequers, the complex customs arrangements and continued use of European Rules to secure access to the single market.Michel Barnier, who led the negotiations for the EU, has been clear that the EU cannot accept this position.The UK must either be in the Single Market with all that goes with it — including free movement — or it may have a free trade deal instead.In a sense, he is the keeper of the Orlamme for the EU.Historically, this was a sacred banner carried into battle for the kings of France when no prisoners were to be taken.The heads of government may be more conciliatory and keener to help a fellow leader, not least as most of them face their own domestic dficulties.It is also the usual form for the EU to make a deal.It protests that it is strictly a rules-based organisation to maximise its negotiating strength but then, like an honest costermonger, makes the necessary trade.At the same time the British Government seems desperate to agree something on almost any terms.Chequers rubbed out the Prime Minister’s red lines to leave the UK “half in, half out” subject to EU regulations in crucial areas of the economy, and to the European Court of Justice.The vassal has been put in chains.This desperation means it will be important to watch carefully what comes out of Salzburg.Any deal will be hailed initially as a triumph because of the hostile comments made not only by Mr Barnier but, in his recent state of the Union speech, by Jean-Claude Juncker.Overcoming these obstacles will be portrayed as a triumph for British diplomacy.Those who hope that Brexit will continue to mean Brexit will need to stay awake.The first item to watch out for is money. There is no legal obligation to pay anything at all.This has been established by the House of Lords and no credible authority has questioned their Lordships.If we pay £40billon we must get something clear in , not just wishy-washy promises.Taxpayers would be outraged  it were otherwise.Any agreement on immigration must be examined with great care.We will doubtless be told that free movement has ended but, as Shakespeare wrote, “what’s in a name? that which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet”.There ought to be no preferential terms for new arrivals from the EU above those offered to other nations and no access to state benefits.There must be a clear dferentiation in their rights after we have left and admission must be subject to a work permit scheme focused on skilled rather than unskilled labour.The solution to the Irish question is a further area where Brexiteers must be alert. Last week the European Research Group, which I chair, produced a paper explaining how it could be answered on the EU’s terms.Obviously the UK could simply say that there will be no physical infrastructure at the border but  instead we examine what the EU does on its other borders, and see  those precedents could be followed, then no reasonable person would think a “hard” border were necessary.So far the inevitable attacks on our reports have been mere rudery. No one has found fault with facts.If Ireland were used to justy the major concessions the Government is giving then we would know the deal is a bad one based on a false premise.It would be better than any other which the EU has so far agreed but Ireland is supposed to make it impossible.The issue has been used by those who are fearful of leaving the EU to keep us bound by its rules and regulations.Inevitably these complex machinations have led to some gossip about the leadership.These stories come from all wings of the Party with pro-Europeans such as Tom Tugendhat and George Freeman suggesting it is time to move to a new generationHowever, it is worth remembering the Prime Minister’s virtues.She is determined, thorough and dutul, and in my view duty is an heroic virtue.This gives her great strength and without a clear Parliamentary majority it is not obvious that anyone else could steer the negations to a conclusion.Pitt the Younger was hailed as the pilot who weathered the storm.

Nobody wants it.But this self-described “bloody dficult woman” believes she alone can ram it through.Either she knows something nobody else does . . . or her fabled “polished turd” is about to hit the fan.On tonight’s BBC’s Panorama, Mrs May spells out the formula she thinks propelled her to the top: “You bide your time and you are bloody dficult when it really matters.”Others fear a dferent characteristic has defined her political career, especially as Home Secretary.“She is mulishly stubborn,” says a former ally.“Once she digs her heels in, nothing can sht her — right or wrong.”They fear she will stick defiantly to her half-baked plan until she runs out of road and is forced to choose between an EU fudge or defeat in the House of Commons.The Chequers deal is flawed by the fantasy we can follow an EU rule book on free trade and regulation while reserving the right to duck and e.Outside Cabinet, Tories on all sides — Brexiteers and Remainers — insist it is unworkable.“It fails to take back control of our laws, borders, money and trade,” writes ex-Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith.“We would be out of Europe yet still run by Europe.”EU negotiator Michel Barnier fears it endangers the whole EU project, which is already threatened by tensions over mass immigration, the Euro and jobless school leavers.Special treatment for the UK would instantly trigger demands from other member states for their own tailor-made deals, unravelling the drive for ever-closer union.Mrs May claims there is no alternative to Chequers.But there has to be — and Britain is already working on it.Despite Chancellor Phil Hammond’s blundering interference, preparations for a clean break are in train, covering everything from free trade to the vexed border with Northern Ireland.It may be pitched as a last-ditch option, only to be deployed in an emergency.But since Chequers is universally seen as a non-starter, free trade automatically becomes the only viable plan on the UK table.New Brexit minister, karate black belt and rising star Dominic Raab, is making this vividly clear in Brussels.He alarmed Downing Street by threatening to withhold the EU’s £40billion ransom  they push us too far.And he has told Barnier to do his own dirty work and impose a border in the Irish Sea  he dares.This is music to the ears of Tory MPs who desperately yearn to see some fighting spirit.They hope against hope Mrs May secretly has a cunning plan, ready to roll out at the right moment as she suggests, calling Barnier’s bluff.But there is another red card on the table, face up and flashing danger to our EU neighbours.Do they want to humiliate the PM to the point where she is defeated in Parliament and pushed into a second catastrophic election?EU leaders can read the polls which put Labour in front.They will also be horried to see ex-Tory vice-chairman Jeffrey Archer unhelpfully saying he would vote for Corbyn  he were a Northerner.And we should all be alarmed by David Cameron’s Goldman Sachs-trained Treasury minister, Jim O’Neill, saying: “I find myself struggling to be that scared by the prospect of a Corbyn government.”The EC has enough on its plate with the growing explosion of anti-Brussels populism across Europe. The last thing it wants any time soon is a hard-left Labour government led by lelong EU-haters Jeremy Corbyn and Marxist Chancellor John McDonnell.It might be the one bargaining chip that makes Michel Barnier blink first.For a Bank of England governor, his forecast of a 35 per cent crash in house prices verged on the hysterical.Project Fear has lost the power to shock, but it won’t stop trying.Aircraft will not fall from the sky, the Channel Tunnel will stay open, NHS patients will not starve or die from lack of NHS drugs.Not only have Carney’s nightmare scenarios of slump and mass unemployment proved false, the reverse has happened.Young workers are flocking to the UK for jobs. Wages are rising. Growth is strong.Now we see French companies such as Chanel stampeding to invest billions here.

And the influx continues.Latest statistics show the number of migrants who settled here in the year to March 2018 was 614,000, equal to a city bigger than Bristol. Net migration was around 270,000.Yet the revolution has been imposed by the ruling elite without any consent. No British citizen was ever asked to vote for this upheaval. No major party ever sought a mandate to open our doors.This helps to explain why the British public has such profound distrust in MPs on the question of immigration, as revealed in a major new opinion survey published this week.In the biggest consultation of its kind, involving 20,000 interviews, just one in six people showed any faith in the Government to tackle migration, while only 13 per cent felt that politicians are “open and honest” about the issue.These findings are not the result of bigotry or prejudice. Britons have been remarkably tolerant in the face of change.Indeed, that shines through the survey, which discovered that 65 per cent of people believe migrants bring valuable skills to the economy and the public sector. Similarly, 59 per cent think that ersity benefits our national culture.But British decency has been exploited by the political class to implement its agenda, with the result that disillusion is now widespread.People are rightly fed up with politicians who indulge in denial and deceit about the reality of mass immigration.A classic example was the phoney claim from the last Labour Government that, when the former communist countries of eastern Europe joined the EU in 2004, just 13,000 of their citizens would come to the UK. In fact, more than a million did.Even worse has been the attempt, particularly by the Left, to suppress open discussion by hurling accusations of racism against critics of mass immigration.A climate of censorship now prevails where public figures are expected to parrot the fashionable orthodoxy, and ordinary citizens are afraid to voice their concerns.Yet the anxieties of the public are all too genuine. Immigration has imposed more strain on our civic infrastructure, reflected in the shortage of affordable housing, the never-ending NHS crisis, the growth in the welfare burden and dficulties for parents in finding school places for kids.The import of cheap foreign labour has meant lower wages and job insecurity. Just as disturbing is the erosion of solidarity because of this upheaval.Social cohesion cannot exist without real integration, as the public recognised in the survey.The majority of respondents, 88 per cent, agreed with the idea that “migrants should learn English” and 85 per cent believe that migrants “should share our values”.But the multicultural ideology, which has long been the creed of the state, works in the opposite direction.It encourages migrants to cling to the practices and languages of their native lands, fuelling ision. As does the institutionalised acceptance of sharia law, which arguably offers more protection to men than women, undermining the traditional concept that we are all equal before the law.The consequences of multi-culturalism are seen at their most corrosive in the failure by the state to tackle serious crimes perpetrated by ethnic minorities, such as the organised abuse of girls by mainly Asian gangs in places like Rotherham and Derby.More concerned to uphold the illusion of cultural ersity’s success than to protect victims of crime, the police and other authorities indulged in a cover-up. It was only exposure of the abuse by journalists that finally forced them to act.That mix of official dishonesty and paralysis only undermines our society. There is a lesson for us from Europe, where the political order is threatened by growing public anger over immigration.In 2010, German Chancellor Angela Merkel declared that “this multi-cultural approach has failed.” But she did nothing to reverse the policy. Instead, she opened the door even wider, especially in 2015 when she allowed in more than a million migrants.The crime that followed has led to public outcry.Britain has always been renowned for its avoidance of extremism.

The EU has to know that she is unafraid to walk away  need be.What does her blundering Remainer Chancellor do?Volunteers his own apocalyptic warning about No Deal reversing our progress since the 2008 crash.Mr Hammond has leapt on the IMF’s latest doom-laden predictions and swallowed them whole, despite its abysmal forecasting record over the financial crisis, austerity and the Brexit vote.The Chancellor has already hampered vital No Deal preparations, undermined the new Brexit Secretary and only last week suggested delaying our departure.Now, at a stroke, he has sabotaged our negotiating hand and boosted the EU’s.It is a measure of the weakness of Mrs May’s position after the loss of her majority that Mr Hammond is still in his job.REMEMBER Brussels mocking the Brexiteers’ idea of high-tech customs checks to solve the Irish border problem?The technology didn’t exist, they said. It was a “fantasy island unicorn model”.Triumphant Remoaners piled in. It proved Brexiteers were clueless, they chirped. And Downing Street then ­produced its convoluted alternative.Except the EU, in the form of Michel Barnier, now believes in the fantasy island unicorn model too. The trouble being it wants it used between Britain and Northern Ireland instead of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.And the DUP, whom Theresa May needs for her survival, won’t wear that. Nor should they, since it ides the UK.Funny though, isn’t it, how Brussels move the goalposts when it suits them? They have negotiated in bad faith all along.TOO many politicians are in denial about the soaring cost of the NHS and social care. So we applaud Health Secretary Matt Hancock’s imaginative plan to sort the latter.The new lelong insurance system he is considering, compulsory for all workers unless they take a risk and opt out, looks a practical idea to fund part or all of an OAP’s care costs.It would give them peace of mind that they wouldn’t have to spend their savings or the proceeds from their home.Maybe it will work. Maybe not. Regardless, it is to Mr Hancock’s credit that he is starting a grown-up conversation at last over future funding of health.For too long progress has been stymied by the Left using any change to the NHS as a political weapon.But the structure of a health service designed in 1948 now needs a radical rethink.It is time reality dawned.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And they’re right to be.As recently as 1991, a third of those aged 16 to 24 owned their own home.Now, that figure is ten per cent.For those aged 25 to 34, the rate has fallen from 66 per cent to 38 per cent.Home ownership rates in Britain are now the fourth lowest in the EU, and we have the second highest proportion of social housing, i.e., people living in homes provided by the State.Earlier this year, we at the Centre for Policy Studies commissioned polling asking young people how government could make their lives better.The top answer was clear — they want housing to be more affordable.And not via cheaper rents — by a three-to-one margin, they wanted the Government to prioritise home ownership.Strikingly, only three per cent of those aged 18 to 24 told us they never wanted to own their own home.They just can’t see themselves being able to afford it for years — often decades.This is a crisis with many causes.The persistent failure, stretching back decades, to build enough new homes. A dysal planning system.Existing homeowners who don’t want their communities disrupted or their views spoiled.A Labour government that made it much easier for buy-to-let landlords to snap up those homes that were being built, and much harder for first-time buyers to do the same — and a financial crash which made that problem so much worse. Yet it’s also a crisis with many solutions.Making it easier to extend or expand existing properties. Changing Green Belt regulations so we protect our most beautul countryside while building on pig farms, or beside railway stations or motorways or electricity substations or other decidedly non-green and unpleasant bits of land.Finding ways  to turn renters into owners, as Margaret Thatcher did with the Right to Buy for council tenants in the 1980s, with more than a little success.But the sad truth is that while the Government has succeeded in dragging up construction levels, it is still not thinking anywhere near radically enough.“Since my very first day in Downing Street, I have made it my personal mission to fix our broken housing system,” Theresa May told the National Housing Federation yesterday.But that mission is in grave jeopardy.A year ago, the Prime Minister endured a triple whammy of embarrassment in her party conference speech — being handed a P45 by a prankster, developing a crippling cough, then seeing the slogan behind her start to fall off.Mrs May bravely endured these trials. But she could do little about the fact that her promise in the same speech to “make the British dream a reality by igniting home ownership once again” was built around a £10billion expansion of the Help to Buy scheme.A scheme which pretty much every economist, including the Government’s own Office for Budget Responsibility, says is mostly serving to push up house prices and make colossally rich housebuilders even richer.Indeed, even as Mrs May was speaking, their collective share price spiked by £1BILLION.Yesterday, the Prime Minister ed to the subject.In a speech to the National Housing Summit, she promised another £2billion for social housing.But even on its own terms, Mrs May’s proposal isn’t a blunderbuss.It’s a pinprick. Not only is the £2billion spread over a decade but it’s a small fraction of the amount that George Osborne cut from the same budgets.And it fits a wider pattern. For all the Government’s rhetoric, the big ideas to get Britain building just aren’t there.One of the keys to David Cameron’s election victory in 2015 — right there on the first page of the Tory manesto — was a promise to extend the Right to Buy to housing associations and to build 200,000 starter homes.The commitment was to create two million more homeowners within five years.As of May 2018, not a single one of those starter homes had been built — and the expansion of Right to Buy is still lodged in the gullet of the Whitehall machine.It’s the same pattern on planning reform.Sajid Javid’s robust proposals as Communities Secretary to break up the oligopoly of the big housebuilders, free up more land and speed up development — all badly needed — were neutered by Downing Street, because it was paranoid about upsetting traditional Tory voters who don’t like the sight of bulldozers.When the Government’s new planning framework was announced in March, the headlines were about building more and higher-quality homes.But the small print made it so that councils could get away with building fewer houses, not more.I don’t doubt that Mrs May’s heart is in the right place.But  she and her team don’t pluck up their courage on housing — and take far more dramatic steps both to build more houses and create more homeowners — they’ll almost certainly lose the next election. More than that, they’ll deserve to.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A vexed issue. Complain about it and people will call you a racist.That’s a popular way of shutting down debate these days. Just screech “raaacisst” at someone.I’d go so far as to say it’s one of the reasons Leave won the referendum — because ordinary people were sick of being called racist when they simply worried about the millions of people who have arrived here in the past ten years.About seven million, in fact. An astonishing number.The Prime Minister is about to draw up her plans for immigration post-Brexit.She will be taking advice from the Migration Advisory Committee . It has suggested we allow in skilled workers who might be vital to our economy.It has also suggested we clamp down on low-skilled migrants.This seems to me a perfectly sensible argument. We should not entirely close ourselves off from the world. And there are foreign nationals here who do excellent work for our country. And pay good taxes.At the same time, the vast influx of low-skilled workers has had a terrible effect upon our country.Some towns — such as Boston in Lincolnshire — have been effectively taken over.And as the MAC found, the vast reservoir of labour has depressed the wages of British people at the lowest end of the scale. It has hurt the poorest of us.But it doesn’t only hurt us. You’ll have seen the squalid conditions in which a lot of these low-paid foreign workers live. This is exploitation, on a massive scale.How any leftie can support it absolutely befoggles me.Living below the minimum wage, crammed into rotten accommodation — all so companies such as Amazon can make a bigger profit.No wonder the big companies were the first to complain. Listen: Pay your workers a decent, living wage in future and shut up, huh?But this is an overcrowded country. It is ludicrous to suggest that the millions we have allowed in have not had a massive effect on our infrastructure.It’s why we need to pave over more and more of the countryside to build homes, for example. The MAC suggested house prices had risen as a consequence — and our homes already cost too much.There’s pressure on our schools, our hospitals and our transport networks.Well, with any luck this will all come to an end. Perhaps the Government might also abide by its pledge to get yearly immigration levels down to the tens of thousands, rather than the hundreds of thousands as it is at the moment.But at the same time we should look after the EU migrants we have already let in, and ensure they feel secure and safe living in Britain.Do all that and I’ll be a happy man. Even  the lefties still shriek “raaacisst” every few seconds.GIRLS – looking for something to wear for a night out?

Yep, it’s the black bin liner, as sported here by Megan Barton Hanson.I have no idea, incidentally, who Megan Barton Hanson is, still less her boyfriend called “Wes”.BBC Radio 6 presenter Cerys Matthews says she refuses to play music made by people who went to private school.OK, Cerys. That means your entire back catalogue is banned, seeing as you were educated at the expensive St Michael’s School in Llanelli.A few weeks ago a BBC executive said he wouldn’t be commissioning comedies from public schoolboys .Spouting every right-on opinion that suddenly swings into fashion?Here’s a tip, Cerys. Play the best rock, folk and soul music you can find.The stuff that sounds the most interesting.You’ll find that auto- matically the private school musicians will be excluded anyway – including yourself.APPARENTLY President Trump’s penis closely resembles a toadstool.This is according to Stormy Daniels, who says she had an affair with Donald.The question is, though – what kind of toadstool?There are hundreds of thousands of species. Was it a fly agaric? That’s the one with a big red head covered in white spots. If so, Donald ought to get himself to a doctor.Or maybe it’s that one with a thin stalk and a big yellow head the size of a dinner plate.If so, Stormy had better get herself to a doctor.A “RELATIONSHIP expert” has warned us all about dodgy body language  we’re out on a date.Tracey Cox says we shouldn’t fidget, for a start. What, even  we’ve taken her to a ballet?Also, don’t wring your hands or sit in a slumped manner, and so on.Hmm. As a “relationship expert” I offer the following advice to blokes out on a first date in a restaurant.2. Don’t pass wind then waft the air saying “Mmmmm, Bisto!”3. When they bring the black pepper, don’t sneeze on her pasta.4. If you do sneeze on her pasta, stir it around a bit when she’s not looking.5. Don’t use a bread stick to excavate the contents of your ear.6. Don’t keep checking the football scores on your phone. And shouting loudly: “Lee Gregory! 85th minute! Get IN you f***er!”7. Don’t ask the lady at the next table  she’s up for a threesome.Follow that stuff and you can fidget away to your heart’s delight. You’ll be OK.THERE’S a crisis in our wildle. Some of our favourite species of birds or mammals are on the brink of extinction.The corn bunting, for example, and the hedgehog.As TV wildle campaigner Chris Packham rightly says, this is because we have paved over the countryside to build ever more homes.And because of the intensive farming methods – which have seen the eradication of farmland birds.Packham has drawn up a “People’s Manesto for Wildle” which includes stuff like twinning city schools with farms, so that kids grow up with an understanding of nature.There’s also a demo at Hyde Park in London on Saturday.

They are urging you to get yours serviced and to install audible carbon monoxide monitors in your home.It might just save a le.Schoolgirl Katie Overton went to bed excited about her little sister’s birthday party next day — but tragically the family never got to celebrate.The next morning, the 11-year-old was found dead in her bed, having been poisoned by carbon monoxide which had leaked from a faulty boiler at her home.Stepdad Paul recalls: “We’d been busy getting ready for Emma’s fth birthday party. We’d been baking cakes and blowing up balloons.“We went to bed as normal that night. In the morning we all got up and cracked on with the arrangements and we thought Katie was having a lie-in.“The house seemed very quiet. I popped out and when I came home, Katie still wasn’t up.“We were used to her having a lie-in at the weekend, but we felt something was wrong.”Mum Debra, 47, went up to Katie’s bedroom at the family’s rented terraced house in Southsea, Hants.Paul, 53, recalls: “Debs called out to me that she’d been sick in her bed. I ran upstairs and she was lying there, motionless.“I started shaking her, trying to rouse her. She wasn’t responding. Her body was cold.“I told Debs to call 999 and I spoke to paramedics on the phone. They told me to try mouth-to-mouth, but her jaw was locked. I knew then she was dead.“We had no idea why or what had happened. All of us were in a state of shock.”An ambulance rushed Katie to Queen Alexandra Hospital in Portsmouth, but within half an hour a doctor confirmed the family’s worst fears.Paul says: “He said there was nothing they could do for her. There was no obvious cause of death.“All we could think was that she’d been sick in her sleep and choked on it.“Because it was an unexplained death, we had CID come to the house. They asked us all sorts of questions, whether Katie had been having any problems at school.“They took away the mattress as evidence and the four of us were left in the house, with no idea the gas was still leaking.”To make matters even worse, rumours circulated around the area that Paul and Debra had murdered their daughter.Paul says: “A friend of Debra’s told us there were some lies going around. There was a lot of stares and whispering behind our backs.“It was incredibly hard to deal with, as we were grieving for Katie.“We were in a state of shock. She was a perfectly healthy girl and she seemed fine when she went to bed the night before.”Post-mortems do not routinely check for carbon monoxide poisoning, so no cause of death was given to her family.But around ten days later, Debra woke Paul early one morning complaining of a strong smell of fumes.He recalls: “I had a splitting headache and the house stank. I felt dizzy and sick.“I phoned our letting agent and said we thought something was seriously wrong with the boiler. An engineer came out and said he was going to put a carbon monoxide monitor by the boiler and we all had to leave the house. He left it running for ten minutes before going back in to grab it. He ran back out again and said, ‘I can’t believe any of you are alive.’“There was a lethal amount of carbon monoxide in the house. He kept saying he was surprised we were still alive.“I asked him  he thought it might have caused Katie’s death and he said, ‘Possibly’.” Paul phoned the police and even though Katie’s body had been cremated, they still had some blood samples. They later tested positive for carbon monoxide.An investigation revealed that faulty pipework on the boiler had been allowing the toxic gas to escape into Katie’s bedroom. Paul has been campaigning for tighter regulations to prevent deaths from carbon monoxide poisoning ever since Katie’s death in March 2003.She says: “He seemed very poorly. He didn’t have a temperature but he kept falling asleep and he’d vomit.“Then, I’d find him asleep in the dining room in a really strange position. Something just didn’t feel right.”The same morning, the carbon monoxide alarm at her home in Strood, Kent, started beeping. She says: “It wasn’t the continuous warning alarm but it was beeping as  it had run out of batteries.“I guess it just made me think and I had a niggling feeling it might be something to do with carbon monoxide. I rushed Aaden-James to A\u0026ampE. They took a blood sample and within five minutes he was on oxygen. He had to spend a couple of days in hospital.“Fortunately, he is OK and there are no lasting effects.”Tests later revealed the gas was leaking from pipes at the top of the boiler.Kirstein says: “If you don’t have a carbon monoxide alarm, get one now. I had one before, now I have three.”But latest figures show there are still around 50 fatalities a year in the UK.He says: “Fteen years on and the basic laws haven’t changed and people are still dying.“Katie’s death was preventable. We didn’t have a carbon monoxide alarm in the house.“We are all now living with a sadness that will never go away.”Paul adds that the tragedy has been particularly hard on Katie’s sisters, Sian, now 22, and Emma, 21.He says: “We want to make people aware of the dangers of carbon monoxide so no more families lose someone like we have.“Sometimes people will say to me, ‘It’s OK, I haven’t got gas, I’ve got a wood-burning stove.’“But carbon monoxide is produced by all solid fuels that burn. There are more carbon monoxide alarms around now than when Katie died, but in England, the law says they only have to be in properties that burn solid fuel.THE Sun is offering you the chance to win one of five brand new Ariston boilers worth more than £1,000 each.The Ariston Clas Net ONE comes with an industry-leading 12-year warranty.To be in with a chance of winning see thesun/aristoncompetition and answer two simple questions.“In Scotland, they have to be in all properties. The law in England needs changing — everyone should have one.“What about older properties? They often don’t have alarms. And what about your neighbour? We lived in a terraced house — the people next door may well have been poisoned as well.“Carbon monoxide goes straight through the brickwork. Please make sure you install an audible alarm in your home. If we’d had one, we would have been alerted to the gas and our beautul Katie would still be with us.”Paul also warns that gas safety ­certicates are not a substitute for ­having appliances regularly serviced.He says: “You can get a certicate without having a service. Of course, a lot of people choose this asSue, 45, had moved into a new-build home in Sale, Grt Manchester, with son Josh and now ex-husband Paul in 2003.She says: “I worked at home running a building firm. I’d get headaches and be queasy, dizzy and fatigued. I put it down to stress. I was forgetful, but thought I was getting dementia. Josh was six. He’d get stomach and head pains.Three years later, Sue was admitted to hospital TWICE with chest pain – and once collapsed – but each time doctors misdiagnosed cocaine abuse, let her rest then discharged her.“No one mentioned carbon monoxide and I wasn’t tested,” she says. But the warranty on her boiler then expired and Paul called an engineer, who found the leaky flue under the lounge floor.Sue still suffers memory, migraine and rheumatic trouble while Josh has poor concentration, and she thinks her family only survived because Paul would open windows a lot. She warns: “With smoke you get a warning but with CO there is no taste or smell. It is a silent killer.”“But what it means is that all these years after Katie’s death, an engineer can walk into a house, have a look at the flame and say, ‘Yes it’s burning a nice blue and it is safe.’“It gives you a false confidence. All gas appliances need to be serviced as per the manufacturers’ guidelines.“And get it done now, don’t wait until November when engineers are busy.

I don’t like that approach at all. What we need is a fair Brexit and good cooperation between UK and EU in future.Jean Claude Juncker appeared to be on the fence, telling reporters that Mrs Mays 10-minute speech at dinner was polite, it was not aggressive, she was doing her job.This morning Mrs May had meetings with other leaders - including Angela Merkel and a series of other leaders.Mr Tusk this morning posted a sassy snap on his Instagram of him offering the PM a bit of cake, with the caption: A piece of cake, perhaps? Sorry, no cherries.TWO EU leaders have spoken out and demanded Brits change their minds and reverse Brexit today.Ahead of Theresa Mays crunch summit in Salzburg, the PMs of Malta and the Czech Republic took the unusual step of calling for a fresh referendum on leaving the EU.Ignoring the clear will of the 17million Brits who opted to break free of the bloc in 2016, Andrej Babiš, the eurosceptic Czech prime minister, told the BBC he was “very unhappy that the UK is leaving and maybe it would be better to make another referendum”.And Joseph Muscat, the Maltese PM, said most of the other EU leaders agreed, and wanted to make the almost impossible happen.I think most of us would welcome a situation where there is the possibility of the British people, putting things into perspective, and then deciding once and for all, he added.But last night the PM told EU leaders there was not going to be another vote.Brussels wants an operational backstop in place to prevent a so-called hard border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland after Brexit.But that would effectively keep Northern Ireland in the EUs single market and customs union.Theresa May simply wont accept this because it will effectively break up the UK and put a virtual border in the Irish sea.And it will infuriate her coalition partners, the DUP, too, who she relies on to win votes in the House of Commons.A new plan by Mr Barnier – revealed by The Sun on Saturday – to police the new customs border between Britain and Northern Ireland with invisible technology has also been thrown out by No10.Britain wants an agreement to not be needed, by agreeing a close partnership with the EU which would make the backstop void.EX-Brexit Secretary David Davis has taken apart Theresa Mays Chequers proposals - on the same day the EU met to discuss them.Mr Davis, who quit over Mrs Mays blueprint for our EU exit, tore them to shreds in a speech today.He told an audience: Chequers is devoid of democracy altogether.Telling Brits they must seize this historic opportunity, he argued that Chequers destroyed all the manesto promises Mrs May had made on taking back control of our money, borders and laws.And he lashed out over plans to keep us tied to the EU forever by accepting a common rulebook.We cannot be governed by a body that we have no control over. It should not even be contemplated, he added.Mr Davis, who is bringing forward an alternative Free Trade Agreement plan in the coming weeks, said Chequers was unpopular among the public too.And on the tricky issue of the Northern Ireland border - which is a huge sticking point in the talks - he insisted there would not be a hard border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland after we leave - because EU politicians have said they wont put one up.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Maria Chatzaki, professor of molecular biology and genetics at Democritus University of Thrace, Greece said heatwaves, sufficient humidity and food paved the way for the booming population.The name Tetragnatha is derived from Greek, tetra — a numerical prefix referring to four and gnatha meaning jaw.They are found all over the world although most thrive in warmer climates in the tropics and subtropics.Commony, they are called stretch spiders because of their eerier elongated body form.When disturbed they will stretch their front legs forward — while they jut their other six legs backwards.This allows them to hide on blades of grass or similar elongated pieces of foliage like twigs and leaves.One of the biggest and most common species is T. extensa.It can be found near lakes, river banks or swamps.Large numbers of iniduals can often be found in reeds, tall grass or minor trees and shrubs.They are so light and nimble that they are able to run over water and chose the waters edge as their preferred habitat.Ms Chatzaki told Newsit.gr: Its as  the spiders are taking advantage of these conditions and are having a kind of a party. “They mate, they reproduce and provide a whole new generation.These spiders are not dangerous for humans and will not cause any damage to the areas flora.The spiders will have their party and will soon die."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000435487011.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"meghan markle grenfell community kitchen with mum doria ragland prince harry","story":"The Duchess of Sussex, 37, beamed as she described the multicultural capital while launching a cookbook written by neighbours of Grenfell Tower disaster victims.Ms Ragland, 62, was heard introducing herself as Megs mom to members of the group.There have been rumours Meghans mum has been looking to move to the UK to be closer to her daughter in recent weeks.Meghan called the book a tremendous labour of love in a speech to volunteers from the kitchen and paid tribute to their community spirit.As Harry and her mother watched on with pride, she described first going to visit the kitchen in January and being overcome by the welcome from the group.\" data-credit=\"AFP or licensors\" data-sizes=\"auto\" data-img=\"https:www.thesun/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000435488889.jpg?strip=all\u0026ampw=960\" height=\"3444\" width=\"5166\"/AFP or licensors15Prince Harry looked on with love as he joined Meghan and Ms Ragland in meeting volunteers from the kitchenMeghan, Harry and Doria Ragland posed with members of the groupShe said: I had just recently moved to London and I felt so immediately embraced by the women in the kitchen and their warmth and their kindness.On a personal level, I feel so proud to live in a city with so much ersity.

Well, Labour geeks, at least. For nine hours on Tuesday, Labour\u0027s 41-member ruling body - plus a baby - shut itself in a room at Labour\u0027s London HQ to thrash out sweeping changes to party rules. One source told the Mirror the proposals were an enormous sht in power in the Labour Party - and some of the stuff is just nuts. But much of the summit ended in deadlock. So the NEC will hold another marathon session on Saturday, hours before Labour\u0027s conference in Liverpool. Then the proposals will be approved, or thrown out, in crunch votes by 1,650 delegates during the conference itself, culminating next Tuesday morning.  Whatever happens will shape the future and the fate of the Labour Party. But the proposals are complicated and riven by multi-dimensional in-fighting, so many people must be left wondering: what exactly is going on? As what we hope will be a public service, here is a very rough guide to what\u0027s happening so far, based on multiple conversations with people in the party. Why are these changes happening?  Late last year, Labour launched a \u0027democracy review\u0027 with the aim of rebalancing power in the party away from the executive, and towards the members. It will affect everything from how candidates and leaders are selected to what gets debated at the annual conference. The review was led by Jeremy Corbyn\u0027s loyal political secretary Katy Clark, took months to put together and has since reported to Labour\u0027s National Executive Committee . To Jeremy Corbyn\u0027s allies, changes will release the grip of centrists on party democracy and open it up to the left-wing membership, which has tripled in size since he took power. To Jeremy Corbyn\u0027s critics, it will silence voices who are hostile to his leadership and lock all but his loyalists out of party posts for generations - even  Labour fails in a general election. But people aren\u0027t just split down party lines. There are also disagreements between dferent sections of the left, such as the unions and Corbyn-backing group Momentum. It\u0027s a bit like multi-dimensional chess. And to make things more complicated, some of the proposals aren\u0027t actually from the democracy review, and have just come at the same time. Proposals that aren\u0027t agreed yet Many proposals were either watered down or weren\u0027t agreed at all during the big meeting on Tuesday. One NEC member, Darren Williams, said he was deeply disappointed with how little remains of the exciting - but perfectly reasonable and practicable - set of proposals drawn up by Katy Clark and her team. Here are the big ones still disputed. Leadership elections  When Jeremy Corbyn stood for leader in 2015, he needed 15% of MPs to back him before he got on the ballot. Backers feared this could lock a left-winger out in future. So last year this threshold was lowered to 10%, and now his supporters want to go further. They say it\u0027s wrong that MPs are the only \u0027gatekeepers\u0027 of a vote. A compromise put to the NEC this week, however, wasn\u0027t what they had in mind. One option on the table would force candidates to get backing from 10% of MPs, AND 5% of local Labour parties, AND three \u0027affiliates\u0027  representing at least 5% of the affiliate membership. This would hand more power to the unions than they currently have. Corbyn-backers feared it could actually make it harder, not easier, to get a left-winger on the ballot. Pro-Corbyn group Momentum told members: Critical democratic reforms were watered down or blocked - despite being backed by Jeremy Corbyn and the vast majority of Labour members and conference delegates. Another option would force a candidate to get at least one of the following combinations:  5% of MPs AND 10% of local Labour parties 5% of MPs AND at least three unions, representing 10% of union membership 10% of MPs, as the system is now.  and MEPs, but MEPs will soon cease to exist so we\u0027ve excluded them to make it easier to explain. After hours of debate, the NEC couldn\u0027t reach a decision on this issue - so they decided to reconvene on Saturday. Open selections  This one isn\u0027t actually part of the democracy review, but could become the most painful row of them all. Backers call it open selections. To critics, it\u0027s mandatory reselection. Currently sitting Labour MPs face a trigger ballot where each local branch, union branch and affiliated society branch in their constituency gets a single block vote per branch on whether to keep them before a general election. Only  they lose more than 50% of the total branch votes do they face a full-scale selection, pitted against rival candidates. Corbyn-backing group Momentum wants to change this to a full system of open selections - where every sitting MP faces a full reselection before each general election, even  they\u0027ve served for decades. More than 20,000 people have signed a Momentum petition calling for such a system, and hope the NEC will put it to a vote next Tuesday morning at conference.  Momentum co-ordinator Laura Parker says the move will open the door to a new generation of MPs. Critics say it is a bid to fill the parliamentary party with Corbyn loyalists and snuff out the biggest refuge of dissent against the leader. Several compromises are thought to be floating around that would loosen the current system of trigger ballots - but not remove it altogether. One could see a full selection triggered  30% of local party branches, OR 30% of affiliate/union branches, in a constituency voted for one. That means it\u0027d be easier to have an open selection. It\u0027s understood there is still no decision between these competing options - and the issue will be discussed again by the NEC on Saturday. There will be a vote on the issue at conference no matter what, but the crucial point is which proposal will be endorsed by the ruling NEC. The power of the deputy leader  Labour chiefs had drawn up plans to prepare for Jeremy Corbyn’s ‘sudden resignation’, it was reported this week. The proposal would restrict the powers of deputy leader Tom Watson in the event that the Labour leader steps down unexpectedly, according to HuffPost . Under current rules, Watson would become acting leader  Corbyn was incapacitated or quit without warning, until a leadership election can be called. The change would effectively put Labour’s ruling body, the National Executive Committee  in charge of the acting leader, and give them approval over his or her powers. However, a source said this proposal was not agreed at Tuesday\u0027s meeting and will be discussed again on Saturday.  Some members had hit out at proposals to let Labour members choose council chiefs directly - instead of councillors choosing their leader, as happens now. Critics feared that could lead to the ousting of \u0027centrist\u0027 council chiefs or group leaders with views hostile to Jeremy Corbyn. Councillors would have also been forced to run their local manestos past new-look local government committees. However, any proposed changes to local government will now be delayed until next year, said Nick Forbes, the local government rep on the NEC. He tweeted: The NEC has formally agreed to defer any decisions on rule changes for local government until 2019, pending a longer review which will involve @LabourCllrs and @LGA_Labour in the next stages. A sensible and pragmatic decision that will be welcomed by many in Labour Local Govt.  Proposals that ARE agreed A Labour source said the NEC reached agreement on the following proposals in the democracy review. They will now go forward to vote by the conference. More conference debates allowed  The \u0027Contemporary Criteria\u0027 for determining which policy motions can be considered at Conference will be abolished, ensuring this cannot restrict policy debates. Darren Williams wrote: We agreed to scrap the contemporary criterion for conference motions and to increase the number of subject areas debated at conference to 10 chosen by the CLPs and 10 chosen by affiliates. Currently four are chosen by each group. A disability rep on the NEC A disability rep on the NEC will be created, who will be elected 50% by one-member-one-vote and 50% by trade union affiliates. NEC member Darren Williams added there would be other measures preparing the ground for women, young members, disabled members and ethnic minorities to be better represented. Changes to how NEC members are replaced  By-elections will take place among Labour members when there is a vacancy on the ruling NEC.  This would replace the current system where the position is filled by the runner-up from the most recent election.  Eddie Izzard benefited from this system in March when he was able to step up after Christine Shawcroft resigned amid a party storm. But he is understood to have been among those backing the change this week. A vital change to the Welsh and Scottish reps That Scottish and Welsh Conference will, in future, determine how the Scottish Labour Party and the Welsh Labour Party NEC places are elected. This will give conference delegates in Scotland and Wales the power to decide how their NEC representative is chosen. It comes after disagreements about the Welsh rep, who was chosen by the party\u0027s leader in the region. More local Labour Party meetings Constituency Labour parties will be required to have a minimum of eight meetings each year under the plans. Proposals that aren\u0027t under the democracy review For clarity, not all the measures under the microscope are part of the \u0027democracy review\u0027. Some of them just happen to have come along at the same time. That means they will face a separate vote at this year\u0027s conference: Open selections See above.

That’s why I’ve been calling problem gambling Britain’s hidden epidemic.

But you\u0027ll need to have a few million pounds lying around. An impressive tower in the New Forest, built in 1886, is up for sale for a handsome \u0026pound3.5million. The Sway Tower, named for its proximity to the village of Sway in Hampshire - and not because of any architectural concerns - reaches a height of 220 feet, spanning 14 floors. It boasts beautul, panoramic views across the New Forest National Park to the Isle of Wight.  While the tower\u0027s cupola and its spiral staircase might look like something from a medieval castle, it\u0027s actually very homely on the inside and was previously a boutique hotel. On the ground floor is a sitting room, drawing room, dining room, kitchen and conservatory. There\u0027s also an indoor swimming pool, tennis court and garage set within a walled garden measuring three quarters of an acre.  Between the first and fourth storeys are four en-suite double bedrooms, each on their own floor. Above this, between floors five and 13, are seven more rooms. Four of them are listed as suitable for conversion into, say, four further double bedrooms . One of the remaining rooms is purely for water storage, while the other three are used by two mobile operators and the emergency services.  While this may sound like an inconvenience, it actually brings in rental income of around \u0026pound35k per year. On top of the tower is the cupola giving breathtaking views across the countryside -  you\u0027re fit enough to get up that many stairs.

Kiesha Schofield was assaulted by 28-year-old Jade Binch last year after she reportedly fell out with the mum\u0027s daughter, who was a school pal.  She was left with a fractured nose, bruising and a bloodshot eye following the attack, according to her own mother, Tfany Schofield. Tfany, 33, says she reassured Kiesha that Binch would be jailed for the beating, which also allegedly left the youngster with scratches all over her body. But instead, she escaped jail with a fine and a six-month community order.  The attacker, who had been convicted of assault by beating last September, was also given 10 days of rehabilitation activities and told to pay court costs. Now, Kiesha is reportedly too scared to walk to school after repeatedly encountering Binch in the street since the conviction a year ago. Her mum claims Binch \u0027got away with\u0027 the attack. Sharing images of her bloodied daughter, Tfany, from Sutton-in-Ashfield, Nottinghamshire, said: You can see the state Kiesha was in from the pictures. She had blood all over her face and was bruised on her head and body. She claimed Binch fractured Kiesha\u0027s nose and left her with scratches over her body and bruises on her back and arms where she had been kicked. She had a bruised and blood shot eye which took a long time to heal, she said.  However, Binch claimed that the injuries obtained by the young girl were not linked to the incident and that Tfany\u0027s claims were not true. The Crown Prosecution Service  confirmed the images showing Kiesha with a bloodied face, damaged nose and bruising were used as evidence in the case. Tfany continued: I was livid. I wanted to do the same to her that she\u0027d done to Kiesha but common sense kicked in. I knew I needed to show Kiesha that you follow the right processes. I knew I couldn\u0027t retaliate. I kept reassuring her: \u0027She\u0027ll definitely get prison time for this\u0027. When she was given the fine and no jail sentence, I couldn\u0027t believe it. The judge who also watched the CCTV footage in court gave her a fine - how is that justice for attacking a minor? An online video appears to show Binch training in a boxing ring three years ago. The man who shared the footage claimed to have trained her for four years. Many commenters praised her \u0027hook\u0027, while Binch bragged that she was a \u0027wolf not a sheep\u0027.  Kiesha and Binch\u0027s daughter had been playing in a group in March 2017 when they reportedly fell out. According to Tfany, Binch then approached the schoolgirl after being alerted to the row by her daughter. She then assaulted her, allegedly leaving her hospitalised for the day. Tfany claimed: Kiesha and Jade\u0027s daughter were the best of friends. They\u0027d been at my house for dinner just before the attack happened. There was a big group of them out and Jade\u0027s daughter had fallen out with her boyfriend. Kiesha went over to tell him everything would be alright and Jade\u0027s daughter just said \u0027I\u0027m going to tell my mum.\u0027 Kiesha rang me panicking saying her friend\u0027s mum was \u0027coming down to get her\u0027. I just reassured her, thinking \u0027what mum was going to do anything to a child?\u0027 The rest of the group started walking to the shop and Jade then pulled up and got out of the car and assaulted her. As the youngster lay injured on the pavement, concerned passersby ran to her rescue and called the emergency services.  Tfany, a cleaning supervisor, and her partner were forced to rush out of work after a friend called them in a panic. The mum said: Kiesha was in [the hospital] for a few hours because they needed to keep her an eye on her due to her head. She claims that her daughter is now so scared that she won\u0027t even leave the house without her brother. Kiesha doesn\u0027t go out anymore, Tfany said. There\u0027s a shop at the top of the road and she won\u0027t go without her brother. She added: Kiesha does nothing and has got a very negative outlook on le. A year and half later, my daughter is still seeing a counsellor, still has flashbacks of that awful night. She now has a barrier up which she will not lower and she don\u0027t understand how someone could do what this evil person did and yet get away with it.

Some of the women were invited to Perk\u0027s Field near Kensington Palace for a cookery event to launch their recipe book - and Meghan was joined by her mum Doria Ragland as well as husband Prince Harry. Doria introduced herself to people, saying: Hi, I\u0027m Meg\u0027s mom. 1 of 16Prince Harry made his own greeting - sharing a somewhat awkward kiss with one of the women. 2 of 16Harry and Doria watched proudly as Meghan gave a speech - without notes. Doria told one guest she was head over heels with pride. 3 of 16Meghan gave her first speech since becoming a royal, talking for three minutes, and explained why she is so proud to live in London. 4 of 16The Duchess, who helped prepare food in the specially decorated marquee with women she had met at the Hubb Community Kitchen in the Al Manaar Muslim Cultural Heritage Centre, said: I had just recently moved to London and I felt so immediately embraced by the women in the kitchen - your warmth, your kindness, and also to be able to be in this city and to see in this one small room how multi-cultural it was. 5 of 16On a personal level, I feel so proud to live in a city that can have so much ersity. 6 of 16That\u0027s 12 countries represented in this one group of women, is pretty outstanding. 7 of 16Guests sat down to the home-made dishes from the new cookbook including coconut chicken curry, aubergine masala and a range of chapatis and sharing dips, as well as caramelised plum upside-down cake, and spiced mint tea. 8 of 16Speaking about the cookbook, Meghan said: Working on this project for the past nine months has been a tremendous labour of love. 9 of 16Harry was his animated self. 10 of 16Meghan has been privately visiting the Hubb Community Kitchen, at the Al Manaar Muslim Cultural Heritage Centre in North Kensington, where the women who created the book regularly meet to cook. 11 of 16Meghan shares a bond with the women, and thanked all involved with getting the cookbook published. On a personal note I\u0027m especially grateful because this is my first project so I appreciate your support and the vision that I had for this and seeing it come to fruition. Everyone embraced this so deeply, because it\u0027s been a passion project for all of us - and for very good reason. 12 of 16I said in the foreword that this is more than a cookbook, and what I mean by that is the power of food is more than just the meal itself, it is the story behind it. And when you get to know the story of the recipe you get to know the person behind it, and that\u0027s what we\u0027re talking about in terms of coming together, to really engage and talk and to be able to celebrate what connects us, rather than what ides us. That, I believe, is the ethos of Together. 13 of 16Doria took a keen interest in the cookery.

Experts who carried out a detailed study found one in three of us describe ourselves as ‘socially isolated’. And typically UK adults have just two people they feel they can truly confide in. Increasingly demanding careers are a factor - 32 per cent revealed working extra hours has been detrimental to their social le. Social media has also had an impact, with one quarter admitting the bulk of their social activity now happens online.   However pets appear to make all the dference – just 21 per cent of those with cats and dogs said they were lonely compared to 32 per cent of those without pets.  Deri Watkins, general manager for Mars Petcare, which commissioned the research, said: We firmly believe that pets could form part of the solution to the growing issue of loneliness in the UK.  We’re extremely passionate about the issue, which is why we submitted the study findings to the Government, following their call for evidence on suggested approaches for their Loneliness Strategy. We truly hope that the benefits of Human-Animal-Interaction and the practical role pets can play in tackling loneliness are considered, as our research shows the tangible dference our canine and feline friends can make. The research also found six in 10 feel socially anxious – and more than two thirds avoid socialising altogether.  Forty-four per cent think people are less friendly than they were as recently as just five years ago. And two thirds believe society is becoming more fragmented compared to previous generations. While one in six admit they worry more about what others think of them now than they did five years ago. However those with pets revealed having a furry friend makes all the dference.  The research, carried out through OnePoll , found 82 per cent of pet owners polled felt less lonely upon getting an animal.  In fact, four in five said their feelings of isolation faded within a month of getting one. Six in 10 even went as far as to describe their pet as their closest companion.

The former Suits actress had met a group of women during secret visits to the community who had started cooking for people around them whose lives had been destroyed by the disaster. She became close with the team at the Hubb Community Kitchen in the Al Manaar Muslim Cultural Heritage Centre in West London. When she discovered they could only open two days a week because of funding, an idea was born and now months later she has launched their charity cookbook. As well as promoting the fundraiser with a sweet video, she\u0027s written a very personal three-page foreword for the book. She speaks about her experiences meeting the women at the Hubb Community Kitchen and why she believes food is so important. The royal spoke passionately for around three minutes without notes about the project in her speech as Prince Harry and her mother looked on proudly. The Duchess of Sussex said: I\u0027m so privileged to know you. Working on this project for the past nine months has been a tremendous labour of love.    I have just recently moved to London and I felt so immediately embraced by the women in the kitchen, by your kindness and to be in this city and be in this room and see how multi-cultural it was. On a personal level I feel so proud to live in a city with so much ersity. This whole country is represented by the people in the kitchen. It\u0027s pretty outstanding. There\u0027s so many people to thank - I\u0027m extremely grateful because this is my first project and I appreciate your support. It truly took a village to see this through. Everyone has embraced this so fully because it has been a passion project for us all. As I said this is more than a cook book and what I mean by that is the power of food is more than just the meal itself it is the story behind it. And when you get to know the story behind the recipe, you get to know the person behind it and help us celebrate what connects us rather than ides us. That is the ethos of Together. Women of the Hubb Community Kitchen are showcasing their own personal recipes featured in the cookbook, many of which have been handed down through generations.  The duchess is joining them as they cook the dishes and assist with the preparations, before the group and the duke and duchess sit to enjoy the freshly made food with their guests. Dishes were handed out to those attending in the outdoor reception at the palace where there were long tables decorated with brightly coloured flowers. Homemade dishes including coconut chicken curry, aubergine masala and a range of chapatis and sharing dips, as well as caramelised plum upside-down cake, and spiced mint tea.  Meghan continued in her speech: Thank you so much for letting me be part of this and letting me be on this adventure with you and I’m so excited to see the projects we will continue to do in your community and also how you will inspire people globally by sharing your stories and your recipes. It\u0027s so impactful. You can see that in just a few days alone what\u0027s happened and the book\u0027s not out yet. What you have been able to do is a testament to what that means to people. I\u0027m so proud of you. So on that note I know that some of you have started eating, as you should. I\u0027d be the last one to want to let the food get cold so please enjoy your beautul lunch and give another round of applause for the Hubb Community Kitchen. Thank you. Meghan, her mother and Prince Harry made their way around four food stations, with the duchess helping to cook along the way. Ahlam Saeid had prepared a huge bowl of green rice at the first stop, to which the duchess added fresh mint and olive oil. Ms Ragland asked the cooks questions about the ingredients, while one of the cooks promised to set food aside for the royal couple. The duchess told her: Oh thank you, I\u0027ll take that home and have it for dinner. Meghan appeared to be a dab hand in the kitchen as she confidently flipped chapatis and turned koftas on the grill. Meanwhile the duke was several steps behind, chatting to guests and watching his we proudly. Following lunch, the trio posed for a group photo with the women of the kitchen and their families then stayed to talk to them. Meghan Markle\u0027s cookbook launch in pictures: Mum Doria joins Prince Harry and women affected by Grenfell disaster   Kensington Palace previously shared a touching video of Meghan working in the kitchen and chatting with the women to promote the new project. She also wrote an emotional three-page foreword for the book, which can now be pre-ordered on Amazon for just \u0026pound9.99. In it she recalls the moment she heard about the Grenfell fire when she was working in Canada, and how she wanted to help. She writes about visiting the kitchen when she was getting used to le in London with Prince Harry and the incredible women she met. Details of her favourite meals are also shared including collard greens, black-eyed peas and cornbread, which reminds her of her childhood.  The duchess went to meet those affected by the Grenfell disaster at least twice at the beginning of the year, including a trip to the Al Manaar community mosque, which lies in the shadow of the charred shell of Grenfell Tower. She was without Prince Harry but was accompanied by a royal protection officer and one of the prince’s aides. The visits were compared to many made by her late mother-in-law Princess Diana, who often carried out charity work in secret. Speaking at the time, a leading Grenfell community member said: Meghan\u0027s visits mean so much to us. She has a special place in our hearts. A royal source added: Ms Markle has regularly been making private visits to organisations as she gets to know the charity sector.

Jurors were shown footage of Mohammed Abdul, 21, allegedly driving his Suzuki Vitara past bouncers and into revellers. CCTV footage appears to show the vehicle coursing down an alleyway packed with clubbers before later ploughing into the venue itself. From a camera inside Blake\u0027s in Gravesend, Kent, the vehicle\u0027s front lights can be seen getting closer and closer as dancers mingle, unaware the Suzuki is hurtling towards them.  One man can then be seen spread-eagled on the bonnet, swept off his feet as the Suzuki rams into him from behind. Others are seen fleeing to safety as security guards appear in hot pursuit of the car, shortly before midnight on March 17 this year. The car can be seen reversing, its registration plate hanging off at an angle, as patrons stagger to get to their feet. Some clubbers can be seen appearing to swarm the vehicle and showering it with a volley of thumps, while others look visibly distressed in the corner of the nightclub.  Abdul is on trial at Maidstone Crown Court for attempted murder over the incident which left eight people injured. The court heard he had been ejected from the venue at around 11.40pm for being too drunk. His trial was told that while in a rage and acting aggressively, he threatened bouncers, telling doorman Peter Muro: If I can\u0027t come in I\u0027m going to come back and shut this place down and kill you guys. Abdul ed in his vehicle around 10 minutes later and drove at speed down a narrow alleyway by the side of the club, with door staff and clubbers jumping or being pulled out of the way, prosecutor Simon Taylor said.  The alleyway housed a marquee attached to the club with a dance floor and DJ booth, and it was filled with revellers there to see grime rapper Giggs. Abdul, of Deptford, south-east London, accepts he was the driver of the vehicle and has admitted causing serious injury by dangerous driving, jurors heard. But he denies two counts of attempting to murder persons in the vicinity of the club and an alternative charge of attempting to cause grievous bodily harm with intent.

Now sleep researchers are saying that we need to get eight-and-a-half hours of rest every night because we are so stressed out. Pennsylvania State University professor, study author and sleep expert Dr Daniel Gartenberg explains why eight hours is just not enough. He says the night needs to be stretched to eight-and-a-half hours. “If anything, I think we need more sleep now because we are bombarded with so much information. “One of the main s of sleep is to take all the information we get throughout the day and sort into what’s relevant.” We’re taking in more information than ever – about 34GB a day – and the brain needs more processing time.  “At the end of the day, there’s not just the right amount of sleep, there is also getting the right quality of sleep,” says Dr Gartenberg.  Light from screens – especially our ever-present smartphones – is in part to blame for sleeplessness, but we may be able to leverage them for better too, he says, and work on projects that aim to do just that.   Dr Gartenberg’s solution is an app called Sonic Sleep, which uses “pink noise” to “round out other sounds” and prevent them from waking you in  the night.  Noise at night stimulates the brain and may cause you to wake. Dr Gartenberg’s system aims to control that sound stimulation. The practice also involves “sleep hygiene’” – doing things like keeping cell phones out of the bedroom . And cognitive training – undoing links between the bed and bad thoughts. Plus, learning relaxation techniques.

The storm is expected to bring gale force winds through the evening and overnight into Friday. Gusts of 45 to 50mph are predicted around exposed coasts and at some spots inland, as well as the possibility of some gusts of up to 65mph.

Cameron Paton uploaded the clip to his twitter account with the caption: “Get back to class ya wet wipe.” In the footage the driver is shown pulling out of a junction before driving straight towards a large brown puddle which has collected at the side of the road. Two young boys with backpacks on are shown just feet from the puddle, while one boy can be seen on the grass verge directly in front. The Ford van driver can be heard speeding up his vehicle before driving right through the puddle. A young boy who appears to be around 15-years-old and wearing all black and carrying a backpack is shown trying to shield himself as the water sprays completely over him.

There\u0027s a lot to think about, from the location to the dress, the honeymoon and the cake, and the cost can quickly add up  you\u0027re not careful with your budget. So it\u0027s no surprise that some women take a long time - sometimes years - to plan their dream day. But it turns out that a few brides-to-be also expect their wedding party to take a lot of time out of their busy lives to help them plan - and they become bridezillas  things don\u0027t quite work out.  This is the situation a woman going by the name Marissa  found herself in recently after being asked to be her best friend\u0027s maid of honour, reports The Sun . Let\u0027s just say it didn\u0027t end well. Marissa shared her story on Facebook , where she revealed that in April her friend demanded her boyfriend propose to her by the end of July. If the man in question didn\u0027t meet her deadline, she would start giving him the silent treatment.  The future hubby planned on popping the question within the allotted time frame, but asked Marissa and friends to try and mislead his partner so she would be surprised when the moment came. During a night out, Marissa and a friend try to talk her off a clf by trying to convince her to compromise and show a little patience. But their words didn\u0027t have the desired impact. I later find out she cried the whole ride home, started a fight with future hubby about being an a**hole for not proposing and cried herself to sleep that night, said Marissa. She also claimed that we bullied her into thinking he wasn\u0027t going to propose - ever.  But sure enough the proposal did happen, and Marissa, having been friends with the bride-to-be for over 20 years, agreed to be maid of honour, despite the fact that they were growing apart. Pretty soon she began regretting her decision. A month or two later, I noty her that I am planning on competing in a fitness show PRIOR to her wedding. This means the whole competition would be over before her wedding. She cries, tells me I am being selfish, and then proceeds to say I won\u0027t be any fun at the bachelorette.  Shame on me for not stopping my entire le to accommodate her wedding YEAR. When the hen party rolled around, the bride threw a tantrum as her Gatsby-themed bash had to be toned down due to budget restrictions. Marissa then found herself forced to work the bar at the event as the bride had failed to hire people to help. Ironically this caused the bride to brand her antisocial for not being more involved at the party. Even when she discovered her boyfriend had been cheating on her, Marissa still attempted to keep a smile on her face and do everything she could to make the bride\u0027s big day perfect.  She agreed to pay \u0026pound153 for her dress, she picked up an \u0026pound88 tab for lunch on the day they went dress shopping and spent around \u0026pound609 on the wedding shower, with a little help from bridesmaids. Despite her best efforts Marissa was then ghosted by the bride for a week after the shower - all because she\u0027d gone to her cousin\u0027s finance\u0027s hen do instead of going food shopping with the bride. When the bride finally spoke to her again, it was only to lay into her about not putting in enough effort for the wedding. Marissa wrote: She said it was ridiculous that I bullied her into thinking she would never be proposed to, I didn\u0027t comment on her engagement post saying she would be the \u0027most beautul bride ever\u0027 and I didn\u0027t like enough of her pre-wedding posts.

The web, in Aitoliko, is around 1,000ft, or 300 metres, in size. Experts believe that warm weather is to blame, with conditions ideal for spiders who come to the tourist hotspot to mate. A rise in the mosquito population could also explain the phenomenon.  The spiders behind the unusual masterpiece are reported to be Tetragnatha insects. But anyone who wants to see the web should get there soon, as it is not expected to last long.  Professor Maria Chatzaki told Newsit.gr : High temperatures, sufficient humidity and food created the ideal conditions for the species to reproduce in large numbers.

From buying props to travelling across the world, those who want to increase their following will do just about anything for the \u0027gram.  Recently one woman received death threats over a photo she posted on Instagram which was meant to reflect her perfect morning.  With a plate full of tortilla wraps passed off as crepes and ious other staged pieces, the image went viral. Now another picture is doing the same for a very similar reason.   Instagram star Harimao Lee has been slammed for sharing an over-the-top photo of a plane journey with her 127,000 followers.   The photographer travelled from Hong Kong to Rome with Cathay Pacic in a business class cabin and shared a picture of herself inside, sipping champagne and stargazing while draped in fairy lights.  People were quick to mock her for the image, which had very clearly been staged. One user commented: Ridiculous fairy lights aside, lady you are sitting on the business class seats BACKWARDS with your head inches away from the TV monitor...this is so staged!    Another said: I wonder how much time and effort was spent preparing this photo compared to actually looking out of the window. I\u0027m not sure this is the best kind of advert for Cathay Pacic because it just looks a bit hollow, especially with the random fairy lights for no apparent reason. A third added: Oh ffs love neck your plonk, go to sleep and decide the next day  you actually have a le. Trying to bring back the romance and glamour of first class air travel? Amazing s one can go to to get ‘likes’, posted a fourth. Others branded the snap cringe and told her to get a le.  But not everyone was against the image, some people praised Harimao for her efforts to create a fairytale vibe. What a charming shot, said one person. It\u0027s so magical, commented another. Damn this is epic, wrote a third.

Little Coco and her brother Luca, along with mum Dasha, will soon be released into the wild. When a British charity rescued Dasha from a tiny, squalid cage opposite a restaurant in Armenia no one realised she was pregnant. A few months later she gave birth. Since then the seven-month-olds and mum have been in a special enclosure with minimum human contact, a crucial step to surviving on their own in the rugged hills. Alan Knight, head of Sussex-based International Animal Rescue, said: “Mirror readers’ donations have helped to make our work possible.  “At first, we thought Dasha had fallen ill, but it soon became clear she was pregnant. “First one little head appeared, then we realised another cub was on the way. It was an amazing moment.” Dasha was imprisoned her entire 10-year-old le for the amusement of restaurant diners near Yerevan. She was fed on scraps from their meals and her cubs would likely have suffered the same fate. But she was rescued by the charity along with her mate, Misha. Tragically the male bear died soon after.  In Armenia, brown bears are often caged in appalling conditions near restaurants and shopping centres. But now IAR has won the backing of officials and working with Armenia’s Foundation for the Protection of Wildle it aims to free up to 80 bears.

Staff at the A\u0026ampE department of a medical centre in the south of the island are said to have called officers in after making the bizarre discovery. The unnamed woman, described as an expat, had sought help after suffering pain in her genital area which doctors diagnosed as an infection caused by the reptile. Island newspaper El Dia claimed she told police she had begun to feel odd after going out partying with a group of British friends a couple of days earlier - but had no idea how the tortoise ended up where it did.  The size of the reptile has not been revealed. Island papers - and respected Spanish dailies which have echoed the story - have named the medical centre she attended as El Mojon in the municipality of Arona in the south of the island. The facility, above the holiday resort of Los Cristianos, operates as a small hospital and is eventually expected to become the main southern Tenere state hospital.  No-one from the hospital was available for comment this afternoon although El Dia said health officials had declined to comment for data protection reasons. National Police in Tenere, reported to have been called in to question the woman over concern about how the animal had ended up in her private parts, could not be immediately reached. She is said to have gone to A\u0026ampE at El Mojon on Saturday. In December last year doctors revealed the full list of baffling items found in vaginas.  The most common was scented soap followed by a deodorant lid, a bottle cap and a penis ring with spikes on.

Mr Weber said Ms Ferraii had separated from her husband about 14 years ago and was a health worker who had carried out studies into Alzheimer\u0027s disease. She lived in Steinmaur, a municipality north of Zurich, and rarely travelled out of Switzerland, but she did a lot of travel within the country, he added. She was a godmother to one of Mr Weber\u0027s children, he added.  The mountaineering guide said: My we will be devastated. They were good friends. We have known her for at least 25 years. Our children went to school together. Just days before she left for Ireland, Ms Ferraii, the Webers and friends went on a seven-day, 50-mile hike. Ms Ferraii was one of two people killed in the storm. A worker at a forest park in County Armagh, Northern Ireland, died after he was hit by a tree. The man in his 20s was working on behalf of public utility Northern Ireland Water in Slieve Gullion Forest Park. A co-worker was injured.  A number of others were hurt as the storm damaged properties and brought down trees and power lines. In North West England, a woman was seriously injured after a tree fell onto her car in Cheshire. Two people were taken to hospital after a tree fell on a moving car in Alnwick, Northumberland. In the Scottish Highlands a man had to be rescued after becoming trapped under a digger in a river in the village of Rogart. The Met Office and Ireland\u0027s weather service had issued danger to le warnings before the storm hit.

We have been forced to change the defence with Murdoch out with a knee injury.“In the first 20 minutes, with Rachid Bouhenna starting, maybe not everyone was comfortable.“Afterwards we grew into the game and I don’t think that we made any mistakes.”Excuses, perhaps, but valid ones? Probably. Further to his points, when King, Paul McMullan and Fyvie, in particular, came on United kicked into gear.Ahead of Saturday’s trip to Falkirk, for the first time in a few weeks, Csaba will have options to consider from a squad he has, for all his critics, united behind one cause.Stanton is expected back in training while the trio aforementioned will have played themselves into the gaffer’s thoughts.Arabs heading through on Saturday will be looking for three points after draws against Alloa and Morton in their last two league matches.And rightly so, to push themselves back into promotion contention they will have to pick up three points with more regularity.However, Csaba has defended their record so far which sees them lie in fth position – just three points behind leaders Inverness Caley Thistle, saying: “We have had four games in a row without losing – two wins and two draws – so psychologically the team are showing spirit which is good.“They  have stuck with us for three years, this is the third year in the Scottish Championship and I think, not just the fans, but everybody is hoping we can go up.“This is a normal reaction, I understand them but they also must understand that we are also human and are trying to do the best for the club.“The fans have to appreciate the work that has been put in, the season is just beginning and it is only five games.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b7bd9b8dfe43.jpg ","title":"csaba laszlo says fraser fyvie has all the right stuff","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United manager Csaba Laszlo was delighted to welcome club captain Fraser Fyvie back to the fold on Saturday and believes he is just what they need to push on.The midfield man came off the bench on 73 minutes after recovering from a long-term knee injury and made a huge impact for the Terrors.With practically the last kick of the game Fyvie netted a terric half-volley to equalise after Morton had taken the lead through a Michael Tidser penalty on 11 minutes.It was not just the goal, but his overall play, which pleased Csaba.“I am happy to have him back, not just because he scored the goal, but he is a player who can create chances and shoot,” he said.“In the last 20 minutes he showed his experience and he knows what you have to do.“He comes on and in just 20 minutes he shoots three times. Two were very dangerous and the third was the goal.“Fraser is definitely a leader but we must be careful with him because he had two cruciate ligament problems so it has not been easy for him to handle this psychologically.”Ahead of Saturday’s trip to face bottom side Falkirk, Csaba has decisions to make in his midfield.After his dominant 20-minute display at Tannadice, Fyvie will be in contention to start and Csaba also revealed Sam Stanton is close.“It is good that he is making competition. Him and Sam Stanton must come back, hopefully, very quick. Maybe this week he will begin training,” he added.“He is also a creative midfielder who can score goals from the middle.“He scored a fantastic goal against Queen of the South.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee united gaffer csaba laszlo blasts referee after spot kick call","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United manager Csaba Laszlo has hit out at referee Colin Steven after he gave a controversial penalty against his side on Saturday.Steven pointed to the spot on 11 minutes when debutant Rachid Bouhenna was adjudged to have fouled Morton defender Gregor Buchanan in the box from a corner.Michael Tidser stepped up to give the ’Ton the lead in a Championship game which finished 1-1 thanks to substitute Fraser Fyvie’s last-minute equaliser.Although Csaba was pleased with the fight they showed to win a point, he was frustrated at the referee’s performance.“I am really proud of the boys because it was a really dficult game,” he said.“You get a penalty against you, and I don’t want to talk about the performance of the referee because it’s not my job, but I thought it was a foul for us at first.“I didn’t hear the whistle, then the referee shows for the penalty but I think, to be honest,  he gives this penalty then he has the chance to give 10 others for both sides.“It’s just my opinion and it is not all about the penalty. I don’t want to criticise the referee but, according to me, it was a very soft penalty.“I asked my players  there was contact there but they didn’t think it was one which you have to give.”Of United’s display, Csaba added: “I think for 90 minutes plus added time we played one-way football.“The boys tried hard and it’s not easy when the clock is ticking down and you still can’t score.“In the first-half we had two very good chances where we should score and in the second half we were pressing Morton.“They were, more or less, 11 behind the ball playing very deep and they tried to counter attack.“Sometimes you have these games where you have to suffer but we have to be more clinical, must be more clinical.“We can talk about the many mistakes but we have to play faster, more with the

supporters","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United defender Rachid Bouhenna insists they must repay the fans for their support with a win at Falkirk on Saturday.The French-Algerian centre-back made his United debut in their disappointing 1-1 draw with Morton at Tannadice at the weekend.The Terrors now travel west for a crucial Championship tie after captain Fraser Fyvie, ing from a long-term injury off the bench, salvaged a point with a last-minute strike against Jonatan Johansson’s side – who took an early lead through a Michael Tidser penalty.And Bouhenna says they will do everything they can to pick up three points and get the Arabs back onside ahead of, what he insists is, a continued promotion push.“Of course for Dundee United the objective is to go to the top league, the Premiership, so we have to win these games at home and get results away,” he said.“Saturday we lost two points, we need to win the supporters back this weekend at Falkirk and I hope next year we will play in the top tier.“The fans were amazing, we need them for the rest of the season and I think they are behind us.“After the game I thought it was a good game but we had many chances to score and didn’t take them.“It’s good to come back to draw but for the next game we have to win  we want to stay near the top of the Championship.”Despite hauling down Gregor Buchanan for the penalty which Tidser converted to give the Ton the lead on 11 minutes, Bouhenna was pleased with his first run-out in tangerine.However, The 27-year-old was not happy with referee Colin Steven’s call to award the spot-kick after the tussle with Buchanan at a corner and Bouhenna expressed his surprise given the physical nature of Scottish football.He added: “It was an OK debut I think.“Only really the foul for the penalty – I can’t believe it.“I don’t think it was, he did not have the ball and we are in a duel but I don’t know why.“It was not just the penalty, it was every ball the referee whistle against us.“It is not like Algeria or France, for sure.“It is more physical but Morton was a very physical game – that is the big dference and I think we can play more football at home.“Away it will be very dficult, you saw in the last game at Alloa you can’t play because of a dficult pitch but at home we have to play more.“Next game it will be very dficult when we play against Falkirk, so we have to get used to this.”Bouhenna is still settling into le in Dundee and getting to grips with the language – not to mention the accent.However, he still feels at home after being welcomed by everyone at the club.Skipper Fyvie, in particular, impressed the big defender with his influence on the side when he entered the fray on 73 minutes.The 25-year-old changed the game and got the equaliser with a ferocious half volley in second-half stoppage time.“Fraser has the experience, when he come on to pitch he helped us.“He is good for us and I hope in the next game he can continue to help us  he is in the starting XI or comes on to the pitch.“I am enjoying being at Dundee United, I am feeling very good.“My team-mates and everybody at the club have been very nice, they feel like family and I am very happy with it.“With the manager and the team-mates it is very good but we have to keep going, keep working and think about the next game.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/07/image.jpg@1.146874.jpg ","title":"tay road bridge lift out of action for eight weeks while replacement is

first","story":"\u0026nbspA DOCTOR and a former detective have joined forces to launch Scotland\u0027 first absinthe blanche using ingredients hand-picked from around their 500-year-old ancestral home by the shores of Loch Ness.The couple, Lorien and Kevin Cameron-Ross, creators of the award-winning Loch Ness Gin, developed the recipe for Loch Ness Absinthe, both distilled at their home on the banks of the loch, following a trip to the birthplace of the spirit, Val-de-Travers in Switzerland.It was there Lorien learned to fine-tune the craft of making absinthe which was first used as a medicinal remedy by a French doctor living in the country, Pierre Ordinaire around the 1790s.Although best known as absinthe verte, the notorious \"green drink\", popular in the late 19th and early 20th century among artists and writers in Paris, with Vincent Van Gogh and Ernest Hemmingway among its devotees, the couple decided to create their own Scottish blanche recipe.Blanche absinthe dates back to 1910 following the ban of green absinthe in ious countries \u0026ndash although not in the UK \u0026ndash due to unproven fears it had hallucinogenic properties resulting from the use of thujone, a component of wormwood.This led to the illegal production of clear absinthe in Switzerland, making it harder for the authorities to identy.Lorien said: \"We are really proud of our latest product, Loch Ness Absinthe, boasting our very own homegrown botanicals including wormwood mixed with nearby fresh water which flows into the famous loch.\"We felt there was gap in the market for an absinthe blanche in Scotland, a drink I really enjoy, so decided to put the wheels in motion last year and began to research its history and fully understand the craft of creating and distilling it.\"Loch Ness Absinthe, with a ABV of 53 per cent, is less potent that absinthe verte, which is usually around 72 per cent.The couple, who are firm believers in mindful drinking where you drink less and enjoy yourself more, recommend that Loch Ness Absinthe should be enjoyed slowly as an aperit, ideally in a mix of one-part absinthe to three parts iced water, poured over a sugar cube on the glass\u0027 rim.Lorien continued: \"I\u0026rsquove worked really hard to get the recipe for our latest product, Loch Ness Absinthe exactly the way I wanted and in the process perfected the art of distilling it to get the exact results I was looking for.\"With the help and support of Kevin, I\u0026rsquove created a drink that I\u0026rsquom really pleased with, which has already received fantastic feedback, leading to us driving our plans forward to launch even more products in the near future that will continue to be inspired by the loch and the land around us.\"Thursday 20 Sep 2018

march","story":"\u0026nbspA GAY pride march in Inverness could get the green light as early as this week.The planned Proud Ness parade, which is expected to take place in Inverness on October 6, has been overshadowed by a row between religious objectors and counter petitions.The row erupted last week, shortly after Donald Morrison, a home mission worker with the Free Church of Scotland , submitted a petition of around 600 to 700 names opposing what he deemed the \"unsavoury event\".The move sparked a furious response from other sections of the community, with three separate petitions launched supporting the Gay Pride march. They have since gathered more than 14,500 signatures.And the march looks set to go ahead as planned after Highland Council revealed that the objections made in the original petition \"are not sufficient reason\" to refuse it. The local authority said objections on moral grounds were not a material matter when its licensing department decides whether to approve the temporary traffic restrictions that allow marches to proceed.It added that the petition against the march is \"being considered separately\" through its regular petitions procedures by its legal service team.A Highland Council spokeswoman said: \"Highland Council, Licensing has received a request for a parade on October 6 in Inverness.\"This is currently being considered under consultation with Police Scotland and the council\u0027 roads team.\"A decision on the parade will be made [this] week and a Temporary Traffic Restriction Order would be required for the march.\" They added: \"The matters raised in the petition are not sufficient reason for the council to refuse permission for the parade, and the petition is being considered separately.\"Meanwhile, Mr Morrison has accused Highland Council of \u0026lsquomoving the goalposts\u0026rsquo after claiming it had shted a deadline for views on the march to be submitted.He said his petition was submitted on September 7 \u0026ndash which he argued was the last date for comments \u0026ndash and that he had since heard the deadline had moved back to September 21.\"One cannot help but wonder whether the circulation of two online petitions, in favour of the Proud Ness march, both created within 24 hours on and around 11 September, prompted Highland Council to review and then quickly change their date, so as to accommodate the cravings of these petitioners,\" he said.\"Everyone can clearly see that the subtle and suspicious date change is most conspicuous, just as it is deeply alarming.\"Surely it is wholly inappropriate for... Highland Council to act in a manner, that very much appears to be deceptive and gives the impression of being supportive of these counter online petitions.\"Following the council\u0027 insistence that the petition\u0027 objection is not a material licensing matter, it is not clear what dference a later deadline would have made over any decision. It is also not uncommon for councils to push consultation dates back in order for extra views to be aired.Meanwhile, the creator of one of the petitions in favour of the march has spoken of her delight at the amount of support they have received.Alice Masheter said the response had been \"fantastic\" and that, even though she is not a member of the LGBT+ community, she had felt compelled to set a petition up in solidarity to show that everyone is \"accepted and welcomed up here\".She said the pro-march petitions show that the LGBT+ community \"do have a huge amount of support\" and anti-march views are \"in the minority\".Thursday 20 Sep 2018 7:35 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116850.jpg","title":"New social enterprise cafe set for grand opening","story":"\u0026nbspA QUIRKY caf\u0026eacute that could be run by former prisoners in an attempt to reduce re-offending rates is opening in Inverness this week.The venue at 86 Church Street called Ar n-\u0026Agraveite, which translates to Our Place, will be officially opened by Inverness MP Drew Hendry at noon on Thursday.It aims to \u0026lsquorebuild\u0026rsquo people\u0027 lives after jail, giving them work and a chance to be a part of society.More than 50 volunteers are needed in the first year to run the venture and make it financially viable.Andrew Fowler, from the charity Signpost, which is spearheading the caf\u0026eacute scheme, said: \"We genuinely believe that we will be preparing people for work.

McKenna’s ascent has been rapid as the defender has started every game he has been fit for.Aston Villa and Celtic’s rejected bids were the latest in a number of moves for the centre-back.Hull City had three bids, with the final in excess of £1m, knocked back in January and Swansea City also made an approach for McKenna during the summer.McInnes said: “Scott deals with everything in his stride.“We are not dealing with someone who is a standard footballer.“He is something a bit special.“All he thought about was getting himself ready for the St Johnstone game.“They don’t make them like Scott too often these days.“He is a brilliant boy.“With all the experience I have in the game I can say to Scott with so much confidence that his time will come. Scott backs himself and trusts me.”McInnes recently claimed that McKenna, contracted to the Dons until 2023, will eventually leave Pittodrie on a “big ticket” move to the English Premier League.That could be as early as January  a club come in with a bid that meets the Reds’ valuation, early enough to find a replacement in that window.McKenna’s  from injury was a welcome boost at a time when eight players were ruled out for the trip to St Johnstone by injury or suspension.McInnes said: “Scott’s level of performance has been outstanding since he got into the team.“Defensively we have not been too bad and it has not been our biggest area of concern.“However, Scott’s  gives everyone a boost.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"fixed price 112000 two bedroom flat in bucksburn","story":"\t\t\t\t\t31a Mugiemoss Road, located in the city\u0026#8217s Bucksburn area, is a well maintained flat in a traditional granite building.Description: This lovely property comprises: entrance vestibule L-shaped hallway front facing lounge providing space for living and dining furniture stylish dining kitchen fitted with an array of base and wall storage units front facing double bedrooms with wardrobes which span one wall further good sized double bedroom which overlooks the rear and a centrally positioned shower room fitted with a 2 piece suite.Outside to the front is an exclusive section of garden.

The competition is free to enter and all shops who enter will also be promoted to consumers through an online Indie Retail Directory.Shopkeepers can nominate their businesses until Sunday September 9 via bestsmallshops. A shortlist of 25 of the most impressive applications will be shortlisted by a panel made up of established representatives from the independent retail industry.The judges will be looking for evidence of a small shops\u0026#8217 entrepreneurial spirit, ways that they have been innovative in their business and what they have done to have a lasting positive impact on their community.The shortlisted small shops will be invited to a parliamentary reception on November 13 to meet their Member of Parliament and find out who will be crowned Best Small Shop 2018.Argyll and Bute has an amazing array of small shops which help support our rural economy and I would love to see them recognised.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,Since when is it okay for a man to stand in a layby and urinate in broad daylight?It has become more noticeable in recent years and is never a pleasant sight. It strikes me this sort of selfish attitude is something that may also be contributing to the growing problem of drivers throwing rubbish out their windows on Argyll\u0026#8217s road network.If you can\u0026#8217t find a public toilet, at least find a tree to hide behind when you\u0026#8217re caught short \u0026#8211 and a bin to chuck your rubbish in.Name and address supplied.Sir,At Royal Mail we never forget that we form an essential part of the UK’s social fabric.We know our postmen and postwomen are valued members of the local community as they deliver letters and parcels six days a week \u0026#8211 in all weathers. We’re also continually looking to make our services even better to give customers greater convenience as they shop online.I’d like to make your readers aware of a few changes to their doorstep deliveries so there are no surprises.Customers expecting tracked items from large retailers are among those to benefit from these changes. If they are not at home when we deliver, they will now receive email/SMS notications on the whereabouts of their delivery. For customers who have provided their contact details, the notications will confirm when their items have been delivered to a neighbour, as well as specying the neighbour’s address.The \u0026#8216Something for You\u0026#8217 card is also going digital, making it easier for customers to retrieve their item  they are not at home when we deliver. Email and SMS notications will let customers either re-arrange their parcel delivery for another day or collect their item from their local Customer Service Point using relevant identication. Customers will no longer need to go home to collect the physical card \u0026#8211 which we’ll continue to post through letter boxes.And finally customers taking pre-paid parcels  to selected Royal Mail Customer Service Points will receive an acceptance scan as soon as they drop off their item thanks to new scanning technology.Gerry McAuley, delivery director, Glasgow Mail Centre.Sir,The Supreme Court appears to have come to a sensible decision for the terminally ill in its landmark right-to-die ruling.One year ago my adult children and I watched helplessly as a most loved, mentally alert member of our family, with terminal cancer, suffered a needlessly horrible and prolonged death.This, after the patient had pleaded, for two weeks, with family doctors and religious leaders to end the constant suffering by requesting some form of assisted dying.This Supreme Court decision has come too late for our loved one but hopefully Westminster and Holyrood will now each consider and pass a bill to allow assisted dying and prevent suffering for current and future patients.Gordon Caskie, Muasdale.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 32","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 12/08/18, 3:16 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowSomething slightly dferent in this edition.

I foolishly stood up too soon approaching the Kilmartin stop and fell forward, landing head to door and feet in the air.Thank you to the doctor who checked me over, and to the driver and passengers who waited until I had been checked.Janet Jardine, KilmartinSir,I would like to give thanks to Tarbert Festivals Committee for all their hard work in organising the very successful Seafood Festival.Tarbert Festival Queen 2018 Chloe MacDonald with her Princesses Cara and Kaitlyn were beautul and a great credit to the festival.My thanks again to everyone who helped in any way to make this year’s festival such an amazing event and to the very many people who visited the village for the occasion.Councillor Anne Horn, TarbertEditor\u0026#8217s note: With apologies to Councillor Horn for the delay in publishing this letter, originally submitted in July.Sir,The closure of the tourist centres at Tarbert and Inveraray is very worrying and I can’t understand why VisitScotland, backed by the Scottish Government, came up with such a decision.Tourism is extremely important to Argyll and Bute, and all agencies should be working together to assist the tourists that come to this area.Tarbert is in my council ward and I know how valuable the centre there is. The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a dferent form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of ersity to suit inidual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very signicant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex  from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray. They searched all the places they had visited, including the George, but the keys were not found, so they ed to Cairnbaan by taxi.Fortunately the hotel found the keys and managed to make contact with them, and they ed to Inveraray by taxi to collect the keys from the staff who had been kind enough to wait for them.Once again I would to thank you for your help in making my guests\u0026#8217 stay memorable.Pauline Houston, Crinan Canal CottageSir,I was very happy to attend this year\u0026#8217s Islay, Jura and Colonsay Agricultural Show.It was great to hear about the terric work being done by the Islay Development Initiative with their Islay Pollinator Initiative which generates employment, including two Modern Apprentices in Beekeeping.I spoke to local farmers about single farm payment delays, feed prices, fuel prices, broadband speed and the poor quality of our infrastructure. I also met with the Islay Book Festival team and heard from my constituents from across Islay, Jura and Colonsay about numerous local issues, all of which will addressed.A huge thank you to all the hard-working volunteers who helped make this year\u0026#8217s show possible.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 33","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 19/08/18, 2:04 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There has been talk of a new rugby pitch for a while, but plans presented to community councillors on Monday go further than that.We hope everyone involved is as enthusiastic as Mid Argyll Rugby Club and more power to their elbow.This year\u0026#8217s has to go down as one of the best Mid Argyll Shows in recent times.The weather helped bring out the crowds in big numbers, but the real credit must go to the volunteers who organise the show.

Macmillan is there to help people with cancer live le as fully as they can.Offering a broad range of cancer information and support services \u0026#8211 including a free support line and a community of over 7,700 healthcare professionals \u0026#8211 demand for Macmillan’s services is constantly growing, but we rely on the generosity of the public to provide this support.Macmillan’s Coffee Morning takes place on Friday September 28 \u0026#8211 but people can host whenever they want. Whoever they invite and whatever they serve, people are highly encouraged to host a Macmillan Coffee Morning in a way that suits them.If people can’t bake, that doesn’t have to stop them. Throughout September, headline partner M\u0026ampS will be selling a selection of limited edition coffee morning products \u0026#8211 including lots of cakes, biscuits and two exclusive mugs \u0026#8211 with 10 per cent of proceeds going to Macmillan.Homes, workplaces and communities from the Shetland Islands to Land’s End will be hosting coffee mornings this year readers in Argyll and Bute can find events nearby using the interactive map on the Coffee Morning website www.macmillan.org.uk/coffee.Thank you to everyone who gets involved.Joanna Lumley, actress and Macmillan supporterSir,The SNP announced it is starting up a new \u0026#8216fact-checking\u0026#8217 service to monitor the accuracy of research and political statements.Many people in Scotland will be wondering  the SNP will be fact-checking the cost of its new independence blueprint.

The kids have had a great time with their teams playing well, building team spirit and creating a positive impression of the soccer centre and Lochgilphead.The Red Star 2007 team as well as regularly taking part in the Oban Primary League has travelled to Mossend, Oban, Crieff, Campbeltown and Helensburgh.  The kids are really developing and getting ready to move up to nine aside from now and then eleven aside in August 2019. The 2008 team has been to Mossend, Oban, Ardencaple, Campbeltown, Helensburgh, Finnart and Airdrieonians and have also been taking part in the Oban Primary League.The 2009s, 2010s and 2011s have been on trips to Oban, Campbeltown and Helensburgh. The kids played four and five aside as well as being committed to regular additional training sessions. The future looks good for when they step up to seven aside.Finally the girls team took part in both Oban and Campbeltown festivals. The enthusiastic girls have developed enormously in the last nine months. It\u0026#8217s great to see such an active group of girls growing from around eight girls this time last year to nearly 20 now.The action continues with teams due to take part in Haldane and Lochnell festivals in September. For the year so far that’s over 200 kids\u0026#8217 days out in total with around 60 kids at the Oban festival and around 70 kids at the Campbeltown festival.With funding from Ardrishaig Community Trust and the Ventient Energy A\u0026#8217 Cruach Community Fund administered by Foundation Scotland it is hoped to increase the number of festivals kids can attend and to get more teams through to Lochgilphead.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"come on scotland","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 07/09/18, 5:22 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA healthy Mid Argyll support will be at Hampden this evening  to see Scotland take on face World Cup semi-finalists Belgium at Hampden Park.A bus load of 40 youngsters from Lochgilphead Soccer Centre headed off to Glasgow on Friday afternoon to cheer on Scotland in their friendly game.The match is a warm-up before the serious business begins on Monday September 10 as Scotland begin the inaugural Nations League at home to Albania.Here we go again.

Jemma won the two-lap race in 25.7 seconds and placed highly in another three events. Beth won the high jump clearing 1.14m and the long jump and Kirstie had an outstanding run to win the four-lap race in 55.5 seconds. The other event winner in this contest was Jemma’s twin sister Jorja who won the javelin throwing 14 metres.Local girl Neve Bowden was the under 9 champion thanks to wins in the four-lap race and long jump. Scarlett Speirs from Inveraray was runner-up winning the high jump and two-lap race. Carla Renton from Campbeltown won the javelin in this age group.Violet Campbell from Glenbarr dominated in the under 13’s contest winning all five events including a 6.49 metres throw in the shot putt. Emma Plumber from Tayvallich was runner up with Kyra Robertson from Ardrishaig in third place.Karis Kidd from Ardrishaig was the under 15 champion, winning the two running events and the long jump and finished 1.5 points ahead of Amy Gibson from Bunessan on Mull who won the high jump with a 1.40 metres clearance. Caryn Kerr from Campbeltown was third on overall points and won the shot putt with a 6.67 metres throw. The previous week Caryn won the junior shot putt at Oban Highland Games.Three girls tied on points in the under 7’s competition and the final placings were decided on the most inidual wins which resulted in Cara Green from Ardrishaig the winner ahead of Zara Whyte and Chloe Hill.Ruairidh Charnock from Lochgilphead was the boys under 7 champion just one point ahead of Olly MacVicar from Tighnabruaich. Ruairidh won the two-lap race and long jump while Olly won the four-laprace and javelin throwing nine metres.Local boy George Balkeen dominated in the under 9’s with a clean sweep of wins which included impressive performances in the two-lap race recording 27.9 seconds, four-lap in 61.6 and a 10.50 metres javelin throw. Luke MacVicar from Tighnabruaich was second overall and Ciaran Johnstone from Oban was third.Roan MacVicar from Tighnabruaich was the under 11 champion thanks to wins in the two running events and finished four points ahead of Sam Gillespie from Lochgilphead who won the high jump and javelin throwing an impressive 14.25m. Third placed Robert Kerr from Campbeltown won the long jump in this section.Two Kintyre boys excelled in the under 13’s with Lewis Gilchrist from Tayinloan champion thanks to wins in the two-lap race in 22.9 and four-lap race in 48.2 seconds. Runner-up Ruaridh Campbell from Glenbarr won the shot putt throwing 9.76 metres and third placed Murray MacDonald also impressed winning the high jump with 1.31 metres and long jump.The entry was disappointing in the two older age groups where Finlay MacLean from Oban won the under 15’s ahead of Ewan Ferguson from Lochgilphead. Finlay won four events and Ewan won the high jump.Jake Gillespie from Lochgilphead was the under 17 winner ahead of Shaun Doy from Kilmichael Glassary. Shaun won the long jump and high jump clearing 1.55 metres. Jake recorded 22.1 seconds in the two-lap and threw an impressive 10.33 metres in the shot putt. Jake had a very successful summer season competing at the local Highland Games in Argyll and ended the circuit at Oban Games the previous week winning the overall Argyll junior championship.The two annual trophies in memory of the late Hugh MacArthur, founder member of the local club in 1984 who died in June 2015, were contested in the under 9 boys and under 9 girls.

What’s more, even  they don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,  released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in 2003, a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid 1990s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now, 23 years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per cell  and the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"some close shaves in the strc","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 10/09/18, 9:00 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThere were only two Mid Argyll crews competing in the Scottish Tarmac Rally Championship  Pendragon stages at Warcop training camp in Cumbria on Sunday August 26.They were Donald Bowness and navigator Paul Gribben in their Vauxhall Nova and Jamie Miller and Ian McCulloch in their Citroen C2R2Max. Both crews compete in the 1600 class.This was Jamie\u0026#8217s second outing in the car. In what was a wet and slippery day, only the first stage was completed in slightly drier conditions which made tyre choice dficult.Stage two was better, after a change of tyres. There were several incidents on stages throughout the day which caused delays. Jamie and Ian stopped to help on stage three when a car rolled. This caused them to lose a lot of time but priority was to ensure the other competitors were safe.By stage seven, the \u0026#8216red mist\u0026#8217 had set in on Jamie and he had a battle with a mk 2 Escort.Jamie said: \u0026#8216This is a good event, but the class in front have a phenomenal pace to compete against, although I still enjoyed it.\u0026#8217Jamie\u0026#8217s next event is Leuchars, Fe, in November which will be the final round of the STRC. He is also looking at doing the MSN circuit event in December at Knockhill.Donald and Paul also had a few close calls. On stage two they went through a fence in slippery conditions costing them around 35 seconds.Back to service, it was a change of tyres. The new tyre choice proved to be working well back on stage and they began climbing their position and setting impressive times.On stage seven, their car stopped within inches of a concrete block.At the end of a long day rallying, Jamie and Ian finished 46th overall and 14th in class, while Donald and Paul finished 7th overall with 1st in class and 1st FWD car setting a fourth fastest stage time.Donald said these were his best results so far since he started his hobby.

As pupils had brought a iety of instruments, including saxophones, flutes, guitars, accordion, trombone and, of course, tuned percussion, they were surprised that the day started with just rhythmic clapping.Alison and Felix both demonstrated playing techniques on their specialist instruments. For Alison, with a few flautists in the group, this was very informative. Scary soundtracks with special string techniques was Felix’s forte.We were split into two groups with each group composing three short melodies in the style of Steve Reich. These were developed using minimalist techniques such as addition, subtraction, stretching, interlocking, shting and phasing with each melody sounding very dferent depending on the instruments within the group. We performed and gave positive feedback on each other’s work.After lunch we got together to compose a third section in the style of John Adams with input from everybody. Techniques used here included gradual transformation and even sparkles.By the end of the day we were able to put our melodies together and we performed our unnamed minimalist composition. The event involved us interacting with each other, meeting new people and learning interesting skills that will be beneficial for our exam next year. We are all thoroughly delighted to have been a part of what was a great experience.

To make things worse, defender Luke Naisby was forced off with a hamstring injury.Star tried to play their way into the game but their passing was rushed and it was Southside who added to their tally before the break after a long ball over the top resulted in a breakdown of communication at the back and the striker had the simple task of rounding Kalache and placing the ball into the net.Star pulled a goal back in the second half thanks to an excellent inidual effort from Cammy MacDonald. Chances followed for Star, but Aaron Moore\u0026#8217s shot was blocked by the Southside keeper and Gregor Peacock shot just wide of the far post.The scoring was completed by the visitors in the 85th minute when Star failed to clear a corner and the striker shot past Kalache from close range to seal a 1-4 victory.Star will look to bounce back in another tough tie on Saturday September 15 when they take on Uddingston at home in the first round of the West of Scotland Cup.

I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,  you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers\u0026#8217 attention to the Facebook page \u0026#8216Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging\u0026#8217?The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The 600 jobs in aquaculture will not last long  mass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a 25-year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start again  an alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued? It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September 7, it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The 2018 parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause \u0026#8216irrecoverable damage\u0026#8217.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception. May I please ask your readers to seek out their pipers and encourage them to represent their school as a piping quartet,  not as a full band, at the next Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships?The championships are organised annually by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust.

Karen Wylie, 39, is hoping to raise \u0026pound80,000 to fly son Saul - who suffers from Spastic Diplegia Cerebral Palsy - to America for surgery which will allow him to stand independently and potentially walk. The Post reported earlier this year on the family’s campaign to help Saul whose condition causes muscle stfness in his legs and arms, meaning he cannot stand or walk unaided. The family, from Tarbolton, are fundraising so they can travel the 4000 miles to Missouri for a spinal operation which would dramatically reduce Saul’s spasticity. They hope to take Saul to St Louis Children’s Hospital to see Dr TS Park, a pioneer in Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy  surgery. Karen said: “Our objective is to get Saul to the best possible stage to allow us to apply to St Louis Children’s Hospital for him to be evaluated for this le-changing surgery. This will involve intense physiotherapy blocks, the purchase of specialised equipment and working closely with ious professional therapists to get him strong enough. This will take some time but no dream will ever be too big for our boy, it might just take a little longer to get there.” Saul was born with twin brother Clay 12 weeks’ premature. Clay weighed 3lbs and Saul just 1lb. Clay was treated at Crosshouse Hospital near Kilmarnock for three months to allow his lungs to develop and learn to feed and has now made a full recovery. However, Saul was kept in Yorkhill Hospital for six months and spent most of his first year in hospital as he was so fragile. At 18 months old, he was diagnosed with Spastic Diplegia Cerebral Palsy. When Karen was pregnant with the twins, she and her husband Stuart were given the devastating news that Clay had a better chance of survival  Saul were to be terminated, something that was never option for them. Karen said: “We were told on several occasions that Saul was too tiny to survive but he continues to defy the experts and he is our little fighter.” Not a keen runner, Karen – who gave up work when the twins were born and cares for Saul on a full-time basis – is taking on the 10k with a group of 25 friends and her 66-year-old mum in order to raise the \u0026pound80,000 needed to take Saul to America. Karen said: “I am not a runner, but have been training three times a week for the event and can now manage to run 4.5 miles. My mum has never done anything like this before so is extremely nervous but very determined to complete the race for her grandson. “Our fundraising total is set at \u0026pound80,000 to cover my son’s surgery, specialised equipment, intense physio and a two- year rehabilitation programme. We have been campaigning for 18 weeks and have raised an incredible \u0026pound41,000 so far. “We have been overwhelmed by the kindness of friends and family who are willing to help raise funds for Saul’s journey, their generosity is very much appreciated and our family are exceedingly grateful to everyone who’s helped us on this journey. “We were extremely proud when Saul started school with his twin Clay and older brother Mylo, eight, this year. He attends Tarbolton Primary School and has several classroom assistants who support him depending on what activities are being done each day. “Like every parent we long for endless opportunities for our son. We are exceedingly grateful to everyone who has supported us on Saul’s journey to help make his dream come true – to walk like his brothers.” The run is on Sunday, September 30.

local organisations, the ambitious target was reached.\nThe fundraising effort has now triggered the release of a European Leader grant of \u0026pound150,000, along with a combination of other grants, which means that the theatre now has the budget to transform its auditorium.\nThe revamp forms phase one of the \u0027Building on success\u0027 strategy to develop the building and make it more customer friendly and fit to meet increasing demand.\nIf the plans go to schedule, by the end of summer 2019 the auditorium will be developed to designs by Simpson \u0026amp Brown Architects.\nA raft of improvements will be made, including existing retractable seating replaced with new, better padded seats and increased legroom, plus aisle seats fitted with hand grabs, to help customers move up and down the steps more easily.\nThe current balcony seats that provide a restricted view of the stage will be replaced by around 24 new seats on diagonally stepped platforms.\nThey will offer a full view of the stage when two sections of solid balcony are replaced with steel rail and glass panels.\nAlso, new swivel stools, in the section of the balconies closest to the stage, will allow the theatre to offer some seats at a reduced ticket price.\nLow level safety lighting will be introduced into the new side balconies, and new heating ducts will be installed to deliver hot air at floor level.\nSir David Younger, chair of the Eastgate board of directors said: \u0026ldquoThe Board would like to thank most sincerely the Eastgate staff, the Friends of the Eastgate and all donors who rose magnicently to the challenge of raising a sizeable sum of money in a very short space of time.\n\u0026ldquoThe theatre was first developed in 2004 by the efforts of the local community and it is heartening for all of us to realise that all these years later it is still so valued.\n\u0026ldquoBy levering the European Leader grant the local fundraising has made a huge impact locally.\n\u0026ldquoThis, combined with the success of general manager Caroline Adam in attracting other signicant capital grants will help to ensure that the people of Tweeddale and much further afield have an arts venue well equipped to meet future needs.\nDonations to the appeal came in all shapes and sizes ranging from a little boy who put 50p of his pocket money into the donations box in the foyer to an American couple who transferred a four-figure sum. A bullock donated by local farmer Robert Barr now has Muchacoo  on his passport after dozens of visitors to the Peebles Agricultural show each paid \u0026pound5 to name him.\nAll of the money raised will go towards the development of the Eastgate Theatre building.\nDiscussions are already underway about progressing to phase two which will improve and reconfigure the foyer/caf\u0026eacute areas.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"sheriff-orders-gala-woman-to-hand-over-car-keys","story":"A GALASHIELS woman has been ordered to give up her car keys after being accused of two drink driving offences in the space of two months.\nJune McKain has been told she cannot drive a vehicle until the outcome of her trial in November.\nThe 58-year-old of Ladhope Crescent, appeared from custody at Selkirk Sherf Court where she pleaded not guilty to a charge of driving with a breath/alcohol count of 42 microgrammes -

Struthers, who was mentioned in dispatches, was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, with two bars later added, for his missions with the Royal Naval Air Service, which amalgamated with the

championship was not played, or perhaps there were not enough ladies and gents to run a mixed doubles competition.If the teams were always picked from a hat, the method used currently, it would explain why partnerships did not endure, unless by luck, though one strong player may win successively.The cup\u0026#8217s first winners in 1919 were: Mrs Chapman and Mr R. Y. Maxtone, the following year Mr Maxtone partnered Miss B Strang.1921 must have been a strange year for mixed doubles. The winner is inscribed as P. S. MacNair without a partner. Sometimes it can be a struggle to get teams, so perhaps MacNair played singles against a doubles pair.In 1922 honours were taken by Miss C. K. MacNish and Mr E. Armour. In 1923 a dferent pair emerged Miss J. I. McKersie and Mr A. G. MacKelvie.Miss B. Strang ed, partnered by Mr L. Edwards in 1924.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.

The cake was 3ft4in\u0026nbspwide, and 8in\u0026nbsphigh, and is an exact replica of the building near Tranent High Street.  Using vanilla sponge sandwiched with buttercream, former architect Michelle carved the cake into shape before covering it in a sugar paste fondant.

Each family member will don a special t-shirt as they do their bit for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust and The Butterfly Trust.  Amelia\u0026rsquos mum Kathryn Tait is one of those who will be climbing the 86 steps inside the lighthouse before slowing making a 121ft descent back to solid ground on Saturday, September 22.  She said: \u0026ldquoIt was Amelia\u0026rsquos gran, Shirley Dinning, who had the idea.  \u0026ldquoShe wanted to do the abseil from the Forth Bridge but they already had their charities and so she could not do it for the cystic fibrosis charities. That is why she decided to do it at the lighthouse.  \u0026ldquoI have never done anything like this.  \u0026ldquoI would not say I am looking forward to it but I am looking forward to raising money for the charities.  \u0026ldquoAmelia is going to need help the rest of her le and it is nice to give something back.  The youngster, who turned one last month, was born three weeks early at the Birth Centre in the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh .  It was three weeks later, following a routine heel prick, that it was discovered she had cystic fibrosis.  The genetic condition affects more than 10,400 people in the UK.  People with cystic fibrosis experience a build-up of thick, sticky mucus in the lungs, digestive system and other organs, causing a wide range of challenging symptoms affecting the entire body.  Kathryn said: \u0026ldquoShe had her heel prick test at five days old and then everything was fine.  \u0026ldquoThen, when she was three weeks old, we got a call from the Edinburgh Sick Kids Hospital to say we needed to go up because they had to discuss her results with us.  \u0026ldquoI phoned Amelia\u0026rsquos dad, Darren, at his work and said we needed to go there.  \u0026ldquoThey said she had cystic fibrosis and explained all about it \u0026ndash all about the genes, why she had it and that sort of stuff obviously it was a lot to take in.  Kathryn, who previously worked at Leuchie House, near North Berwick, as a care assistant, told the Courier she had heard of the condition but did not know a lot about it until speaking to the doctors.  Since the diagnosis, Amelia, who Kathryn described as \u0026ldquoalways smiling and [who] loves attention, has had regular trips to the Sick Kids to be checked over by doctors, nurses, physiotherapists and dieticians.  Kathryn, 23, of Dovecot Way, Haddington, said: \u0026ldquoAmelia has twice daily physio which she does not enjoy.  \u0026ldquoLuckily her pancreas is sufficient and she does not have to take enzymes to help her digest food.  \u0026ldquoWhen she does have an infection, it is quite an intensive course of antibiotics, three or four times a day.  \u0026ldquoIt is just the little things we have to watch for, like spraying deodorant because, obviously, you do not want her breathing that in and dust and things.  Now friends and family members, including Amelia\u0026rsquos older sisters Laura and Abby, are getting ready to give back to the two charities.  The Butterfly Trust, based in Edinburgh, offers support to families and people affected by the condition, while the Cystic Fibrosis Trust is heavily involved in research.

James Waters and Hugh Macdonald, artistic directors, said: \u0026ldquoThis year\u0026rsquos festival is an intoxicating mix of old and new both in performers and the music they play.  \u0026ldquoClarinettist and composer Mark Simpson is an extraordinary musical personality as artist in residence and his involvement has sparked a programme ranging from Stockhausen to Sch\u0026uumltz and presenting some of our favourite artists as well as featuring some thrilling festival debuts.  \u0026ldquoWe have had a lot of fun planning it and really look forward to sharing it with our audiences.  Following the huge success of the 2016 community opera in Dunbar , the Lammermuir Festival has commissioned a new community opera for 2018.  An Cadal Trom by Matthew Rooke features some 150 performers from Dunbar and across the county, a host of volunteers, and professional musicians, including McOpera .  Legendary jazz pianist Jason Rebello and classical pianist Alisdair Hogarth are joined by singers, exploring jazz and classical influences on a whole host of music from Schubert, Schumann, Strauss and Ravel to Great American Songbook songs like Somewhere Over the Rainbow.

The girl and the boy were trapped in the locked vehicle and were only rescued after passers-by heard the traumatised girl screaming \u0026ldquohelp, save us.  The concerned passer-by contacted the police and managed to calm the distraught children down by waiting by the vehicle while it was parked in a lay-by near to Prestonpans last year.  Yorkston, who was in charge of the children\u0026rsquos welfare, eventually appeared about 30 minutes later claiming he had \u0026ldquoonly been five minutes and had been relieving himself.  The 28-year-old then jumped into his car and drove away from the lay-by, leaving the police to launch a hunt for him and the two children.  Yorkston had previously admitted abandoning the children in the car last August when he appeared at Edinburgh Sherf Court earlier this year and he was due back in the dock last Wednesday.  Solicitor Cameron Tait, defending, said that his client had not attended court but asked Sherf Adrian Cottam to deal with the case in his absence.  Mr Tait added that the care of the children was now under supervision of the local social work department.  Sherf Cottam agreed and decided to admonish Yorkston on the charge of abandoning the children.  Previously, the court heard that the two children were spotted within the locked vehicle parked at a lay-by on the B1361 at about 5.30pm on August 16 last year.  Fiscal depute Mark Keane said: \u0026ldquoWitnesses were out for a walk and they observed a stationary car in the lay-by and saw two children within the car who very distressed.  \u0026ldquoThe girl was shouting \u0026lsquohelp, save us\u0026rsquo.  When asked where the person looking after her was, the girl pointed to an opening in the trees.  The fiscal added that \u0026ldquothe car was locked and the windows were fully up and it was \u0026ldquoa hot day.  \u0026ldquoThe witnesses became concerned about the children\u0026rsquos welfare and decided to phone the police and stay with the car for about 25 minutes, the fiscal added.  Solicitor Lesley Cunningham, defending, told the court that Yorkston had stopped for a toilet break as he took the children to a McDonald\u0026rsquos restaurant.  Ms Cunningham said that her client had \u0026ldquoan underlying drug problem at the time of the incident which was \u0026ldquonow resolved.  She added: \u0026ldquoMr Yorkston was taking the children to a McDonald\u0026rsquos and stopped by the side of the road for the toilet. He admits now this was foolish in the extreme. Fortunately there was no harm done to the children.  Yorkston admitted to being responsible for two children and wilfully abandoning them by leaving them alone within a locked vehicle while windows were fully closed in hot weather conditions at a lay-by on the B1361 near to Prestonpans on August 16 last year."},{"url":null,"title":"popular-former-musselburgh-church-minister-is-remembered","story":"  The American-born clergyman served Musselburgh Congregational Church, on Links Street, for 41 years after being inducted as its minister in 1968.  A bachelor, he retired to Gford in 2009.

Just two weeks before he died, Mr Lindgren was moved to Herdmanflat Hospital in Haddington until a permanent home could be found but he passed away on July 18.  Mr Lindgren was born in Lynn, Massachusetts, on May 28, 1930 his father Raymond was Swedish and his mother Effie was a Macleod from the isle of Skye.  Mr Lindgren was ordained into church ministry in 1957 at the age of 27, holding a list of degrees including a Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Theology, Master of Theology and PhD.  He was inducted into the Ministry of Genoa Congregational Church in Nebraska, where he served for six years.  With practical experience under his belt, he went on to complete a post-graduate degree at New College Edinburgh before arriving in Musselburgh, where he took an avid interest in community le.  The Rev Janice Andrews, minister at Musselburgh Congregational Church, said: \u0026ldquoHe was one of the longest-serving members of Musselburgh Rotary Club.  \u0026ldquoWhen Musselburgh hosted the district conference he was charged with preaching to 1,000 delegates \u0026ndash an onerous task but members had complete confidence in his ability to speak to such a large audience, he was so very competent.  \u0026ldquoFor over 20 years of his ministry he served as chaplain to the 297 Musselburgh Squadron RAF Air Cadets.  \u0026ldquoHe had a keen interest in antiques and collected old postcards.  \u0026ldquoHe used this collection to publish an illustrated history of the towns and villages of East Lothian and the city of Edinburgh, evidence of his sincere interest in this beautul and historic area of Scotland.

The restricted service was only for general advice, which makes up about a quarter of the total bureau work, but paid staff were still available for case work and outreach services as normal.  Claire said: \u0026ldquoI think a lot of people don\u0026rsquot know that CAB is a volunteer-based charity, so we do rely on volunteers to be on reception, to become general advisers and also some of them do administrative work as well.  She said that volunteers were often people who were retired but wanted to keep mentally active, those who were between jobs and wanted to build new skills, and law students looking for experience.  Claire, who also handles financial capability issues at the CAB, started out as a volunteer adviser.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe always need volunteers, who are the leblood of the CAB.  \u0026ldquoWe have about 30 [volunteers] at the moment and 12 members of staff.  \u0026ldquoWe put a lot into advisers and helping them but not everyone makes it at the other end.  \u0026ldquoAs volunteers they can also take holidays whenever they want or attend appointments but it is important that we get a certain level of commitment.  She added: \u0026ldquoGeneral advisers deal with everything from the dog next door barking too loudly to entitlement to benefits.  \u0026ldquoThey also deal with dismissal cases, as well as helping people to make phone calls and write letters.  \u0026ldquoAround 35 per cent of the cases will be about benefits and about 20 per cent on debt followed by employment, housing, customer and local issues.  The CAB\u0026rsquos other volunteer support officer, Magdalena Szulc, who also began as a volunteer, agreed with her colleague.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe need people who can commit for six to seven hours\u0026rsquo volunteering each week and the training programme, which can take six to eight months.  \u0026ldquoThey also need good listening skills, to work well in teams, be open-minded, don\u0026rsquot judge people or their circumstances and enjoy helping people.

It is set amongst the fields which surround this old former mining village. The graveyard is reached taking a short walk which follows an old rail line. The surviving gravestones are not so old, yet I felt an immediate aura of antiquity as I entered the place.  As I wandered there I knew nothing of its past. I had stumbled upon it during a short walk from the village. I always explore when I get the chance, never knowing what I might find. It seemed neglected and strangely positioned, away from the village and no evidence of a kirk nearby. I assumed it to be connected to nearby Elphinstone Tower.  Yet soon afterwards I discovered that on the north-west of the graveyard there had indeed been a kirk a medieval pre-reformation chapel no less. Its foundations remain buried under the surface, its stones yet to tell its stories.  However, that is just one layer of this graveyard\u0026rsquos history, for it is described as overlying a prehistoric site of \u0026ldquonational importance by Ancient Monuments UK. I had been walking within an ancient fort, possibly as early as the late Bronze Age or early Iron Age. While visible evidence of this is now all gone, I can testy to the aura of antiquity which hangs there. Historic sites are often not just what you can see, but what you can sense and feel.  But the graveyard was not why I was in Elphinstone that day. I had taken a trip to this village to visit Meg\u0026rsquos Chuck. It\u0026rsquos a \u0026lsquobullet stone\u0026rsquo set in the village.  There is more than one story about this stone. One tale tells us that an elf is trapped within it. According to this story the elf was a servant of an Elphinstone witch called Meg.  One day the witch travelled in her carriage to a nearby burn and there had eaten food, refusing to share it with her elves. While she was having a post-scoff snooze, an elf snuck into her carriage and took the leftovers. The angry witch incarcerated the elf within the stone as a punishment.  The primary school have a version of this story painted in the playground and the children there are best to tell that tale! It\u0026rsquos a story which suggests a reason for the village name: \u0026lsquoElf in Stone\u0026rsquo!  But as is often the case, there is also an older folk tale about the stone, mentioned well over 100 years ago by P M\u0026rsquoNeill in his fascinating book of the traditions of the area. In this tale Meg is also the main character. Here is my re-telling of this old story:  The stone which now stands in Elphinstone village once stood by the smiddy. It was owned by a well-kent witch of the village called Meg. She was not the only witch in the area, for she had many friends who were also witches. They were all married women, with heavy domestic duties to perform and little time for themselves during the day.  However, as night fell and their \u0026ldquoauld gude men lay soond asleep at hame, this happy group of witches would meet up at Harry\u0026rsquos Burn, a short distance from the village but far enough away to be out of earshot of a sleeping husband.  Here the sisterhood would have witchy fun and play games. Meg would bring the bullet stone for a game of chuck , a game in which four stones are laid on a surface while one is thrown in the air. The player must pick up all the four stones, then catch the thrown stone as it falls back to the ground.  Perhaps this huge stone was actually the one thrown into the air. After all, they were witches and so a normal game of chuckie would have been a bit mundane. I do not know exactly how heavy it is but it would defeat anyone trying to lt it without magic or machinery.  In fact it would have been a fair challenge to carry from the village to the burn, even for a witch. And that is why Meg didn\u0026rsquot carry it to her liaisons. She used magic, of course. As her husband snored in the house she would creep out to the stone and turn it into a horse. I can visualise her mounting this confused beast in the light of the moon, then riding speedily with joyful laughter towards Harry\u0026rsquos Burn to meet her friends and enjoy the short time of freedom from domestic duties.  There at Harry\u0026rsquos Burn she would dismount and greet her friends. No doubt they all had dferent and novel methods of travel to get to their location: a flying sieve, riding a wolf, even a husband changed into a horse are all possibilities according to the beliefs of the time!  Upon her arrival Meg would lead the horse to the burn to drink. As soon as it had quenched its thirst, Meg changed it back to a stone. And so the heavy stone was successfully transported so the witches could play their game.  Then, when the fun was over, Meg turned the stone back into a horse for the  journey, carefully dismounting at the end of her journey on the same spot by the smiddy, and then transforming the poor creature back into stone.  And so the bullet stone remains in the village after Meg\u0026rsquos final journey. It can be found opposite the primary school and is called Meg\u0026rsquos Chuck. As far as I know it hasn\u0026rsquot been a horse since the last time Meg changed it into one, so it will be desperate for some exercise by now.  There is no reason not to believe that Meg also trapped an elf within the stone, as the later tale suggests. She was, after all, a witch with powerful magic.  So  you sit on it, be careful about the words you mutter. You might just accidentally say the spell that transforms it into a horse, and then you\u0026rsquoll be off on a terryingly wild ride to Harry\u0026rsquos Burn, possibly in the company of a hyperactive and by now very hungry elf.  Or maybe that would be fun! I wonder what the spell was. Maybe the children in the school have an idea?"},{"url":null,"title":"youtube-and-wikipedia-edit-a-thon-event-for-preston-tower","story":"  Dig It!

One of the two reactors at the power station, to the east of the town, is being taken offline.  The programme means hundreds of extra workers will join the 750-strong regular workforce for the maintenance period, known as a \u0026ldquostatutory outage.  Robert Gunn, station director, said: \u0026ldquoIt is Torness Power Station\u0026rsquos 30th birthday this year and this is the 22nd statutory outage we have carried out at the station.  \u0026ldquoWe are very well practised at them and over the years we have built great relationships with the extra workers who come and support us during the outages.  \u0026ldquoThese workers will be staying in local hotels and B\u0026ampBs, eating in the area\u0026rsquos restaurants and using taxi firms.  \u0026ldquoIt is great that our investment in the power station can also benefit our local community just as the peak tourist season is coming to an end.  \u0026ldquoWe carry out maintenance and inspections on the units that generate the electricity all-year-round but a statutory outage gives us the chance to carry out pieces of work that are not possible when the reactor is operating.  Philip Mellor, chairman of Dunbar Trades\u0026rsquo Association  and owner of the Dunmuir Hotel, was delighted with the news.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is very positive news.  \u0026ldquoI am delighted to welcome people to Dunbar and certainly as we move into the quieter season, as the holidaymakers have left, it is the ideal time for EDF to run this type of project.  \u0026ldquoIt will massively benefit the community as a whole.  EDF Energy carries out a statutory outage on each of its reactors once every three years.  These are planned in advance with the National Grid to ensure that there is no impact on the national electricity supply.  The other reactor at Torness is due to continue operating normally throughout the period.  During the outage workers will carry out more than 12,000 separate pieces of work \u0026ndash each carefully planned during the last two years of preparation.  The biggest projects include fitting of additional reactor gas temperature instrumentation, exchange of the turbine intermediate and low-pressure rotors, and replacement of auxiliary cooling water pipework systems.  Torness Power Station\u0026rsquos two nuclear reactors generate enough electricity to power more than two million homes and started operating in 1988.  The station employs more than 500 full-time staff and about 250 full-time contract partners.  Since it opened, Torness has produced enough low-carbon electricity to save the equivalent of 84.8 million tonnes of CO2e  during its 30 years of operation, the same as taking all of the passenger cars off the UK\u0026rsquos roads for more than a year."},{"url":null,"title":"tranent-womans-key-part-in-new-bbc-one-game-show-chase-the-case","story":"  The former Ross High School pupil plays a \u0026ldquofurious security guard in new strategy game Chase the Case, hosted by BBC Breakfast presenter Dan Walker.

Dunbar Cement Plant, which employs more than 140 people and contributes \u0026pound8 million to the local economy each year, has now been given the go-ahead to create a cement mill grinding station, storage silo and ious other facilities.  According to the planning officer\u0026rsquos report: \u0026ldquoIn a supporting statement submitted with the application it is stated that the proposal is part of Tarmac\u0026rsquos long-term internal upgrade and modernisation programme at Dunbar cement works.  \u0026ldquoIt asserts that the cement mill is necessary to produce new grades of cement required for modern construction and the cement market.  \u0026ldquoThe proposed mill will replace two existing mills on the site and will be more energy-efficient and quieter than those existing mills.  \u0026ldquoThe supporting statement also asserts that the cement works benefits from rail sidings on both the south and north side of the East Coast Mainline.  \u0026ldquoTrains run under a load out structure that feeds cement into rail tankers.  \u0026ldquoAt present, trains are fed only on the south side using adjacent silos where train capacity is already fully used.  \u0026ldquoAdditional products must therefore be exported by road.  \u0026ldquoUntil the late 1980s, the northern siding was also fed by a large silo that was dismantled.

As a result, he is also British No. 1 and No. 2 in two weight isions.  Faith, of Tranent, is current Yokkao Scottish Champion, WTKA British Champion, Yokkao Open British K1 Champion, and Celtic Nations Champion and is ranked No. 2 in the UK.  In Italy, the duo will be competing to become both WTKA Muay Thai and K1 world champions.  Scott Hendry founded the club with friend Charles Cameron in 2014, and currently trains both Lewis and Faith.  \"Definitely, we could have two world champions coming back in November,\" he told the Courier.  \"They could come back with both titles which would be a tremendous achievement.\"  Faith\u0027s exploits are all the more impressive considering she has only been in the sport since May 2017.  \"Faith has been pretty remarkable,\" Scott said. \"She\u0027s had eleven fights in the space of a year.  \"She\u0027s won four titles and she\u0027s ranked number two in the UK.  \"She\u0027s fought the girl who is ranked number one four times and beat her three times.  \"I\u0027ve calculated it and she should move to number one by the end of the year.\"  The club, who train in the Bronx Boxing Gym in Tranent, will hold a fundraiser on Sunday.

Speaking about the championship and Olympic approval, Scott said: \"I think its good for the whole of the sport to be honest.  \"That\u0027s a huge thing for the sport, it should open up other avenues for the sport in terms of funding, as well as increase the profile of the sport.\"  There\u0027s definite potential for both Lewis and Faith to become Olympic athletes but Scott knows there is a long road ahead  both want to go pro.  \"Lewis is in a predicament because he\u0027s really good at football as well. He goes across to train in Glasgow every two weeks with the Scotland Youth Development squad.  \"So, there\u0027s a chance Lewis could go into pro football, teams have spoken to him. He\u0027s going to have a choice to make at some point.  \"With Faith, I think  it\u0027s done right she could make a career out of it.  \"There\u0027s avenues she could look at going down, but she\u0027s only 12 so there\u0027s a long way to go just yet.\"  The club has also recently been nominated three times in the Celebrating Sports Awards, held by East Lothian Council.

His determination to clear his name of allegations of sexual impropriety has the potential to tear the Scottish Government and the SNP apart. The two most important politicians in the modern history of Scottish nationalism have been pitted against each other at the very moment the party needs to unite over the future of independence.  We\u0027ve had the extraordinary spectacle of the former First Minister, and SNP leader, conducting a war of legal words over social media with the current First Minister, and SNP leader. In y posts, Nicola Sturgeon defended the anti-sexual harassment procedures she introduced in January, and insisted on fairness for the complainants. Alex Salmond has condemned that due process as an unfair kangaroo court. Worse, he\u0027s accused the Scottish Government of leaking salacious details of the allegations to undermine him. Mr Salmond has even raised an action against the Scottish Government in the Court of Session.  For their part, Scottish Labour say that Nicola Sturgeon should already have suspended her predecessor from the party. That she has failed to follow the precedent set by the expulsion of the former Children\u0026rsquos Minister, Mark Macdonald. No formal complaint been lodged, however, with the SNP that could trigger such a disciplinary procedure. But to the dismay of many members, Ms Sturgeon has pointedly failed to rule out Mr Salmond\u0027s future defenestration. She can\u0027t.  The FM faces an acute dilemma. Under the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos procedures, complaints against former ministers are assessed by the civil service. If the result is problematic it is handed to the First Minister, \u0026ldquoin their capacity as party leader, so that the FM \u0026ldquocan take action to secure the highest standards of behaviour in the current administration. It\u0027s not clear what actions should be taken here, but you can be pretty sure critics will insist that suspension from the party is one of them. The allegations have been serious enough to be handed to the police.  However, the usual resignation argument that a minister cannot do their job properly until they\u0027ve \u0026ldquocleared their name does not apply. Alex Salmond sits in no parliament, holds no senior position in the party and is merely a sometime television presenter.  Labour\u0027s Rhoda Grant called for Mr Salmond to be suspended in order to create \u0026ldquoa safe space for his accusers \u0026ndash the two women who have made complaints. But it\u0027s not at all clear what kind of threat he is supposed to present to these women, or how removing Mr Salmond\u0027s membership card would make the space they occupy any more safe. The implication that Alex Salmond is some kind of crazed sex criminal, who cannot be allowed to walk free, is appalling. He\u0027s been found guilty of no improper conduct whatever.  Of course, the real damage was done by whoever leaked the confidential details of the allegations that he sexually assaulted two women. This vastly increased pressure on the First Minister to suspend Mr Salmond for the duration. He strenuously rejects the allegations and says he\u0027s been denied the right to see the evidence. That\u0027s assuming there is any concrete evidence.  Police and government agencies tend to work nowadays on the supposed Macpherson Principle that \u0026ldquovictims should always be believed, which is sometimes taken to mean that actual evidence is superfluous. Following a succession of miscarriages of justice, the politan Police has now abandoned this inversion of the presumption of innocence, and changed its guidance to say that accusers should be \u0026ldquolistened to rather than their allegations automatically accepted as fact. But it may be too late for Alex Salmond. In politics, you are now guilty until proven innocent. All the parties have tended to suspend politicians when allegations become public.  Many in the SNP are dismayed that Ms Sturgeon did not, at the very least, give her former mentor some kind of positive character reference last week, and then refuse to comment further. The First Minister placed herself at the forefront of the controversy, declaring that she was \u0026ldquo100% behind the Permanent Secretary, Leslie Evans, whom Mr Salmond\u0027s supporters believe has acted as judge and jury. Her remark that the complaints couldn\u0027t be \u0026ldquoswept under the carpet sounded damning.  The unalloyed glee among opposition politicians at what they see as the final humiliation of their greatest former foe is matched in the SNP by a kind of existential despair. It is hard to convey just how important Alex Salmond is to the independence movement. Political journalists and Women for Independence may regard the former leader as a hangover from alpha male politics, but for many ordinary nationalists he has hero status, comparable to that of Charles Stewart Parnell, the 19th century Irish Nationalist with whom Salmond used to compare himself. Unfortunately, that career ended with a sex scandal, too, over Parnell\u0027s adultery.  Irish nationalists always believed that Parnell was brought down by Establishment dirty tricks. There is an unshakeable conviction among many in the SNP that today\u0027s scandal must be,  not the work of M15, then a move by the deep state to silence an influential voice on the eve of a possible announcement of a second independence referendum. Salmond promised in his so-called Morningside Declaration in May to  to front line politics as soon as indyref2 is announced.  But  this is an establishment plot, then the unfortunate reality for Nationalists is that Nicola Sturgeon finds herself at the apex of it. As the new parliamentary term begins she\u0027ll come under intense pressure to suspend Mr Salmond from the party, or be accused of favouritism and hypocrisy. But  Alex Salmond were expelled on the eve of the most crucial SNP conference in years, the consequences would be unimaginable. The SNP has not just been rocked by this development it has been traumatised \u0026ndash and it may never be quite the same again."},{"url":null,"title":"relieve-the-gsa-of-responsibility-for-mackintosh-building-art-experts-suggestion-to-msps","story":"  Currently burnt-out, the Mackintosh Building is still at the heart, and perhaps is the soul, of the art school.  However, should the building, disastrously ruined by fire twice in four years, still be run by the educational institution?  That is the provocative question that will be posed to Members of the Scottish Parliament tomorrow by one of Scotland\u0027s leading Mackintosh experts, the writer and gallerist Roger Billclfe.  Mr Billclfe, a vocal critic of the GSA\u0027s responsibility for, and handling of, the building\u0027s first fire in 2014, has suggested in a submission to MSPs that the GSA should be \"relieved of the responsibility\" of the \u0027Mack\u0027.  He says that by the time the building is rebuilt - which GSA chair Muriel Gray said could take up to six years - it will have not been used as a place of teaching for more than a dozen years.  Billclfe believes that the building should be treated as a \"world class work of art\" and could be used as artist accommodation and for exhibitions.  : The Mackintosh Building will be rebuilt says chair  In the conclusion to his submission he says that, because of the unanswered questions around the 2014 fire, the GSA is \"unfit\" to be a custodian of the building.  Mr Billclfe said: \"Temporary accommodation put in force after the 2014 fire will likely have had to be replaced by more permanent arrangements.  \"This seems to be a suitable time to consider relieving the School of its responsibility for the Mackintosh building - something it is believed to have considered in the 1990s when it offered the building to a government agency - and removing the inherent dangers associated with its occupation by a large body of students.  \"This would remove from the School the apparent burden of running a major \u0026lsquomuseum\u0026rsquo and also satisfy the growing demand for access, particularly after the injection of \u0026pound30m of public, private and charitable donations to restore the building following the 2014 fire.\"  Mr Billclfe, whose latest book is \u0027Charles Rennie Mackintosh and the Art of the Four\u0027, believes the Mackintosh Building, consumed in a blaze for which no cause has yet been established, should be rebuilt from the architect\u0027s plans.  : How the Mack will be remade: Muriel Gray interview  The Committee\u0026nbspis also hearing evidence from Eileen Reid, the former head of widening participation at the school, the architect Malcolm Fraser, and Stuart Robertson, director of the Charles Rennie Mackintosh Society.  The prospect of the GSA giving up their right to the building appears unlikely.  However, there was much anger expressed after the June fire, and how two blazes could have occurred in four years.  The first fire, in 2014, was sparked by an projector igniting some expanded foam being used by a student for a degree show.  Until the police and fire service investigation into the new blaze is complete and published, observers, the public and alumni are in want of reply to questions over cause and responsibility.  : The new Mack will be paid for by insurance and fund raising  A spokesman for the GSA said: \"The Mackintosh Building was commissioned and designed as an art school and GSA is fully committed to it ing as a working art school.\"  In the Herald on Sunday, the chair of the GSA board, Muriel Gray, was adamant the GSA will restore the Mackintosh Building.  Ms Gray said: \"This time it will be built with such knowledge and expertise that we have learned since 2014.  \"We are resolved that the Mackintosh comes back as a working art school, as a major player, a cultural leader for the city and the Scottish economy.\"  She added: \"Imagine the thrill of saying, \u0027We have an architect for this project: who is it? Charles Rennie Mackintosh.\u0027\"  \"The roads lead back to Mackintosh, absolutely and non-negotiably.  \"As far as we are concerned that decision we made in 2014 has just been interrupted.\"  It has been estimated that the cost could be more than \u0026pound100m, but Ms Gray said she hoped this would be met by insurance and a private funding raising initiative, rather than rely on public funds.  : Mackintosh expert on the rebuild at book festival  The building was insured through an Owner Controlled Insurance Programme .  This was held in the name of the GSA and Kier Construction Scotland Limited, which was in charge of the works at the building.  The restoration of the school following the 2014 fire was due to cost \u0026pound49m in total.  A paper for the Committee says that the GSA have \"communicated with donors regarding the 2018 fire and no donor has requested a  of their donation.\""},{"url":null,"title":"lord-steel-says-may-should-call-off-brexit-and-back-peoples-vote","story":"  The Liberal Democrat grandee urged her to accept the process was simply too dficult and damaging and that, she should halt it and call a People\u0026rsquos Vote.

He added: \u0026ldquoIn the words of the popular American song: let\u0026rsquos call the whole thing off.  The former Holyrood Presiding Officer\u0026rsquos remarks came as campaigners for a second EU referendum set out a roadmap to obtain a \"People\u0027s Vote\" giving the public the final say on the outcome of Brexit negotiations.  The People\u0027s Vote report, written by Scottish peer Lord Kerr of Kinlochard, who authored Article 50, suggested the PM could be forced to concede a second referendum by a vote of MPs in Parliament or that she could even decide to call one herself.  And it insisted that the option of staying in the EU \"must be on the ballot paper\".  But Mrs May brushed aside the calls for a second referendum, saying voters had already made their decision.  \"When the referendum took place, we gave people the opportunity to make a choice. They made that choice,\" she declared.  \"This was probably the biggest exercise in democracy in our country\u0027s history. If we were to go back on that vote, it would destroy trust in politicians.  \"My answer to the People\u0027s Vote is that we\u0027ve had the people\u0027s vote - it was the referendum - and now we should deliver on it,\" she added.  The report argues that the March 29 2019 deadline for Brexit could easily be delayed to make time for a vote to be held.  And it warned that politicians would be judged harshly  they denied calls for a People\u0027s Vote on the grounds that it would be too dficult to arrange in the short time remaining.  \"More than two years since the 2016 referendum, a political, economic and possibly constitutional crisis is gathering across the United Kingdom,\" said Lord Kerr, a former head of the diplomatic service.  \"Our view is that the most viable and democratic way of resolving it is to allow the public to have their say on Brexit. To deny them a voice challenges the basic principle of informed consent.\"  And the crossbench peer warned: \"History will not, in our opinion, be kind to any politician who hides behind purely logistical arguments, legalese or arcane parliamentary procedure in order to deny people a vote on the outcome of these Brexit negotiations at such a fragile and crucial moment for our country.\"  With opinion polls regularly finding a majority of voters now think the UK made the wrong decision to leave in 2016, the People\u0027s Vote report said it was not too late to \"think again\" about Brexit.  There was \"no insurmountable political or procedural obstacle\" to putting the two-year Article 50 process on hold to provide time for the necessary legislation and practical arrangements to be put in place for a vote, it argued.  And the report said a decision to dump Brexit now would be \"cost-free\" as the UK could retain its existing EU membership terms, including its budget rebate and exemption from joining the euro - while rejoining years later would require them to be renegotiated from scratch.  Drawn up by a cross-party committee including pro-EU MPs, peers and MEPs from Conservatives, Labour, Liberal Democrats and Greens, the roadmap outlined six possible routes to a fresh referendum but said others may emerge as events develop.  The report explained that  Mrs May secured a deal with Brussels this autumn, MPs could use parliamentary amendments to force a referendum either when voting on the deal itself or on later legislation to implement the withdrawal agreement.  If her deal were rejected by the Commons, it would be up to Speaker John Bercow to decide whether or not to permit MPs to vote on a fresh referendum when the PM faced Parliament to explain her next steps.  Although Mrs May has consistently said that she would not allow a second referendum, the report suggested she might decide that a public vote was the best way to win a mandate for her deal or to escape the \"constitutional crisis\" of no deal.  \"Facing the very real possibility of overseeing a deeply unpopular and potentially disastrous no-deal Brexit, she may decide that the only way to avert this outcome is to put her deal to the public through a People\u0027s Vote,\" suggested the report.  The sixth option of a vote following victory for a pro-referendum party in a snap general election within the next few months was judged \"very unlikely but not inconceivable\".  The roadmap made no recommendation on the question to be asked in any poll, something that would ultimately be a matter for the independent Electoral Commission.  But it said that, for reasons of \"simplicity, speed and clarity\", it was likely that a two-way choice - either \"the Government\u0027s deal versus stay\" or \"no deal versus stay\" - would be preferred over a multiple choice question.  Any vote should not be delayed by arguments over whether to extend the franchise to include 16 and 17-year-olds and expats or tighten social media rules.  But the report said social media companies should be warned they would face tougher regulation in future  they failed to take all actions within their power to prevent abuse of their platforms by campaigns.  David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary, asked how likely a second referendum would be  Parliament willed it, replied: \"Pretty unlikely because most people understand to announce a second referendum would be to invite the European Union to give us the worst deal possible in order to persuade us to stay in.  \"That\u0027s the consequence of a second referendum and is why it\u0027s a very bad idea it\u0027s completely against the national interest.\""},{"url":null,"title":"labour-ends-funding-for-kezia-dugdales-defence-in-wings-over-scotland-defamation-case","story":"  The move, which exposes Kezia Dugdale to potentially signicant costs, has been seen by some of her fellow MSPs as a \u0026ldquobetrayal and \u0026ldquofactionalism by her pro-Corbyn enemies.  Mr Campbell, 50, who runs the nationalist Wings Over Scotland website from his home in Bath, is suing Ms Dugdale for \u0026pound25,000 in a defamation action started last November.  It followed the Lothians MSP accusing him in her Daily Record column of making a homophobic remark about gay Scottish Secretary David Mundell.  Mr Campbell had said Mr Mundell\u0026rsquos son, the Tory MSP Oliver Mundell, was \u0026ldquothe sort of public speaker that makes you wish his dad had embraced his homosexuality sooner\".  In her column, Ms Dugdale said she was \u0026ldquoshocked and appalled to see a pro-independence blogger\u0027s homophobic tweets - Mr Campbell vigorously denies homophobia.  Until now, the UK labour party in London has bankrolled all of Ms Dugdale\u0026rsquos legal support, paying for a QC and an advocate to conduct her defence at Edinburgh Sherf Court.  The costs so far are understand to be close to \u0026pound100,000.  However, to the shock of Ms Dugdale and many other Labour MSPs, the UK party has now ended the arrangement, leaving Ms Dugdale to fend for herself.  Although the party will bear all of Ms Dugdale\u0026rsquos costs to date, it will not pay for any more legal counsel or any damages and costs  she loses.  It is understood UK Labour, which raised \u0026pound56m last year, did not tell Ms Dugdale directly of its decision, but informed her lawyers that it was no longer standing behind her case.  Ms Dugdale, 37, who was Scottish Labour leader from 2015 to 2017, opposed Jeremy Corby becoming UK leader, earning the lasting resentment of his supporters, who now dominate the party apparatus.  As the publisher of Ms Dugdale\u0026rsquos column, it is understood the Daily Record may now supply Ms Dugdale with legal support for the rest of the case.  However any help would not extend to damages and costs  Mr Campbell won his case.  Earlier this month, Sherf Kenneth McGowan refused Ms Dugdale\u0026rsquos request to have the action thrown out and agreed to proceed to an evidential hearing.  Ms Dugdale had been on the point of appealing that decision when UK Labour withdrew its support, forcing her to scramble to lodge the appeal.  Ms Dugdale\u0026rsquos spokesman said: \u0026ldquoGiven the principles on which it was founded - equality, fairness and justice - the UK Labour Party wholeheartedly committed to paying all legal costs associated with this case from start to finish.  \u0026ldquoIt is very much hoped that all promises will be kept.  UK Labour said: \u0026ldquoIt would be inappropriate to comment on a live, ongoing legal case.  Mr Campbell declined to comment."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-government-loses-vote-on-p1-assessments","story":"  Holyrood voted 63 to 61 to pause and review tests for P1 pupils, after complaints from teachers about them being of little value, and parents reporting\u0026nbspchildren in tears.  The SNP government has promoted the standardised national assessments as a key tool to gather information about P1 children\u0026rsquos abilities and to fine tune their teaching.  The vote is not binding on the government, but was a blow to Mr Swinney\u0026rsquos reputation as Education Secretary, and a sign the opposition could embed it in law at a later date.  The decision saw the Greens, Labour and LibDems line up with the Tories while only the SNP voted for a continuation of the computer-based literacy and numeracy tests.  The government defeat came just three months after Mr Swinney was forced to shelve his flagship Education Bill because teachers and other parties would not support the reforms.  The Tory-led manoeuvre followed an often bad-tempered debate in which Mr Swinney and other SNP MSPs accused the Conservatives of rank hypocrisy and political opportunism.  Ruth Davidson\u0026rsquos party had previously advocated standardised tests at P1 and endorsed the government\u0026rsquos use of them in its 2016 Holyrood manesto.  Tory education spokeswoman said her party had been wrong in the past.  \u0026ldquoWe made a mistake about P1, she said, adding her party remained in favour of assessments at P4, P7 and S3.  She told the Education Secretary: \u0026ldquoI think the time has come, because of the evidence that has been piling up over the last two years, to call a halt, reconsider the evidence that is very much before us and evaluate what is the best way of progressing P1 pupils.\"  Mr Swinney said he was \u0026ldquoappalled by the Conservative Party and accused it of \u0026ldquodeceit.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe Conservatives are playing politics with the education of our children and we will not play along \u0026nbspwith them.  He defended the assessments as an essential part of a good education system, an integral part of effective teaching and learning, and part of \u0026ldquonormal classwork that took little time.  After the vote, other parties demanded the SNP respect the will of parliament, something ministers have repeatedly told Westminster to do on constitutional issues.  Ms Smith said: \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Parliament has voted decisively on this matter, and now the SNP government must act on that. The nationalists have ignored the evidence on this for quite some time, but they can\u0026rsquot afford to any longer.  \u0026ldquoThese tests need to be halted, and the evidence re-examined. The SNP is always talking about how important the Scottish Parliament is and how its will must be respected.  \u0026ldquoThis is the perfect chance for the SNP to do just that.  Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard used a point of order immediately after the vote to demand the government respect the outcome.  He said: \u0026ldquoTeachers told this government that these tests were useless, ministers ignored them. Parents told this government that they do not trust these tests, ministers ignored them.  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Parliament has now voted to scrap these tests and SNP ministers must not now ignore the will of Parliament. The Government must therefore bring forward immediate plans for how it will respond to this evening\u0026rsquos vote as a matter of urgency.  Green education spokesman Ross Greer said: \u0026ldquoWhat\u0026rsquos truly shocking about the introduction of these standardised tests is that all the issues highlighted by Greens and others were already well known when the SNP decided to press ahead.  \u0026ldquoMembers of the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos own International Council of Education Experts have been at the forefront of these criticisms and ministers still cannot explain why they would ignore their own experts, never mind the voices of a majority of Scotland\u0026rsquos teachers.  \u0026ldquoNow a majority in the Scottish Parliament have joined the calls to scrap these tests for four and five year olds and in a fit of arrogance, the government seems set to ignore our decision.  \u0026ldquoThe concerns that Greens have raised are not limited to the P1 tests. The whole concept of standardised testing does more harm than good to our young people. John Swinney should follow the evidence, accept the will of parliament and scrap the tests immediately.  But SNP MSP Gordon MacDonald said all the opposition parties were \u0026ldquoguilty of the most appalling hypocrisy for siding with the Tories to score political points.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government introduced p1 assessments because they are a tool we need to track kids\u0026rsquo progress and help drive up standards in our schools.  \u0026ldquoThe Tories put standardised P1 assessments in their manesto the majority of Tory-run councils across Scotland already assessed kids from P1 so did Labour and the Lib Dems.  \u0026ldquoLabour and the Lib Dems have sided with the Tories in their political gamesmanship, and sought to prey on the anxieties of parents, just to grab a headline.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos depressing that they all stood willing to do so at the expense of kids\u0026rsquo education.  \u0026ldquoWhen it comes to educating our young people, we should be united in an ambition to drive up standards \u0026ndash not exploiting these issues for political gain.  Sue Palmer, chair of the educational charity Upstart, which promoted a boycott of the assessments, said: \u0026ldquoThe opposition parties made many cogent arguments against the P1 testing and it\u0026rsquos very disappointing that the Scottish government isn\u0026rsquot prepared to listen to them.  \u0026ldquoWe at Upstart Scotland are particularly pleased that one of the closing speeches against the tests mentioned the long-term implications of beginning testing at such an early age in terms of children\u0026rsquos social and emotional development. \u0026nbsp  \u0026ldquoThere is growing evidence that the decline of self-directed play  coupled with an early focus on teaching specic academic skills is helping to fuel mental health problems among children and young people.    \u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"new-details-of-45m-loan-to-firm-owned-by-fms-adviser","story":"  The Herald has learned the first \u0026pound15m tranche was given to Ferguson Marine Engineering Ltd, the last commercial shipyard on the Clyde, because it was\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoexperiencing cash flow challenges.  The problem was caused by cost overruns on a \u0026pound97m government contract for two CalMac ferries which have been beset by delays.  Ferguson\u0026rsquos is part of the Clyde Blowers empire owned by Monaco-based Jim McColl, who sits on the First Minister\u0026rsquos Council of Economic Advisers.  Finance Secretary Derek Mackay learned of the cash flow issue in July 2017 and the loan was made last September, but he did not tell Holyrood\u0026rsquos finance committee until seven months later, when he sent a confidential letter referring to the trouble.  Until last week, there was no public record of the loan due to \u0026ldquocommercial confidentiality.  In June, Mr Mackay announced a further \u0026pound30m loan to Ferguson\u0026rsquos to help it \u0026ldquoersy. However records seen by the Herald cast doubt on whether this will ever be repaid.  The loan would not be repaid in a crisis until Ferguson\u0026rsquos insurance company, HCCI, was paid what it was owed first, as it is the first-ranked creditor.  Tory MSP Jamie Greene said: \u0026ldquoThe SNP have been anything but transparent. It took Derek Mackay over seven months to alert the Finance Committee about the first loan, and there are still huge question marks over the details.  \u0026ldquoHe then changed his story on what the money was for, saying that instead of ersication as first claimed, it was to plug a hole in the ferry contracts.  \u0026ldquoThis deal has been shrouded in secrecy. It\u0026rsquos not good enough for MSPs to go months in the dark - the SNP need to come clean and finally provide all the information surrounding these loans.  The government said thorough due diligence was carried out by officials and external advisers before the loans were provided on fully commercial terms designed to enhance the future prospects of the business and generate a commercial rate of ."},{"url":null,"title":"john-swinney-to-proceed-until-apprehended-on-p1-testing","story":"  All the indications are the Education Secretary does not consider the Holyrood defeat on P1 assessments sufficient to arrest his plans, advising schools to continue for now.  Opposition parties argue Mr Swinney must obey the will of parliament, but voting figures of 63 to 61 show how close the decision was.  It was exactly this ergence of opinion that Mr Swinney faced when he addressed an audience of educational professionals at the Scottish Learning Festival in Glasgow on the morning of the vote.  As Storm Ali began to make itself heard around the auditorium of the SEC Centre, the minister would have expected a buffeting on testing as the audience of teachers, heads and other educational professionals were invited to ask questions.  It did not start well. A teacher from a primary school in Galashiels, in the Scottish Borders, said her experience of P1 testing was that they were not working.  \u0026ldquoThey are actually a huge waste of time and money in the way they are being enforced in primary schools, she said.  \u0026ldquoIt is not that I have an objection in principle to the idea of standardised assessments, but what I am seeing in practice is that they don\u0026rsquot work, they are not suitable and my colleagues around me feel exactly the same way.  \u0026ldquoThere is a widespread feeling in Scottish primary schools that they are not fit for purpose.  As Mr Swinney scribbled hastily into his notebook in preparation for a dficult answer, a headteacher from another primary school came to his rescue.  \u0026ldquoWe did not find any level of stress at all and the primary one children actually quite enjoyed taking part, she said.  \u0026ldquoIn terms of the feedback we found them to be extremely helpful. We had a small group of boys that I think we had the wrong measure of when it came down to teacher judgement and it changed how we looked at the support they needed. I think we had underestimated them.  \u0026ldquoThe depth of feedback and the quality of feedback the assessments gave us really helped those children.  Mr Swinney said the contrasting remarks illustrated the ergence of opinion on the benefits of the assessments for five-year-olds.  But what he was at pains to stress to the audience was his belief in the quality of feedback they could provide.  He said: \u0026ldquoWhat literally drew an intake of breath from a group of teachers who went through the assessments with me was when they saw the diagnostic information and the way it was presented.  \u0026ldquoIt marshalled some of the strengths and the challenges that young people face and the purpose of standardised assessments is to make sure we are able to learn from what the experience of young people has been, what their challenges are and then to do something about it.  \u0026ldquoThe attainment gap exists when young people come into formal education and the challenge is to try and narrow that as quickly as we possibly can which is why I take the view that P1 assessments are helpful in that respect.  Lurking in the audience to hijack the Education Secretary further on assessments was Larry Flanagan, general secretary of the Educational Institute of Scotland teaching union.  Mr Flanagan, whose union has backed a campaign to encourage parents to opt out of P1 testing, raised the issue of councils who blanket test pupils, rather than allowing inidual teachers to decide - a phenomenon blamed for greater levels of pupil stress.  Mr Flanagan said: \u0026ldquoA set of guidelines was produced, one of which was that teachers would control when these assessments were done.  \u0026ldquoWe know that 25 out of 32 local authorities breached that guideline and instructed teachers when to carry out the assessments.  With a nod to his past as a secondary school English teacher, Mr Flanagan then drew on the words of Hamlet to ask: \u0026ldquoSo in terms of empowerment, there\u0026rsquos the rub. How do we turn rhetoric around professional autonomy into a reality?  Mr Swinney conceded that he did not agree with Mr Flanagan on many things, and also expressed mock surprise the union leader had not taken the opportunity to raise the ongoing issue of pay.  But Mr Flanagan did get a concession from the minister on the need to ensure the guidance was being followed.  Mr Swinney said: \u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot always say this, but I agree with Larry Flanagan. The guidance is clear that teachers should choose at what point it is appropriate to undertake the assessments and that should be respected and I will pursue that in my discussion with local authorities."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-tells-eu-leaders-in-salzburg-chequers-is-only-credible-plan-on-the-table","story":"  As the Prime Minister promoted her compromise proposals over dinner with fellow European leaders at an informal summit in Salzburg, Carwyn Jones, the Welsh First Minister, intervened, arguing that  Holyrood and Cardf were to oppose the final Brexit deal, then there should be a general election, which could eventually lead to another EU referendum.  \"The next step is to see whether a deal can be supported by, for me, parliaments plural: Westminster Edinburgh and Cardf. If that doesn\u0027t happen, then I don\u0027t see any alternative other than a general election where Brexit would be the main issue.  The Bridgend AM added that  there were an inconclusive result at an election, then there would be \u0026ldquopotential for a second referendum\".  When asked  the Scottish Government agreed with Mr Jones\u0026rsquos point about a potential general election, a spokesman for Michael Russell, the Constitutional Affairs Secretary, replied: \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Parliament has already rejected Brexit and we will make sure that Holyrood has the chance to continue to make its voice heard as the Tories drag us close to the clf edge of a no-deal or a blind Brexit.  \u0026ldquoIt simply should not come down to a choice between those options: the catastrophic or the merely disastrous, he added.  Before the Salzburg dinner began at the Felsenreitschule - the theatre made famous by the von Trapp family in the film The Sound of Music \u0026ndash Mrs May insisted her Brexit blueprint was \"the only credible and negotiable plan on the table that delivers no hard border in Northern Ireland and also delivers on the vote of the British people\".  She stressed: \"If we are going to achieve a successful conclusion then, just as the UK has evolved its position, the EU will need to evolve its position too.\"  But ahead of the dinner Donald Tusk, the European Council President, made clear the UK\u0026rsquos Brexit plans needed to be \"reworked\".  Announcing a special EU summit in mid-November \u0026ndash which will set the scene for signing any Brexit agreement \u0026ndash Mr Tusk said that while there was \u0026ldquomore hope a deal would be done, there was \u0026ldquoless time in which to do it.  Today, David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary in a speech in Munich will insist the Chequers Plan was \u0026ldquoalways a non-starter and he and his fellow Brexiteers would \u0026ldquoshortly be presenting an alternative plan which will outline a more ambitious vision\".  On her arrival in Austria, the PM welcomed how Michel Barnier, the EU\u0026rsquos chief negotiator, had recognised his original plan for the Irish border was unworkable and had sought to come up with an \u0026ldquoimproved solution. But Whitehall sources made clear that the private suggestions about Brussels\u0027s new proposals were unacceptable as they still did not drop the view that Northern Ireland could be treated as a separate customs jurisdiction from the rest of the UK.  Mrs May stressed: \u0026ldquoWhat we cannot accept is seeing Northern Ireland carved away from the UK customs territory because, regardless of where the checks would be, what that would mean would be that it would be a challenge to our constitutional and economic integrity.\"  She also decried \u0026ldquoprominent Labour members like the Mayor of London, who were now trying to take Britain \u0026ldquoback to square one with support for a People\u0026rsquos Vote on Brexit.  \"I want to be absolutely clear, this government will never accept a second referendum, declared the PM, adding: \"We held a People\u0027s Vote it was the referendum in 2016.  \u0026ldquoPeople voted to leave the European Union, it is now a matter of trust in politicians that we should deliver on the vote of the British people,\" she added.  Earlier, Lord Steel, the former Liberal leader, urged the PM to make a television broadcast to call off Brexit and announce a second referendum.  \u0026ldquoIn the words of the popular American song, he added, \u0026ldquolet\u0026rsquos call the whole thing off.  The intervention by the former Holyrood Presiding Office came after a People\u0027s Vote report, written by fellow Scottish peer Lord Kerr of Kinlochard, who authored Article 50, suggested Mrs May could be forced to concede a second referendum by a vote of MPs or that she could even decide to call one herself. It stressed the option of staying in the EU \"must be on the ballot paper\"."},{"url":null,"title":"uk-govt-criticised-for-not-using-majority-share-holding-to-halt-rbs-branch-closures","story":"  The cross-party Scottish Affairs Committee had urged the UK Government that,  the bank did not act on its recommendation to stop the closures, then  should \u0026ldquouse any influence that its majority shareholding provides to apply pressure on RBS to reconsider the closure programme.  But the Government declined to do so, declaring: \u0026ldquoGovernments should not be in the business of owning banks nor should they intervene in the commercial, operational or management decisions of business.  Such decisions, it argued, were rightly the responsibility of boards and management teams, who were \u0026ldquobest placed to set strategy and commercial direction and to make day-to-day management decisions.  Last December, RBS announced it would shut a total of 62 branches north of the border but later ten of them were given a stay of execution until at least the end of this year, pending a review.  Committee member Danielle Rowley, the Scottish Labour MP for Midlothian, said the Government\u0026rsquos response was disappointing and showed it continued to \u0026ldquowash its hands of branch closures.  \u0026ldquoBut  it continues with its stated aim to  RBS to private ownership without making a strategic intervention to solve this problem, taxpayers will rightly ask what good their investment did beyond the initial emergency bailout, she said.  Ms Rowley accused the Government of being \"wedded to their dogma that the state has no role in the commercial banking sector, and claimed the Tories were missing a golden opportunity to make a positive dference and support communities across Scotland.  Noting how in her own constituency Bonnyrigg had lost the last bank on the high street and was now facing the prospect of losing its Post Office too, the backbencher added: \u0026ldquoThe evidence gathered by the committee was clear and our recommendations were reasonable. It is unfortunate that the Government has chosen to bury its head in the sand.\"  In 2008 following the financial crash, the taxpayer bailed out RBS to the tune of \u0026pound45 billion.  In June when the Government sold off another tranche of shares \u0026ndash at a loss of \u0026pound2.1bn \u0026ndash the public stake in the bank fell from 70.1 per cent to 62.4. The sale raised \u0026pound2.5bn.  The Government has said it intends to sell \u0026pound15bn-worth of RBS shares by 2023. The overall loss to the taxpayer is set to be around \u0026pound26bn.  In February, the bank reported an annual profit of \u0026pound752 million its first for a decade and a sharp turnaround from the \u0026pound6.95bn loss seen the previous year."},{"url":null,"title":"hogmanay-sends-a-forget-me-not-love-letter-to-the-eu-and-the-world","story":"  The famous quote did come to mind when I spoke to Charlie Wood and Ed Bartlam this week about their European-themed Hogmanay celebrations.  Hamlet being a European tragedy, perhaps it was apt.  Both Wood and Bartlam, who as Underbelly are once again planning the three-day Hogmanay event, said that the European focus of this year\u0026rsquos celebrastion - a \u0026lsquolove letter\u0026rsquo in fact - is not a lament for Brexit, or a last, and loving, farewell to Scotland being part of the EU.  Mr Wood noted, accurately, of course, that the British islands are in Europe, geographically and culturally, whether anyone likes it or not. He says the focus is purely a apolitical one.  Well. Whether you believe that or not  this notably yearning Hogmanay theme - which involves noted writers in a series of commissions, musicians, and others - however, cannot be seen separately from our context, the prospect of the UK leaving the EU. Why else send a \u0026lsquoforget me not\u0026rsquo love letter?  It is fair to say that much of the cultural world is viewing Brexit with, as with the majority of Scots, alarm, consternation and dismay.  Mr Wood and Mr Bartlam, who are successful venue operators at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, know this.

Ms Sturgeon has written to opposition leaders in London, arguing that  the UK failed to agree a deal with the EU, the timetable for talks must be extended.  The SNP leader said: \"It\u0027s time for everyone in the UK political establishment to wake up to the reality of what now faces us.  \"If the choice we face is between no-deal and no detail, then an extension to the Article 50 negotiation period must be on the table as the only way to avoid an economic clf edge, and allow all alternative options to be considered.\"  At a dinner with fellow European leaders in Salzburg, Austria, on Wednesday night, Mrs May continued to argue her Chequers proposals were the only credible route to a deal.  The PM\u0027s message was that while the time for an agreement to be reached was now short, \"delaying or extending these negotiations is not an option\", according to a senior UK official.  Mrs May has been adamant that there will be no second referendum on Brexit nor any extension to Article 50 ie Britain will leave the EU on March 29 next year.  But the FM insisted it \"seems increasingly likely\" that the statement setting out the future relationship between the UK and the EU \"will be vague and lacking in meaningful detail\".  \"The Tory Government has been busy trying to paint Brexit as a choice between a no-deal Brexit and the inadequate Chequers proposal, but in reality that is a false dichotomy thanks to their incompetence, infighting and indecision, it seems increasingly likely that the choice will be between a no-deal Brexit and a blind Brexit.  \"Both options are unpalatable and completely unacceptable, declared Ms Sturgeon.  \"A no-deal Brexit will, by the UK Government\u0027s own admission, lead to dire economic consequences and a shortage of medicines and foodstuffs.  \"Meanwhile, a blind Brexit will simply kick all of the dficult decisions into the long grass - but with the UK already out of the EU.  \"Not only would that continue the uncertainty, it would be tantamount to stepping off a clf edge blindfolded, with no idea of what the landing place will be.\"  Ms Sturgeon added: \"Even at this late stage, Theresa May can escape the corner into which she has boxed herself.

The Guild managed to secure support from new sources and instead of planning on building new facilities upwards, they looked towards expanding outwards. Adjacent buildings were purchased, and renovation work began in 2014, completed by the end of 2015. The newly refurbished building includes several new spaces while maintaining many of the historic features, ushering Scotland\u0026rsquos oldest theatre into the 21st Century.  Attend one of the touring productions presented throughout the year, which includes live music, stand-up comedy and theatrical dramas. The Guild of Players presents a regular season of four shows, as well as a family-friendly Christmas pantomime.

Yesterday a panel of Mackintosh experts, including Roger Billclfe, the gallerist and writer, and Stuart Robertson, director of the Charles Rennie Mackintosh Society, gave evidence to Holyrood\u0026rsquos Culture Committee.  They said the Mackintosh Building, destroyed in the second of two fires in four years, should be rebuilt and an expert panel should be established to oversee the task.  : Why Glasgow\u0027s patience on the Mack is wearing thin  However Sandra White, MSP for Glasgow Kelvin, said the GSA board, whose chair Muriel Gray vowed this week to rebuild the world-famous building, appeared \u0026ldquonot fit for purpose.  She said: \u0026ldquoI think it is criminal it has happened twice and I want that on record...as far as I am concerned, no lessons have been learned from the 2014 fire.  Ms White added: \u0026ldquoDo you think the board is fit for purpose? And should the iconic building be taken under public control, and out of the hands of the board? Because from what I have seen there is a lack of transparency, no communication with the local community at all, I don\u0026rsquot think they are fit for purpose.  Mr Billclfe, whose written evidence suggest the Mackintosh Building should be taken out of the GSA\u0026rsquos control, said the building was a \u0026ldquofire trap waiting to happen before the first conflagration in 2014.  : Why the Mack shall be rebuilt, by Muriel Gray  He said: \u0026ldquoThe staff are still there that were responsible for it.  \u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot want to send them to prison but I want to make sure that they don\u0026rsquot operate a system where they can do it again.  A former senior employee at the art school, Eileen Reid, said anyone that worked in the school before the first blaze knew it was a fire risk.  \u0026ldquoWe all knew it. We used to talk about how many minutes we would have to get out, she said.  \u0026ldquoOf course I was concerned about the iconic building but there was a risk to le too.  She questioned why an immediate investigation into fire risk management was not carried out after it \u0026ldquofailed in 2014 fire, adding: \u0026ldquoI do think it was systemic.  Malcolm Fraser, the architect, said the cause of the second blaze could be partially the failure of statutory oversight.  : How the Mack will be rebuilt, by GSA chair  Mr Robertson said it would be tragedy  the building was lost forever.  \u0026ldquoYou wouldn\u0026rsquot build student flats on top of Edinburgh Castle  it burnt down, he said.  \u0026ldquoFor it to disappear would be a tragedy and it would show that Scotland doesn\u0026rsquot care about culture.  Speaking after the meeting, committee convener Joan McAlpine said: \u0026ldquoWe heard today that there were systemic failures in managing risk in the Mackintosh Building.  \u0026ldquoThe committee will be taking further evidence, including inviting representatives from the Glasgow School of Art, in order to bring greater transparency and clarity to this issue.  \u0026ldquoWhile it is for expert investigators to tell us the cause of the fire, there are wider issues about the conservation and custodianship of Mackintosh\u0026rsquos building and artworks and we believe as a committee it is right that we shine a light on these matters.  : \u0027Relieve the GSA of the Mack\u0027 says expert  Culture committee member and Green MSP Ross Greer added: \u0026ldquoNot only is the GSA in receipt of huge amounts of public money, it was the custodian of the jewel in Scotland\u0026rsquos architectural crown.  \u0026ldquoWe need an end to the secrecy and smoke and mirrors.  \u0026ldquoAbsolute clarity needs to be provided on their involvement in the site in the lead up to the second fire.  \u0026ldquoThis tragic saga raises real concerns over whether the School of Art would be a fit and proper custodian of a rebuilt and refurbished Mack.  A spokesman for the Glasgow School of Art said: \u0026ldquoParliamentary Committees invite iniduals and organisations with an interest in a subject to contribute to a process of information gathering, and the four witnesses who took part into today\u0026rsquos hearing have shared their particular perspectives.  \u0026ldquoWe anticipate being to be invited to participate in a future hearing as part of the process of enabling the panel to achieve its stated aim of ascertaining how we got to the current position and what lessons were learned."},{"url":null,"title":"jeremy-corbyn-does-not-rule-out-approving-indyref2-if-he-becomes-pm","story":"  The Labour leader made clear that he would \"decide at the time\" what to do  Nicola Sturgeon asked for his consent to hold another poll.  However, he stressed that his party did not want a referendum and would be \"very clear on why we don\u0027t think it\u0027s a good idea\".  In 2017, Mr Corbyn sparked controversy when he suggested that  Holyrood voted for another vote on Scotland\u0026rsquos future, as it did in March of that year, then it should not be blocked. \u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot think it\u0026rsquos the job of Westminster or the Labour Party to prevent people holding referenda, he said.  But before the last Holyrood election Labour gave a \"cast-iron guarantee\" that it would oppose another referendum.  In an interview with BBC Scotland ahead of this weekend\u0026rsquos start to the Labour conference, Mr Corbyn was asked what he would do  the First Minister, asked for the power to hold another vote on independence Westminster\u0027s consent would be need  any referendum were to be legally binding.  He replied: \"We would obviously decide at the time.\"  Pointing to the \u0026pound13 billion budget deficit in Scotland, the party leader said a Labour government would invest money in Scotland through a \u0026pound20bn transformation fund and a \u0026pound3bn increase in revenue spending.  \"Things will be very dferent in Scotland with an ally in Westminster like a Labour government,\" he declared.  When he was asked whether he was ruling out giving Ms Sturgeon consent for a referendum to be held, Mr Corbyn replied: \"I\u0027m not ruling[it] out I\u0027m just pointing out the reality.  \"We don\u0027t want another referendum, we don\u0027t think another referendum is a good idea and we\u0027ll be very clear on why we don\u0027t think it\u0027s a good idea.  \u0026ldquoWhat\u0027s more important is dealing with child poverty, housing problems and lack of investment in Scotland 200,000 more children going into poverty has to be dealt with. A referendum will not solve that.\"  The Scottish Labour manesto at the 2016 Holyrood election said: \u0026ldquoWe rule out another referendum on independence during the letime of the next Parliament.  At the general election a year later, then Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale also gave a \u0026ldquocast iron guarantee that Labour would oppose a second referendum, saying independence would lead to \u0026ldquoturbo charged austerity.  The Scottish Tories said Labour looked \u0026ldquoutterly weak on the constitutional question.  Adam Tomkins, the Scottish Conservative constitution spokesman, said: \u0026ldquoEvery time Jeremy Corbyn talks about Scotland he gives yet another concession to the SNP.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos more proof that Labour are utterly weak when it comes to Scotland\u0026rsquos place in the UK. Jeremy Corbyn does not care about Scotland and has no interest in standing up to the Nationalists, as this latest gaffe proves, he added.  Willie Rennie, the Scottish Liberal Democrat leader, said: \u0026ldquoThis is an extraordinary opinion from Jeremy Corbyn. So many people with moderate and progressive views will be horried by this careless attitude towards the UK. Liberal Democrats are opposed to independence and opposed to another isive independence referendum.\"  He added: \"The case against independence is even stronger since the SNP\u0026rsquos Growth Commission admitted what we said about independence in 2014 was right. Brexit also shows that breaking up long standing unions is costly and hard to do.  Ms Sturgeon is expected to make an announcement on her plans for a future vote on Scotland\u0026rsquos future once the terms of any Brexit deal become clear, which means probably some time in November.  SNP depute leader Keith Brown said:\u0026nbsp\"We already have the democratic mandate to give the people of Scotland a choice over their future \u0026ndash a position backed by the Scottish Parliament. For any Prime Minister to stand in the way of that would be a democratic outrage.  \"Of course, it used to be the case that Labour thought the people of Scotland were sovereign and should determine their own future. Now, apparently, it\u0026rsquos down to the whim of the MP for Islington North.\"  A Scottish Labour spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoLike the majority of the people of Scotland, Jeremy Corbyn doesn\u0027t want to see a second referendum.  \"Jeremy is clear that independence is not in the interests of Scotland and the Scottish people and would lead to intensied and prolonged austerity something even the SNP Growth Commission now recognises.  \u0026ldquoThe real ide in Scotland is between the richest and the poorest - not the false ision created by another referendum.\""},{"url":null,"title":"analysis-theresa-may-stumbles-in-salzburg-as-eu27-says-chequers-plan-unworkable","story":"  Eyes jumping from side to side, nostrils flaring and hands gesticulating, the Prime Minister was screaming inside. Her frustration at trying to square the seemingly impossible Brussels circle was clear for all to see.  Perspiring in a sultry press conference room, Theresa May could not hid her anger following the \u0026ldquofrank exchanges she had had minutes earlier with Donald Tusk, the leader of the EU leaders, who publicly and coolly delivered the last rites to her Chequers Plan.  UK diplomatic sources had expected a bust-up but thought it would come at the October 18/19 European Council. The breakdown now at least gives the UK negotiators more time before the very final deadline of mid-November.  The Prime Minister confirmed that the UK was building up a new proposal to unblock the logjam on the Irish border issue.  It is thought this would entail having \u0026ldquoregulatory checks at Irish Sea ports these are technically dferent but similar to customs checks. Such checks already exist between Northern Ireland and the British mainland in regard to agricultural products.  The hope must be with this suggestion and the EU\u0026rsquos pledge to \u0026ldquode-dramatise its own backstop plan, there is a chance that they could meet somewhere in the middle to prevent a hard border with Ireland and avoid a no-deal Brexit.  Yet the key will be not just whether Brussels can accept what many would regard a fudge but also whether the Democratic Unionists, who just so happen provide the PM with her Commons majority, will be able to do so.  The Salzburg rejection now leaves Mrs May looking bruised and battered, seeking friends where few can be found for her compromise. Brexiteers hate it, Remainers hate it, Brussels hates it.  And the timing could not be worse.  In just over a week\u0026rsquos time the Tories gather in Birmingham for what one MP helpfully dubbed a \u0026ldquoBrexit bloodbath.  Various colleagues will be \u0026ldquoon manoeuvres, sensing the smell of political blood, not least Boris Johnson, who has his Chuck Chequers rally before the party leader gives her keynote speech.  Her aides will be making sure there will be plenty of water and cough toffees on the lectern and, instead of letters on the backdrop, there will be a projected message.  If the Maybot can survive the Tory turmoil in Birmingham, there will be just two weeks to reset her plan to try to get the EU27 on board.  Of course, it may be that the old political rouse is being worked here: make things look so desperately bad that when victory is seized from the jaws of defeat at the last moment, the sense of achievement and relief is all the greater.  Or, it could be as bad as it looks."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8713295.jpg?type=article-full","title":"jeremy-corbyn-backed-petition-to-save-one-of-edinburghs-historic-streets-finally-accepted","story":"  The Save Leith Walk campaign was launched to fight plans for a \u0026pound50 million redevelopment which the group says\u0026nbspignores the historical signicance of the street.

ISGD will provide businesses with the chance to shape their own event around the day.The Gin Cooperative Co-Founder Natalie Reid said: “Scotland as a food and drink producing country is seen as a benchmark for quality, so we wanted to create a day that celebrates Scottish Gin that’s distilled in Scotland and promoted as being Scottish with co-ordinated events with gin makers, bars and more.“It’s also a fantastic chance for some of Scotland’s food \u0026amp drink agencies, tourist agencies and businesses dedicated to promoting Scotland to play their own unique part in the story of Scottish Gin.”“We view International Scottish Gin Day as a unique opportunity that can bring commercial benefits to the many great bars, restaurants and bottle shops not just here in Scotland but across the rest of the UK and further afield.”                                                                                                        The Gin Cooperative was established earlier this year by Natalie along with her husband Martin.The business works with Scottish Gin Makers to tell their story and the broader story of Scottish Gin to consumers across the world.Natalie explained: “We currently have the world’s largest Scottish Gin directory and the world’s largest dedicated Scottish Gin website.“As a business, The Gin Cooperative promotes the story of Scottish Gin with the support of Scottish Gin makers who have a listing on our directory.                                                                                                        “We currently feature over 190 inidually profiled Scottish Gins with more being added every few weeks.“From day one, one of the objectives of the business was to establish a day that would provide the opportunity to showcase how fantastic Scottish Gin really is to a global audience.”                                                                    "},{"url":null,"title":"scotland s military band is heading for aberdeen","story":"        Scotland\u0026#8217s best-known military band is in the midst of its first-ever national tour \u0026#8211 and is set perform in Aberdeen at the end of the month.                 The Band of The Royal Regiment of Scotland is performing at venues across the country as part of its ‘Walking with Heroes’ centenary tour which is aiming to raise tens of thousands of pounds for Armed Forces charity Poppyscotland.                                                    Fresh from another incredible month of spectacular performances at the world-renowned Edinburgh Tattoo, Scotland’s State Band, as it is also known, will be performing at the Beach Ballroom on Friday, September 28.                                                     Members of the band local to the area recently joined Aberdeen Provost Barney Crockett and the Poppyscotland team to spread the word about the eagerly anticipated concert.        Lord Provost Crockett said: “It is an honour to welcome the Band of The Royal Regiment of Scotland to Aberdeen. “We are very fortunate that the Beach Ballroom has been chosen as one of the venues for the band to play on its seven-date centenary tour. “I would also like to take this opportunity to wish them well in meeting their fundraising targets for the very deserving Armed Forces charity Poppyscotland.”Starring in the Beach Ballroom show will be hometown heroes LCpl Mark Angus and LCpl Natalie Mair.                                                                                                         Both hail from Aberdeen originally, and the September concert will mark the first time either has performed during their military career in the Granite City.LCpl Angus, who has played the tuba in ious military bands during his 16-year Army career, said: “The last time I performed in Aberdeen was with the brass band at Cults Academy, so I’m really excited to be back home as part of the Walking with Heroes tour.”LCpl Mair added: “I’m looking forward to having my local fan club – well, my mum, sister and aunties! – coming along to show us their support. It’s going to be a very special night.” LCpl Mair plays the cornet and has recently ed from the Far East where she provided musical and ceremonial support in South Korea, Vietnam, Singapore, Japan and Indonesia.                                                                                                        To accompany the centenary tour, there is also a CD – Walking with Heroes – which will commemorate 100 years since the end of The Great War, and honour those that served our nation so valiantly. The programme includes works by such iconic composers as Holst, Shostakovich, John Williams and Karl Jenkins alongside new compositions and arrangements. These include traditional Scottish fayre and feature a whole host of soloists in particular the unmistakable skirl of the pipes.Gordon Michie, head of fundraising, said: “It is a privilege for Poppyscotland to be in partnership with such a talented group of musicians. “The tour is providing a great opportunity for music lovers across the country to experience the unmistakable and memorable sound of Scotland’s State Band.                                                                                                         “We urge the public to get their hands on tickets for the performance as soon as possible as they are already selling out fast.”As well as the tour itself, the band is undertaking another fundraising effort in the form of The 1918 Poppy Pledge. Not only is this a lasting tribute to those who fell in the First World War, but, importantly, will also allow the Poppyscotland to make a step change in the scale of support it is able to provide those in the Armed Forces community who rely on the charity’s support today.

September has a high rate of babies being born.\u0026ldquoStaff morale is already at an all-time low. Several experienced midwives are either retiring or leaving because of the added workload and the burden it is causing.Bill Fernie of the pressure group Caithness Health Action Team said he was not surprised that a midwe felt compelled to speak out.He said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a terrible situation for the staff to find themselves in. They should be commended for all their efforts.\u0026ldquoTravelling to Raigmore places more than enough strain on the mums and their families so going to Glasgow would have added to that. I can fully understand why someone at Raigmore would want to whistle-blow as it appears to be a pretty fraught situation.An NHS Highland spokesman said: \u0026ldquoDue to the unpredictable nature of maternity activity, cases are assessed on an inidual basis and robust risk assessment and escalation plans are in place to ensure safe service provision.\u0026ldquoTo date, since accepting intrapartum transfers from Elgin, there has been no need for any Caithness woman to be erted from Raigmore Hospital to deliver elsewhere due to staffing levels or capacity, as is being suggested by the midwe whom you interviewed.Thursday 20 Sep 2018 7:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Bower author helping Norn become the norm","story":"COMMON words and phrases used by Caithnessians may be thought of by locals as slang terms \u0026ndash but, by using them, they may have been reviving a dead language.Bower author Elspeth Grace Hall is doing her bit to revive the language of Norn that was once widely spoken in Caithness.Norn was officially declared a \u0026ldquodead language by world heritage body the United Nations Educational, Scientic and Cultural Organization .However, Grace Hall has been bringing about a revival of the region\u0026rsquos native tongue by writing a series of children\u0026rsquos workbooks to teach kids how to read and write in Norn.If Elspeth is successful in helping to increase the numbers of Norn speakers in Caithness, UNESCO could reverse its death declaration.They had once delivered a similar verdict on Kernowek \u0026ndash the native language of south-west English county, Cornwall.But in 2010, UNESCO announced that its former classication of the language as \u0026ldquoextinct was \u0026ldquono longer accurate.Grace Hall said: \u0026ldquoIf you have ever sat \u0026lsquoO a benk\u0026rsquo, fed the \u0026lsquoscorries\u0026rsquo, told your \u0026lsquomannie\u0026rsquo off for being a \u0026lsquoloon\u0026rsquo or simply popped off \u0026lsquotill\u0026rsquo the shops you have been speaking a second language \u0026ndash one that officially doesn\u0026rsquot even exist.\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove always been intrigued by languages and the Caithness dialect is wonderfully rich.\u0026ldquoI started to investigate the etymology of words unique to Caithness and found that they weren\u0026rsquot part of Scots, English or Gaelic, they were in fact Norn. A language that official bodies such as the UNESCO insist has been dead since the 1800\u0026rsquos.\u0026ldquoIt wouldn\u0026rsquot be the first time UNESCO has prematurely pronounced a language as dead. Back in 2009 UNESCO declared Manx extinct despite there being over 1500 speakers of Manx.\u0026ldquoUNESCO was forced to change its classication of Manx from \u0026ldquoExtinct to \u0026lsquoEndangered\u0026rsquo after a group of school children wrote to them in Manx asking what language they were writing in  Manx didn\u0026rsquot exist.\u0026ldquoThe more people I talked to the more I came to find that Norn isn\u0026rsquot dead, it has just become lost in our English. When I gave people examples they shrugged them off as \u0026lsquoCaithness Words\u0026rsquo but it is so much more than that it is \u0026lsquoCaithness language\u0026rsquo  only we put our minds and our hearts to it.With her Norn Min series workbooks Grace Hall is spreading the Norn language both within Caithness and outside of the region as well.She added: \u0026ldquoThe Norn Min series has three workbooks published and another two in the pipeline. Copies of the series have sold as far away as America and Sweden.\u0026ldquoIt was just after the publication of Norn Min buk two that I received an email from the University of Bari in Italy as their Minority Languages department was interested in Norn.\u0026ldquoThey asked  they could use the Norn Min series to create an Italian-Norn phrasebook. A week later I was contacted by the World Children\u0026rsquos Book project and they offered me a contract to translate five of their books into Norn.The World Children\u0026rsquos Book project has over 200 translators making their bilingual books available in languages traditional publishes ignore such as English Igbo in Nigeria, German/Tigrinya in Ethiopia and now English/Norn in Scotland.Copies of both the workbooks and storybooks are available at John O\u0026rsquoGroats and Caithness Horizons.\u0026nbspThursday 20 Sep 2018 7:37

celebrate the torture and consumption of dogs.It is thought that inflicting pain such as blow torching, bludgeoning and skinning and boiling them alive, makes their flesh taste more tender, and helps those who eat it cope with hot weather.However, dog-eating festivals represent less than 0.01 per cent of the dog-meat trade as a whole.

Local resident and self-professed \u0026ldquoTrinkie lover Bryan Newlands welcomed the group\u0026rsquos formation, underlining that the pool harboured a lot of memories. \u0026ldquoI used to go there a lot... Even though I lived on the other side of town, every summer myself and a friend would go \u0026ndash even when it was raining, he said. \u0026ldquoIt was a great place as the town didn\u0026rsquot have an indoor swimming pool until 1994. Many people learned to swim at the Trinkie.While a slideshow showed images of how the pool used to look and how much Wickers got from it, other more contemporary images show a dilapidated ruin \u0026ndash a far cry from the hustle, bustle and smiles of yesteryear.The new group was formed with a mission to \u0026ldquobring the pool back to le and a number of office-bearers were proposed and elected.James Bremner was elected chairman with other roles going to William Macdonald , Catherine Patterson  and Garance Warburton .Seven committee members were also elected: Fiona Bremner, Trudi Mcalpine, Davina Lyall, Fiona McPhee, Leslie Grant, Roddy Mackay and Councillor Willie Mackay.Ms Patterson underlined that it was going to be no easy fix as \u0026ldquothere are holes in the wall at the deep end, which also has cracks that go right down to the ground.\u0026ldquoThe previous group... had the holes patched up, but they kept reappearing, she said. \u0026ldquoThe wall itself is also crumbling and the bridge that ides the deep and shallow ends has had its fixtures corroded. Also the south access road that leads the public to the pool is in poor nick.She stressed that volunteers to patch things up and general goodwill is always welcome, \u0026ldquobut [often] their help only scratches the surface of what needs to be done.She added: \u0026ldquoMajor investment is needed along with a report from a structural engineer to see how much damage there is, what can and cannot be done, and to get an estimate of how much the restoration will cost.Mr Newlands \u0026ndash committee member Ms Lyall\u0026rsquos son \u0026ndash stressed that the Trinkie added tremendous character to Wick.\u0026ldquoPut it this way, with the summer we\u0026rsquove had, that pool would have been full had it been in use, he said.Other memories came from Wick Society chairman Iain Leith. \u0026ldquoGoing there was a popular pastime in its day with adults and kids from all over Pulteneytown flocking to it, he said.\u0026ldquoRestoring it could be a big boost to the town\u0026rsquos economy by making it a tourist attraction as well as giving back the town a much-loved landmark.Ms Patterson emphasised that the Trinkie had the potential to be an asset to both locals and tourists.\u0026ldquoBut we need investment because  nothing gets done the pool is on its way out.Thursday 20 Sep 2018 7:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117364.jpg","title":"New service gives job hunters a Fair Start","story":"\u0026nbspScottish Government ViewpointFAIR Start Scotland is the country\u0027s new devolved employment support service.It is focused on supporting unemployed people who have challenges in accessing the labour market for whom work is a realistic prospect.Launched in April, earlier this year, it is an example of one of the first uses of newly devolved powers under the 2016 Scotland Act.The service will run until 2023 and aims to provide tailored, flexible and person-centred support to at least 38,000 people across Scotland who want help to find work, and stay in work.Fair Start Scotland is distinctive in that participation is purely voluntary.This means that people have everything to gain and nothing to lose \u0026ndash choosing to participate will not affect existing benefits or be driven by fear of benefit sanctions.The service is delivered locally, meaning that no participants are left without the support they need.Delivery is over nine geographic areas including the Highlands and reflects local area economies, meeting the needs of employers, disabled people and those at risk of long-term unemployment.Jamie Hepburn, Minister for Business, Fair Work and Skills, said: \"What\u0027s crucial about Fair Start Scotland is that it treats people with fairness, dignity and respect and that it is focused on the needs of the inidual.\"We are dedicated to delivering a high quality employment support service that will lead to real and sustained job outcomes and help people to achieve their full potential.\"As well as meeting the needs of unemployed people, Fair Start Scotland also seeks to help businesses find the skilled and committed employees they need to thrive.\"One of the many now benefitting is Highlander Alan Cairns .He has not worked for over a year and his biggest barriers to work have been low confidence and computer skills but now he has secured 16 hours of work per week.Alan started on the Fair Start Scotland service in the middle of May and has been attending the service for the past 12 weeks.

Like that earlier work, The Katanes Saga is told in an unpretentious, engaging, sometimes blokey style. From the drunken arguments to the devious plots to the mutilations and killings, Cassells tells it like it is.\u0026ldquoThe Raven Banner was basically a guide to Norse Caithness with a little bit about each area and what I thought were the main things that happened in Norse times, he explains. \u0026ldquoThe Katanes Saga is far more in-depth.\u0026ldquoThey were people like you and me. They had the same faults. You could meet three Vikings in the pub any night.\u0026ldquoOne word I would use to describe the Norse is pragmatic. They were really pragmatic people. If that\u0026rsquos the way it works, that\u0026rsquos the way it works \u0026ndash  it doesn\u0026rsquot, I\u0026rsquoll do it my way.\u0026ldquoI do mention that of all the Norse earls of Orkney only a handful actually died in their beds. Most suffered violent deaths. One was killed with contact poison from his own auntie and mother on a shirt.Cassells  is a retired Royal Mail manager who previously worked as a lighthouse keeper on Muckle Flugga and Stroma. Those experiences inspired two other books, No More Paraffin-Oilers and A Light Walk.The Katanes Saga sees him ing to a theme that first sparked his interest at an early age. Born in Barrow, he moved to Thurso in late 1950s when his father came to work at the Admiralty test establishment.\u0026ldquoI always liked Greek and Roman mythology and I started reading about Norse mythology as well, he recalls. \u0026ldquoAs a young boy I lived in Sweyn Road in Thurso and I wondered who Sweyn was. A pal of mine said, \u0026lsquoAch, that\u0026rsquoll be Sweyn the pirate.\u0026rsquo So for about a year I had this happy vision of a Pugwash-type character that the street was named after. I then discovered Sweyn Aslearson.Swyen , iously described \u0026ldquothe last of the Vikings and \u0026ldquothe greatest troublemaker in the westernlands, had an estate at Duncansby and was renowned for raiding, plundering and pillaging. One of the many who suffered at his hands was Frakokk, who had featured in the poisoned-shirt incident: she was burned to death in her farmhouse at Helmsdale, along with other members of her faction, in a revenge attack led by Swyen.It\u0026rsquos an example of the way in which many of the strands are intertwined, as Cassells points out.\u0026ldquoI read the sagas and I started taking a look at place names, he says. \u0026ldquoFor a long time I lived at Scrabster \u0026ndash Skarabolstadr, the \u0026lsquohomestead of the sea-mews\u0026rsquo.\u0026ldquoAnd the stories were interesting to read. They were intriguing.\u0026ldquoYou try and unravel it and it\u0026rsquos just more or less two families feuding all the way through it. That goes right to the very last act of the local earl being kned in a beer cellar in Thurso.One of the most shocking events is the burning to death of Bishop Adam by a mob in Halkirk in a dispute over a butter tax.\u0026ldquoHe got a bit greedy, Cassells says. \u0026ldquoThey complained to the earl at the time who more or less said, \u0026lsquoDamn the bishop, you can burn him as you please,\u0026rsquo so they took him at his word.\u0026ldquoBishops crop up a couple of times. There was lot of enmity between the local Norse earldom and the Scottish king over bishops. A bishop got his eyes put out in Scrabster.\u0026ldquoAfter the bishop was murdered at Halkirk, the Scottish king came up here and carried out what was, for want of a better description, pure genocide of the people from the Halkirk area. I believe they were all massacred round about where the Pennyland estate is now in Thurso. Hundreds of people were killed there.\u0026ldquoIn those days you just didn\u0026rsquot go burning bishops \u0026ndash they\u0026rsquore going to come down heavy on you.\u0026ldquoRavenshill Road used to be known as the Gallows Hill, before the atomic houses were built there, so that has been a place for judicial executions for quite a long time.From the machinations of the \u0026ldquofemme fatale Ragnhild at Murkle to the murder of Earl Rognvald at Forsie to the Battle of Clairdon Hill outside Thurso, the power struggles and manoeuvrings come thick and fast. It\u0026rsquos a rapid-fire history lesson, but more than anything Cassells simply wants people to enjoy the stories.\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a thing I never learned in school here. It was never mentioned, he says. \u0026ldquoThis is our own local history, and I just hope people think it\u0026rsquos a good read.The Katanes Saga  is self-published and is on sale in Caithness Horizons, newsagents in Thurso, and Wick Heritage Museum.Thursday 20 Sep 2018 7:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117588.jpg","title":"Preloved pet trade blasted","story":"\u0026nbspA CAITHNESS-based animal rights campaigner is calling for a change in the law to stop \"heartless\" pet owners from selling unwanted animals online.Natalie Oag, who is backing a proposal by the Scottish Government for the introduction of a special licence for dog owners, says animals listed on sites such as Preloved are the victims of a \"throwaway society\".\"Pets shouldn\u0027t be viewed the same as inanimate objects when no longer wanted,\" said Ms Oag, the Highland representative for the Peta Foundation .Pets listed on Preloved include a 9ft python available for \u0026pound1000 and, until a few days ago, a heavily muscled eight-month-old \"untrained\" micro pocket American bulldog for \u0026pound2000 \u0026ndash listed as it did not get along with another dog.Other listings include a sheepdog which \"adores humans\" but is not interested in sheep, while on Gumtree \u0026ndash which has recently imposed a \u0026pound2.99 fee to deter \"casual\" trading \u0026ndash pets for sale include an 18-month-old cat looking for a \"stable\" household, a pair of two-year-old \"very tame\" rabbits and a one-year-old cat whose owner claims to have developed a skin allergy.It is not illegal to post adverts and sell pets online. However, Ms Oag believes it is leading to a surge in the number of abandoned and ill-treated animals.\"It\u0027s not fair on them to be sold alongside kids\u0027 bikes and unused furniture,\" she said. \"Too many people are just not taking responsibility.

He was a third-year medical student who played rugby with the cycling trio and was also a talented musician. He had also been suffering from depression.The idea of cycling from John O\u0026rsquoGroats to Land\u0026rsquos End came to the trio after they had learned that Marcus had previously done the y cycle, not once but twice.Fenn, a final-year maths student from Sheffield, said that Marcus\u0026rsquos sudden death was a huge shock to us all at the rugby club,and for everyone that knew him.\u0026ldquoHearing the news that he had been suffering from depression was a surprise to all his friends and family, he said.\u0026ldquoIn light of this, Marcus\u0026rsquos family have set up a fund in his name \u0026ndash Marcus in Mind \u0026ndash to raise awareness and prevent this sort of tragedy happening to more young men.Giles, a marine and offshore engineering student from Bridgnorth, Shropshire, added: \u0026ldquoThe three of us felt compelled to do something to help raise awareness of depression and mental health.\u0026ldquoAfter learning at his funeral that Marcus had completed this very cycle ride twice, we knew it would be an appropriate challenge.\u0026ldquoWe are using the social media hashtag #ItsOkNotToBeOk and we\u0026rsquore hoping to remove some of the stigma and get blokes like us opening up about mental health.Given Marcus\u0026rsquos and the trio\u0026rsquos links with rugby, clubs around the UK have been aware of the mental health awareness drive that they\u0026rsquore undertaking,Alex, a marine engineering student from Porthlevan, Cornwall, said: \u0026ldquoWe have been in touch with rugby clubs up and down the country.

They worried that the business case for the cinema and hub was not sufficient and risked adding to the number of empty buildings in Cromarty.Others argued that the project would be out of keeping with Cromarty\u0026rsquos historic architecture.A report which went before this week\u0026rsquos committee said that Cromarty Community Council had taken a neutral stance over the proposals, but that a consultation it held with the public found that, out of 63 residents who responded, 37 supported the plans and 26 were opposed.Recommending approval council planners said existing paths through the site would be maintained and added that the location within an area that is already fenced off meant there was a \"perceptible distinction\" between the yard site and wider Links area.They added that the film society had looked at other existing venues for a possible cinema and found none were suitable, and added that Cromarty Estate had argued there was \"a demand from local groups and businesses for office space\".Voting unanimously in favour of the plans, a number of councillors on the committee said it was an exciting project but also acknowledged some of the local reservations over the business case.Dingwall and Seaforth councillor Margaret Paterson said that while some in the community had doubts over the cinema\u0026rsquos financial viability, she stressed that \"the film society is active and forward-thinking and they will get the people\".Wick and East Caithness councillor Raymond Bremner also acknowledged local fears that the community might be left with \"dficult buildings\"  the development didn\u0026rsquot \"quite work\" but praised the application and gave his support to it.And Dingwall and Seaforth councillor Angela Maclean said she believed the hub and cinema was \"a venue that can be used by lots of dferent groups in the community\" and would boost the neighbouring Slaughterhouse Cafe.\"This is an exciting development for Cromarty \u0026ndash it\u0026rsquos a cosmopolitan and very artistic community,\" she added.Thursday 20 Sep 2018 7:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The atmospheric walk is a magnet for visitors and local alike.The Avoch Primary School pupil\u0026rsquos mother Julie Mackay reported the \"nasty\" burglary on a community Facebook page prompting a run of comments \u0026ndash including some which suggested the culprits may have a problem with the natural area being studded with colourful wooden toy fairy houses.However, the effort to replace the items was considered a great success despite the dissident tone.Mrs Mackay , of High Street, Rosemarkie, said: \"We replaced the pink boot with the money that had been collected by the Panacea shop in Rosemarkie, which was around \u0026pound20. The shop owner Cornelia Hughes gave them to us at cost price and she also donated the wobbly-roofed house.\"Cornelia is seen by the children as the white witch of the Fairy Glen as she makes \"get well\" lotions and potions and sells fairy dust and crystals in her shop and she dresses up at Halloween looking quite the part. And our local posties Wilma Stewart and Sheila MacDonald donated the watering can fairy house.\"She added: \"We all went to Fairy Glen and the local children helped to glue them down.

The findings from these will be fed into the on-going options investigation study, which is expected to report in the autumn of 2018 on ways to improve the junctions to help reduce the risk of accidents.\"Road safety is a priority for the Scottish Government and we understand the concerns of the community.

A farm trailer chassis was found at Avoch. And at Nigg, an abandoned kayak, plastic pieces and a large rusting boat were found.For more details about the project visit www.scrapbook.org.ukThursday 20 Sep 2018 7:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Construction began in 2016 and is expected to be completed on schedule in late summer.\nLocated at Seafield the new centre is just a short distance from the long-standing Eric Gray Centre. Once opened the centre will provide specialist assistance for adults with complex care needs and learning disabilities.\nThe building has been designed by Richard Gibson Architects and construction is being led by DITT. The drone footage was shot by Nick McCaffrey.\nThe centre does indeed look good and is on schedule well done DITT , the clients and staff are all looking forward to being in the building. It has taken many years to reach this point  and is much needed.\nI wonder what,  any, proof you have that clients and staff are looking forward to being in the building? If you do have some proof to justy your claim, are they looking forward to being in before or after completion?\nGeorge Dickson\nI have along with other parents of clients that currently use the Eric Gray Centre worked hard, and against many obstacles to finally see the realisation  of a much needed new building where all clients who are at this moment in dferent buildings due to there being not enough space in the old building and facilities that have run there course in time. It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.\nI also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last 10 years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.\nSome parents and staff have had a look through the new building at dferent stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed. I like many other parents and carers look forward to the day its complete and our daughters and sons can enjoy the help and encouragement from staff to live their lives to the best of their ability.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August. It is part of the Year of Young People activities.\nThe youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.\nYear of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to 26 years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, \u0026#8216What do you enjoy about Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What makes you proud of Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What is Shetland famous for?\u0026#8217.\u0026#8221\n Send any ideas, before Friday 6th July 2018, to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call  744490 or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.\n\u0026#8220This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People 2018.”\n\n\nAre they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be done\nI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.\nOver the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called \u0026#8216 limited edition rubbish \u0026#8216.\nI would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.\nNo doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230..despite the fact everybody else looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.\nLove the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder  the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary  to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder  takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary  to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain  credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on  it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself  doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate   and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! .\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists  when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.David Spence.   I’ll lend you a trowel to apply the “paint” provided that you are prepared to produce it \u0026#8230\u0026#8230.. on stage at Mareel perhaps. After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and  you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 22 ","story":"After being tasked with compiling a feature to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the senior football inter-county, it was a pleasure to speak to several of those with first-hand knowledge of the history of the Milne Cup competition.\nGeordie Hunter goes the furthest back, having made his debut in the 1953 game. On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely dferent.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the  and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit  ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great inidual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois  Benjamin Pad , Raphaël Varane , Diego Godín , Ivan Strinic  Ivan Perisic , Luka Modric , Jordan Henderson , Eden Hazard  Cristiano Ronaldo , Edinson Cavani .\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the ing Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe  Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt  anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed,  anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.\nIt is rare enough for a local game to end 0-0, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.\nAstonishingly, Delting’s 4-1 triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers  I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds  dficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame.

A phone call from Brydon Thomason to Alastair Wilson, the Scottish Natural Heritage warden, alerted folk to them heading north off Westing, which triggered a mega sprint across to the coast where they were able to look down on about four animals including a male.\nTo be able to see them close to is a memorable experience, but to be able to look down on them underwater even more amazing. Such oppor­tunities don’t come often. They were also seen to catch a seal in the bay at Lund, and photographed by several folk during their progress north, and so hopefully can be identied by the team that are still up here researching the distribution and abundance of killer whales around Scotland.\nFrom photographs, it has been established that an orca seen off Cullivoe, north Yell, on the evening of the 12th July, is a big male known as 014 or “Bigga”.  Next day, the same inidual was identied at 0800hrs heading north through Yell Sound.\nSome of our showiest plants are in flower just now. “I know a bank whereon the wild thyme blows …” wrote William Shakespeare in “A Midsummer Night’s Dream”. And indeed I do. There’s a fantastic bank near me where the pale mauve flowers of thyme are pushing through between the bell heather, itself with some plants paler than others.\nCommon heather is not so bold in its colouration, but works in mass production, and will soon be colouring the hills with subtle shades. The third in the trio of obvious heathers is cross-leaved heath, whose compact flowerheads drooping from a single stem are pinker in colour.\nChanging colour, two striking plants are now in full bloom – angelica and meadowsweet. Although names for meadowsweet in dferent coun­tries all translate as “queen of the meadow”, it seems that its name actually comes from its use in flavouring the drink mead. Also in the days when hygiene was not quite so good as now, the plant with its rather nauseating scent was spread out on the floors of houses to counteract unpleasant odours. A Shetland name is “blackenin-girse”, from its use for dyeing wool.\nFrom the showy to the opposite – demure and unnoticed is a little plant with a big name that is very common about gardens, steps and roadsides: procumbent pearlwort. This low, hairless, tufted perennial has its base as a non-flowering rosette. However, the name pearlwort is said to come from the tiny, pearl-like white, long-stalked flowers whose sepals are actually longer than the usually four petals. In folklore it is said to have special powers of protection. So next time you go to pull out this so-called weed, just give it a closer look first. Maybe its powers of protection will rub off on you!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"div","story":"A DIVE vessel with 14 women on board was escorted into port after she began taking in water off Shetland on Sunday.\n issued a mayday call in bad weather soon after midday when she was approximately eight miles east of Sumburgh Head.

Strong views were expressed \u0026ndash for and against \u0026ndash on the inclusion of the belt of trees to the north and west of Inverallan Church.\nThe trees contribute to the setting of the conservation area, forming a backdrop to the B-listed church \"and provide a natural separation with the later development to the north west\", according to the officer\u0027s report to members.\nThose against the proposed extension cited the project to convert the church for \"community use, part funded by developing housing either side of the church\".\nThere was a sense that including the location within the conservation area would be \"a barrier to this development\".\nConversely, there was support for including the trees because they would be better protected from speculative development.\nThe draft proposals will go to the council\u0027s south planning committee for approval.

by-election opens this Wednesday at three venues across North Antrim, including the Joey Dunlop Leisure Centre in Ballymoney.\nAccording to the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland  75,478 North Antrim voters are entitled to sign the Petition in respect of Mr Paisley, recently suspended from the House of Commons, with 10% of those or 7,547 signatures needed to force a by-election.\nUUP Leader Robin Swann and Dunloy Sinn Fein MLA Philip McGuigan have both expressed disappointment at the EONI decision to open only three centres with limited opening hours, instead of a possible 10.\n\n\nINADEQUATE\n\n\nBoth MLA\u0027s as well as TUV leader Jim Allister have said will be signing the petition.\nExpressing disappointment, Mr Swann said three petition centres was totally inadequate for a constituency the size of North Antrim, and by restricting the opening hours, the EONI has shown little regard to people in daytime employment,\n\nSUBVERTED\n\n\nMr McGuigan agreed that the EONI decision on venues was extremely disappointing, and simply not good enough.\nHe continued that people\u0027s ability to reject the disgraceful behaviour of Ian Paisley was greatly reduced by this decision after he had accepted lavish family holidays from the Sri Lankan government and lobbyied against a UN resolution about\u0026#160 human rights abuses by the Sri Lankan authorities.\nHe said the UUP would not register as campaigner during the recall petition, but would encourage any North Antrim electors who think what Ian Paisley did was wrong to sign the petition\n

Ben their proud mother Sabrina has agreed to share their inspiring story.\nSabrina and her husband Bryan are hoping their unforgettable experiences will encourage others to give blood and sign the Stem Cell and Bone Marrow Register.\nSpeaking exclusively to The Chronicle, teacher Sabrina said: It\u0027s been the toughest year of our lives but what a dference the past 12 months have made no words can ever express how we all felt this time last year.\n\u0026#8220To have two children going through such le-changing procedures in the same hospital, on the same day, is something we could never have imagined. Caden is improving every day and Ben has never looked back.

\n            \n\nLord Mayor, Cllr Julie Flaherty attended the launch adding: “The partnership with STA is a fantastic opportunity, and we are very excited to offer a fresh and innovative swim programme incorporating advanced swimming and Junior Leguard courses, as well as increasing grass roots level classes including baby, pre-school and beginner sessions,”\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThe programme will have very little impact on children currently in lessons. The main area of change will be the names of the lessons from Stanley right through to Shark. \n\nA Progression Chart will be displayed throughout the sites. The change will embrace all areas ensuring a standardised programme is delivered to learners.\n\nLeanne Dougliss, STA’s Interim Sales and Marketing Director added: “We are happy to launch STA’s Swim programme with Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council. Swimming is a vital le skill that all children should be given the opportunity to learn. They have embraced this opportunity to enhance their swim scheme and we are delighted to be able to offer a current, cost-effective, quality programme that is appealing to learners of all ages and abilities. Together we can save lives through the teaching of swimming, first aid and lesaving. I look forward to working with the team to ensure their customers receive the highest quality lessons.”\n\nFor information on the getactiveabc Swim Academy, visit getactiveabc\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8633378.1536767392!/image/image.jpg","title":"international sheepdog trial was a tail wagging success","story":"\nThousands of local, national and international visitors descended on Dromore\u0026#8217s Gill Hall Estate for the International Sheepdog Trial 2018\n\n                \nMore than 600 dogs and 300 top handlers from the UK and Ireland went through their paces to secure a place for the competitive three-day event.

many women are being left traumatised by these implants","story":"\nA Banbridge woman who suffered 12 years of pain after having a vaginal mesh implant fitted is leading the fight for a moratorium on the use of the devices in Northern Ireland.\n\n                \nDrawing on her own painful experience, Jackie Harvey has set up an online support group to offer help and advice to local women about mesh implants, and raise awareness about the complications associated with them.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nJackie Harvey.\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe implants are used by surgeons in an operation to treat pelvic organ prolapse and urinary incontinence, which can be common after childbirth. But following reports of many women being left in agonising pain, there have been calls for the procedure to be banned, or at least suspended until the long-term safety of the implants can be evaluated.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAt the age of 36, a gynaecologist recommended that Jackie have a vaginal mesh implant fitted as a way of alleviating the urinary incontinence problem she’d been left with after having her second child.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nIn March 2005 she underwent surgery and it worked well. She recovered quickly, but unfortunately the plastic implant soon started to cause her problems.\n\n“After a year or two I noticed the tops of my legs were getting really painful and stf and I just thought I must be getting old, though I was only 38 at the time,” she explained.\n\n“I went to doctors ious times about the pain in my legs and got x-rays, but they didn’t really show anything. In 2009 I stopped doing any sort of impact exercise. I couldn’t run. I couldn’t really walk very far without getting pain in my legs, my feet and hips. I kept going back to the doctor and nothing was showing. In 2013 I was really struggling and I went to rheumatologist who told me that I didn’t have arthritis. I went to an orthopaedic consultant who told me he couldn’t see anything wrong with me. And then by 2015 I had seen an article online where a woman called Kath Sansom had started a campaign group called ‘Sling The Mesh’ and she was suffering from very similar complications to me, and it was just like a lightbulb going off in my head - this was 10 years after I’d had it put in.”\n\nJackie, who claims she wasn’t told about the risks so couldn’t make an informed decision about getting the implant, says the pain she suffered as a result of the device ruined 12 years of her le.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“It had a really detrimental impact on my le. I was struggling to walk and I was in pain and exhausted every single day of my le. I felt about 90. I was stf, sore and I just felt ill. For me to go to a doctor and my issues not to be recognised or accepted was just horrendous.” \n\nJackie was referred to a gynaecologist who told her the implant wasn’t causing her problems, but she refused to accept that was the case. She decided she had no other option but to challenge the doctor’s findings, and eventually had to pay for specialist treatment in England.\n\nThe 49-year-old office worker had a scan in London which showed that her implant was in the wrong place and was causing her pain. She finally underwent surgery at a hospital in Oxford in March this year to have her mesh removed.\n\n“As soon as I woke up the dference was amazing,” she said. “I’m still not perfect, but I’m an awful lot better than I was.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThrough the UK-wide ‘Sling The Mesh’ group, Jackie heard many stories of women from Northern Ireland who are suffering similar problems to those she experienced. So, in a bid to help them, she decided to set up her own local support group on Facebook, and it already has around 200 members.\n\n“This is a repeated story across the UK, not just in Northern Ireland,” she continued. “These ladies are going to their surgeons and they are being told ‘It’s not the mesh that’s causing your problems’, or ‘It’s all in your head’. It’s almost like they’re reading off a script.\n\n“These women are in pain, some of them are constantly getting infections, others are on antibiotics every day.\n\n“Their lives are a misery, they have no sex lives, their marriages have broken down, some have lost their jobs, they can’t enjoy their le, it’s just horrendous. That’s what spurred me on to push for some sort of recognition that there is an issue in Northern Ireland and something has to be done.”\n\nWhile the NHS says “the majority of women treated with mesh respond well to the treatment”, it acknowledges that “the Medicines \u0026amp Healthcare products Regulatory Agency  has received reports of complications associated with vaginal meshes - mostly regarding persistent pain, sexual problems, mesh exposure through vaginal tissues and occasionally injury to nearby organs, such as the bladder or bowel.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nJackie, who was the first woman to report her implant to the Northern Ireland Adverse Incident Centre at Stormont, is campaigning for the use of vaginal mesh implants to be suspended.\n\n“In Scotland there was a moratorium put on the use of mesh in 2014, by the Scottish government, and it doesn’t make sense that in the rest of the UK women aren’t afforded the same protection,” she said.\n\n“We want the use of mesh suspended whilst there is a review ongoing. We want the same protection that they have in Scotland. We also want a national register to register how many mesh complications there actually are.\n\n“So many women are being left traumatised by this. They are going to doctors for help and are just basically being fobbed off. It’s appalling. I hear the same story day in, day out from women looking for help and there’s nobody there to help them. Where do these women go for help?

Despite the Troubles shutting down parts of the city, he is determined to play his headline slot in the Harp Bar even  it means playing to an audience of one. It’s here that Terri meets his we Ruth, played by West End star Niamh Perry, and the two try to build their le together, as Terri becomes distracted – all too easily – by trying to passionately promote the latest band to come on the punk scene as he turns promoter for Rudi and The Outcasts.\nIf anyone during Sunday’s afternoon matinee was expecting a leisurely retrospective they were in for a rude awakening as this is a gloriously full-on production of music and song with all-star cast in full, fine voice, all playing instruments and giving it the heap.\nEvery audience member is with our protagonist as he goes across the water, copious copies of seven-inch vinyl under his arm as he tries, most of the time in vain, to try and get snooty English music executives to listen to a band from Derry called The Undertones and their debut song Teenage Kicks – a song so iconic that John Peel did the unthinkable and played it twice on Radio One.\nWith every high comes the inevitable low and we witness how Terri releases the band from the Good Vibrations label for “£500 and a signed copy of a Shangri-Las record”.\nWith a marriage falling apart, mounting debts at the record shop and next to no revenue, a fundraising concert at the Ulster Hall sets the scene for the rousing finale and our lead’s poignant rendition of Sonny Bono’s Laugh At Me.\nA standing ovation gave way to the ‘national anthem’ as the raw opening bars of Teenage Kicks started up and the audience sang every line back to the cast.\nGood Vibrations is a must-see – simple as that. The amount of energy fizzing off the stage is infectious and the cast of ten are exceptional. A transfer to the West End must surely follow.\n\n\nGood Vibrations runs at the Lyric Theatre until Saturday, October 6.

The game went ahead at Windsor Park.\n\nThe party has also called for a boycott of the 2019 Eurovision Song Contest which will take place in Israel.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"nama pressured into selling properties by eu official says","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Of course I do.”\n\nTDs heard that Nama was overall “well on course” to achieve what it was set up to do.\n\nThe agency has projected a 3.5 billion euro surplus by the time it completes its work as planned.\n\nIt aims to have 20,000 Nama related properties brought to the market by 2020.\n\nOverall, Nama has 2.7 billion euro worth of assets left to sell before it wraps up. It is not known for definite when that date will be.\n\nMr McDonagh said 10,500 properties have been built on Nama related lands so far.\n\nThe majority of those homes were private.\n\nMr McDonagh estimated that less than 10% of those properties comprised social and affordable homes.\n\nNama chairman Frank Daly said in the past four years, Nama has built roughly 25% of the overall houses constructed across the country – even though it was not set up as a housing agency.\n\n“There are people living in each of those 10,000 houses,” Mr Daly said.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"amazon unveils range of new echo smart home devices","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Wonder  we’ll introduce anything new today? 🤔 Follow all of the news from today’s Amazon Devices Event starting at 10am PST: \nhttps:t.co/o0pGZP7RFW\n\n— Amazon Echo  \nSeptember 20, 2018\n\n\n\n\nAs part of the firm’s plans to extend voice control to a wider number of appliances around the home, Amazon also unveiled its £25 Smart Plug, which once in place will allow users to control the socket using Alexa voice commands via an Echo smart speaker.\n\nAmazon’s senior vice president of devices and services Dave Limp said the momentum around the smart home had been “incredible”, with more than 20,000 devices now available in the category.\n\nThe new Echo Dot will cost £49.99 and has been given an improved speaker, resulting in audio playing up to 70% louder, Amazon said.\n\nThe firm’s smart home hub Echo Plus includes a built-in system to automatically find and connect with other smart home devices it detects nearby.\n\nEcho Show, the video-screen carrying version of the smart speaker, has been given a revamp too, featuring an improved speaker system alongside its 10-inch HD screen, which can be used to stream videos and make video calls.\n\nIt will cost £219.99.\n\nA range of companion devices were also unveiled, including the Echo Sub subwoofer, which helps boost the sound produced by connected Echo smart speakers.\n\nWhile the Echo Input allows users to make their existing speakers smart, by allowing them to be controlled by Alexa voice commands once connected.\n\nJorrit Van der Meulen, vice president of Amazon devices international, said: “We want you to have access to Alexa everywhere – in your kitchen, in your living room, in your office, and more.\n\n“Today, we’re excited to expand the number of ways that customers can add Alexa to their homes, so they can use Alexa to make their lives more convenient and easy.”\n\nAmong the surprise companion devices announced was the Amazon Basics Microwave, which can be connected to an Echo and turned on using voice commands – with users able to specy a cooking time.\n\nWhile the Echo Wall Clock can use its clock face to display any timers a user currently has running.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"corbyn not

A referendum will not solve that.”\n\nResponding to Mr Corbyn’s latest comments, Scottish Conservative constitution spokesman Adam Tomkins said: “Every time Jeremy Corbyn talks about Scotland he gives yet another concession to the SNP.\n\n“It’s more proof that Labour are utterly weak when it comes to Scotland’s place in the UK.\n\n“Jeremy Corbyn does not care about Scotland, and has no interest in standing up to the nationalists, as this latest gaffe proves.”\n\n\nJeremy Corbyn has a careless attitude towards the UK. \npic.twitter/P2nukKdY8H\n\n— Willie Rennie  \nSeptember 20, 2018\n\n\n\n\nScottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie described Mr Corbyn’s position as “extraordinary”, as he reiterated his party’s opposition to another “isive” referendum.\n\n“So many people with moderate and progressive views will be horried by this careless attitude towards the UK,” he said.\n\n“The case against independence is even stronger since the SNP’s Growth Commission admitted what we said about independence in 2014 was right.”\n\nThe SNP was elected on a manesto that said the Scottish Parliament should have the right to hold another referendum  there is a signicant and material change in the circumstances that existed in 2014.\n\nSNP depute leader Keith Brown said: “We already have the democratic mandate to give the people of Scotland a choice over their future – a position backed by the Scottish Parliament. For any prime minister to stand in the way of that would be a democratic outrage.\n\n“Of course, it used to be the case that Labour thought the people of Scotland were sovereign and should determine their own future. Now, apparently, it’s down to the whim of the MP for Islington North.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"storm bronagh set to batter parts of the uk and ireland","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Drivers of other vehicles should be aware of sudden gusts of wind which can affect handling and braking, and give high-sided vehicles, caravans and motorbikes plenty of space.”\n\nOn Wednesday, a wind gust of 91mph was recorded in County Down, Northern Ireland, the strongest in September in Northern Ireland since records began.\n\nIn County Galway, a woman, named locally as Elvira Ferraii and said to have been aged in her 50s, died when the caravan she was staying in at the remote beauty spot in Clden ecoBeach Camping and Caravan Park blew off the clf and smashed on to the beach below.\n\n\nRoad users in the North East and North West of England are reminded to take care this evening ... currently strong winds in the North of England.

Renvyle Post Office being buffeted by the storm. \n\nWith the building’s owner away on holiday, neighbour Liam Diamond thought quickly and called local plant hire firm Graham Heanue, who arrived swtly with an excavator and secured the roof with its bucket.\n\n\nNeighbours to the rescue, managed to prevent the roof from blowing off and onto a busy street where it would have surely caused accidents and injuries. \n#StormAli\n \n@MetEireann\n \n@IanDempsey\n \n@joeliveline\n \n@NewstalkFM\n \n@rtenews\n \n@HenryMcKean\n \n@Galwaybayfmnews\n \npic.twitter/QELt5sL7cm\n\n— Diego  \nSeptember 19, 2018\n\n\n\n\nLiam’s daughter Priscilla Diamond, who filmed the incident, warned the roof could have caused injuries had it blown off. \n\n“To the front of that building is the main road, it was busy with children going to school, people going to work and customers using the post office,” Priscilla told the Press Association. \n\n“It was not going to last much longer and could have caused injuries or accidents  left to fly away.”\n\nPriscilla’s brother Diego Diamond said the bucket was still holding the roof in place a day later, but that a builder has arrived to temporarily secure it.\n\n“I was fearful that some auld buck would park up in front and the roof would land on them,” the 32-year-old local business owner said. \n\n“We’re just neighbours and for public safety more than anything we took action to prevent possible fatalities.”\n\nA second named storm, Bronagh, is set to batter parts of the UK and Ireland over the coming days, with more strong winds expected. \n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiego said he would like people to take some messages away from the video from Galway.\n\n“Take heed of weather warnings, tie down anything that could possibly cause damage , don’t leave loose s*** out around the house,” he said.\n\n“We were nearly hit by a few flying missiles while trying to prevent the roof from going.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch peta is saving the pets that were left behind after hurricane florence","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n

The group is calling for cast iron solutions at the Autumn summit.\n\nFounder Tanya McCamphill said: “Two years after the referendum on exiting the European Union there still is no agreed solution to prevent borders on the island of Ireland or down the Irish Sea.\n\n“It is widely recognised that a hard border in Ireland or down the Irish Sea would cause signicant social, economic and political challenges, yet still there is no agreed solution. \n\n“Our campaign reflects a growing anxiety that our way of le is under threat. For us, the issue of Brexit borders is much greater than trade or economics. It\u0027s about the lives of ordinary people - people who live day to day with the realities which politics imposes.\n\n\"We are in London asking for help to wake up those with power to the realities of the human cost of Brexit borders.\"\n\nThe group is opposed to any borders on the island of Ireland or down the Irish Sea and represents a cross-section of the community in the city who are becoming increasingly anxious that the voices of people from Northern Ireland are not being heard at the Brexit negotiating table.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\nThey will call on political leaders to ensure that the fears and concerns of all peoples are heard, and that an agreement at the EU Autumn Summit will ensure no hard borders are imposed after Brexit takes effect.\n\nMs McCamphill added: “We hear a lot of rhetoric and promises that there will be no hard border. In spite of that we have been given no cast iron solutions. We cannot be expected to just allow people to put their lives on hold and wait worrying about their futures.\n\n“For a long time we have been able to move freely from Derry to Donegal, Armagh to Louth, Belfast to Edinburgh, London to Dublin and so on. A hard border in the Irish Sea or in Ireland will impact on everyone’s freedom and the increasingly good relations that we have been fostering across these islands.\n\n“Derry Girls Against Borders want to empower the people who will be affected and we are not prepared to sit back in the hope that a solution will be reached. The impact of Brexit borders on our lives is much bigger than trade and economics. It’s about the emotional, psychological impact also and the signicant challenges any change will pose to our way of le. Where we come from things are complex, they are delicate and they require thoughtfulness. That thoughtfulness requires engagement and it requires listening to those who will be affected. \n\n“The freedoms and flexibilities we currently have protect our way of le, they protect the shared sense of belonging people right across our communities have. We do not believe that those concerns are part of the debate yet and they must be in order to achieve a satisfactory solution.\n\n“All we are asking is to be heard - and for those right across these islands to help us be heard. You don’t have to be from Derry - or be a girl - you just have to care. Help us, make them listen and stop Brexit borders.”\n\nTo sign the Derry Girls Against Borders petition on change.org, click here: \nhttps:www.change.org/p/dublin-london-belfast-and-brussels-hear-our-voices-and-stop-brexit-borders\n\nTo follow the campaign on social media: Twitter: @DerryGirlsAB Facebook: \nwww.facebook/DerryGirls\n Instagram: @derrygirlsagainstborders\n\n\nPictured above: A cross section of those who have shared their stories with Derry Girls Against Borders on how a Brexit border here will adversely affect their lives.\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"derry mp welcomes commencement a6 drumahoe dungiven","story":"\nSinn Féin MP Elisha McCallion has welcomed confirmation that work on the Drumahoe to Dungiven section of the A6 road upgrade will officially begin next Wednesday.\n\nThe Foyle MP said: \"News that the A6 dualling scheme between Drumahoe and Dungiven is set to begin next week is a positive step forward for the city. \n\n\"Work is already well underway on other sections of the A6 and when completed, this road upgrade will reduce journey times between Derry and Belfast which is vital for growing our economy and increasing connectivity.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\n\"It will also make it much easier for visitors and tourists to travel to the city. \n\n\"This has been made possible because of the work to take this vital infrastructure project forward carried out by Chris Hazzard as Infrastructure Minister. \n\n\"This, along with other key infrastructure projects such as the A5 and the transport hub at the old Waterside train station, will all enhance this city and district for locals and others.\" \n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"derry public urged stay safe high winds heavy showers continue","story":"\nA local councillor has urged people to take all necessary precautions as the stormy weather continues.\n\nSinn Féin Councillor Kevin Campbell  has advised the Derry public to heed the current amber weather warning issued by the Met Office.\n\nIt comes after trees and hoardings and roof tiles have blown down across the city.\n\n\"I would urge caution as driving conditions will be dangerous at times and rail, air and ferry services may be affected.  There is also the possibility of longer journey times and cancellations are possible,\" he said.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\n“All road users should take extra care of loose debris and be mindful that tree falls and some structural damage are possible.\n\n“Power cuts may occur, and I would advise members of the public to report any damage to poles or electricity lines immediately and to stay clear.\n\n“People should keep informed about the weather and act to protect yourself and your home from the effects of flooding and high winds, and importantly to heed safety warnings.”\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"mayor derrys family fun day take place weekend","story":"\nBrooke Park is the place to be this weekend as the Mayor invites local children along for some family fun.\n\nThe event is taking place this Saturday September 22, from 2pm – 5pm, with all donations in aid of the Mayor’s chosen charity, Foyle Search and Rescue.\n\nAnnouncing the event, the Mayor, Councillor John Boyle, said he was delighted to be hosting the event in the beautul grounds of the recently regenerated park.\n\n“Brooke Park has undergone a major transformation and recently the extensive work which has gone into the project has been recognised with a second Green Flag award.

However that didn\u0026rsquot faze him as he lined up in front of the live ITV4 cameras.\n\nHe stormed past championship leader Zamparelli on the opening lap to grab fourth place, before posting the fastest lap of the race sas he began to close in on the podium battle and pile the pressure on George Gamble ahead.\n\nSome robust defending from Gamble saw Harper forced onto the grass on a couple of occasions, but he was able to find his way past heading into Copse corner on the penultimate lap to take third position, which he held through to the finish.\n\nA time penalty for the driver ahead though ensured the Dromore High School student ended the weekend with a second place finish as part of a superb one-two-three finish for the JTR team, with the result putting Harper just one point shy of fourth in the championship standings.\n\nHarper said afterwards: \u0026ldquoI feel I\u0026rsquom really in my groove in the series now and I\u0026rsquom going to be giving it everything to try and continue our great pace and end the year in style at Brands Hatch GP, a circuit I love.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch woman’s invite to join charity Twilight Walk  ","story":"\t\t\t\nBALLYNAHINCH woman Rosalind Steenson is urging people to join her on the forthcoming Marie Curie Twilight Walk to raise funds for the leading cancer charity.\n\nThe event \u0026mdash which takes place on Friday, September 28 at 7.30pm \u0026mdash will be held in the beautul grounds of Barnett Demesne in South Belfast to raise funds for an organisation which provides care to people with a terminal illness in their own homes or in one of its nine hospices.\u0026nbsp\n\nThe charity is also a leader in research into the best ways of caring for people with a terminal illness and all the\u0026nbsp\n\nservices it provides are free of charge, with around 70% of its income coming via donations with the balance of funds provided by the NHS.\n\nThose taking part in the forthcoming Twilight Walk can expect much more than just a walk as there will be a festival atmosphere with music, entertainment and a spectacular firework display to finish off.\n\nPeople take part in the walk for all sorts of reasons, with a large proportion walking in memory of someone they have lost.\u0026nbsp\n\nRosalind will be remembering her best friend of over 30 years, Michelle Watterson, who died in the Marie Curie Hospice in Belfast in July.\n\n\u0026ldquoMichelle was diagnosed with cancer for the second time three years ago and, unfortunately, it spread to other parts of her body and became terminal, she explained.\n\n\u0026ldquoShe spent her final ten days at the hospice where she received exceptional care.

Even  you start out walking by yourself, you are never alone along the Camino.\n\nThe Camino Portugues, or the Portuguese Way, spans from Lisbon to Santiago de Compostela, the final destination being St James\u0026rsquo Church, where the body of St James is said to lay.\n\nIt travels through the province of Galicia in northern Spain, going through the cities of Porto and Pontevedra and along the coastline of Sanxenxo, the Cies Islands, and Baiona.\n\nWhile this Camino way was shorter that the more arduous Camino Del Norte throughout the northern Basque area of Spain, Edmund said that there were other challenges.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoThe biggest challenge was walking in extreme heat, said Edmund. \u0026ldquoIt was 38 degrees on one day but for the rest of the days it was around 28 degrees. Staying hydrated was also a challenge.\n\nEdmund also enjoys the feeling of having to travel from one hostel to another with just the bare basics, as he says it gives him an understanding of what le is like for those with transitory lestyles.\n\nHowever, he adds: \u0026ldquoThere\u0026rsquos a great togetherness and camaraderie as everyone is doing it together.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"First look inside new £16m Down Leisure Centre with ‘wow factor’  ","story":"\t\t\t\nTHE new \u0026pound16m Down Leisure Centre, which opens its doors to the public in November, has the wow factor those closely involved in its design always promised it would have.\n\nWhile very much a community facility, the ultra-modern and futuristic three-storey building boasts a stunning range of facilities which would rival any of those more commonly found in leisure complexes attached to five star hotels.\n\nWhile the finishing touches are being put to the 6,500 square metre, three-storey Market Street building, the Down Recorder was last week given a sneak preview of the stunning new centre that has been a long time coming.\u0026nbsp\n\nPlans for the new complex were first discussed well over a decade ago and despite raised eyebrows about building the centre in front of the ageing facility it will replace, everything has gone smoothly with council officials delighted they now have a leisure complex that will be the envy of many.\u0026nbsp\n\nThey are confident that once the centre opens its doors to the public, people will recognise the long wait for a new leisure complex has been worth it, with the new vitality suite on the top floor which boasts a sauna, steam room and small pool with its own mini fountain, particularly stunning.\n\nThe spacious and airy entrance foyer opens up to reveal two swimming pools, one of which has a moveable floor. There is a reception, lobby area and ground floor studio with Newry, Mourne and Down Council\u0026rsquos corporate colours a recurring theme throughout the building.\n\nThere are dedicated changing facilities on the ground floor with the pools designed for use by people of all abilities. The smaller of the two pools measures eight metres by 13, while the main 25-metre pool boats six lanes and electronic touch pads to time races.\n\nThroughout the building, every effort has been made to flood it with as much natural light as possible which helps provide the centre with its imposing look. A boccia court designed for use by disabled bowlers is also located on the ground floor, with this particular area also doubling up as a dance studio and multipurpose hall.\n\nCouncil officials have also revealed the new centre\u0026rsquos ground floor level is higher than the main road outside to protect the building from future flooding that may occur in this part of the town and which was a signicant problem a number of years ago.\n\nModern sound proofing techniques have been deployed throughout the building, particularly in the swimming pool and main hall areas. When the natural light fades,\u0026nbsp subtle, state-of-the-art LED lighting illuminates the building, adding to its unique character.\n\nMains gas was connected to the building which also boasts a combined heat and power source which helps minimise its carbon footprint with photovoltaic cells on the roof helping heat the water in the pools and shower systems across a number of changing room areas. In addition, air source heat pumps sucks in cold air from the outside and turns into warm air.\n\nSo-called ocalux glass allows natural light to stream into the building on the ground floor, also reducing glare and preventing people from outside looking in.\n\nThere are miles of pipework and electric cables with the plant room \u0026mdash the new leisure complex\u0026rsquos nerve centre \u0026mdash resembling something akin to the interior of a futuristic space ship.\n\nThe impressive four court hall on the first floor can be used for a iety of sports, including badminton, basketball and five-a-side football. One of the walls has also been specially marked at the request of the Down Handball Club.\u0026nbsp\n\nAs with the ground floor swimming pools, there is also a dedicated viewing area over the main hall, while nearby there is a dedicated area for racquet ball and handball.\n\nA spin studio and multi-purpose area are also located on the second floor, with all music and sound systems built in and controlled from the main reception area.\n\nThe third floor boasts spectacular views across to Down Cathedral, the Dromara Hills, the Mournes and across Dunleath Park towards the Vianstown area.\n\nWhen not admiring the views, users can immerse themselves in getting fit or pampering themselves in the vitality suite. The third floor boasts an 85-station fitness suite and fitness room that can be hired by sports clubs to use. Council officials say the use of the top floor will evolve over time and has the capacity to respond to need.\n\nEach of the eight beams which hold the top floor in place weigh 35 tonnes and had to be put in place overnight as part of a military-style operation which involved heavy lting gear and went without a hitch.\n\nThe vitality area extenuates the wow factor, featuring a relaxation pool alongside steam and sauna rooms, with the careful attention to detail in the design process accentuating this particular area where people can relax and unwind. There is also a dedicated lt to take people from the swimming pool area directly to the top floor.\n\nCouncil director Michael Lipsett said the new leisure centre was top of his in-tray when he joined the local authority eight years ago.\n\nSince then, he has attended countless meetings to propel the scheme forward and is delighted ratepayers will soon have an opportunity to use a centre which the district can be justiably be very proud of.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe long wait has been worth it and this is a fantastic building which I have no doubt people will appreciate and enjoy. It will also be a pleasure for our leisure staff to move to a modern building.\n\nMr Lipsett added: \u0026ldquoI have watched the building grow from the drawing board and to finally see it nearly complete is really something else. Everyone associated with the building, from the designers to the builders and the councillors who supported it financially deserve credit.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoTheir collective efforts have produced a magnicent building that would not be out of place in the private sector. That\u0026rsquos how good this building is.\n\nOnce staff move in and the old leisure complex has been decommissioned, it will be bulldozed to provide a major new car park at the rear. Ahead of the opening, council officials plan to organise a series of visits to provide the public with a glimpse of the spectacular new 21st century leisure centre.\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C September 19%2C 1978  ","story":"\t\t\t\nDOWNPATRICK \u0026mdash Downpatrick\u0026rsquos old town hall is to be turned into a training centre for out of work teenagers in an exciting \u0026pound500,000 initiative to combat the district\u0026rsquos growing youth unemployment problem.\n\nWork has already begun on clearing the hall and the centre is to expected to be fully operational by January next year with room for up to 30 trainees. Organised by a newly named community group \u0026mdash Lecale Training Workshops Ltd \u0026mdash the scheme will cater for young people between the ages of 16 and 19.\n\nLatest unemployment figures put the total number out of work in that age group in Down district at almost 500. The aim\u0026nbsp\n\nbehind the new centre is to give them work experience and provide them with basic skills in a iety of jobs.\n\nThe idea for the new community group is the brainchild of Mr Bill Hampton, of Down District Trades Union Council. Lending a hand is Downpatrick man Mr Malachi Curran, who is head of the Department of Manpower Services in Northern Ireland.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe whole idea has ben introduced to help young people who have been unemployed to prepare for work, Mr Curran said. \u0026ldquoIt isn\u0026rsquot an apprenticeship, but rather is aimed at teaching them basic skills and perhaps helping them choose the type of career they want to follow.\n\nMr Curran said that they hoped to be able to put anything up to 250 young people through the course inside five years.\n\nCLOUGH \u0026mdash The death toll on a road outside Clough climbed to five in three years when a young motorcyclist was killed on Sunday. He was 19 year-old Andrew Stephen Martin, of Ascot Park in Belfast.\n\nMr Martin was involved in a head-on collision with a car at a spot known as the Rectory on the Ballykinlar-Clough Road. The accident happened at approximately 2pm and Mr Martin died about two hours later in Downe Hospital.\n\nThe driver of the car, who was a soldier based at Ballykinlar camp, was taken to the Downe, but was later transferred to the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast suffering from severe facial injuries.\n\nMr Frank Greeves, a local lorry driver, told the Recorder that it one of the most dangerous bends he had ever seen. He asked: \u0026ldquoHow many more lives have to be lost before something is done?\n\nA DoE spokesman said there were no plans to carry out work on the road.\n\nSTRANGFORD \u0026mdash A party of 130 mentally and physically handicapped children and young adults went cruising on Strangford Lough free of charge on Tuesday \u0026mdash courtesy of the Downpatrick Division of the DoE Roads Service.\n\nThe group\u0026rsquo aged between 12 and 25, came from the Downpatrick area and were accompanied by parents and volunteers. They left Strangford in the morning on the MV Portaferry to explore wildle and points of interest on the lough.\n\nThe idea of the cruise originated with the staff of the Downpatrick Roads Division who realised that the ferry \u0026mdash often used for educational and pleasure cruises by many groups \u0026mdash was also ideally suited for use by handicapped people because of its ramps and high sides.\n\nThe crew for the outing worked their rest day without payment and the other overheads for running the boat were written off by the DoE as normal test running. Ready Mix concrete stepped in to provide refreshments.\n\nMr Ray Carter, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State and Minister with responsibility for the DoE, was there to see the children off on their cruise.\n\n\u0026ldquoThis a fine and warming gesture by the crews of the ferries to give up their free time. I know to look at the happy faces around me that their kindness is very well received.\n\nKILLYLEAGH \u0026mdash A scheme to turn Killyleagh harbour into a boat and leisure centre has proved to be the straw which broke the back of a group of local residents. Already 104 residents have signed a petition against the scheme which has received outline planning permission.\n\nPut forward by Mr Robert Morrow, a local coal merchant and businessman, it sets out his hopes to construct pontoon jetties, a clubhouse, toilet block, bar, restaurant, chandlery, workshop and car parking spaces.\n\nThe residents, while believing that there is an urgent need for the harbour to be brought up to an acceptable standard, feel that the scheme falls short of that is required and that it is likely to have a \u0026ldquomost undesirable impact on the residential area surrounding the site.\n\nRATHMULLAN \u0026mdash The Rathmullan Mound is to stay \u0026mdash or at least the best part of it is. After four months of intensive archaeological digging, experts have ruled that the Mound is too valuable to be removed, though they have taken away the top section.\n\nBut although the Department of the environment has put a protection order on the site it will not be taking the Mound into public ownership in the way it has done with other ancient monuments.\n\nThat decision is expected to anger local historians and Down councillors, who have been battling to save the monument from demolition and who have called for it to be taken into public charge.\n\nThe Mound is a rath dating back to early Christian times, with evidence of five dferent settlements from 700 AD to the 16th century. The top section, which is Norman, has been removed, though all of the archaeologist\u0026rsquos findings have been carefully preserved.\n\nOne of the most exciting discoveries was a large souterrain, or underground passage. This 1,000 year-old chamber was used by early inhabitants of the area and is still as perfect in parts as it was when it was first built.\n\nBALLYGOWAN \u0026mdash Female wrestling comes to Ballygowan in a big way tonight when Blackfoot Sue takes the ring at The Squire\u0026rsquos Inn.\n\nThe shapely wrestler from the USA gets to grips with another lady grappler, Manchester\u0026rsquos Miss Lena. The bout is sure to be the star attraction at this initial venture by the Ballygowan night spot.\n\nBut several other star bouts are on the programme, including world middleweight champion Adrian Street, Prince Jitsu and Bruce McDonald.\n\nARDGLASS \u0026mdash Hugh Duggan, the newly appointed progressional at Ardglass Golf Club, took up his position at the seaside club on Monday. Twenty four year-old Hugh, formerly attached to Kirkistown Castle Golf Club, becomes only the second professional golfer appointed to the club in its 84-year history.\n\nHis appointment, combined with many other improvements both on and off the course, has made Ardglass one of the most progressive clubs in Co Down.\n\nBALLYNAHINCH \u0026mdash Ballynahinch piper Ian Jess took second place in the All-Ireland solo piping championships at Banbridge Technical College on Saturday.\n\nIan was placed second in the march section and third in the reel and strathspey section, but had to be content to finish runner-up behind Tom Anderson, from Dublin.\n\nIan is tutored by Joe McAdam, the pipe major at Ballynahinch, and is now regarded as one of the best pipers in the country.\n\nKILMORE \u0026mdash A former pupil of Down High School has obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Lancaster. He is John James McIlhone, from Kilmore, Crossgar, who graduated with a second class honours BA ision one in history.\n\nIn the junior section Richard Parkes, of Field Marshal Montgomery, came out on top.\n\nSAINTFIELD \u0026mdash A woman was taken to hospital on Saturday night after two cars were involved in an accident on the Crossgar Road, Saintfield.

This was the product of gathering together his late father\u0026rsquos copious notes on the history of the town.\n\nThe society\u0026rsquos other founding members included Mr Robert Brown, an agent for Dunleath Estates who was treasurer, Down County Council official Mr Robert Maxwell, who was secretary, and the Rev John Radclfe, who was chairman.\n\nOther society members included other local clergy, headmasters, representatives of professions and local businesses and iniduals who were interested in local history.\n\nThe first meeting took place in Denvir\u0026rsquos Hotel where it continued to meet every month for several decades. At this meeting the objects of the Society were outlined \u0026ndash to encourage and foster interest in the history and traditions of Downpatrick and County Down, music, arts and sciences and the architecture of buildings and monuments of historic or artistic value in the area.\n\nThe following day\u0026rsquos Down Recorder reported that Mr Parkinson gave the first lecture of The Downe Society, fittingly on the subject, The Story of Downpatrick, in which he spoke about man reaching Ireland some seven thousand years ago, through to the ravages of the Norsemen, De Courcy and the Normans, the Fitzgeralds, Cromwells, Southwells and into the eighteen century.\u0026nbsp\n\nHis closing words were on the urban administration of the day with a sense of the historic past and the hope of future well-being.\u0026nbsp\n\nIn 1948, the formation of the Society was a signicant attempt to bring together people from all sections of the community, particularly across the religious ide. Both The Downe Society, and its later partner, the Lecale Historical Society, maintained a proud non-sectarian record.\u0026nbsp\n\nOver the years, the society hosted many outstanding speakers including a Lord Chief Justice, local author Lynn C.

His greeting at a youth Mass in Galway where he declared \u0026lsquoyoung people of Ireland, I love you\u0026rsquo became a stand out moment, replayed on television on countless occasions since. My own childhood involved attending Mass at the Graan and serving as an altar boy in St Michael\u0026rsquos Church in Enniskillen with many of my primary school classmates. We were lucky too that for much of my childhood our pastoral leadership was led by Father Brian D\u0026rsquoArcy who preached a message of tolerance, ersity in the church, compassion for the complexities of le and the experiences that shape them. Even when a stream of disturbing disclosures arose that challenged the Church and its response to clerical abuse and coverup, Father Brian\u0026rsquos consistently strong and unequivocal demand for accountability, truth, justice and recovery for victims offered a pathway for the institutional church to remain connected with its members.\n  My own le journey took me to Dublin in 1999 and what I discovered very quickly was that the message of compassion, openness and truth that I had faithfully followed and listened to every Sunday did not reflect the views and actions of the hierarchy either in Ireland or in the Vatican. Like many people of faith I found this not just challenging but chilling.\u0026nbsp\n  As I embarked on a legal career in human rights law I spent many days hearing story after story of adults recalling their experiences of abuse and brutal actions at the hands of clergy and lay people at the Residential Institutions Redress Board.\u0026nbsp\n  Those stories will never leave me. Sine then, the full impact of church and state abuse has come through my office door clerical sexual abuse, church authority cover ups, Magdalene laundries, the cruel operation of mother and baby homes, where many single mothers lost their babies to a regime of illegal adoptions and told they had committed a mortal sin. We have been witness to church intolerance towards lone parents, women, advocates of shared education, access to certain healthcare services, separated couples and the LGBT community.\n  And so when I was given a ticket to the Pope\u0026rsquos Mass last weekend I thought long and hard about attending. I could see that for many people of faith this was an opportunity to gather as a church community and celebrate their faith, their God and their Christianity.\u0026nbsp\n  On the other hand I could see that for many victims of the Church the Pope\u0026rsquos visit resurrected those deep seated and enduring feelings of hurt, trauma and damage that has never been properly addressed with actions.\u0026nbsp\n  So many victims have said to me that the abuse itself is not nearly as bad as the culture of cover up, the systemic efforts to sideline and disbelieve victims, to hide evidence and wrongdoers from a process that would lead to truth, justice and love for the victim and their families.\u0026nbsp\n  So I ended up last Sunday foregoing the papal Mass and standing for truth with nearly 10,000 other citizens in Dublin City Centre. It was a personal choice. I am glad now I made that choice. I am sad that the Vatican and the leadership of the Church still don\u0026rsquot get it. Still don\u0026rsquot acknowledge that abuse wasn\u0026rsquot simply perpetrated on children by inidual wrongdoers but that their many violations were facilitated, covered up and enabled by Bishops, Archbishops and Cardinals all the way to the Vatican.\n  Ireland has changed utterly since 1979. It is reflected in all the societal changes that have taken place in the last thirty nine years. It is reflected in the fact that the people of Dublin were much more interested and welcoming of the Queen than the Pope.\u0026nbsp\n  It turns out that Pope John Paul was wrong when he said back in 1979 that he loved the young people of Ireland. The Church showed anything but love to all those they have hurt and damaged.\u0026nbsp\n  They have even now showed a lamentable lack of capacity to lead, to acknowledge, to take ownership of their failings and to take actions rather than deliver honeyed words. This visit was a massive opportunity to reverse the damage caused. The opportunity has been missed.\n                                    \n                \n                \n                \n                    \nThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisation\u0027s Editors\u0027 Code of Practice.

Even  you didn\u0026rsquot know the first thing about the place other than it was old, it was still clearly an important part of the history of Belfast.\u0026nbsp\n  After the fire, the past of the Bank Buildings became known and many lamented at the thought of losing such a piece of the past: for it to be turned to rubble and replaced with something nondescript. It\u0026rsquos easy to forget that while inanimate, buildings do have character and tell the story of a city in a way that brings it right into the present.\n  But with all that said, it seems now that the fire has been extinguished, some seem more concerned with preserving what is left of the building rather than putting the le back into Belfast. While it has been deemed structurally sound, some debris has still been falling when the wind has swooped through in the wrong direction and with the first storm of the season forecast for this week, the real integrity will only be known now.\n  For more than a fortnight, a firm cordon has been put in place around the burnt-out building and businesses in the immediate area have reported a severe drop in trade, with some stating their footfall has fallen by more than half. With the cordon expected to be in place until after Christmas, there are fourteen businesses within it who cannot open at all.\n  That\u0026rsquos not to say that nothing is being done to try and help those businesses.\u0026nbsp\n  Belfast City Council is working with other agencies to try and find alternative premises for these businesses and to ensure that they will not be left out of pocket for something that essentially amounted to sheer bad luck.\u0026nbsp\n  For businesses still open but noticing a fall in trade, signage has been placed to direct people around the cordon to ensure they can still move around the city centre. Translink too are doing their bit by offering a free shuttle bus that goes from St. Georges Market to the city centre every ten minutes.\n  Events such as fashion shows and promotional meals have been scheduled and there has also been the launch of the \u0026ldquoYour Belfast campaign which aims to encourage shoppers back into the city.\n  I\u0026rsquod say that you can\u0026rsquot fault them for trying, but I do see a few issues with all that is going on.\n  It\u0026rsquos not that I begrudge Belfast having their campaign. I really don\u0026rsquot. Their local economy is certainly going to have taken a hit following the fire and hats off to those trying to make the best of the bad situation, but I don\u0026rsquot think they\u0026rsquore going about it in the best way.\n  If people want to go to Primark, then put on subsidised shuttle buses for them. The company seem to have been brilliant in looking after their staff and sending them off to other stores despite losing thousands of profit a day with the loss of their flagship store and should be supported for that.\n  If you look at the list of businesses that are completely closed due to the fire, they include the likes of Tesco, a charity shop, McDonalds and of course, Primark. Only three or four of the shops would be generally considered higher end and are places where you plan to go to rather than just meander into as you\u0026rsquore passing.\u0026nbsp\n  If I was in Belfast and need to pick up groceries or want to see  there are any gems in the charity shops, a free bus to Victoria Square isn\u0026rsquot going to do me much good.\n  A fashion show showcasing the latest designer trends Belfast has to offer isn\u0026rsquot going to be of much interest to those who focus on affordability rather than ensuring that a print or certain cut is in vogue.\u0026nbsp\n  As the news of the Primark fire broke, many people spoke of how both they and their parents before them had depended on the store\u0026rsquos low prices when times were tough. To see a campaign promoting higher cost clothing must feel a little insensitive to those who now are worrying about where they\u0026rsquoll be buying their winter jumpers and endless pairs of gloves to replace those that keep getting lost in the schoolyard.\n  We wouldn\u0026rsquot have had the \u0026ldquoYour Belfast marketing campaign had it not been for the Primark fire so I can understand why it is focused on Belfast, but I feel that there\u0026rsquos huge scope to promote the whole of Northern Ireland as viable alternatives.\u0026nbsp\n  We all know that Belfast is still open for business so no amount of cajoling is going to make someone go there  they don\u0026rsquot want to but perhaps those in Belfast aren\u0026rsquot as aware of what other towns across the province have to offer.\n  The advert lists qualities that Belfast is said to have but it\u0026rsquos nothing unique. Here in Enniskillen, we\u0026rsquore also strong, proud and together. We too have great local music to offer and can offer a great night out. We also love our food, enjoy shopping trips and look out for one another.\n  We may not have had a fire, but our high street needs support too. Traders have been complaining about high rents and rates for years so there\u0026rsquos quite a high turnover rate of independent shops and small chain branches.\u0026nbsp\n  People go to where the cheapest prices are but small businesses can\u0026rsquot afford to lower their prices to match local competition so they risk losing out on trade. It\u0026rsquos a situation where no-one really wins. If the Belfast campaign is to be a more long-term one, then they should widen it to include everywhere. Promote the highlights of each county and make it accessible to all.\u0026nbsp\n  If Translink brought back open  tickets, I\u0026rsquom sure we\u0026rsquod see a marked increase in people coming here for a weekend break. Some people are understandably cautious of driving in unfamiliar places, especially towns but four hours on a bus in one day doesn\u0026rsquot leave much time for relaxing or shopping.\n                                    \n                \n                \n                \n                    \nThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisation\u0027s Editors\u0027 Code of Practice.

This year the RUAS are delighted to welcome Paul Trapp, who is travelling from Wisconsin, USA, to judge. The event is also a great chance to interact with 200 dairy related trade exhibitors on the most relevant technological advances, dficulties and solutions in the industry. \u0026nbsp\n  Rhonda Geary, Operations Director, RUAS said: \u0026ldquo2015 saw the move of Winter Fair to our new purpose built exhibition venue, Eikon Exhibition Centre at Balmoral Park. The move has worked brilliantly and attracted one of the largest attendances to date. In preparation for the 31st Winter Fair we have increased the livestock accommodation and now have stalling, washing and milking facilities for 200 cattle. There is 4750m2 of exhibition space and a full house of 200 trade stands. \u0026nbsp\n  During the Winter Fair there is a busy Seminar Suite with talks presented every half hour from 11am until 3.30pm.\n  Dr. John Bailey from AFBI will speak about better phosphorous management, Bobby Irwin of United Feeds presents a paper on getting the lactation to the right start and Roberta Simmons of the YFCU and Barclay Bell, President of the UFU will speak about succession on farms.\n  CAFRE\u0026rsquos Martin Mulholland will be advising on feed efficiency this winter, making optimum use of grass silage \u0026nbspwhile Christopher Osborne form the UFU will speak about dairy commodity markets and the prospects for 2017.\n  Dr. Sam Strain and Sharon Verner from the Animal Health and Welfare Northern Ireland will look at improved biosecurity and BVD while Jessica Sloss from Red Tractor, speaks about the farm assurance scheme.\n  The live calf rearing demonstration will be making a  for the 2016 Show. \u0026nbspGorteade Cow Care owned by Barry O\u0026rsquoLoughlin will be displaying a fully ing calf igloo with veranda and Heatwave ad lib calf feeder.\u0026nbsp\n  One of the innovative technological features at next week\u0026rsquos Winter Fair will be the Northern Ireland launch of the CalfApp and Calf Cloud by Volac which won gold at Eurotier in Hannover. It gives information about changes in drinking pattern and fluid intakes and monitors calf health.\n  The launch of the Winter Fair was held at Draynes Farm, near Lisburn, where Michael Drayne led a tour of agricultural journalists and industry representatives around his farm and milk bottling plant. The milk botting plant began when his father began with a horse and cart. Now the business has a fleet of vans distributing milk and dairy produces to customers in four counties. However their products are supplied to customers across Ireland through the Henderson Food Service and other companies.\n  The borehole gives Draynes Farm a constant supply of water which is also useful to soften the mains water for washing.\n  A 50KVA solar panel plant has been installed on the roofs of some of the buildings.\n  Draynes Farm processes 5m litres of milk per year and operates Monday to Friday with their own supply of 1.2 million litres of farm milk held over the weekend until the beginning of a new week. A total of 35 staff are employed in all departments.\n  The Draynes Farm dairy herd uses three Lely Astronaut A4 milking robots. The cows visit the robots on average 3.1 times per day averaging 33 litres per day with some exceeding 50litres.

But others around the town expressed disappointment.\n\n\nThe North Antrim seat at Westminster has been filled by a Paisley for almost 50 years.\n\n\nIan Paisley has been an MP since 2010 when he successfully retained his father\u0026#39s seat, winning almost 50% of the vote. Lord Bannside had held the seat since 1970.\n\n\nThe enduring popularity of the Paisley brand among many was clearly evident within moments of Mr Paisley emerging from his constituency office as drivers beeped their car horns at him, many giving him the thumbs up.\n\n\nOn a brief walkabout, the political veteran attracted a lot of attention with one car even pulling over despite traffic for the chance to shake his hand and tell him they had been up all night for news of the petition.\n\n\nMr Paisley flashed his trademark smile at the supporter and quipped: You\u0026#39re braver than me, I had a good sleep.\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\tNorth Antrim MP Ian Paisley in Ballymena\n\t\t\n\n\nJoy Williamson said she believes Mr Paisley has learned his lesson.\n\n\nHe did something wrong but I don\u0026#39t think it was anything that others haven\u0026#39t done, she told Press Association.\n\n\nKathy Burnett also said she accepted Mr Paisley\u0026#39s apology and insisted he is a good MP.\n\n\nI think they should just leave things the way they are, she said.\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\tKathy Burnett in Ballymena after North Antrim MP Ian Paisley kept his seat when a recall petition failed to attract enough signatures.

negotiations on the Brexit deal needed to be ramped up after Theresa May told European leaders Chequers was the only route to a deal.\n\n                \nSimon Coveney said that while Mrs May’s government did not agree with the European Union’s text for the withdrawal treaty, it had failed to bring its own alternative.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nDescribing the consequences of a no-deal Brexit as “damaging and severe”, Mr Coveney said there was an onus on the negotiation teams to find a solution.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe issue about how to avoid a hard border and an agreement on the Irish backstop was still to be resolved.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThe tanaiste said that while a lot had been achieved to date, negotiations needed to be stepped up.\n\n“It will take an intensication of negotiations in Brussels between the two negotiation teams on the details of how the backstop works,” he said.\n\n“That intensication has not happened to the extent that it needs to get this done.\n\n“We don’t have proposed legal text from UK despite the fact we have a UK spokesperson saying it doesn’t agree with the approach of the EU.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier is reworking the offer it put forward earlier this year in a bid to address concerns raised by the prime minister.\n\nMr Coveney added: “What they are talking about is a de-dramatised minimum amount of practical checks that are needed so that the EU can ensure it protects the integrity of the single market and customs union.\n\n“I think Theresa May is very genuine in her commitment to a backstop and is determined in finding a way forward in that.”\n\nMr Coveney added that Brexit would be a “lose, lose, lose” for Britain, adding that its influence on the world would be diminished as a result of leaving the EU.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nHe  said: “The consequences of a no-deal Brexit are so damaging and so severe, in particular for Britain, but also having a negative impact on Ireland. There is an onus on all involved in these negotiations to find a way through.”\n\nMr Coveney made the comments as he unveiled a campaign to help Irish businesses prepare for Brexit.\n\n

Association, and of possessing a document bearing an oath of allegiance to the paramililtary organisation, was handed a three-year sentence on Thursday. \n\n                \nSending David Coleman to prison, Judge Geoffrey Miller said the evidence presented to the court suggested the 32-year old’s responsibility within the UDA was at a “local level” as opposed to a him being a “directing figure.”\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nFreedom Corner on the Newtownards Road in east Belfast where are there UDA symbols, pictures of gunmen, loyalist slogans and the crest of the Ulster Young Militants.\u0027Picture By: Arthur Allison.\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe judge also described the UDA as an illegal organisation steeped in “brutal thuggery, extortion and drug dealing ... which offers nothing to the community it leeches off”.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nColeman, a father-of-one from The Green in Holywood, was charged with two terrorist offences following searches of properties connected to him last summer, namely belonging to the UDA on dates between November 6, 2016 and October 18, 2017, and of possessing a document likely to be useful for terrorism.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nDespite initially denying the offences, Coleman - who Belfast Crown Court heard was originally from the Shankill area of Belfast - subsequently pleaded guilty to the charges, and was handed a three-year sentence. He was told he will serve 18 months in custody, followed by 18 months in licence when he is released.\n\nBefore passing sentence, Judge Miller was told by a Crown prosecutor that a number of items were seized during searches of properties linked to Coleman on June 19 last year.\n\nIn one property, police saw a black UFF flag flying at the front of the house, while a mobile phone was located in a second house.  \n\nThe prosecutor revealed that a deleted text was sent to multiple recipients from the phone, which said : “Lads the more ya look around the more ya realise were defo back on our feet and it feels gd when the world put us down and laughed at us not to many laughing now is there but always keep our feet on the floor we don’t show of or act big lads we dont need to and its done us wonders no fighting or shit we any of were coming togeather building abit at a time it a team effort it cant work we out team work and our teams gd and were doing things that ppl said couldnt d done well the last two years say it all the future lads togeather and go forward watp qs 2nd batt c coy.” \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nOne person responded by writing “QS bro.”\n\nThe prosecutor said it was the Crown’s case that the text was linked to the UDA - especially Coleman’s use of ‘watp’ for ‘we are the people’ and ‘QS’ for ‘Quis Separabit’. He also revealed that images were found on the phone, including pictures of Coleman at UDA/C Company murals on the Shankill.\n\nThe court heard further searches were carried out, and on October 17 last year police recovered a document used to swear an oath of allegiance to the UDA and which bore Coleman’s fingerprints. The prosecutor said: “Also recovered was a great deal of material indicative of membership.”\n\nThe prosecutor added Coleman’s criminal record - which includes offences for rioting, robbery and carrying an imitation firearm - was a “signicant aggravating factor.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nDefence barrister Charles MacCreanor QC said Coleman’s plea should be welcomed by the Crown, as there would have been dficulties in prosecuting the case as a majority of the evidence against his client was “hearsay and circumstantial.”\n\nPointing out Coleman’s plea indicated an acceptance of responsibility, Mr MacCreanor spoke of the mundane nature of the texts, which he said were “certainly not organising criminal activity.”\n\nThe barrister also addressed Coleman’s criminal record, telling the court he was charged with disorderly behaviour at 14, and rioting at 15 and again at 16 - around the same time Coleman was expelled from school, with the barrister telling the court Coleman “fell in with what is often described as negative peers.”\n\n                            \n            \n

     \n\nMORE:\n \nIan Paisley thanks voters after narrowly surviving recall petition\n\nThe North Antrim MP was suspended from membership of the party on July 24 pending further investigation, after the House of Commons’ Standards Committee found he had committed “serious misconduct” in relation to his failure to declare two lavish family holidays paid for by the Sri Lankan government, then lobbying the UK government on their behalf.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nHe was also handed a 30-day ban from the House of Commons.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nIn a statement today, a DUP spokesperson said: “The internal processes surrounding these matters have been completed.  \n\n“On Tuesday, September 18 Mr Paisley was readmitted to membership of the party following a suspension of 57 days and upon re-admission he is subject to a number of conditions including a ban on holding office within the party for 12 months.”\n\nThe party said it would be making no further comment on these matters.\n\nIn the early hours of this morning, Mr Paisley learned that he had surviving a bid to oust him from his Westminster seat.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nHe clung on to his seat after the UK’s first ever recall petition fell just 444 votes short of the total required to force a by-election.\n\n\n\nStorm Bronagh to bring rain to Northern Ireland\n\n\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\nCookie Settings\n\n\n\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp
