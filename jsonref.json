He initiated a conversation, asking the boy where he was and what his plans were.Over the next six months the ex-minister sent messages, inviting him to events and to help leaflet for him in his constituency.The youngster told Mr Mackay he was only 16 on September 18. But the messages continued until February 1, 2020.His texts pressed the boy to meet up and one even described the youngster as \u0027really cute\u0027.The boy told the newspaper: \u0027When he asked me about my haircut and said I was cute, I was grossed out.\u0027 The contact with the boy was made through a variety of social media messages and text messages from a personal phone.It is understood Ms Sturgeon was first told some of the detail of the messages early on Wednesday evening, after the newspaper had contacted one of her special advisers. The First Minister then met Mr Mackay, who offered to resign.It was not publicly announced until shortly after 8am yesterday, when Miss Sturgeon\u0027s spokesman issued a statement in Mr Mackay\u0027s name. It said: \u0027I have behaved foolishly and I am truly sorry.\u0027I apologise unreservedly to the inidual involved and his family.\u0027Ms Sturgeon said he had taken \u0027full responsibility for his actions\u0027 and apologised to the inidual involved \u0027and to those he has let down\u0027. She confirmed only that Mr Mackay had been suspended by the SNP at First Minister\u0027s Questions yesterday lunchtime, after reading the full transcript of his exchanges with the boy.Asked if Ms Sturgeon was happy with Mr Mackay describing his acts as \u0027foolish\u0027, her spokesman said: \u0027Those are Derek\u0027s words.\u0027Mr Mackay did not attend Holyrood yesterday and was not seen at home in Bishopton, Renfrewshire.

Scottish finance Secretary Derek Mackay, 42, pictured left on his final photo call as a minister this week, and right with his estranged wife Jennifer in 2011Asked if she believed he could continue as an MSP, she said: \u0027He has issues to reflect on but the party having suspended him pending further investigation it is only right and proper that there is now space for that to happen.\u0027Clearly there are issues to be reflected on but it is inconsistent for the party to suspend him pending further investigation and then for me to immediately pre-empt the outcome of that. But I could not be clearer about my views of the seriousness and severity of the issues we are discussing.\u0027Asked about Ms Cherry\u0027s claim he had displayed \u0027grooming behaviour\u0027, Miss Sturgeon said: \u0027I haven\u0027t seen comments by Joanna Cherry but I cannot be clearer about how serious this is. It is for the police to decide if they think there is anything to be investigated.\u0027Last night, the mother of the boy said that her family would be willing to meet Miss Sturgeon, after the First Minister asked to be put in touch with them.She told the Scottish Sun: \u0027Of course I\u0027d be happy to meet Nicola Sturgeon if my son would like to do that.\u0027The boy also said that he would be willing to meet Miss Sturgeon but insisted his identity must remain anonymous.He said: \u0027When I heard he had actually quit I thought, \u0027Wow\u0027. I knew that meant he was admitting what he had done and that it was wrong. I accept his apology – kind of – but I wouldn\u0027t want to meet him in person.\u0027Mr Mackay will automatically be entitled to a £11,945 pay-off, which he will be awarded 90 days after he left office.It is understood opposition politicians will consider demanding a Standards Committee probe into whether to suspend him as an MSP. "},{"url":null,"title":"Touching moment Russian fishermen try help newborn seal pup whimpering ice","story":" While it is moved the seal appears calm and looks out over the side of its transport as the fishermen reach a road where they\u0027re waiting for a local animal rescue service.  One of the unnamed fishermen told reporters: \u0027We came to fish, it was dark outside when we heard a cry.          A group of fishermen stumbled upon and tried to help a seal pup (pictured) while they were working on Russia\u0027s Sakhalin island, which is in the Pacific Ocean north of Japan              The men comforted the whimpering animal (left) and used a sledge (right) to move it towards a road where they met a local animal rescue service\u0027First we thought it was a baby and started to look for it yet soon we noticed a newborn baby seal all alone.

But that’s the latest direction for the current incumbent, Simon Armitage.Armitage and his band LYR, which includes musician Richard Walters and producer and multi-instrumentalist Patrick Pearson, have signed to “post-classical” label Mercury KX, with their first single, Never Good With Horses, out on Friday, and their debut album Call in the Crash Team to follow in the spring.“We’re lining up some shows as well,” said Armitage. “Or as they call them in this business, gigs.” LYR will be appearing on 9 March in Leeds, and 10 March in London.Armitage said the songs on the first album started as “sort-of poems, hybrid things between songs and lyrics and poems”.“I quite often read them at events, but I think they were reaching out for tunes and musical setting,” he said. “This allows me to indulge an aspect of lyricism which is generally not available on the printed page.”Never Good With Horses, in which the poet’s downbeat recitation is joined by awkward keyboards, impassioned vocals and soaring strings, evokes the sadness at the end of a relationship. “That phrase ‘Never Good With Horses’ just drifted into my head one day and the whole thing just fell out of the title, like a venetian blind,” said Armitage. “The speaker is a woman describing her disenchantment with a partner who exhibits traditional male characteristics of insensitivity and a lack of empathy.”The poet described LYR’s music as “electronica, ambient, spoken word by definition – something quite genuinely hybrid”, with all 10 tracks adopting the perspective of a different fictional character. “They’re monologues or soliloquies from people in personal crises,” he said. “They’ve all been written since 2008, which probably has some bearing on that.”Armitage said he was not the only poet laureate to have released music, citing John Betjeman’s 1974 album Banana Blush – although Betjeman subsequently dismissed it as a “vulgar pop song record, a serious lapse in taste”. He also proposed a new party game, where players suggest the kind of band former laureates might have performed with: “Tennyson in some sort of grunge band, maybe.”But even though his voice features on Call in the Crash Team, the poet insisted he has no intention of breaking into song. “My singing days are over,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/095c768ae9929d05299ced339eabf036dab63592/0_28_4250_2550/master/4250.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=79b962c8c0355ba631887d7a512a2293","title":"treasure trove of effects goes to charles dickens museum in london","story":"Note to butler on how to serve gin punch is among letters acquired from US collectorCharles Dickens was precise with instructions for his dinner party: no champagne and as little wine as possible for guests before the food and definitely only he and his magazine editor friend to be given gin punch during the meal.“Basically don’t get them too trolleyed beforehand,” said Cindy Sughrue, explaining Dickens’s detailed note to his butler. He was also worried that some guests would not be up to spirits. “Dickens made his own gin punch, he loved it and and it could be quite strong.”The note is part of a remarkable collection of letters, manuscripts, original artworks and personal effects that have been acquired by the Charles Dickens museum in London.Sughrue, the museum’s director, said they were given the opportunity to cherry-pick the items that came from an enormous private collection in the US. It was a “treasure trove,” she said. “A true once in a lifetime moment for the museum.”More than 300 items have been purchased thanks to a £1.22m grant from the National Heritage Memorial Fund and contributions totalling £1.8m from the Art Fund, Friends of the National Libraries and the Dickens Fellowship.There are some true gems in the collection, said Sughrue, including Dickens’s note to his butler regarding dinner party arrangements. Under the heading “Wine”, he writes: “At supper, let there be a good supply of champagne all over the table. No champagne before supper, and as little wine as possible, of any sort, before supper.”The newly acquired letters give fascinating insights into Dickens’s character and state of mind. They are often just great reads in their own right.Sughrue said: “I love his letters whether published or unpublished because they are immediate, always passionate, often very funny and gloriously descriptive … you get unfiltered Dickens.”A good example is an unpublished letter that Dickens wrote from a rented house in Lausanne, Switzerland, in 1846 while he was writing Dombey and Son.Lausanne itself is dull, he writes, but around it is glorious. “Fancy walking from this place, as I was doing every day last week on to a sea of ice, unfathomable in depth, five and 20 miles long, and tossed up into immense waves, like the spires of Gothic Churches!The letters touch on his marriage, relationships, his reception in America and the time he got stuck up a mountain with Wilkie Collins. Some of the phrases he uses sound modern, not Victorian. “I have been writing my head off since ten o’clock,” he writes in one.Another letter shines a light on the grief he felt at the sudden death of his 17-year-old sister-in-law, Mary Hogarth, on whom he based Little Nell in The Old Curiosity Shop. The letter to his illustrator gives instructions for Nell’s death scene.“I want it to express the most beautiful repose and tranquility and wear something of a happy look, if death can,” he writes. “I am breaking my heart over this story and cannot bear to finish it.”The hoard also includes a delicate unfinished drawing of Dickens in chalk and pastels by Samuel Laurence. This original was assumed to have been lost.Sughrue said the anonymous collector had been a devoted Dickens fan since he read Oliver Twist as a child. He amassed a huge collection “with a real connoisseur’s eye he knew what he was looking for”.Mark Dickens, the museum’s chair and great-great-grandson, said the purchase was highly significant. “The museum already holds an impressive collection of Dickens-related material, and his quite staggering material brings us even closer to the man himself, his character, feelings, family and friends.”The new acquisitions will be researched, catalogued and conserved before going on display online and at the museum in Doughty Street in London."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/65ff8c8a085df08173ee7cdf1aa8bd81040459b9/395_0_3105_1864/master/3105.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bbb3009502ebeb919e50b909dce57870","title":"brexit regulation britain eu agencies sajid javid","story":"From medicines to aviation, Britain will need to replicate EU agencies, no matter what the chancellor wantsPutting the lead back in paint, the sewage back on beaches and enhancing the lethality of children’s toys. These are just some of the “opportunities” for deregulation offered in Sajid Javid’s call for the public to propose ways to erge from the EU rulebook.Slashing European regulation has long been an article of faith for the Tory party, fulfilling both its Thatcherite and Europhobic instincts. No matter that recent history – from the global financial crisis to the tragedy at Grenfell Tower – has taught us that regulation is a public good to be protected, not an evil to be eradicated.Just like Boris Johnson, Javid has learned to live outside history, eschewing any responsibility for his party’s decade in power. Brexit is presented as a fresh start for the country and the government. The idea of ergence is crucial to provide Brexit with a sense of purpose.But the truth is Brexit will create a more bureaucratic state rather than a more agile one. The UK now needs to build its own regulatory functions in Whitehall to replace those that were delegated to Brussels. From medicines to chemicals to aviation, the UK will need to replicate European agencies, no matter the chancellor’s ideological bent. Instead of sharing these regulatory functions with 27 other states, Britain will now need to shoulder the responsibility alone. Brexit will be a boon for British bureaucrats.Good regulation requires deep technical expertise. Neither the public, politicians nor commentators possess the expertise to judge whether medicines are safe or whether complex financial instruments pose a risk to economic stability. Brexit may have been the politics of the gut – the instinct that the country would be better off out – but it is only viable with a vast expansion in the number of technocrats.So what will these technocrats do? The fundamental error is to think that less burdensome regulation means a lower regulatory burden. In practice it means two sets of regulation to replace one, if the UK and the EU operate with different standards and rules – even if they are lighter touch here than across the Channel. That means complexity goes up, not down.Moreover, product markets are increasingly global, not local. So any firm that wants to export into the European single market will need to match its regulatory requirements. Products will be produced to the highest standards, not the lowest. For any goods produced here that firms want to export, deregulation is merely a mirage.There are some areas where Britain could realistically deregulate, though none are desirable. It could erode workers’ rights, lowering the cost of production. But we already have one of the most “flexible” labour markets in the world – and many Brexit voters expect more protection not less. The UK could cut back on environmental standards, but this would be inconsistent with commitments under the Paris climate agreement.While financial regulation was given effect by an EU directive, this was based on the global Basel agreements: erging from these would make the UK a pariah a little over a decade since the global financial crisis nearly tipped the world economy into a depression due to the sharp business practices of banks in the City of London as much as Wall Street. The Bank of England has always been a more important financial regulator than the European commissionThe truth is that Britain’s economic problems are the result of a failed free-market model. The path to success lies in a more active and entrepreneurial state that works in partnership with business and unions to raise productivity and unleash innovation. Our problems are of our own making. Only in the delusions of Brexit fantasists is putting the lead back in paint the way to put the great back in Great Britain.• Tom Kibasi is a writer and researcher on politics and economics"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03c477f45e7cc38bb7166f1a6c30af598ec112b7/0_61_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dfe853320756bacfdc6ed8992df8dd40","title":"loneliness social connect local communities","story":"More than 2 million adults suffer from chronic loneliness and although its most severe form is more prevalent among Britain’s oldest citizens, younger adults report loneliness more  than any other age group.A desire for social connection is fundamentally hardwired into our psychology, and so being deprived of it has devastating mental and physical consequences. Yet we live in a society which has become ever more fragmented and atomised. This coincides with the decline of Britain’s industrial era. Though this period was male-dominated, and the work often physically damaging, whole communities were based around mines, docks and factories. Call centres, supermarkets, office blocks and zero-hours work do not provide the same social connections.Indeed, in that era the problem was often the opposite of loneliness: of claustrophobia, of everyone knowing what everyone else was up to. Jobs have become more precarious and staff turnover has increased while union membership has plummeted, weakening workplace solidarity.The social spaces where we congregate and connect are dying. In the 1970s, there were more than 4,000 working men’s clubs just 1,300 remain. A quarter of Britain’s pubs have closed since the beginning of the century. Nightlife is withering: in 2018 alone, the number of British nightclubs fell by a fifth. The decade-long fall in young people’s living standards has robbed them of their collective spaces: hundreds of youth centres have closed their doors. And almost 800 libraries have been axed in the decade of austerity.Nonbelievers may welcome the collapse in British religiosity, but the decline in church attendance has meant that the chance to chat each week with other people has vanished.Is this unravelling of social connections inevitable and irreversible? On Tuesday night at the Old Red Lion pub in Kennington, south London, there were people in their 80s chatting to women six decades younger. This was the local group of The Cares Family: an initiative bringing together older locals and young professionals in urban areas. The pub gives everyone a free drink, and they mingle: I found myself chatting to a woman born in 1939 who fought for equal pay in the 60s, and another who became isolated after spending years caring for her ill mother, and now fears there will be no one to care for her at the end of life.Here is an imaginative attempt to overcome loneliness and bridge Britain’s generational ide. “I think obviously there’s a big difference between being lonely and being isolated,” says Annie, a 26-year-old volunteer from Bath. “It’s easy to feel lonely ... in London everyone is doing their own thing. But older people are genuinely isolated: there’s no social structure around them, they often don’t have family and friends around them.”Here are clubs that build connections, and self-confidence too. Activities range from singing in choirs to script reading. Some attract 150 people, young and old in equal numbers, ranging from working-class white residents from “old London” to first-generation migrants.The Cares Family is the brainchild of Alex Smith, a former Labour activist who met an octogenarian named Fred while door-knocking for a council election. Fred had never missed an election before, but he hadn’t been able to leave the house in three months: so Alex wheeled him to the polling station, watching as Fred waved and smiled at people he hadn’t seen for ages.Alex discovered that Fred had once run a fancy-dress shop in Camden Town that he visited in his youth. “I realised there were a lot of people like Fred,” Alex explains, with deep historic community connections but few current ones. And though Alex had “loads of connections” on social media, his community roots had “frayed or gone unattended in the rush of working life and digitisation”. This network has helped transform lives: Alex cites an older woman who would ask a cab driver to drop her off outside a chippy so she could chat to people coming and going now she has somewhere she can establish meaningful connections. Here’s a community network that makes clear that the long drift towards isolation is not inevitable. All of us need to connect with others, even as society has robbed us of opportunities to do so. An atomised, fragmented society is not simply sad – something to passively mourn – but contributes to a major public health crisis. Loneliness is devastating our mental and physical health and, at its worst, is killing us. Yet thankfully, unlike some conditions, we can easily cure it. We just need the will."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/230991959691554728c46278e8bbd4684402103e/0_0_7952_4771/master/7952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c6729dd661e0866c9b392a9765d49696","title":"committees blind hiring and flexible work how to build a diverse workforce","story":"By limiting yourself in the recruitment process you may miss out on someone who’s right for the job. These simple steps will help to cultivate an inclusive organisationBut ersity isn’t limited to a candidate’s race, gender, or age – it includes their education, socioeconomic background, sexuality, religion, mental and physical health and many more facets. When we create environments that encourage different opinions and contain a multitude of backgrounds and experiences, we broaden our communities, which in turn benefits both the work and the culture of the organisation.Here’s how to get started with building an inclusive and erse business:Look outside of the obvious education channelsThis may come as a surprise, but where someone studied - for their qualifications – doesn’t necessarily correlate to their qualities as a candidate. It’s important to be intentional about recruitment, and if you are only accepting candidates who have a certain level of education, or attended a certain type of university, you may be missing out on someone just right for the job. Go further afield when you attend university job fairs and remember to think digitally. With an increasing number of courses being offered online, make sure you connect with those graduates as well. The Open University has been offering qualifications through distance learning for 50 years. It has an excellent resource – the OU’s OpportunityHub, which connects prospective employers with graduates and alumni around the country for work and internships. The OU also regularly runs OU Online TalentConnect, a digital careers fair where employers can chat and interact with its uniquely erse body of graduates and undergraduates all over the UK and internationally.“The OU provides a unique supply of candidates, as a majority study alongside full-time employment – it shows a true commitment and a willingness to go that extra mile,” says the HMRC’s Memunatu Bangura.Create a ersity, equity, and inclusion committeeHave a specific committee to oversee ersity, equity, and inclusion at your organisation, to ensure that not only the roles you are hiring, but the work that you do appeals to a broad group of people. Of course, ersity isn’t just about hiring – but it’s probably a good idea to ensure that the team responsible for hiring are erse themselves.Could the role be remote? Or part-time?For many candidates, especially those with disabilities, knowing that a job can be done remotely, or part-time, is deeply attractive. You can also sign up to be a part of the Disability Confident programme, which signals to jobseekers with disabilities that your organisation supports and encourages a talent pool that is inclusive. When pulling together your job description, think seriously about whether it would be possible to offer remote work, or a job share – many parents benefit from flexible schedules.Consider mature studentsNot everyone attends university. Many candidates from lower-income backgrounds, or BAME candidates, may not have been given the same access to opportunity as others, and many people choose to attend university later in life, if at all. Mature students are defined as being undergraduates over the age of 21, and they account for almost 300,000 people a year. According to Ucas, the majority of mature students are women who live at home, undertaking degrees in vocational subjects. These are candidates who will have learned to juggle work, or parenting, alongside their studies.“We want to work with OU students and graduates because we know they are highly motivated and talented iniduals who have the potential to make an enormous contribution to Mencap as either staff or volunteers. We work across England, Wales and Northern Ireland and we know that OU students are spread across the whole of the UK too,” says Jen Stoneman, volunteer services coordinator at Mencap.Be realistic about your goalsWhile it would be amazing to cultivate a erse work environment, it won’t happen overnight. Be patient, and set metrics of success that ensure that you are appealing to erse groups, and growing your workforce. Identify one metric to improve upon, set a deadline, and keep track of the progress.Empower your business.

This generation’s Chariots of Fire, say, or The English Patient. But its success hinges on a certain cultural amnesia which has not affected one of its chief rivals, Joker.Unlike Joker 1917 has been relatively untainted by controversy: it is not a film accused of inciting incels. The other knock on Joker has been that it is Todd Phillips doing Scorsese karaoke, that it is a facsimile of other, better films. But the same is true of 1917.Like 1917, Peter Weir’s 1981 film Gallipoli is about two young men, one worldlier than the other, making a perilous cross-country trek that (spoiler alert) only one survives, ending with a desperate sprint through the trenches. The hero in both films is running not for his own life but that of his fellow soldiers, with a message to abort an imminent attack. In each case he fails to reach his destination before the first wave goes over. No less a critic than Pauline Kael described Gallipoli with lethal politeness, as “an exemplary academic film about the waste of war”. The film is held up as a classic in Australia, but less well remembered in the US. To its credit, 1917 takes some of those elements and welds them to a new, or at least newly fashionable, form. Mendes has spoken of his admiration for Alfonso Cuarón’s Children of Men, and the long takes in that film have since become de rigueur. The natural extension of the long take is the single-shot film – or the pretend single-shot film, as in 1917 and Alejandro González Iñárritu’s Oscar-winning Birdman. Mendes owes a debt, too, to Christopher Nolan’s Dunkirk, with which 1917 shares an editor (Lee Smith), a ticking-clock structure and the emphasis on spectacle over character that marks a blockbuster built for international markets.All of which would be fine, if 1917 wasn’t being hailed as groundbreaking. Yet the film’s acceleration to pole position in the Oscar race can be attributed, I think, to the fact that all that technical ingenuity is exercised in service of a familiar, comforting story. (As well as the degree to which its studio backers hves publicised the difficulty of its production – the same rules have long applied in the acting categories). It’s a tale of heroism in the manner of 2016’s Hacksaw Ridge, only this particular war has been thoughtfully airbrushed: you’ll never hear a quieter medic’s tent than the one Mendes gives us. Screams are conspicuously absent, never mind that the company has just been ambushed in no man’s land.It ends with our hero wandering from tent to tree, slumping against one in an image that echoes the film’s first. There’s a striking romanticism to the scene – a return to nature after the horrors of the trenches, explicitly tied to a yearning for home: away from Europe and back to England. Mendes would surely bristle at the parallel, but 1917 ends with the same kind of nostalgia for a green and pleasant land that attracted people to Brexit (not to mention Midsomer Murders). And it’s a hankering for that same kind of Britishness that might help explain its appeal.In contrast, Gallipoli dramatised a military disaster that is seen as the moment in which a young country realised the motherland couldn’t be trusted. But as any member of a former colony will tell you, sentimental deference dies hard."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/657ae9e1e67e35d277b16f0a8fff61c48d516b91/0_181_2732_1640/master/2732.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8b628c4bd90c4560e81f5341f682dc5","title":"parasite review bong joon ho south korean satire","story":"Members of an unemployed family target a wealthy household in Bong Joon-ho’s superbly written, horribly fascinating comedy-dramaIn all its delicious cruelty and ingenuity, Bong Joon-ho’s satirical suspense thriller Parasite has arrived in the UK from Korea, having won the Palme d’Or in Cannes last year and dominated the connoisseur conversation from then on – at the expense, rightly or wrongly, of every other non-English-language film.This really is a horribly fascinating film, brilliantly written, superbly furnished and designed, with a glorious ensemble cast put to work in an elegantly plotted nightmare. Its narrative engine hums with the luxurious smoothness of the Mercedes-Benz that one character is fatefully given the chance to drive. In my original review from Cannes, I wondered if the narrative was a little over-extended, but, on a second viewing, I can see how that amplitude of detail is what gives the film its flavour.Parasite is a scabrous black comedy-slash-farce that resonates beyond its generic limits – a movie about status envy, aspiration, materialism, the patriarchal family unit and the idea of having (or leasing) servants. More than this, it is about the suppressed horror of the overclass for its underlings and its morbid distaste for the smell of people who have to use public transport. The satirical reflex extends to a vision of South and North Korea living together in paranoid, resentful intimacy, and its climax is precipitated by an almost Biblical climate-emergency catastrophe.The parasites in question are a dodgy unemployed family living together in a scuzzy, stinky basement flat, with the teenage son and daughter periodically roaming around, holding their smartphones up to the ceiling to pinch the non-password-protected wifi of neighbours and nearby businesses. The dad is Ki-taek (a lovely performance from veteran player Song Kang-ho), a laidback loafer married to former track star Chung-sook (Chang Hyae-jin). The son is Ki-woo (Choi Woo-sik), a shiftless young guy who has flunked the university entrance exams and the daughter is Ki-jung (Park So-dam), a smart, cool customer with an artistic gift for web-based fraud.One summer, by posing as a college student, Ki-woo gets the chance to tutor the teenage daughter of a very rich family in a spectacularly grand modernist house, owned by business high-flier Mr Park (Lee Sun-kyun). Ki-woo’s student is the demure Da-hye (Jung Ji-so), whose instant crush on him is something Ki-woo does nothing to discourage. The somewhat distraite mistress of the house, Yeon-kyo (Cho Yeo-jeong), asks if this smart young man might also recommend an art tutor for Da-hye’s negligibly talented kid brother Da-song (Jung Hyun-jun). He passes off his sister as the cousin of a friend and her brazen grifter-sense of when and how to be confident, and even arrogant, bags her the job.Soon, these wicked kids have cunningly contrived to get the family chauffeur fired and replaced with their dad. They then dislodge the housekeeper Moon-gwang (Lee Jeong-eun) and install their placidly smiling mum. A whole family of cuckoos in a brand new nest, pretending to be strangers to each other. But then the artless little kid points out that they all smell alike – and they smell of poor people.Parasite is a movie that taps into a rich cinematic tradition of unreliable servants with an intimate knowledge of their employers, an intimacy that easily, and inevitably, congeals into hostility. Joseph Losey’s The Servant invokes a comparable transgression, nightmarishly amplified here by the subterfuge and by the sheer numbers of people getting up close and personal.Parasite is also in a Korean tradition of pictures such as Kim Ki-young’s classic thriller The Housemaid from 1960, remade in 2010 by Im Sang-soo, and also Park Chan-wook’s servant-class con-trick drama, The Handmaiden. A second viewing of this film also put me in mind of the claustrophobic horror in Park’s Oldboy.And there is something else, too. The Park family love to play Handel on the music system in their lovely home – the Spietati, io vi giurai aria from his opera Rodelinde.

(Oh, and acting, too)Buried in the endearingly manic jumble of thoughts and dedications in Olivia Colman’s dumbfounded Oscar acceptance speech last year – the one sealed as a classic by its panicked shoutout to Lady Gaga at the very end – was a telling thank-you that went largely overlooked. “And to Bryna,” Colman said, “who made me do things that I said ‘no’ to, but she was right.” It underlined the fact that Colman’s surprise victory over the frontrunner, Glenn Close, was not just a happy stroke of luck, but the result of a long and expertly calculated campaign.The Bryna in question was Bryna Rifkin, the Hollywood publicist extraordinaire and dab hand at steering stars through the almost six-month marathon of “awards season”, from the essential autumn trio of buzz-building autumn festivals (Venice, Telluride, Toronto) to Oscars night. Rifkin’s client list is elite: in addition to Colman, she has in recent years carried the likes of Marion Cotillard, Ruth Negga, Willem Dafoe and Michael Shannon to against-the-odds Oscars recognition. All would have been put on a rigorous circuit of interviews, roundtables, talkshow spots and dressy appearances at umpteen precursor events and lesser award ceremonies – the very things a perennially working and not especially attention-seeking character actor such as Colman might have “said ‘no’ to”, only to be persuaded by a determined PR team that visibility is the key to victory.Such promotion does not come cheap – $5m (£3.8m) is a typical cost for a single Oscar campaign, although for studios hungry and deep-pocketed enough, the sky is the limit. It is estimated that Netflix, still a relative newcomer to this game, spent upwards of $25m last year in its efforts to secure a best picture win for Alfonso Cuarón’s Roma – another critically adored, non-English-language arthouse film that didn’t look or feel much like a typical Oscar frontrunner, and thus needed a concerted push from its distributor to make voters view it as such.The all-out campaign included all manner of Roma-related swag, from throw cushions to lush coffee table books, sent out to voters and journalists. And it worked – up to a point. It won three Oscars, but fell at the final hurdle to the cosily old-fashioned and very American Green Book – which not only spent a bit less money on the way, but weathered a variety of PR crises, including excavated #MeToo stories of the film’s director, Peter Farrelly, flashing his penis on the set of past productions, and an Islamophobic tweet from the screenwriter, Nick Vallelonga.When Roma lost, some pundits speculated that voters had been put off by Netflix’s overeager campaigning, although given the obstacles the film was already up against – including industry wariness of the streaming model and the Academy’s general phobia of subtitles – it can’t have lost more than it gained.The Golden Globes are another kind of race entirely. Eyebrows were raised last month when Taron Egerton won the Globe for best actor in a musical or comedy – not because his committed performance as Elton John in Rocketman was undeserving of the honour, but because of reports circulating on social media that all 90 voting members of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA) had been invited to a reception for the film that also happened to be on his birthday. Nine years ago, an unlikely best-picture Globe nomination for the riotous CherChristina Aguilera campfest Burlesque probably had a little something to do with the fact that Sony had flown out HFPA members for a Cher concert and hotel stay in Las Vegas.Egerton didn’t get an Oscar nomination. (Nor did Burlesque, for that matter, to this writer’s eternal disappointment.) Wooing Academy members is a subtler art more about making them believe they love your film on their own terms. The disgraced Harvey Weinstein, once the master of opportunistic Oscar campaigning, knew this better than anyone. Spending an alleged $15m (at the time, a jaw-dropping industry record) on campaigning for the frothily charming period romcom Shakespeare in Love was the gamechanger that shaped the awards-season machine as we know it today: it beat Steven Spielberg’s solemnly macho frontrunner, Saving Private Ryan, to the prize on the strength of a cynically ingenious “love v war” campaign line that persuaded voters that the lighter contender was the one truly in their hearts. (The same year, a similarly button-pushing Miramax campaign for Life Is Beautiful netted it three wins, proving the Academy’s aversion to foreign-language fare can be overcome if the film is sweetened enough.)Weinstein may be persona non grata, but his tactics endure. A recent campaign pivot for Joker, which leads the field with 11 Oscar nominations – but is also one of the most polarising contenders in recent memory – is worthy of the character himself: yes, the violent, nihilistic supervillain origin story is attempting a touchy-feely rebrand. Last week, as Oscar voting opened, a glossy sheaf of Warner Bros-sponsored content on the film’s behalf appeared in the industry trade bible, Variety, headed by a feature titled A Case for Empathy, talking up the film’s themes of class ision and mental health awareness, and going so far as to conclude with a Gandhi quote: “The true measure of any society can be found in how it treats its most vulnerable members.”It was the most brazen development yet in a campaign that has even turned the rebellious, publicity-shy nature of its star, Joaquin Phoenix (now the best-actor favourite), into a strategic advantage – with his unpredictable acceptance speeches (including his scorching attack on industry racism at the Baftas) and interview walkouts projecting the very image of anxious outsider-hood that Joker’s admirers respond to in its troubled hero. Is that just Phoenix being Phoenix or is it his own kind of anti-campaign strategy, the equally winning opposite of Colman’s funny, agreeable compliance? In this racket, it’s increasingly hard to tell. If he loses in an upset to Marriage Story’s star, Adam Driver, however, look no further than Driver’s publicist – one Bryna Rifkin – for an explanation.Judy Garland was the one to beat. Her all-stops-out, career-best performance in a Star Is Born movingly reflected her own career ups and downs, and the Oscars ceremony directors were so confident of her victory that they sent a camera crew to the hospital room where she had just given birth to her third child. Kelly emerged the winner for her against-type role as a dowdy, put-upon housewife in The Country Girl, proving the Academy’s eternal preference for unblemished ingenues over complicated legends – particularly when they are “brave” enough to strip away their glamour on screen.It looked like a tight race between the four highbrow non-US stars nominated: Judy Davis was the critics’ choice, Joan Plowright the sentimental favourite, Miranda Richardson the ubiquitous breakout who was in everything that year and Vanessa Redgrave the beneficiary of best-picture heat for Howards End. Instead, in a classic vote-split scenario, they gave way to the one nominee who was not like the others: the Brooklyn-born newcomer Marisa Tomei for a brashly hilarious comic turn in the very mainstream My Cousin Vinny. Cruel rumours persisted for years that the award’s presenter, Jack Palance, had read the wrong name in retrospect, voters simply chose the most entertaining performance.Jack Nicholson’s ever-expressive eyebrows shot up a mile when he opened the best picture envelope to reveal the title of Paul Haggis’s tortuously contrived “everyone’s a little bit racist” parable. Ang Lee’s acclaimed cowboy love story, Brokeback Mountain, had swept all the other prizes that season, and seemed poised to make history as the first overtly LGBT film to win the top Oscar. But word of a homophobic backlash from the Academy’s more conservative members had been circulating in the industry: veteran stars Ernest Borgnine and Tony Curtis evidently spoke for many when they said they refused to see Lee’s film, and that faction tipped the balance.Two types of films tend to win the best visual effects Oscar these days: lavishly expensive blockbuster spectacles or best-picture contenders looking to add another trophy to their haul. (Ideally, both.) Nominated against Star Wars: The Force Awakens, The Martian, The Revenant and Mad Max: Fury Road, Alex Garland’s low-budget, minimalist British sci-fi didn’t seem to have a prayer. But the work that went into creating Alicia Vikander’s sentient humanoid robot was so plainly ingenious and essential to her much-admired performance – it helped she was that year’s It-girl, winning that night for another film – that it pulled off a true David-v-Goliath shocker.The circumstances of Moonlight’s win were themselves so stunning – as Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway erroneously declared La La Land the victor, only to be corrected minutes later – it’s easy to forget just how breathtaking a moment it would have been anyway. Barry Jenkins’ melancholy study of gay black masculinity seemed destined all season long to finish second to Damien Chazelle’s vibrant LA musical, which landed a record 14 nominations and led 6-2 in wins as the final envelope was opened. But, in the wake of Donald Trump’s election victory, Academy members were perhaps in a more pensive, socially conscious mood, enabling a historic win."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4bcce022b655bb7a9134bc751a0c74661dd1ec12/554_410_3236_1942/master/3236.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=08dba0cb94731d6d2f4c47bd9c617a57","title":"why once upon a time in hollywood should win the best picture oscar","story":"Tarantino’s cinematic ode to the movie industry is so relaxed it is barely a film at all and there are scenes that will stay with you for daysOne of the highlights of the final furlong of awards season is the Hollywood Reporter’s Brutally Honest Oscar Ballot series, in which Scott Feinberg talks outrageous truths out of an anonymous voter (whose identity Twitter then scurries to guess).The first one this year was quite the corrective for all those who thought 1917 was a lock-in for best picture – unless Parasite were to dazzlingly pip it. Turns out, both of those movies are just too goddamn foreign. Sam Mendes’s 1917 might be fine for the Baftas but the Oscars are an American bash and a Yank has got to win in order to make Hollywood great again.It’s a reminder that Quentin Tarantino’s ninth film really does tick a lot of Oscar boxes. It’s about Hollywood, obviously no film since The Artist has lavished so much airtime on the mechanics of the movie biz, nor riffed so lovingly on its folklore.It stars men – and a woman – that the industry adores. It flatters its audience with the assumption of enough cultural knowledge to indulge its spoof inserts and that final act rug-pull. Aside from some fairly uncontroversial scepticism about Charles Manson, it studiously avoids politics. And it offers voters an opportunity to fete Tarantino, one of their own, slightly-unsung prodigal sons – a tamed yet still spunky enfant terrible who’s just about to become a dad.To be honest, I have long harboured a loathing for Tarantino – the man maybe more than his movies, though I’ve never gone nuts for those either. Pulp Fiction is overcooked Kill Bill tension free Inglorious Basterds flat-out awful. But the problems I had with his back catalogue – especially the fetish-level self-indulgence and sniggering revisionism – evaporated here.I think that’s mostly on account of pace: Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is so relaxed as to be barely a film at all, while also being the most obviously cinematic contender. It is both an episodic meander and a formally stringent genre fairytale. It is all about the feeling: of being a hot and charming washed-up stuntman with the warm breeze flowing through your gorgeous hair as you fix an aerial on a Beverley Hills mansion. Of being a hot and charming 26-year-old starlet, married to Roman Polanski, feeling the warm breeze flow through your gorgeous hair as you zip through traffic-free freeways in an open-top motor, off to the hottest party in town.And if its actual narrative is all over the shop, it functions just fine as a delivery vehicle for scenes that stay with you for days: the humbling of Leonardo DiCaprio by a child star Pitt scoping out a derelict movie ranch Margot Robbie gleeful at seeing her own character up on the big screen (hat-tip to Tarantino for leaving Sharon Tate in the movie, rather than artfully substituting his own star).In its extreme auteurish extravagance, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is absolutely uncompromising. It is also a manifesto: baked into the movie is the line Tarantino has been trotting since its release – that he, like Scorsese, is a celluloid defender, a crusader against the dark forces of the franchise. That might ring a little hollow. But it will still be music to many voters’ ears. Mine too, for once. Few, it seems, can carry a tune quite like Tarantino."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4fbd0623f60962bb181e9253c0c7de9d4bf68fdc/0_230_2798_1677/master/2798.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7b7e02f57f0410656d3823d4e6fc64fd","title":"kirk douglas a life in pictures","story":"Kirk Douglas, the last great star of Hollywood’s golden age, once said he had ‘made a career playing sons of bitches’, a career that began in 1946 with the film The Strange Love of Martha Ivers.

A slow climb. Many expected the Canada striker Christine Sinclair to break the USA legend Abby Wambach’s record of 184 international goals at the World Cup last summer. Except that was unlikely. With Canada playing a defensive game and Sinclair having managed nine World Cup goals in her four previous tournament finals, it was unlikely she would get the four needed to shift the crown over the US-Canada border.Instead the moment would come seven months later, in much less glamorous circumstances. A seventh-minute penalty against St Kitts and Nevis in Concacaf Olympic qualifying last Wednesday equalled Wambach’s tally and, against a team ranked 127th in the world, it was inevitable the 36-year-old would then claim the record. It looked so simple. With Canada cruising at 3-0 Adriana Leon cut back to an unmarked Sinclair in the middle and the forward swept side-footed into the bottom corner. The celebrations were uncharacteristically bold for a player happy to fade into the background, with Sinclair bowling the ball towards nine players lined up as pins for a strike.Despite the small crowd, inferior opposition and small stage, the Canadian’s achievement – a record across women’s and men’s football – is deserving of praise. Yet she ducks it. “For me it has nothing to do with the record, it’s to have young girls be able to dream of playing professionally or represent their country, win Olympic medals,” she said. “To inspire young girls to pursue their crazy, wild dreams ... it’s pretty cool.”She scored against Mexico on Tuesday too and 186 goals, and counting, in 291 appearances is phenomenal. If Wambach’s record seemed unbeatable, Sinclair’s seems even more so.The game is changing. As professionalism increases, as the talent pool grows, as players are thrown into competitive environments from younger ages and there is a constant stream of talent ready to replace those coming towards the end of their careers, the longevity of players shrinks.Canada has the second-highest number of women playing organised football in the world, with 290,087 players, behind the 9.5 million in the US (according to the 2019 Women’s Football Survey) and Sinclair has been the jewel in the crown of the Canada women’s team for 20 years, from the moment she stepped in at 16 in 2000. Their narrow semi-final defeat by the USA at the London Olympics in 2012 was perhaps the defining game of her career the unplayable forward became one of only three players to have scored a hat-trick against their opponents, before Canada were knocked out by an Alex Morgan strike in extra time.She has an ability to find space where there is none. Her goals to games ratio, one in close to 1.5 matches, is testament to her determination to wait for an opening. She lurks like a hunter, waiting in defenders’ blind spots before pouncing. Her goals may not be worldies – though there are a few of those – but they are calculated.The Portland Thorns player has shaped and managed her career around the national team. In the run-up to the 2015 World Cup in Canada she played nine club games in 2016 she played 12 times for the Thorns.But Canadian Soccer has done little to help her to her record. It could be argued that, with better commitment from the governing body, Sinclair would have passed Wambach’s record much sooner. It has hosted only nine home friendlies since that World Cup in Canada, including one in 2019 and two in 2018.It will take someone special to topple this record. Vivianne Miedema, a very different player to Sinclair but with a similar attitude to the limelight, is on 69 Netherlands goals at 23 years old. At that rate she could catch the veteran’s number, but the game is getting tougher, opponents are getting better and Miedema is playing a huge number of club matches for Arsenal.The seemingly impossible, though, is possible, as Sinclair’s dethroning of Wambach shows. The American forward said as much in a moving tribute to Sinclair on Instagram.“I’ve tried to live and play in a way honoring that legacy and privilege, so that little girls coming up after us will accomplish things we’ve only dreamed of,” she wrote. “So, as a girl who grew up dreaming of winning Olympic gold for my country before women’s soccer was even an Olympic sport, tonight I am celebrating.“Tonight, I am celebrating the honor of passing that record, that legacy of our beautiful game, to the great Christine Sinclair: world-record holder for most international goals man or woman in history. Christine: History is made. Your victory is our victory. We celebrate with you.“To every girl coming up in the pack with a dream to do something that doesn’t yet even exist: We believe in you to accomplish that we can’t even yet imagine. Your Pack is with you. And history awaits you.”• Aston Villa have signed the Austria international Sophie Maierhofer following her graduation from the University of Kansas.

At least 33,000 children need urgent medical treatment due to acute malnutrition, according to Oxfam Guatemala.Central America is one of the world’s most dangerous regions outside a warzone, where a toxic mix of violence, poverty and corruption has forced millions to flee north in search of security.Now, drought, famine and the battle for dwindling natural resources are increasingly being recognized as major factors in the exodus.And it seems to be getting worse: 2019 was the driest year in a decade with only 65 days of rain, according to Guatemala’s National Institute of Seismology, Volcanology, Meteorology and Hydrology. Guatemala’s subsistence farmers depend on rainfall – which is increasingly erratic – and most lack alternative sources of water.Worsening hunger across the region is a factor in the rise in migrant caravans trying to reach the US overland, according to both analysts and migrants themselves.The caravans have been met with repression and hostility by Mexican and American authorities who accuse the migrants and refugees of political subversion and criminality.But experts warn that the additional burden of extreme weather is overwhelming these communities, which have been long ignored and repressed by the government.Marc-Andre Prost, a WFP regional nutrition adviser, told Reuters: “Climate change is not responsible for this situation but it’s definitely exacerbating a situation where people don’t have the capacity to cope.”Guatemala’s new president, Alejandro Giammattei, like numerous predecessors, has pledged to make child malnutrition a national priority, but the 2020 budget proposed a decrease of $27m to the ministry of health and a $13m increase for defense. (Congress failed to approve the budget in November, and details of the new budget have not yet been released.)For García, the situation is desperate: food aid has yet to reach her canton, so once the maize runs out in March, she must find backbreaking work picking coffee – or else risk starvation. There’s no guarantee she’ll even find work, as a leaf-eating fungus known as roya – which thrives in warm conditions – has also devastated coffee crops.García, who’s weak from chronic hunger, said: “I’ll get paid $4 a day. But if I pick less than 46kg, I won’t get paid.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a16ddb73403a929cffd8f23843991dc634d6068/0_162_4844_2907/master/4844.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ab423f2b1ae6a4910def08db4cd8a63","title":"i swam 31 rivers in 31 days and survived but we need a clean up","story":"Millions swim in open water and outdoor pools in the UK and we must press for better water standardsWhy would you even want to swim in a UK river? It’s cold, it’s a bit mucky and yes, it comes with risk.I may well die of some hideous waterborne flesh-eating virus that entered the water on the wing of a migrating bird, but I love river swimming. Perhaps the duck poo between the toes or the fact that it’s “dirty” is what’s discouraging you from leaping into your local river, but when was the last time you went for a swim in a pool and didn’t have someone else’s hair wrap around your fingers?Despite the headlines saying the UK’s rivers are treated as open sewers and that no river is biologically safe to swim in, I recently plunged into 31 different English rivers in 31 days. The most I suffered from was a number of nettle stings, almost invisible in winter, and a mild cold. Our waterways are the veins of our countryside, which is why I support the growing clamour to clean up Britain’s rivers to meet bathing water standards and applaud campaigners in Ilkley who are forcing authorities to address issues with the River Wharfe.The Rivers Trust wants rivers to be healthy in every way, offering a high standard of water quality that is good for both people and wildlife, and valued by everyone. Unfortunately, our rivers are often polluted – there are thousands of sites around the country where untreated sewage and wastewater are discharged into the river when the sewer system is overloaded. Last year, the Rivers Trust launched a map of “rivers fit to swim in”, giving swimmers a chance to make an informed decision on where and when to swim. Seven and a half million people swim in open water and outdoor pools in the UK, and it is a growing trend. Everyone knows that activity of any kind has physical and mental benefits, but research shows that by taking the activity outdoors the benefits increase. While there are designated bathing areas around the British coastline, inland access to quality bathing water would be hugely beneficial.People have been swimming in rivers for centuries and there are a number of river spots across the UK that are popular with swimmers, families and other water users. During a UK heatwave it is common to see people swimming in their local river, so it makes sense for the Environment Agency and government to invest in the infrastructure to improve water quality.In fact, there are plenty of examples that demonstrate an improving picture for our waterways. Scientists from ZSL reported a rise in the River Thames estuary seal population last September, proving that the Thames ecosystem is thriving and improving. When I swam in the River Colne – a river that borders Greater London and Buckinghamshire and flows under the M25 and M1 – the water was so clear I could see the riverbed.Researchers have found that people who spend time visiting natural spaces are more likely to recycle, consider green travel or volunteer for environmental causes. This is exactly what the locals of Ilkley are doing as a result of their access, engagement and enjoyment of their natural river. Can you imagine the benefits countrywide if more people take the time to engage in their local green space and waterways? Of course, at this time of the year, rivers can appear brown and bleak. But look for the signs and you will learn to appreciate the beauty of our waterways, or at least identify when a river doesn’t look right. If more people pay attention and report incidents, more action can be taken. If you want to swim, do your research before taking a dip.

According to data from the Kennel Club, registrations of French bulldogs alone has risen from 1,521 in 2009 to 36,785 in 2018. Over the same period, the use of artificial insemination in dogs has also risen.Now an investigation by the journal Vet Record has found there are currently at least 37 canine fertility clinics in the UK – as discovered through internet searching. In 2015, a BBC report on a clinic suggested the existence of such a facility was noteworthy and unusual. That, they say, suggests there has been a rise in such clinics.“There has been rising public demand for these dogs, and these breeds tend to need human assistance in order to be able to breed,” he said.The report reveals that 20 of the clinics offered flat-faced dogs as studs, while examination of the websites by the  found many illustrated with images of such breeds. Indeed, some clinics appear to be entirely devoted to brachycephalic dogs. Services on offer range from artificial insemination to ultrasound scans, sperm motility testing, microchipping, progesterone testing and, in some cases, caesarean sections.Loeb and colleagues found some of these clinics are linked to veterinary surgeries, while others are run through basic websites with limited contact details.The researchers say the findings raise several concerns. Some procedures can only be carried out by a vet, including caesarean sections and artificial insemination involving transfer of sperm to the female’s cervix. Loeb and colleagues note that while it is possible clinics without a vet may hire one for such procedures, it is not clear whether they do so.What’s more, the team found two clinics advertising an invasive form of artificial insemination that was banned in the UK last year. Upon contacting the clinics, they were told the website information was incorrect and would be removed.Loeb said the findings raise questions, including whether anyone is monitoring what happens in such clinics.“Unlike businesses that breed and sell dogs, those offering stud dogs, canine artificial insemination and ultrasound scans do not require a licence to operate,” the report notes. “They are not generally regulated unless they offer services that are clearly acts of veterinary surgery.”In a linked editorial, Loeb writes that breeding flat-faced dogs using artificial insemination and caesareans may even be unlawful, pointing to regulations that say dogs should not be kept for breeding if their genes or other traits suggest breeding would harm the health or welfare of the parent or offspring. “There are lots of procedures that can be done to animals that are banned, because they are seen as mutilations because they are purely for aesthetic purposes,” Loeb told the . “If you think about it, this is another example of that.”But Bill Lambert, head of health and welfare at the Kennel Club, said artificial insemination is now used for many breeds and can bring genetic benefits, while non-vets can be very skilled in aspects of canine fertility that can be practised without veterinary qualifications. Professional support, he added, can help inexperienced breeders ensure safety and good conditions.“Where veterinary procedures are not involved then sometimes you can get extremely experienced people who are not vets but they are maybe more experienced in certain areas,” he said. Daniella Dos Santos, president of the British Veterinary Association, said the organisation was deeply concerned about the advertising of banned procedures, adding that while other forms of artificial insemination are allowed and important for breeding, a vet should be involved in their use.That said, she stressed, the process is not suitable for all dogs – including those who cannot mate or give birth naturally.“We would be concerned about artificial insemination being used in such cases, or to allow dogs with inherited diseases and conditions, for example brachycephalic obstructive airway syndrome in flat-faced dogs, to be used for breeding,” she said. “Vets will often recommend that these dogs are neutered.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cdf424360981f394841f2702d23a4ec8b0836315/0_298_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af40eeaad20917c16f4e8959d4628af8","title":"green day rocknroll helps you dance through the apocalypse","story":"Can the world’s biggest punk band capture the zeitgeist on their new album like American Idiot once did? They talk about staying positive in the age of Trump – and how people have forgotten to love each other• Why Green Day and 90s punk still resonates with today’s young music fansGreen Day are in their modest rehearsal space in their hometown of Oakland, California, a little haven in a country on the turn. The trio of 47-year-olds – still the world’s biggest punk band – are posing for photos with singer-guitarist-songwriter Billie Joe Armstrong’s prized Triumph motorcycle. Then someone remembers that the band’s forthcoming Hella Mega Tour, alongside fellow alt-rock survivors Fall Out Boy and Weezer, is sponsored by Harley-Davidson. The Triumph is put back under its protective sheet.“Welcome to Trump’s America,” sighs bassist Mike Dirnt when I tell him of my journey via San Francisco, where I was shocked to see so much desperate homelessness. “A place where the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. Sadly, I don’t think we’ve seen anything yet.” The band own a number of Oakland businesses – “it’s important for us to do what we can to lift up our local area,” Dirnt says – while Armstrong still goes on protests and attends local punk shows.Armstrong is a fan of new bands such as ShitKid, the Chats and White Reaper, though is often confused by what he sees. “I’ll see kids wearing leather jackets and a Grateful Dead T-shirt. How did that happen?” Recently, he attended a show only to be confronted by a young punk with giant liberty-spiked hair, “looking like he’d just walked out of a squat”, asking for a selfie on a brand-new iPhone. “It’s cool and it’s weird,” he laughs. “I’m just excited people are still doing cool shit.”Green Day’s new album is titled Father of All Motherfuckers and yet, surprisingly for a band best known for delivering 2004’s George Bush-baiting rock opera American Idiot, they say Donald Trump had little influence on the new record. At the same time, they insist it is political.“It’s all there in the songs,” Armstrong says. “I’m singing about ‘looking out for the jingoes and heathens’ or ‘another black kid shot in town’.” There’s a lyric about bulletproof backpacks designed as protection during school shootings, “one of the most absurd ideas I’ve ever heard”. But Armstrong doesn’t want to be on the nose. “Everything that is happening in the world is right there on Twitter. It’s so confusing and it’s so depressing. I really wanted to create some kind of escape for people I didn’t want to be so obvious.” Satirical punk site The Hard Times wrote a story the day of Trump’s inauguration titled Future Green Day Concept Album Sworn Into Office. “It was funny, but I didn’t want us to do that. It wasn’t where our heads were at – at all.” Where were your heads at? “I was listening to Little Richard.”“And the world has become so isive,” says drummer and band goof Tré Cool. “We wanted to try to bring people together. It’s become something of a far-out concept to love each other!”This year the band will turn 34. No punk band has made it this far. The Sex Pistols lasted three years, the Clash 10, the Ramones 22. Green Day are writing the blueprint while living it, so it is no surprise that they have sometimes made mistakes. Last year Armstrong duetted with Morrissey on his covers album California Son – a terrible look in the wake of Morrissey’s vocal support for far-right organisations and iniduals.“I wasn’t aware until the song came out,” says Armstrong. “We do the song, and he was very lovely, and then the song comes out and a lot of Brits were like: what the hell are you doing? I really did not have a clue … ” Bewitched by the singer’s status as an 80s indie godhead, he simply failed in his due diligence. Cool pipes up, giggling: “Hey, we’ve all got our Ted Nugents, right?” – a reference to the US rocker and gun enthusiast.Green Day have endured major wobbles and are now in “uncharted territory,” as Armstrong puts it. “People get over their high school bands. They don’t go on to spend every day in their orbit for the next 20 years.”After two records on the late, great East Bay punk imprint Lookout!, in 1994 the young band signed with major label Reprise. The punk scene was aghast. 924 Gilman Street, the puritanical Berkeley-based all-ages headquarters of said scene banned the group from performing. Green Day released Dookie in February of that year and it sold 20m copies. They wouldn’t return to play Gilman Street until 2015.Old friends and fellow scenesters might not have wanted to talk to them any more, but everyone else did. Along with Smash, the third album by fellow Californians the Offspring (at 11m sales, the biggest-selling record on an independent label ever) and the rise to prominence of the Berkeley band Rancid, Dookie spearheaded an interest in American punk rock not seen since the birth of the New York CBGB scene 20 years earlier – but with the sales to match the cultural impact.“We were always thinking about legacy,” Cool says. “We never wanted songs to sound like we’d relied too much on whatever recording techniques were in vogue. We knew we were in this for the long haul.”Then came, if not decline, then some cooling off. The excellent Insomniac arrived in 1995 and struggled on account of not being Dookie. Nimrod followed in 1997 another strong collection of songs that became most notable for featuring a coda, the purely acoustic Good Riddance (Time of Your Life), that suggested there might be more to Armstrong’s songwriting than three chords and fuzz. The song soundtracked the Seinfeld finale and became a hit at US high school proms, its melancholy dovetailing with events that marked a passing of time. And yet by 2000’s Warning, the mall had been relinquished to the nu-metal kids. Warning became the first release of Green Day’s major-label career not to go multi-platinum. They wouldn’t release an album for another four years.“I find it hard between records thinking what I’m going to write about,” Armstrong says. “I get a lot of self-doubt. I don’t think I’ve ever realistically thought the band might be done, but I have questioned whether I could do it any more.”Green Day re-emerged amid war in the Middle East under Bush. Young people who might once have been fans were returning in body bags. “Sieg heil to the President Gasman,” Armstrong sang on Holiday from the album American Idiot, and if punks weren’t supposed to sign to major labels, they certainly weren’t supposed to release double albums that became Broadway musicals.It sent them stratospheric and the weight of expectation since has never truly lifted: 2009’s 21st Century Breakdown felt ordinary in the shadow of its predecessor the release of three albums in a year – 2012’s ¡Uno!, ¡Dos! and ¡Tré! – favoured quantity over quality. An ill-fated festival appearance saw Armstrong, his set about to be cut short, destroy his guitar and rant: “I’m not Justin Bieber!” He subsequently went into rehab for the abuse of alcohol and prescription pills.The band slunk into another period of near-irrelevance. They had emerged from the previous one with a genre-defying, generation-defining reboot – this time all they had was a good record, 2016’s Revolution Radio. Few bands harness the zeitgeist once, let alone twice. Is Father of All Motherfuckers that third moment? No, but it is the closest they have come since American Idiot. At 26min 16sec, it is their shortest album, featuring a collection of songs as fast and furious as any in their discography. It sounds as if they are having fun for the first time in years, without trying too hard.Armstrong says it is an “homage to the roots of rock’n’roll music, the music that inspired us to do this. That doesn’t just mean punk rock. It’s Martha and the Vandellas and Mott the Hoople. Old bubblegum music like the Archies. Powerpop. Garage music … Playing Motown through Green Day, so to speak.”You might read the fizzing Father of All Motherfuckers as Green Day saying they are not done yet. Ask them if their forthcoming triple-header tour is an attempt to halt a downturn in the band’s fortunes and Armstrong will laugh and say, in reference to 80s-themed package tours: “There are many differences between Green Day and Kajagoogoo … We’re going to keep making records that matter. I always want whatever we do to feel like the first time we played at Gilman, or the first time we made a rock opera.” By embracing the band’s love of rock’n’roll, Green Day are also trying to reclaim something at their nation’s core. Instead of an overt appearance from Trump in the lyrics, there is positivity and make-do spirit it feels like a record about a beloved US, not the US that presently exists. “I think good rock’n’roll has always had this ability to be transcendent,” says Dirnt. “A song might be about losing your gal or whatever other misfortune has come your way … but the best stuff takes your hand and helps you dance through the apocalypse. I’d like to think that’s what we’re trying to do.”Rock as an act of resistance, I offer. “Oh yeah,” they all chime. “I like that!”Father of All Motherfuckers is out on Reprise."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0688820456d4929430dfe9f18346fdcd146a042f/2192_1128_3371_2023/master/3371.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=143aba0aea8da61862697e8d59a60280","title":"lapsley best track of week","story":"This week we’ve got a doom-pop battle cry, some shouty ska-shuffle, and a billionaire’s sinister EDM soul-suckerFour years ago, the then-19-year-old emo-synth singer Holly Lapsley released a debut album that was a) Really quite incredible (yay!), and b) Largely ignored (boo!).

It has captured a mood for change and wrongfooted Leo Varadkar, the taoiseach and Fine Gael leader, and Micheál Martin, the leader of Fianna Fáil.At the core stands McDonald, 50, the personable Dubliner who succeeded Gerry Adams and may turn Sinn Féin into a party of government. As one wag put it in a letter to the : “Have Leo and Micheál met their Mary Lou?”In Cabra, a working-class area of McDonald’s Dublin Central constituency, many root for her to shake up what they consider an an ossified party duopoly past its expiry date.“She’s better than any of the men,” said Ann Smith, 75, a grandmother out walking her dog. “She really fights. I love the way she talks to people, especially the men. She’s well able for them.”For a movement that dates from the 1916 Easter Rising it is quite an arc: a succession of leaders with a whiff of sulphur culminating in a mother-of-two who studied English literature at Trinity College Dublin.“She’s very bright, articulate, self-confident and a good debater,” said Deaglán de Bréadún, the author of Power Play: The Rise of Modern Sinn Féin. “I’d say Sinn Féin couldn’t believe their luck when she joined. She’s such a good performer on radio and TV and it’s probably a help with southern voters that she doesn’t have a northern accent. All in all, it’s very hard for her political opponents to pick holes in her image.”Talk of seismic breakthrough may be overdone. McDonald is not about to become taoiseach. Sinn Féin’s results traditionally underperform opinion polls. The party fielded just 42 candidates for the 160-seat Dáil Éireann, the lower house of the Irish parliament, so will not fully translate support into seats.Analysts expect Fianna Fáil to win about 50 to 55 seats, Fine Gael perhaps 35, and Sinn Féin 26 or at most 30. The two establishment parties have ruled out forming a coalition government with Sinn Féin, but it may yet play kingmaker.“It’s not revolution, it’s evolution,” said Dr Theresa Reidy, a political scientist and election expert at University College Cork. “For Sinn Fein it’s more about consolidation.”Even so, McDonald finds herself leading a remarkable turnaround. A party Irish voters used to shun as radioactive, an off-putting mix of Northern Ireland accents and Troubles vibes, has overtaken leftwing rivals and established itself as a voice for those who view Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael as the TweedledumTweedledee stasis.McDonald grew up in Rathgar, a middle-class suburb of Dublin, and attended a Catholic school, Notre Dame des Missions, before studying Sylvia Plath and metaphysical poets at Trinity, formerly a Protestant bastion.She worked as a researcher at the Institute of International and European Affairs, a thinktank, before joining Fianna Fáil, the party of her parents, before switching to Sinn Féin in 1999, a year after the Good Friday agreement.One version says she left because a Fianna Fáil bigwig stymied her advancement. McDonald’s version is she wanted a better fit for her principles about social justice and Irish unity.“She’s not lacking in political ambition but has fully converted to Sinn Féin ideology. You don’t thrive in that party without buying into its Irish republican mindset,” said De Bréadún.The party fast-tracked McDonald up the ranks: an MEP in 2004, a TD (MP) in 2011, then succeeding Adams as party leader in 2018. She praised him as her “political mentor” and ended a speech with “tiocfaidh ár lá”.McDonald can be “wooly” on detail but speaks with a passion that distinguishes Sinn Féin from other parties, said Reidy, the professor.Voters at first seemed unmoved. They abandoned Sinn Féin in a 2018 presidential election and in 2019 council and European parliamentary elections. The party braced for more losses in the general election, so fielded few candidates. Then the poll numbers started rising – and rising.The economy hums at near full-employment but voters are fatigued with the Fine Gael-led government, which was propped up by Fianna Fáil, and angry at hospital bed shortages and soaring rents. McDonald, ably supported by party colleagues Pearse Doherty and Eoin Ó Broin, has cast Sinn Féin as a vehicle for change.The party keenest on unification paradoxically benefitted from voter indifference towards Northern Ireland. Barely a blip in the campaign, it let Sinn Féin focus on bread-and-butter issues.That changed this week when a notorious 2007 murder returned to haunt the party, forcing McDonald to revisit Sinn Féin’s links with the IRA since the Troubles.Some voters recoiled. “Too many unanswered questions,” said Michelle Walsh, 51, a Dublin Central constituent who does not plan to vote for McDonald.Claire Beatty, 45, another constituent, said history had “leaked” out but that McDonald’s party still represented change. “The past has stuck with them but people are being left with no alternative.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/502c90396bcee4d31f25b3cec960b99e6705fc95/0_0_6948_4169/master/6948.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7905643344312dab4c8260ebafd7c989","title":"back to the future why are we opting for nostalgic pop culture","story":"From rewatching 1990s TV shows to replaying classic computer games, taking the safe option when it comes to entertainment can help audiences rediscover themselvesNever before has civilisation produced so much new pop culture. From the plethora of TV shows on competing streaming platforms to the seemingly infinite choice offered by online music and gaming services, the wealth of new material being released each month is staggering. Yet when it comes to cultural consumption, audiences are increasingly choosing to seek out classic, safe bets – forgoing the next big thing in favour of the last big thing.According to UK media watchdog Ofcom, the single most-watched programme in the first quarter of 2019 was the 1990s sitcom Friends. In the US, the top Netflix spot has long been held by the US version of the Office, which first aired 15 years ago. Meanwhile at the box office, sequels and reboots abound. Last year’s top five grossing films in the UK included the remake of the Lion King, Toy Story 4, Frozen 2 and Star Wars: Episode IX – the Rise of Skywalker.Even computer gaming is stepping increasingly back into the past. Two of the biggest launches in recent years have actually been mini versions of the comparatively ancient 80s and 90s games consoles, Sega’s Mega Drive and Nintendo’s SNESNES. “Without a doubt, people are going back to the classics,” says Iain Simons, director of the National Videogame Museum in Sheffield. “They pioneered so many of the things we have today.”One obvious reason why audiences are opting for classic, safe bets is the sense of comfort they can provide in a world that feels increasingly precarious. This feeling of comfort isn’t simply a function of nostalgic familiarity, however. Today’s new TV shows often reflect our current dystopian mood and the fashion for grisly narrative plot twists and traumatic backstories. Think Black Mirror compared with Frasier.There are other reasons for playing it safe when it comes to pop culture. Partly, it can be about taking joy in simplicity amid the complexity of the world we live in. Our frantic pace of life makes spare time so rare that people are wary of not enjoying the little they have of it. “I can see the appeal in a safe bet, especially if you are going to spend a lot of money on tickets,” says Anna Smith, film critic, broadcaster and host of the all-female film review podcast Girls on Film.Likewise, Simons notes that there’s a beauty in the relative simplicity of older video games: “There’s something comforting about only having three lives in a game there are only so many hours in the day.”Nostalgic cultural consumption can also remove the all-too common problem of too much choice. “The overabundance of content can make people feel overwhelmed,” says Cristel Russell, a professor of marketing at Graziadio Business School, who has conducted several studies into people’s re-reading of stories and reconsumption of media. “It’s like going to a restaurant and the menu being 20 pages long. You’re probably just going to order something you’ve had before.”One of Russell’s studies found that revisiting cultural favourites is such a deliberate act – as opposed to a habit – that she coined the term “volitional reconsumption” to describe it. She also found that nostalgic culture can offer something that new works can’t: a form of self-discovery. “The thing you’re watching hasn’t changed, but you have,” explains Russell. “You’ve accumulated all this knowledge and experience, so you’re not looking at it through the same eyes. When you revisit it, you get to see how much you have changed as a person.”Revisiting pieces of classic cultural entertainment can also give us bonding social experiences. For instance, events such as Secret Cinema, which screens old favourites in specially-created immersive worlds, thrive on the feeling of community and belonging you get when you bring fans of a movie together to celebrate it. “I think one of the keys here is the community aspect: we love to watch a cherished film with others, and laugh and cry together,” says Smith. “In a society that feels increasingly less community driven, in many ways this is an outlet for a positive shared experience.”There are other possible psychological benefits to reconsuming cultural works. Erica Hepper, a lecturer in personality and social psychology at the University of Surrey, has researched the social emotion of nostalgia, including the reconsumption of works of art. One study involved letting participants choose an old, beloved song to listen to and then comparing their emotions with those of people who hadn’t done so. “Time and again, we found that people who listened to something that was nostalgic experienced all of these psychological boosts – they feel more connected to people, they feel better about themselves, they feel more optimistic,” says Hepper. “They also feel more motivated to achieve their goals. So nostalgia isn’t about being stuck in the past, it actually looks to the future.”Indeed, one of Russell’s studies showed that reconsuming cultural works can even involve more intense cognitive processes than watching something for the first time. To test this, subjects were made to wear eye-tracking equipment while watching a black-and-white Russian film twice. The equipment monitored both the movement of their eyes and pupil dilation, which can indicate the intensity of the cognitive effort they were undergoing. “Sure enough, on the second viewing, your eye gaze goes to different parts of the screen – you are taking it in in a different way,” says Russell.She found that people were watching in a way that suggested they appreciated the film much more as a work of art on the second viewing. For instance, they were looking at all the creative details rather than just following the plot. Moreover, she found that people’s pupils were more dilated while doing so. “When you rewatch something, the cognitive effort involved changes. You are hyper-responsive – all of your senses are on. It is a much more intense process than watching something for the first time.”That intensity might seem counterintuitive, given how comforting nostalgic pop culture can feel. But as the trend itself illustrates, opting for comforting pop culture isn’t a passive act. Given the emotional and psychological upsides of the tried and tested, it’s no wonder we enjoy watching things again. And again. And again.Safety mattersYour world matters to us.

The site in Armenia was constructed in 1943 to conduct top-secret research into atomic reactions for the development of nuclear weapons. Now the facility provides insight into thunderstorms and cosmic rays. The only way visitors can reach the base in winter is via a nine-mile (15km) climb through snow.Arshak Mkrtchyan, a mountain guide, cuts a trail to the station in snowshoes in temperatures around -22C.Arriving at the station at sunset, the wind is howling across the plateau and the temperature has plummeted to dangerous levels.Technicians at the facility work one month on, one month off during the winter.Inside the station, it is surprisingly cosy. Edik Arshakian and Gurgen Jabaryan, both technicians, are tasked with monitoring the scientific equipment, while Gohar Hovhannisian prepares the meals. She describes being somewhat trapped during the winter.Hovhannisian presides over an enormous kitchen built during the Soviet period, when scores of technicians were required to monitor and maintain rudimentary equipment. In winter she cooks mostly for just two technicians and herself.The confusingly named “rays” are, in fact, high-energy protons and atomic nuclei that zip through space at nearly the speed of light.When they meet the Earth’s atmosphere they strike atoms and scatter them like snooker balls. These particles have the power to cut through material, including humans, and are sometimes blamed for corrupting digital memory and crashing computers.The particles are one of the main obstacles to interplanetary travel, and their effects on astronauts and pilots are the subject of continued study.High-altitude bases such as the one on Aragats are exposed to far higher doses of the cosmic specks than occurs at sea level, since the Earth’s atmosphere serves as a protective blanket.The Aragats facility is part of a network of sites around the world studying cosmic rays and is linked to research stations as far away as Costa Rica and Indonesia.As well as studying cosmic rays, the centre is equipped with sensors that can record lightning strikes from miles around. In 2018, researchers using the sensors on Aragats found a link between thunderclouds and drastic spikes in radiation, which may affect passengers and crew onboard aircraft.Soviet-era electronics abound at the base. Amid the economic turmoil that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Aragats station was kept alive by state funds and donations from the Armenian diaspora community which continue today.Dotted around the centre, “scintillators” record incoming cosmic rays as they strike chunks of clear plastic inside, causing tiny flashes of light.Although Aragats is a thriving research site in summer, when visitors can arrive by car, through the long winter months it is a lonely place almost cut off from the rest of the world.Jabaryan jokes that his favourite part of working at the site is “when the snowmobile comes to pick me up at the end of the month”. But the isolation of this mountain station is a worthy sacrifice for science since, as Hovhannisian says: “We’re above civilisation. The cosmic particles arrive clear and pure here since there’s nothing to disturb them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b31136ce998a49f288e41848af6585f1a0e7357c/0_267_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=77932bb35b0fe9163ffbbf85ebb3272b","title":"tell us have you been affected by the coronavirus","story":"If you have been affected or have any information or news tips for our journalists, we would like to hear from youThe death toll from the coronavirus outbreak in China has reached 563, as health experts prepared to meet in Geneva next week in an attempt to develop a vaccine and Japan reported 10 more infections among passengers aboard a luxury cruise liner quarantined outside Yokohama.China’s national health commission said that, as of midnight Wednesday, there were 28,018 confirmed cases throughout the country – a rise of 3,694 and the biggest 24-hour rise – as well as 24,702 suspected cases.Outside mainland China, at least 230 cases have been confirmed, including two fatalities, one in Hong Kong and another in the Philippines.If you’ve been affected and would like to share your experience or news tips, anonymously if you prefer, direct with our journalists then please do so via the form below.

Some of the women who use long-term injectable contraception are among the most vulnerable in society, they say.“While we are grateful to the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) for working closely with suppliers to reintroduce some of these products to the market, it remains unclear why there is a shortage in the first place or when the normal supply of the products might resume. The lack of transparency around why these shortages have occurred is extremely frustrating.“Thousands of women and girls have been adversely affected by this ongoing situation and they deserve better. We are calling on the DHSC to set up a working group with industry, regulatory agencies and our organisations to get to the root of why shortages in both HRT and contraceptives have occurred. This working group must work together to ensure that this situation is prevented from happening again.”Dr Asha Kasliwal, the president of the FSRH, said it was concerned about reported shortages of certain contraceptives, which could lead to unplanned pregnancies. “We have received queries from our members who are finding it increasingly hard to prescribe contraception,” she said.The FSRH said it had been aware of a number of shortages, both of long-acting reversible contraceptives, such as the Sayana Press, and the oral pill. There are shortages of Norimin and Synphase, which are combined pills with more than one hormone. Some are being completely discontinued, such as Cilest and Loestrin. There are also shortages of the progestogen-only pill, such as Noriday.“We are aware that women are sent away with prescriptions for unavailable products and end up lost in a system that is frustrating to navigate. This is causing utter chaos for patients, clinicians and pharmacists,” said Kasliwal.There was no true equivalent for the Sayan Press self-injectable contraceptive, she said. This means women would have to go to their doctor or practice nurse to be given an injection on a monthly basis instead. That puts a burden on them – some of whom might not be able to get to a GP surgery on a monthly basis or might not want their families to know – and also on the hard-pressed NHS.“These shortages disproportionately affect the most vulnerable in our society, for example a woman struggling to access clinics, or a transgender patient, who is already under psychological distress and for whom changing contraceptive preparations could cause further difficulties,” she said.Nursing staff could not stand by while pharmaceutical shortages are damaging women’s health, said the Royal College of Nursing, which backed the call for an investigation. “Shortages of contraceptives and HRT mean that women are sometimes going for months on end without their medication, leading to complications, poor symptom control, a decreased quality of life, and in the case of contraception, unplanned pregnancies. Women are contacting nurses expressing their frustration about not being able to obtain their medication but unfortunately there are often no suitable alternatives.”The British Menopause Society continues to update its website on the availability of HRT products and alternatives. “For the majority of women, supplies of alternative HRT products are available and women affected should discuss alternatives with their doctor,” said Haitham Hamoda, its chair.“It is very frustrating that we still do not know why these shortages are happening, and why they seem to be unique to the UK. While we understand the DHSC is working with suppliers, we remain concerned about these shortages which need to be addressed urgently.”A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “We understand how distressing medicine shortages are and we want to reassure patients we are doing everything we can to help them access treatments as soon as possible. We are working closely with suppliers and stakeholders to resolve this as soon as possible and continue to ensure we share relevant information across the NHS on a regular basis.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/63f70c4777a6c9c995b251f839e272809d142744/0_109_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3d73de5882e1d172fc4544df41eeb7d4","title":"daniel dubois and joe joyce to meet in london showdown boxing","story":"Undefeated British heavyweights Daniel Dubois and Joe Joyce will face each other in their native London on 11 April.Olympic silver medallist Joyce, 34, and British, Commonwealth, WBC Silver and WBO International champion Dubois, 22, will meet at the O2 Arena.Dubois, who is 14-0 in his professional career, said: “This is the biggest fight of my career without doubt.

The contract, due to commence in the spring, amounts to a recognition that the British Horseracing Authority has some expertise in this area and headcount at its High Holborn office is to increase to fulfil its new obligations.Niall Cronin, communications manager at the Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board, explained: “The IHRB issued a tender for an external company to provide additional monitoring of betting trends on Irish racing to support our existing integrity functions and provide additional information to our stewards with regard to any issues or concerns that may arise.“Following the procurement process, the BHA were identified as the preferred supplier. The BHA will be supporting the IHRB in monitoring of betting on Irish racing and we will also be co-operating in other areas of intelligence.”The BHA has no history of taking on such contract work for other regulators but its spokesman, Robin Mounsey, said that the benefits of closer co-operation with Irish officials were too good to pass up. “The improved collaboration that this agreement will bring will benefit those who work in, bet on and follow racing on both sides of the Irish Sea,” he said.“Using a single intelligence management and monitoring system, as well as recruiting a dedicated resource to monitor the majority of Irish racing from a betting perspective will further protect the integrity of both British and Irish racing and allow the relationship that exists between the BHA and IHRB to grow closer still.”While the degree of proposed collaboration is new, the two regulators have had a good working relationship for years. IHRB vets have assisted the BHA in the build-up to major racing festivals by carrying out tests on some intended runners based in Ireland. Dr Lynn Hillyer, head of anti-doping and chief veterinary officer at the IHRB, joined straight from a nine-year stretch at the BHA. CCNicky Henderson made it plain at Huntingdon yesterday that Shishkin is the leader of the pack among two-mile novice hurdlers at his yard, but he also pointed out that “there’s a host of them in the Ballymore” and Global Society (1.50), who makes his second start over hurdles at Kempton Park this afternoon, could yet prove to be good enough to line up at the Festival.Global Society started favourite for three bumpers in Ireland in his first season, when he was trained by Gordon Elliott, but got off the mark immediately after switching to the Henderson stable under a hand ride by Nico de Boinville. Today’s step up to two miles and five furlongs looks sure to suit, and should also provide a much better test of his Cheltenham credentials with Colin Tizzard’s useful Ofalltheginjoints among the horses taking him on.A big field lines up for the handicap hurdle at 2.55 on the same card, but quite a few are making up the numbers and the favourite Imperial Elysian (2.55) looking fairly priced at around 4-1 to follow up his recent win at Huntingdon.Nefyn Point (3.50) should go well at around 6-1 on the Bangor card, while Fantastic Flyer (7.15) is worth an interest at decent odds to return to form at Chelmsford City this evening. Dean Ivory’s mare is generally consistent and only 2lb higher than for her latest win over course and distance. Jorvik Prince (8.15), meanwhile, will take all the beating in the finale having returned to form in convincing fashion on his first start for Mick Appleby last time.

A lovely return of serve here from Lev Everage. “Can all the people still whinging about England’s World Cup win confirm that they also believe Australia didn’t win in 1999? They progressed from their tied semi with South Africa because of a superior net run rate in the preceding round, which might even be lamer than most boundaries scored.”Oh, my sweet spot! I spent two months researching the 1999 World Cup last year (an essay that lives in The Nightwatchman) and NRR, I strongly agree, is a dreadful way to sort out a tournament where points are skewed to end up level. They actually fixed this for the 2003 comp - by far the best format yet. Sigh!As a (proud) Australian living in London covering the game around the world, my assessment is that there’s no doubt that Aussie fans were far angrier about the 2019 tie-breaker than New Zealanders. There’s probably an essay in that, too.Ground inspection coming up in 15 minutes. We are seeing pictures of the outfield covers coming off the ground with the pitch now clear (very green!). Nick Knight says they understand it will be at least an hour before we’re ready to roll. Progress!The Sky coverage is turning into an excellent chat with Jimmy, specifically about maintaining fitness over his marathon career. He really is in absurd nick. “Gidday Adam.” Good morning, Ailstair Connor. “As a dual French-NZ national, may I the first to draw the obvious analogy between the Cape Town ODI and the Six Nations game in Paris? World champions fail to turn up in Cape Town, vice world champions absent in Paris? (Though England are only co-world-champions really : match drawn, super over drawn, end of story).”Despite coming from Melbourne, even this rugby chat I can (vaguely) understand. It’s a tough little period of ODI cricket for England given all their white-ball focus on the T20 World Cup in October. This is a point Andy Zaltzman made on the BBC Cricket Social when I was on there the other week: why don’t we have more World Cups? His argment is that short-form cricket is defined by tournaments, so hold them every other year. We don’t need to follow the Olympicsfootballrugby.

That’s six (count ‘em) six hours from now. The ground as it looked half an hour ago. Good morning and welcome to the second ODI from Kingsmead. The bad news off the top: it is raining in Durban. With the TV coverage yet to start, I’m not sure what we are talking about exactly, but twitter is hinting at a delayed start. The forecast isn’t crash hot either, to level with you. But don’t let than dampen your enthusiasm for the OBO - we all know that our rain chats are some of the best. If they play, the task ahead of England is levelling the series after losing the opener on Tuesday. We learned more about the home side in victory than the visitors in defeat, racing away to a comfortable victory with Quinton de Kock saluting for a century at the first time of asking since taking over as skipper.It was the first limited-overs international for the world champions since they held the trophy aloft on that famous day at Lord’s last July, although the XI that played that day barely resembles the side out there this week. Plenty of those frontline white-ball stars (not least a couple of handy blokes called Stokes and Buttler) are having a breather while Archer’s elbow - we have learned since the previous fixture - requires plenty of rehab before he bowls again. Righto, I’m looking forward to your company throughout, rain or otherwise!

They can’tEvery four years, journalists from around the world are drawn to the Iowa caucuses like podcasters to a murder. The blatantly anti-democratic tradition appeals to certain journalistic biases: the steadfast belief of the political press that rural Americans are more authentically American than the vast majority of Americans who live in cities and suburbs – and the irresistible opportunity to pedantically explain arcane rules. You can also get something called a “pie shake” in Iowa, which is, truly, delicious.I understand the appeal. In 2008, as a graduate student at the University of Iowa, I was so enthusiastic about the caucuses that I stayed in town through winter break during the snowiest Iowa winter on record, rather than risk missing my chance to caucus for Barack Obama. (This was long before I had even considered journalism as a career.) The exercise in “democracy” that I ended up experiencing was patently absurd.The Democratic party caucuses drew a record turnout in 2008, and mine was packed. Crammed into a campus lecture hall with theater-style seating, none of the “how to caucus” tutorials that advised sending each candidate’s supporters to a different corner of the room applied. The vast majority of people in the room supported Obama, but figuring out exactly how many people that was eluded the party officials in charge. They told the volunteers coordinating the Obama group to come up with their count – and do it quickly. Those volunteers had come prepared they had written the numbers one to 500 on slips of construction paper, which they planned to give to each Obama supporter. The last card distributed would equal the total vote count.It was a perfectly reasonable plan that fell apart the moment someone got impatient and broke the single, numerically-ordered stack, into multiple stacks. Thus ensued much shouting and recrimination, futile attempts to claw back the cards, and vague threats from the party officials. By the time we were ready to start the second stage of caucusing – when those who opt for candidates with insufficient support can switch to their second choice – results from around the state were already being reported and discussed in our room, influencing some people’s decisions. It was a mess.That ill-fated stack of cards in my caucus was a kind of analog version of the now infamous app that set off the Democratic party’s woes in Iowa this week: a perfectly fine idea stymied by poor execution, impatience, and a tendency to seek shortcuts.Silicon Valley is the current spiritual home of hucksters selling plausible-sounding, technological “solutions” to complicated societal problems, so it’s not exactly surprising that the company that bungled the caucus app is tied to a group that exemplifies this unhappy intersection. Acronym, and its affiliated Super Pac, Pacronym, racked up glowing press by selling the idea that Democrats could win back the White House with better digital ads and a propaganda operation designed to appeal to Facebook users.I’m sure that their pitch sounded very convincing. Advanced technology so often does. Just this week, America’s largest bookseller allowed artificial intelligence to convince it that the heroine of the Secret Garden – the child of British colonists in India who was sent home to be raised by her uncle in an English manor house – could be anything other than white. We are a country that allowed Theranos to perform blood tests on actual patients without ever proving its product worked that has confronted the epidemic of school shootings with invasive digital surveillance of students’ email accounts.We have become untenably susceptible to the idea that AI is a substitute for judgment and that technological shortcuts are a viable strategy. They aren’t. Pulling the US back from the brink of authoritarianism is not going to be accomplished with Facebook ads and liberal propaganda masquerading as local news. It’s going to take incredibly hard work from political and community organizers persuading those under the spell of Trump’s demagoguery, motivating the unmotivated to vote – and working precinct by precinct to counteract the well-funded systematic efforts to disenfranchise large swaths of the electorate.There are no shortcuts to reviving American’s democracy. Anyone who tells you otherwise is selling you something."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12ab951c3efe2c4638d90292371d46f20834374b/0_272_4801_2881/master/4801.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a7740095705437d2c1ade84640d506b4","title":"uber ab5 changes drivers california","story":"The company is giving drivers more freedom, but critics say the move is a ‘smokescreen’ and that nothing has really changedFor the past month, the ride-hailing company Uber has been piloting new features in California, such as letting drivers set their own payment rates, in hopes it will avoid the reach of a new state law threatening to reclassify its contractors as full-time employees.But workers – and legal experts – say they aren’t fooled.“This is a smokescreen to make it look like we have more say than we do,” said Steve Gregg, a California driver who has completed more than 16,000 rides for Uber and Lyft over the past three years. “They are trying to manipulate their public image.”On 1 January, California enacted a law known as AB5, which changes the way contract workers are classified. It implements a three-part standard for determining whether workers are properly classified as independent contractors, requiring that 1) they are free from the company’s control 2) they are doing work that isn’t central to the company’s business and 3) they have an independent business in that industry.As a means of complying, Uber now allows drivers to get more trip information up front before accepting a rider’s request, including travel time, distance, destination and estimated fare. Drivers can now reject ride requests without penalty.The change gives drivers the illusion of more autonomy, but “seems like a trick”, said Veena Dubal, an associate professor of labor law at University of California-Hastings. If a driver sets a fare too high, they may end up waiting longer for a passenger. If they set it too low, they won’t be able to cover their costs.“This is incentivizing a race to the bottom”, Dubal said. “I am skeptical this is good for workers.”Nor will it help Uber drivers to pass the three-part test at the center of AB5, Dubal said, as the core of Uber’s business will still be driving. Drivers will thus fail part two, which declares a worker must be “doing work that isn’t central to the company’s business” in order to be a contractor.Instead, she suggested these changes may lead customers to believe drivers have more autonomy than they do, which is key ahead of the ballot measure Uber has pledged to introduce in 2020 to counteract AB5.Uber drivers have long asked for more freedom to cancel rides, but the changes are too little too late, Gregg said.“Nothing has really changed, but Uber makes it as convoluted as possible to make it seem like they have changed,” he said.Since 21 January, Uber has been testing an additional feature in several cities that allows drivers to set their own payment rates, in an effort to prove its employees are contractors with freedom to set their own wages.It is currently being tested only at airports in Santa Barbara, Palm Springs and Sacramento, a spokesman for the company said. He said these changes were meant to “enhance drivers’ control” over their earnings to address AB5.“Since AB5 has gone into effect, we’ve made a number of product changes to preserve flexible work for tens of thousands of California drivers,” he said. “We’re now doing an initial test of additional changes which would give drivers more control over the rates they charge riders.”Uber has also introduced measures on the rider side, showing them a range of prices based on distance and time when hailing a ride rather than the set rate provided in the past. They will also be able to select “favorite” drivers to be matched with again in the future.“This has much more to do with public perception than whether it will actually have a legal impact on AB5,” Dubal said. “The intention is to create confusion among the riding public and among drivers.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8322b02fccb03ca36c42116b2fcf6f07012b0302/160_0_5623_3374/master/5623.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e9a1e1137e23d495cb54a4427c945be","title":"in pictures eight hidden gems of north west france","story":"From vintage steam trains and magical medieval chateaux to corking sparkling wine, north-west France has something to offer all the family.Feeling inspired?

But look, we can’t do anything, we are good strong healthy people and we’ve got good immune systems and fingers crossed that ... we can fight it off.“It’s a frightening situation but it is not a disease where if you get it, it’s certain death. You just have to be lighthearted about the whole situation.”The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the Wuhan coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.Despite a surge in sales of face masks in the aftermath of the outbreak of the coronavirus outbreak, experts are ided over whether they can prevent transmission and infection. There is some evidence to suggest that masks can help prevent hand-to-mouth transmissions, given the large number of times people touch their faces. The consensus appears to be that wearing a mask can limit – but not eliminate – the risks, provided they are used correctly.David Abel, a British man who has provided regular video updates via Facebook, said he and his wife Sally – who are celebrating their 50th wedding anniversary – had accepted they were no longer on holiday.“We’re no longer on a cruise,” he said on Thursday. “All of the luxury of having a steward come into the cabin to make the bed and put chocolates on the pillow, change the towels and facecloths and clean the bathroom – those days are gone. It just ain’t happening.”The endless supply of buffet food and drink, along with activities, entertainment and shore visits, has abruptly dried up, replaced by what to the passengers must seem like relative austerity: one hot drink a day, no-frills meals and, according to Abel, a suspension of laundry and linen services.The cancelled itinerary for Wednesday included a dizzying array of activities, including tai chi and origami classes, Bible study, line dancing, bingo, karaoke, and “Music and Martinis with the Evergreen Duo” in the Crooners bar. Instead, passengers pinned their hopes on finding enough on-demand movies to sustain them during the long days ahead.But there was humour amid the resignation and uncertainty. One male passenger, who opened a Twitter account at the start of the quarantine, said he and his wife’s ninth wedding anniversary had been marked by news of another 10 infections among their fellow passengers. “Happy anniversary!” he wrote.Some celebrated minor victories: expanded lunch and dinner menus, breakfasts delivered at the appropriate time, an internet connection upgrade, a bigger movie selection, and, in Abel’s case, words of thanks from a masked female crew member whose concerned mother had been reassured by his video posts.Others tweeted photos of recently delivered playing cards, as well as sudoku and other puzzles that had been delivered to their rooms.On Thursday, the irrepressibly good-humoured Abel used his newfound online fame to issue a couple of requests. Life would be more tolerable, he said, with a daily banana and a glass of whisky, preferably a Talisker 10-year-old single malt served straight.On a more serious note, he added: “It’s a horrible situation for most passengers onboard, being stuck here, confined to the cabin,” he said, referring to those staying in cabins without a sea-view balcony. “It must be almost unbearable for them.”On Thursday evening, just two days into at least a fortnight of quarantine, they were told they would be allowed on the open deck for 90 minutes under the supervision of quarantine officers. They must stay one metre apart from each other and not make physical contact or form groups.Despite the restrictions, a blast of fresh air blowing in from the Pacific could not come soon enough for Clyde and Renee Smith, an American couple who are on the ship with their two adult grandsons.The couple’s room “is tiny, we don’t have a window, there are four of us – and only one chair”, Renee, 80, said earlier in the day, adding that they had passed the time by watching films.Their 25-year-old grandson, Sawyer Smith, was trying to stay in shape by doing sit-ups now that he was unable to visit the ship’s gym. “It’s not really to the point where we’re getting stir-crazy,” he said. “If they keep us in the rooms for four to five days it might be a little different.”Agencies contributed to this report."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2a7624aa5f31d889fc7e3403a22c8d8a9b0e138/0_287_4896_2937/master/4896.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d49536fefc3cb38949b069339871ebe","title":"antarctica logs hottest temperature on record with a reading of 183c","story":"A new record set so soon after the previous record of 17.5C in March 2015 is a sign warming in Antarctica is happening much faster than global averageAntarctica has logged its hottest temperature on record, with an Argentinian research station thermometer reading 18.3C, beating the previous record by 0.8C.The reading, taken at Esperanza on the northern tip of the continent’s peninsula, beats Antarctica’s previous record of 17.5C, set in March 2015.A tweet from Argentina’s meteorological agency on Friday revealed the record. The station’s data goes back to 1961.Antarctica’s peninsula – the area that points towards South America – is one of the fastest warming places on earth, heating by almost 3C over the past 50 years, according to the World Meteorological Organization. Almost all the region’s glaciers are melting.The Esperanza reading breaks the record for the Antarctic continent. The record for the Antarctic region – that is, everywhere south of 60 degrees latitude – is 19.8C, taken on Signy Island in January 1982.Prof James Renwick, a climate scientist at Victoria University of Wellington, was a member of an ad-hoc World Meteorological Organization committee that has verified previous records in Antarctica.He told  Australia it was likely the committee would be reconvened to check the new Esperanza record.“The reading is impressive as it’s only five years since the previous record was set and this is almost one degree centigrade higher. It’s a sign of the warming that has been happening there that’s much faster than the global average.“To have a new record set that quickly is surprising but who knows how long that will last? Possibly not that long at all.”He said the temperature record at Esperanza was one of the longest-running on the whole continent.Renwick said higher temperatures in the region tended to coincide with strong northwesterly winds moving down mountain slopes – a feature of the weather patterns around Esperanza in recent days.He said there were complex weather patterns in the area, but the Esperanza reading was likely a combination of natural variability and background warming caused by rising levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.He said: “The reason the peninsula is warming faster than other places is a combination of natural variations and warming signals.”Prof Nerilie Abram, a climate scientist at the Australian National University, has carried out research at James Ross Island at the northern tip of the peninsula.“It’s an area that’s warming very quickly,” she said, adding it can occasionally be warm enough to wear a T-shirt.Previous research from 2012 found the current rate of warming in the region was almost unprecedented over the past 2000 years.Abram said: “Even small increases in warming can lead to large increases in the energy you have for melting the ice. The consequences are the collapse of the ice shelves along the peninsula.”Meltwater can work its way through cracks in ice shelves, she said. Because ice shelves already float on the ocean, their collapse does not directly contribute to rising sea levels.But Abram said the shelves acted as plugs, helping to keep the ice sheets behind them stable. Melting of ice sheets does contribute to rising sea levels because they are attached to land.Dr Steve Rintoul, a leading oceanographer and Antarctic expert at CSIRO, said: “This is a record from only a single station, but it is in the context of what’s happening elsewhere and is more evidence that as the planet warms we get more warm records and fewer cold records.”The lowest temperature ever recorded in Antarctica – and anywhere on Earth – was at the Russian Vostok station, when temperatures dropped to -89.2C on 21 July 1983."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2b772a8c28ae58b513749d8ac95241d52f81cca/0_234_4608_2765/master/4608.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2157edfaca9a4062d729012b80315f49","title":"finland blazes trail in keeping citizens cycling and healthy","story":"Country routinely praised for its schools system aims to do the same with preventive healthby  Peter Walker in Joensuu, FinlandThe temperature, even at 9.30am, is -13C, and light snow is falling on the already white-blanketed playground. But dozens of primary-age children are out, and doing something you might not expect in such conditions: riding bikes.Teachers say about half of the children at Joensuu normal school in eastern Finland usually arrive by bicycle, even during the icy winters. Even more have done so today, as an external instructor is here to lead them around a snowy bike obstacle course and other fun challenges.The school is hosting the opening event of the Winter Cycling Congress, a small and slightly niche annual gathering held this year in Joensuu, which prides itself that many of its citizens refuse to see several months of constant snow as a barrier to getting on a bike.Juha-Pekka Vartiainen, in charge of roads infrastructure for Joensuu and among the dozens of people speaking at the three-day gathering, says the city’s year-round cycling is partly down to geography and demographics.But far more important, he stresses, is the fact that he and his predecessors have spent years building safe bike routes, separated from the motor traffic. “There’s a long tradition of cycling here. But we also have a long tradition of planning for cycling,” Vartiainen says.“The things that are important for people cycling in the summer, they become critical in winter. For example, if you don’t have a cycle route it’s almost impossible to cycle in the winter – the road gets really rutted with snow and ice. It’s dangerous.”The Winter Cycling Congress, where academics, activists and other experts present research and swap tips, is run by a tiny group of volunteers, who rely on host cities to fund and promote the annual gatherings.Joensuu and the Finnish government have embraced this role with more gusto than most, flying foreign media including the  to attend the congress.In part this is straightforward PR for the city and its wider region, North Karelia, which despite recent progress remains poorer than average for Finland and heavily dependent on industries like forestry.But there is another reason. Finland’s schools system, routinely praised as one of the best in the world, is already a magnet for visiting international researchers and envious politicians. But now the country hopes to do the same with another sector: preventive health.Amid rising global worries about increasingly inactive and overweight populations, Finland has launched a series of typically interventionist programmes to get its people moving, whether on bikes or by other means.A now-national government scheme called Finnish Schools on the Move – also represented at the congress – finds ways for more children to walk or cycle to school, and then keeps them active in the classroom, using movement in lessons or giving pupils standing desks or balls to sit on rather than chairs.Such preventive health is a key priority of the new Finnish government led by Sanna Marin, the 34-year-old prime minister, who took over in December as the head of a five-party coalition.• While some cities, like Helsinki, clears bike lanes with brushes, Joensuu uses ploughs which leave a compacted snow base, roughened by a blade to give more grip. This sort of snow is fairly straightforward to ride on.• The difficulty – seen Joensuu with unseasonably mild weather earlier this winter – comes when snow starts to melt, but then freezes to ice overnight. The only really safe way to cycle on this is to fit bike tyres with metal studs, which can grip on ice.• For more temperate winter cycling, like in much of the UK, a key tip is to not dress too warmly, as you will heat up as you cycle. But do make sure your hands, feet and ears are properly insulated.Krista Kiuru, the minister for family affairs and social services, part of the health department, is responsible for this. A former education minister, she says Finland’s public health expertise can become as great an international calling card as its schools.“We’re not rich in natural resources,” she told the  at the Finnish parliament in Helsinki. “There’s no oil. But what we can do is similar to what we have done with schools, which is a very well known product around the world.”“When we talk about health issues we talk about healthcare. But very often we’re just talking about taking care of people who are sick. So we should aim to take care of health, not just of sickness. And this is challenging, because the people involved don’t just work at hospitals, but also in in transport, at swimming pools, all of that.”Finland is a pioneer of such policies, and Kiuru says there is a consensus between parties, even the populist True Finns, the second-biggest party in parliament, that these are worth the cost.She recalls, as education minister, changing the mind of one MP who questioned the annual €500m (£425) spend on free and nutritious lunches for all children by taking him to a school to try one himself.“Finns are basically quite motivated taxpayers,” she says. “As long as they can see that there is a greater good which will come from it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/743ba96fb299f76528762bb70279ca84acb0ff6c/0_0_1003_602/master/1003.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=25d1e122248fce3ef97d9dfee9d2304f","title":"israeli airstrikes in syria force russian plane into emergency landing","story":"Civilian aircraft carrying 172 passengers erted from Damascus airport to Russian airbaseA Syrian passenger plane was forced to make an emergency landing at a Russian-controlled airbase in Syria during Israeli airstrikes on Damascus earlier this week, the Russian defence ministry said.An Airbus A-320 carrying 172 passengers from Tehran was erted from Damascus airport in the early hours of Thursday to nearby Khmeimim airbase after Syrian air defences nearly hit it during an attempt to repulse the alleged Israeli attack, according to Russian state news agency RIA.Initial reports in Russian media indicated the plane was Russian, but Flight Radar data showed the plane was a Syrian-operated Cham Wings flight.The incident in Syria’s skies took place a month after a Ukraine International Airlines passenger plane crashed shortly after take-off from Tehran, killing all 176 people on board, after it was shot at in error by Iranian forces.At 2am on Thursday four Israeli F-16 fighter jets struck eight air-to-ground missiles in the suburbs of Damascus without entering Syrian airspace, a military spokesperson told RIA. Russia’s defence ministry denounced what it said was Israel’s “common practice” of using civilian aircraft as a “shield”, Russia Today reported.Syria has to date struggled to repel Israeli airstrikes. In 2018, Bashar al-Assad’s forces accidentally shot down a reconnaissance plane belonging to its Russian allies while responding to an Israeli attack with anti-aircraft missiles, killing 15 crew members. Moscow held the Israeli air force accountable for the incident for allegedly using the Russian plane as cover.Spokespeople for the Israeli military and foreign ministry declined to comment.Israel does not normally comment on its military activity in Syria. Since the civil war broke out in 2011 it has carried out hundreds of airstrikes targeting Assad’s Iranian and Hezbollah allies, whose presence in Syria is regarded as an existential threat by Israel. Strikes normally target supply routes and infrastructure such as weapons depots.The Israel Defence Forces recently confirmed it has also begun operations in Iraq to stop Iran and its proxies from entrenching inside the country.Thursday’s pre-dawn strikes in Syria were the most intense in months, targeting al-Kiswah, Marj al-Sultan and the Baghdad Bridge in the vicinity of Damascus and South Izra in the Daraa countryside.The attack killed at least 23 Syrian and allied Iranian fighters, according to war monitor the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Unconfirmed reports said the senior Syrian Maj Gen Ismail Badran, chief commander of Mezzeh airbase, was killed. Syrian state media reported eight injuries and no deaths.In July last year Damascus accused Israel of “heinous aggression” after strikes south of Damascus and in Homs province led to the deaths of at least six civilians.Syria’s foreign ministry filed a complaint to the United Nations security council over the attack, demanding accountability, although the Observatory said the deaths could have occurred in the aftermath of the attack by the remnants of missile parts or the Syrian counter-attack itself."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07921a2e62a8d268a6a77f6e509ceb4951e55757/0_216_3467_2080/master/3467.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c5865b48d6fb3b1ba378bcd7e745044","title":"paris mayor unveils 15 minute city plan in re election campaign","story":"Anne Hidalgo wants to create self-sufficient communities with amenities nearby, to cut pollution and stressThe Paris mayor, Anne Hidalgo, has made phasing out vehicles and creating a “15-minute city” a key pillar of her offering at the launch of her re-election campaign.The Socialist politician wants to encourage more self-sufficient communities within each arrondissement of the French capital, with grocery shops, parks, cafes, sports facilities, health centres, schools and even workplaces just a walk or bike ride away.Called the “ville du quart d’heure” – the quarter-hour city – the aim is to offer Parisians what they need on or near their doorstep to ensure an “ecological transformation” of the capital into a collection of neighbourhoods. This, she said, would reduce pollution and stress, creating socially and economically mixed districts to improve overall quality of life for residents and visitors.“Paris is a city unlike any other … it is independent, lively, vibrant. It is capable of inventing a new history without forgetting its past,” Hidalgo said at Thursday’s launch.The driving force behind the 15-minute city idea is the Sorbonne professor Carlos Moreno, who believes the “core of human activity” in cities must move away from oil-era priorities of roads and car ownership as we move into a post-vehicle era.“We need to reinvent the idea of urban proximity,” Moreno says. “We know it is better for people to work near to where they live, and if they can go shopping nearby and have the leisure and services they need around them too, it allows them to have a more tranquil existence.“Work is more problematic because people’s jobs are often some way from their homes, but we must rethink this too. Today, our approach to work is the same as it has been for the last 50 years. Is it always necessary to show up somewhere, to be physically present in front of the boss? It is possible to do things differently.”Moreno, a Franco-Colombian who has lived in Paris since he was 20, is delighted Hidalgo has personally picked up his concept of what he calls a “living smart city” and put it at the heart of her political campaign.“When she called me and said she was interested and we met, I thought it would be a paragraph down the bottom of the campaign leaflet, but it’s there at the centre,” he told the .The living smart city is more dense but people friendly, Moreno says, painting the picture of an urban utopia where people know each other and “say bonjour” rather than rushing from one place to another in “a permanent state of anxiety”. The approach is based on four major principles: proximity, ersity, density and ubiquity, and inidual areas within the city should be able to fulfil six social functions: living, working, supplying, caring, learning and enjoying.“Living differently means above all transforming our relationship with time, especially time relating to moving around. Commuting is costly in every respect,” Moreno says.“There is no pleasure, no comfort in it. Take the metro or the suburban train and you see people who are in a state of stress and anguish. That is why we have to have this revolution, to have a city with lots of centres where people can find what they need. We need to break this rhythm of people’s lives, it is a radical approach that will transform lifestyles.”The 15-minute city is not a new idea, but would mark a revolutionary step in a city the size of Paris, the centre of which, bounded by the périphérique ring road, is home to more than 2.2 million people.Melbourne has developed 20-minute neighbourhoods where everything – shops, schools, parks, doctors – is within a 20-minute walk, a bike ride or on public transport. Moreno also cites Copenhagen in Denmark and Utrecht in the Netherlands as cities that have successfully introduced the idea of “hyper proximity” to fulfil the needs of city dwellers.In an hour-long speech unveiling an ambitious plan for the city, Hidalgo promised a sweeping range of policies covering every aspect of city life – from a new 5,000-strong unarmed municipal police force to free sanitary products in schools and public offices, via massive tree-planting and increased fines for “uncivil” behaviour such as urinating in the street or throwing cigarettes on the ground. She said the policies would be examined for their ecological and environmental impact.To the dismay of the car lobby, already angered by the closure of the highways either side of the River Seine that runs through the centre of Paris, Hidalgo has promised to continue pedestrianising swathes of the capital, plus a €350m (£300m) plan to create “a bike lane in every street” by 2024, and a plan to do away with 60,000 parking spaces for private cars.Main roads through Paris will be inaccessible to motor vehicles, “children streets” will be created next to schools for term time, and the schools turned over to local residents during weekends and holidays.Moreno says he was inspired by the American-Canadian author and activist Jane Jacobs, author of the 1961 classic The Death and Life of Great American Cities. “A neighbourhood, she wrote, is not only an association of buildings but also a network of social relationships, an environment where the feelings and the sympathy can flourish.”“My project is about proximity, participation, collaboration and ecology. In Paris we all feel we have no time, we are always rushing to one place or another, always trying to gain time. That is why I am convinced we need to transform the city so Parisians can learn, do sports, have healthcare, shop, within 15 minutes of their home.“This will take Paris into the future.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3a892b3fac2aef85dd3b7d31b60bdaba51e9fbc/0_0_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d049aa8c4f20e1d848ab35de30bd2e3c","title":"yemen mercy flight takes eight children to jordan for treatment","story":"Humanitarian breakthrough in five-year conflict, with two more flights to leave soonHer shoulder injury required simple surgery. In blockaded Yemen, that was out of reach. And so Manal’s right arm shrank as her left arm grew stronger, and her father started to turn away when she was being bathed or dressed. “I couldn’t stand the sight of her,” Abdullah Ali Lutfallah said. “It broke my heart.”After a year and a half of negotiations, five-year-old Manal was among eight children to be evacuated from Sana’a this week for medical treatment in Jordan on the first civilian flight permitted to leave the Yemeni capital in three years. A second aircraft carrying an additional 24 patients was scheduled to leave for Amman on Friday, with a third bound for Egypt expected to follow soon.The “mercy flights” are a rare humanitarian breakthrough in a stagnating five-year conflict between parties used to dealing in the zero-sum logic of war. Even the night before the first aircraft took off on Monday, the Houthis who control most of northern Yemen, including Sana’a, threatened to withdraw permission. Yemen’s internationally recognised government, which enforces a strict air-and-sea blockade on rebel-held territory, also held up the process at earlier stages.“On at least four occasions, a hard-fought consensus broke down and every time that happened, people who should have been receiving care died,” a person familiar with the matter said. “It was deeply frustrating for everyone working on the issue because we all knew how many lives were at stake, and the people who needed help the most were the ones being sacrificed.”For the past three months, a hotel in Sana’a became a makeshift waiting room for about 30 families, some trying to keep their children alive long enough for Yemen’s duelling governments to agree to allow them to go abroad for treatment.“I didn’t believe it was really happening until the plane took off,” said Majdi Abdulwahab, whose daughter Samira, 10, underwent reconstructive ear surgery at Amman’s Speciality hospital on Wednesday morning, five years after being injured in a motorcycle accident.Even before the war, Yemen’s health system was one of the least developed in the region. Once the fighting started, cases such as Manal’s traumatic shoulder injury became impossible to treat. “I submitted her case to a rehabilitation centre and after three months they told us they couldn’t help her,” Lutfallah, 40, said. “We took her back to the doctor, and he said he couldn’t help her either.”Wahib Senan took his son, Ayman, 10, to several doctors and lobbied high officials to find treatment for the scoliosis that started curving the boy’s spine four years ago. “They always told us he had to fly abroad,” he said. “He couldn’t sleep or live his life normally … Seeing your son dying is crushing.”Behind the scenes, international officials worked to build consensus between the parties involved. “For two years, every time there was a breakthrough, one of several of the parties backtracked from their commitment,” a source familiar with the process said.The logistics presented another set of hurdles, including finding airlines willing to take out war insurance to conduct the flight, and finding a UN plane that might be free amid a global scramble to evacuate citizens from coronavirus-hit China.Nursing his daughter in a hotel room, Abdulwahab said he struggled to understand why getting a 10-year-old girl into surgery was so fraught: “What is the fault of those who are suffering from sickness to be dragged into the politics of the world?”For instance, in October, dozens of families with sick children were summoned to Sana’a and told to prepare to fly. A few days later, they were informed that negotiations had broken down and the airlift was cancelled. “We were devastated,” Abdalwahab said.Over the next weeks, new flights were repeatedly scheduled then cancelled at the last minute. International officials were reluctant to send the families home, and by that point, Senan said, he would not have left anyway. “I was either going to get my son treated or die with him,” he said.“You cannot imagine what it was like, psychologically, for those waiting at that hotel,” said Lutfallah. “One woman had cancer, and because she couldn’t get medical care in time, she lost her eyesight. Another father of a young girl was told that they would have to amputate both her legs, but he refused, because he knew she wouldn’t get proper care in Yemen.”For two children, Khalid and Abdullah, authorities agreed to the flight too late – and just in time. Khalid, 9, had entered the first stage of renal failure. “Without dialysis, his kidney would have totally failed,” said Ashraf Shami, a paediatrician overseeing his case in Jordan.Abdullah, 13, had found a donor in Yemen to give him a healthy kidney, but no place there to perform the surgery. The pair were onboard the first flight to Jordan on Monday. “He had months to live,” Shami said. “Maybe less.”Additional reporting by Jassar Al-Tahat"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4164602.1581028153!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"hundreds of students to begin this year s leaving cert exams early","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA pilot group of 40 schools will undertake the  first-ever Leaving Cert computer science exam. Photograph: iStockHundreds of students are set to begin their final Leaving Cert exams in May after authorities decided to schedule the new computer science exam in advance of the traditional exams.The first-ever computer science exam will be held on May 27th, a week before the main written exams begin on June 3rd.A pilot group of 40 schools are undertaking the exam and the subject will be rolled out nationally for all schools commencing in September 2020, for examination in 2022.In another first, the subject will be the first main exam where all students are required to complete it using computers.It involves a practical coursework project to be completed on a computer – under the supervision of the class teacher – which is worth 30 per cent of the total marks.This will be followed by a final exam on May 27th which will include a paper-based and a computer-based element, together worth 70 per cent of the total marks.All components will be assessed externally by the State Examinations Commission (SEC). The roll-out of computer science nationally is likely to pose challenges for some schools, especially those struggling with outdated computers or poor access to broadband.All participating schools in the first phase of the roll-out of computer science, for example, have been selected on the basis that they have the equipment or infrastructure to allow students complete their exams.This includes laptops with at least a 1GHz processor for each student with access to 100Mbits broadband.Skill shortagesParticipating schools have each received €3,000 towards the purchase of computer equipment.The move to introduce computer science to the Leaving Cert followed pressure from employers, who have warned about skill shortages in the Stem (science, technology, engineering and maths) sector.The new subject requires students to focus on how programming and computational thinking can be applied to the solution of problems, and how computing technology impacts the world around us.The move towards holding the computer science exam in May is also a sign of the pressure facing exam authorities to try to accommodate a growing number of exams within a short window.Last year, the SEC added two days to the traditional Leaving Cert written exam timetable.This move followed the introduction of new exams to the Leaving Cert, which have led to a growing number of subject clashes and students being forced to take up to three exams in a single day.This year, most exams will take place over 15 days, beginning on Wednesday, June 3rd and finishing on Tuesday, June 23rd.The final exam will be physical education (PE), which is being examined for the first time this year.A total of 80 secondary schools are piloting the PE exam this year and it is due to rolled out nationally from next September.Students who take the new PE exam will have to submit videos of themselves demonstrating their skills in a chosen physical activity – such as athletics, rugby or ballet – for examiners to grade. This will account for 30 per cent of marks.The remainder of marks will be given for a physical activity project (20 per cent) and a traditional written exam (50 per cent)."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4165103.1581069425!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"sf handling of quinn controversy calls into question way party is run says martin","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMicheál Martin: Sinn Féin needs to answer questions over who first put out the suggestion the late Paul Quinn was involved in criminality. Photograph: REUTERSHenry NichollsMr Martin said he fully endorsed the call by Mr Quinn’s mother, Breege, for a full retraction by Conor Murphy, the Sinn Féin Minister for Finance in Northern Ireland, of comments he made suggesting Mr Quinn was involved in crime.Mr Quinn (21) from Cullyhanna, Co Armagh, was beaten to death by up to ten men in a barn in Co Monaghan on October 20th, 2007, and his family have always held the IRA responsible for the killing.Gardaí believe Mr Quinn clashed with former members of the Provisional IRA who remained in position of control in the local community in South Armagh despite the peace process.Mr Murphy caused huge upset to the Quinn family when, in the aftermath of the murder, he suggested Mr Quinn was involved in criminality and smuggling. Earlier this week, however, he contacted the Quinn family and apologised.However Breege Quinn called on Mr Murphy to openly and clearly state he accepted her late son was not involved in criminality, and Mr Martin said he fully supported her in that call.Speaking during an early morning canvass in Cork city, Mr Martin said he had met Ms Quinn around five years ago and had been in touch with her again recently. The Fianna Fáil leader said she had shown huge courage and great determination in challenging Sinn Féin over Mr Murphy’s comment about her late son.“The Quinn family have suffered an awful lot – the savage murder of their son has been so traumatic for Stephen and Breege, and I think there is an obligation on Sinn Féin as a party and as a movement to apologise in a comprehensive way and withdraw any slur on his name. “The fact that her son’s name was sullied in the way it was has left a deep hurt on the Quinn family, and it’s extraordinary that it’s taken 13 years for an apology to emerge essentially because of Breege Quinn’s courage in consistently pursuing this,” he said.“And she was against a big machine she had to fight against a big operation and a big machine to have her voice heard. and she’s done it over many, many years.“There should be a comprehensive withdrawal of any allegations, but also people need to go to the PSNI and the gardaí and tell the police forces what exactly they know - who they spoke to at the time, how they got assurances around certain issues as to who was responsible and who was not.”Mr Martin said Sinn Féin needs to answer questions over who first put out the suggestion the late Mr Quinn was involved in criminality and that anyone involved in Sinn Féin who has information on the killing needs to contact the gardaí or the PSNI.“There can only be one police force in Ireland, there can only be one criminal justice system, there can’t be alternative systems, and this issue goes to the very heart of the whole Sinn Féin organisation in terms of how they operate, and that needs to change,” Mr Martin said.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4149058.1580234896!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"election 2020 all you need to know about the upcoming general election","story":"And they are off...  as the election for the 33rd Dáil begins,  Political Editor Pat Leahy predicts what the big issues will be.

However, Ireland’s historic 1918 election was held on a Saturday in December while the Nice Referendum and Children’s Referendum were also held on Saturdays.The Taoiseach said he decided to hold the election on a Saturday to make voting easier for families with children. “I do so knowing the inconvenience to families of a polling day on a weekday during school term – time off work, lost income, increased childcare costs,” he said. “I also want to make it easier for students and those working away from home to cast their votes.”Polls will open at 7am on Saturday and close at 10pm.\u0026nbspCounting will commence on Sunday in all 39 constituencies.Wait, February 8th sounds familiar.

Senator Ivana Bacik, director of elections for the party, said the campaign would focus on “real solutions including five non-negotiable proposals on housing, health, work, children and climate”.Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said the party would deliver the “largest” programme of public housing building in the history of the State if elected to government, adding the message that “the housing crisis can be sorted”.

Photograph: Getty ImagesPolitical anoraks and candidates chasing the last seats in a constituency obsess about vote transfers and how they will affect their chance of election.Sinn Féin has become the story of this election given the seismic surge in opinion poll support for it through the three-week election campaign. As a result there is growing interest in its record in attracting transfers and where its own transfers tend to go.However, political analyst Sean Donnelly says that transfers “won’t be that important” in this election for Sinn Féin. If the polls are reflected in the results, he believes a lot of its candidates will be elected on the first count. “Most of their existing TDs will top the polls, and most of them don’t have a running mate,” he says, meaning there will be no splitting of the vote.The party is only running two candidates in four constituencies – Cavan-Monaghan, Donegal, Dublin Mid-West and Louth.Donnelly points out that transfers are completely overrated in Irish elections despite the system being based on the single transferable vote.“People say they play a huge part of our electoral system. They don’t – 90 per cent of seats are won on first count. People have a notion that transfers are like a rescue mission, that somebody’s stuck in a cave or something and we send out this rescue mission called transfers. It doesn’t happen.”He points to two rules that between them account for 97 per cent of seats.“The first is that you have to be in the frame on the first count. If it’s a five seater you have to be in the first five, in a four-seater you have to be in the first four,” and the same applies to a three-seat constituency. “Only 10 per cent of TDs are elected outside this rule.”Rule two is that you must have at least half a quota on the first count. “A half quota won’t guarantee you a seat but if you’ve less than half you’ve no chance,” he says.He said on notable exception was Cyprian Brady, who got less than 1,000 first preference votes – 2.7 per cent – in Dublin Central in the 2007 general election. However, transfers from poll-topping Fianna Fáil running mate taoiseach Bertie Ahern saw him elected in what became known as “human surplus”.Donnelly says “there isn’t a rule in the world there isn’t an exception to, but you can’t judge something on a freak exception like that”.He says transfers made no difference whatsoever in the November byelections. TransfersIn the 2016 general election, just 12 seats out of 158 were affected by transfers. His own analysis in RTÉ’s The Week In Politics Election 2011 guide showed that 11 seats were changed by transfers and in two of those cases the change was within a party – Fine Gael transferred to a different Fine Gael candidate.In 2007, 14 seats (8 per cent of 166) were affected by transfers, and in both 2002 and 1997 some 18 seats were affected (11 per cent).This time around it is estimated that about 12 seats out of 160 will be affected by transfers, which means that 148 will be effectively decided on the first count.Historically, Sinn Féin has not been transfer-friendly but this has improved with each election. In 2011 the party got 7 per cent of all transfers nationally, rising in 2016 to 12.5 per cent. That compares to 23 per cent for Fine Gael and 16 per cent for Fianna Fáil.And as for their surplus votes, 28 per cent did not transfer, 26 per cent went internally to other Sinn Féin candidates, while 17 per cent went to Fianna Fáil, 8 per cent to Fine Gael, and 5 per cent to Labour. One third of votes nationally did not transfer.If Sinn Féin’s momentum is retained on election day it will not be needing transfers, and other parties cannot rely on getting the party’s transfers as a strategy.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4165177.1581074984!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ireland s voting system how does it work and how should i use it","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAt least half the ballot papers cast on Saturday will not be counted beyond the number one. File photograph: CollinsOur single transferrable vote system (STV) of proportional representation is one of the most flexible and subtle systems anywhere in the world. It enables voters to support the candidate or party they like best, even if they have little or no chance of being elected, and then using their preferences to ensure that their vote moves on to a candidate with a real chance of making it to the Dáil. While it is not strictly proportional it is much fairer than the straight vote system in the UK or the US. Should you vote all the way down the ballot paper?Yes. To maximise the impact of your vote it is best to give every candidate a preference. Give your first preference to the candidate you most want to see elected and then in descending order of preference down to the one you like least. You don’t have to do this and can stop at whatever point you want and your vote will still be valid but to have maximum impact it is best to use all your preferences. The key thing to remember is that a lower preference can never interfere with a higher one. Your number two will only come into play if your first preference is eliminated or elected and so on.So how does the system work?From a voter’s perspective STV is very simple. Just rank the candidates in order of your choice starting with 1. The counting of votes is a different matter and can appear very complicated to the uninitiated. The first thing to understand is that a quota is set for each constituency depending on the number of seats to be filled and the number of people who have voted. The quota is arrived at by iding the number of valid votes by the number of seats plus one, and then adding one to the resulting total.For instance if 40,000 votes are cast in a three-seat constituency the quota would be calculated by iding the number of votes by four and then adding one making it 10,001. The formula means that no more than three people can reach the quota. How do transfers work?After the first count when all the number ones have been counted the first thing to happen is that the surplus votes of a successful candidate who has exceeded the quota will be distributed. This is done by checking the second preferences on all the ballot papers of the candidate and distributing his or her number two’s in proportion.When all the first-count surpluses have been distributed the returning officer will then move on to eliminating the candidate with the lowest number of votes. The number two’s will be counted and allocated to the other candidates. The next lowest will be eliminated and so on until there are only three candidates left for the three seats.But where does a number four or five or even lower preference come in?As the counts progress a vote that was cast for a candidate eliminated early in the count will move on to the number two. If that candidate is eliminated in turn it will go on to number three and so on. If the candidate getting the number two is already elected or eliminated the vote will move on to the next available candidate still in the race.There is a complication about distributing the surplus of a candidate elected after the first count with the help of transfers. Instead of counting all of the candidate’s votes to allocate the next available preference, only the last bundles of votes received are counted to see where the next preferences goes. What is meant by tactical voting?One way of voting tactically is that by going all the way down the ballot paper you can support the candidate or party you want with high preferences while attempting to stop the ones you like least by putting them at the very end.Another way of voting tactically is that where a party is running more than one candidate, committed supporters are advised to give the number one to the weakest candidate on the ticket to maximise the party’s chances of winning more than one seat. If the candidate is eliminated, the vote will not be wasted as the next preference will automatically be counted.Are all the preferences on all ballot papers counted?No. At least half the ballot papers cast on Saturday will not be counted beyond the number one. If the number one goes to a candidate who is in contention for a seat but does not exceed the quota at any stage the second preference will not be counted. Many of the seats will be filled by candidates who fall just short of a quota on the final count. Even if a candidate exceeds the quota after the first count only a small proportion of the next preferences will be counted as part of a surplus.What is a spoiled vote?A small proportion of votes are spoiled in every election because the voter has not clearly indicated a preference. This sometimes happens because a number 1 is given to more than one candidate. Often votes are spoiled on purpose with slogans written on the ballot paper by disgruntled voters. Is the STV system or PR a uniquely Irish one?No. It was imposed on this country as part of the Home Rule Act in 1912 and later incorporated in the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921 with the objective of protecting the unionist minority and ensuring they had representation in an Irish parliament. The system was later included in de Valera’s 1937 constitution and two attempts to abolish it, in 1959 and 1966, were rejected by the electorate. The same system is used in Malta, the Australian senate and Northern Ireland Assembly.

Photograph: iStockWhen scientist Peter Soroye first saw the figures showing estimated bumblebee populations in North America had fallen by nearly 50 per cent in a single generation, he thought it must be a typo.He checked the numbers – the result of a long-term analysis of bumblebee populations published in the journal Science on Thursday – seven times to be sure they were accurate.Rising temperatures are contributing to drastic declines of bumblebees across Europe and North America at rates “consistent with a mass extinction”, threatening food cultivation, the study concluded.The researchers estimated that Europe’s bumblebee populations fell by 17 per cent between the two periods the study looked at – from 1901 to 1974 and from 2000 to 2014 – while in North America, the figure was 46 per cent.“We couldn’t believe that the declines were this severe over such a short time period,” said Mr Soroye, lead author of the study and a PhD student at University of Ottawa.“I reckon I must have gone through, like, seven times to double check that everything was right and it was. And so yes, these declines are really drastic. They’re really severe,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone.Declining bee populations have also been linked to heavy pesticide use and habitat loss caused by changes in land use. But Mr Soroye said global warming was exacerbating their plight.“This paper in no way absolved . . . pesticides or habitat loss. It’s that climate change is another thing that’s been added to the mix that’s driving this extinction,” he said.Bumblebees are larger than honeybees, and while they do not produce honey, they are important pollinators.“When they land on flowers, they physically shake these flowers and shake the pollen off,” said Mr Soroye.“A lot of crops like squash, berries, tomatoes need bumblebees to pollinate them, and honeybees or other pollinators just can’t do that.”Bees play a crucial role in producing healthy fruits or seeds for three quarters of the crops that feed people, according to the United Nations.Yet studies show pollinator populations have been declining across much of the world.If the trend continues, nutritious fruits, nuts and many vegetables would have to be substituted by staple crops like rice, corn, and potatoes, leading to an imbalanced diet, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization warned in 2019.The researchers used a database encompassing 550,000 records of 66 bumblebee species from 1901 to 1974 and from 2000 to 2014 and compared their distribution and ersity to local changes in temperature and precipitation.Much larger declines are “likely if climate change accelerates in the coming years”, the study’s co-author Tim Newbold from the University College London said in a statement.The 10-year period from 2010-2019 is likely to be the hottest decade on record, the Geneva-based World Meteorological Organization said recently.Warming southern regions such as Spain and Mexico saw the biggest losses, the researchers said.–Reuters"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"3,700 people on board undera two-week quarantine since arriving back at YokohamaDr Li Wenliang was threatened by police after they said he spread \u0026lsquofalse\u0026rsquo informationTen people on vessel test positive for infection as death toll in China increases to 563Chengdu Letter: Self-quarantine measures have some benefits as city hunkers downTwo ships anchored in Asia as death toll in China hits 490 and airline restrictions tightenDeath toll rises to 425 as Hong Kong reports first death linked to diseaseTotal number of confirmed cases in country increases to 20,438Overall death toll rises to above 300 while countries move to restrict travel from ChinaChina criticises US entry ban saying it contradicts WHO appeal as death toll risesUS declares public health emergency, while Germany confirms its seventh caseWuhan and its people have shown tremendous spirit in response to coronavirus crisisHeatwave conditions expected to sweep through Victoria and New South Wales statesDeath toll rises to 170 as US reports first case of human-to-human transmissionIrish citizens to travel to UK as Russia closes border with China in bid to contain virus\u0026lsquoWhole world needs to be on alert now,\u0026rsquo says WHO as death toll rises to 132 and 6,000 infectedSome 47 people were on White Island when volcano erupted on December 9thHigh-speed rail and cross-border ferry services to be stopped, with flights reducedArdern\u0026rsquos Labour Party-led coalition in power since 2017 will face conservative challengeEmbassy exploring options to evacuate six Irish nationals under lockdown in cityIrish embassy in Beijing monitoring situation but has no plans for an evacuation"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons february 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178.France demands UK aligns with EU rules forever in return for Brexit trade dealPolitics latest news: UK must become the new Norway and defend its fish stocks, says former ministerComment: Where is the money coming from for Sajid Javid\u0026#39s big Brexit budgetary bonanza?Passenger plan forced into emergency landing after coming under fire over SyriaPhillip Schofield reveals he is gay after \u0026#39heartbreaking conversations\u0026#39 with familyShamima Begum loses first stage of legal challenge against decision to revoke British citizenshipUS Election 2020 Democratic primary race: Who is winning the battle for delegates?The charts that show how US politics is polarised at record levelsHow popular is Donald Trump?

All over Britain, in bogs and back gardens, from Hadrian’s Wall to Rochester Castle, amateur archaeologists are unearthing our island’s ancient Roman past. For every damp squib of a KitKat wrapper there’s always the chance that the insistent beep-beep-beep of the metal detector will reveal the whereabouts of a lost Carausian hoard. Best of all, you get to hang on to the loot. According to the Treasure Act of 1996, it’s (mostly) finders keepers. Which would be Gollum-ish and miserlyif detectorists weren’t such a sharing bunch.Since 1997, more than 1.48million artefacts have been voluntarily declared to the Portable Antiquities Scheme database. A new book, 50 Roman Finds from the Portable Antiquities Scheme collects some of the best, from a bearded bronze bust of the Emperor Marcus Aurelius to the Crosby Garrett cavalry helmet found by an unnamed man – or woman – in Cumbria. I like that “unnamed.” No fuss, no glory, just a cool £2.3million from the Christie’s auction house sale.While some detectorists may dream of finding the next Ilam pan or Saxon stash, others are just as content with their “grots” – tiny, worn-down Roman pennies. Off they go on wet weekends wielding metal sweepers with heroic names – Excalibur, Equinox, Sea Hunter (for smugglers’ chests and briny booty) – in the Micawberish hope that something, almost certainly, will turn up. All hail the happy amateurs!Does any other country on earth produce as many have-a-go-hoard-seekers as we do? Or, for that matter, as many twitchers, train-spotters, rare-books-dealers and collectors of stamps, matchbox cars and crinkly Queen’s Park Rangers programs from the sixties? (My husband’s eBay habit must be stopped).Here, in the Treasure Act, is a rare, pleasing coincidence of eccentric national temperament and indulgent, oh-go-on-then legislation. In an age otherwise cursed by pettifogging, form-filling, license-levying and general computer-says-no-can’t-do-ism, it’s cheering to think that in the unlikely event that you do stub your toe on a life-size bronze Caesar somewhere beyond the compost heap… it’s yours.It\u0027s Radio 3 for meOn Sunday afternoons, as the light fades and the detectorist turns to his Thermos of tea, I turn on The Listening Service. And there is lovely Tom Service giving a very short introduction to Christmas songs, or backing vocals, or bagpipes, or the clacking castanets of Spain.After Tom, comes Words and Music with its mix-tape of Bowie and Baudelaire, Mozart and Larkin. It’s no surprise to me that Radio 3 is soaring like Vaughan Williams\u0027 Lark Ascending. In the last quarter, 2.13million listeners a week have tuned in to Radio 3, up 16 per cent.I can’t remember exactly what did it – political tooth-pulling on the Today program, the blouse-rending miserabilists of Woman’s Hour, a tea-time serial on the crisis of children in care? – but some time last year I rolled the dial from 4 to 3, where they were playing music inspired by children’s games: Debussy’s Toy Box, Tchaikovsky’s Nutcracker, Satie’s Jack-in-the-Box.

I mean, very basic. I’ve driven a fair few in my time – and this year will be sampling many more. This is a bit of what I’ve learned, imperfectly, thus far.\u0026nbspIt is not, for these purposes, a “hybrid”, like the Toyota\u0026nbspPrius\u0026nbspor any other vehicle that also has an internal combustion engine on board (with one of two very particular exceptions).\u0026nbspAn electric car is a pure thing – it runs completely and solely on its batteries. When they run out, you stop moving.\u0026nbspI like to think of it as a cross between a washing machine, a laptop and,\u0026nbsperm, a car. So, your car is driven entirely by electric power – powerful lithium-ion batteries (like in your laptop) sending electricity to an electric motor (like your washing machine) which drives the road wheels (like on your motor car).\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch. Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.210 Prince of Wales Drive, Battersea, London210 Prince of Wales Drive, Battersea, LondonThe electricity stored in the batteries mostly comes from being plugged into the mains (there are various charging options, most commonly a fast charger attached to the side of your home, if you have the space). Some will be regenerated from the car itself, saving power otherwise wasted when braking, for example.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp2 Don’t some electric cars run on hydrogen?Yes, but they are not much more than prototypes, with only a handful of filling stations currently. Critics say using a hydrogen fuel cell to generate the electricity for the batteries simply adds an additional stage of energy accumulation and the manufacture of the hydrogen could be problematic, if it requires a disproportionate amount of non-renewable electricity.\u0026nbsp3 How far will one go on a charge?Well, that depends, but you can count on a modern mainstream electric car these days to bae able to take you 200 to 250 miles (conservatively) on a single charge – a\u0026nbspKia\u0026nbspe-Niro, say, or Hyundai\u0026nbspKona\u0026nbspelectric. In the right hands, 300 miles might be possible. This, by the way is two or three times the usual range you’d experience a few years ago.\u0026nbspFeeling the spark: Drivers learning to love electric carsThe most advanced models, such as the famous Tesla range, will go on and on for near enough 400 miles. Some of the smaller more urban-oriented models, such as the new electric Smart cars will be good for about 100 miles.\u0026nbspThe rest is down to how you drive and when. Winter means the batteries tend to run down faster and you’ll likely get a shorter range.\u0026nbspIf you drive hard and fast you’ll use up more energy than otherwise, just like in a petrol or diesel car. Over along time the ability of the batteries to take and store a charge will deteriorate (just like your smartphone or laptop).Yes. To buy or lease you’re looking at a premium of some thousands of pounds. So, let’s take an example, the Hyundai\u0026nbspKona, a compact\u0026nbspSUV.\u0026nbsp With a conventional petrol engine you can pick one up at a list price of £17,505. For the hybrid version (petrol plus electric power generated on-board) you’ll need to fork out £22,495. For the\u0026nbspBEV\u0026nbspHyundai\u0026nbspKona\u0026nbspelectric, the price jumps to £35,100, or £32,600 when you take into account the government grant for electric cars of up to £3,500. \u0026nbspAgainst the usually higher purchase price or monthly PCP or lease fee you need to balance the savings you make compared t petrol or diesel: far cheaper fuel spending on your electricity tariff) lower running costs (fewer moving mechanical parts and consumables eg exhaust pipe, alternator, engine) and a range of lower taxes and congest and parking charges. Electric cars are exempt from road tax, carry lower benefit-in-kind tax liabilities for commercial users, usually form congestion charges and city bans, and can enjoy cheaper parking. There’s also a government subsidy of up to £500 for a home charger.\u0026nbspWhy have electric cars failed to spark with consumers? Has Tesla hastened the death of Britain’s electric car revolution?Grant Shapps’ plan for electric cars will make China a motoring giantWhether this makes financial sense really depends your pattern of car usage – the number of miles you do a year, and the type of journeys. With a lot of medium range commuting for example (say 60 miles a day) an electric car could pay for itself within a few years for sustained long-distance travelling then a diesel might make more sense.5 What are the advantages of an electric car?Apart from the financial ones it is of course far better for the environment. There are many debates about, say, the cost (in environmental terms) of mining rare minerals for the batteries, or transporting them vast distances to factories, or the energy used in making them. Also obviously an electric car that runs on electricity generated from soar power is better than one where the electricity happens to be generated by burning coal (ins or far as anyone can know this when they plug in).\u0026nbspHowever a reasonable assumption is that all electric cars are greener than any internal combustion engined equivalent, and that any public transport (rail or bus) is usually greener than any private alternative.Don’t forget that electric cars are very refined – being almost silent at any speed, and the acceleration form rest is startlingly fast, though they tend to run out of puff as they approach their top speeds. In other words they can be good to drive and to be driven in.6 What are the disadvantages?Surprisingly few, though it does depend on your circumstances. If you live in a flat or a terraced house, charging from home is obviously impossible or difficult, and the ease of use of an electric vehicle is much reduced. If you imagine that you’ll have to do journeys of more than 400 miles without warning, then an internal combustion engine is a surer way of getting wherever it is you might conceivably wish to go – though you’d need to take a break anyway.\u0026nbspIt’s fair to add that some of the public charging infrastructure leaves a bit to be desired – it could usefully be much bigger, more reliable and easier to use.And of course you do need to balance the financial sums against the clear practical and environmental plusses of being a green driver.\u0026nbsp7 Don’t they take ages to charge?Yes and no. The Tesla is an exception, in many ways, because it has a dedicated network of ultra-fast chargers, as well as being chargeable at home.\u0026nbspMost owners of electric cars have to rely on charging at home – but don’t\u0026nbsp have much trouble charging because they most likely have a home charging point, which does mean off-street parking for the moment. If you take a mainstream option like the Hyundai\u0026nbspKona\u0026nbspelectricity home, using a regular\u0026nbsp7kW\u0026nbspcharging point via its own cable a near-full zero to 80 per cent charge takes around 9 hours.A similar charge with a rapid charger (such as you’d fine at, say, motorway services)\u0026nbsptakes around an hour and a quarter. 75 minutes.\u0026nbspIn an emergency, you can also use a domestic three-pin charging lead, plugged into the mains at home like you’d plug in a kettle. However you’d looking at about 24 hours for a full charge – because the batteries are so big and the trickle form the domestic system so modest.\u0026nbsp8 Will they get easier to charge and go further in future?Yes. Much of the progress in the usefulness of the electric car is coming from improvements in battery “density” – the amount of useful power that can be stored in a an ever-more compact way.The battery pack is usually stored lower in the car, under the floor or the seats, and this can help with keeping the car stable (lower centre of gravity). Given that these units can grow very hot and need ventilation or water cooling for example, and have to be protected from water ingress (if fording a stream say, or just in a heavy downpour) , the progress in engineering in this field is truly impressive.\u0026nbspHowever, eventually the rate of improvement in range and efficiency will slow, and that might well mark an optimal moment to make a purchase or take on an electric car lease. But we cannot know when this will happen.9 What about hybrids?Well, what about hybrids? They are not electric cars. This is because they are, as the name implies, hybrids – a cross between an electric car and a traditional one powered by a petrol or diesel engine. Thus well-known hybrid models such as the Toyota\u0026nbspPrius\u0026nbsphave an internal combustion engine on board, as well as an electric motor and some batteries to boost performance and economy.\u0026nbspIn a hybrid the electric power is “self-generated”, which is to say that it comes from the engine regenerating and recycling power that might otherwise be wasted. So for example some of the power usually lost in heavy braking is instead sent back via the electric motor working “backwards” to the batteries, where it is stored for later use.\u0026nbspI drove 300 miles in an electric car and here’s what happenedMost hybrids pair an electric and a petrol engine because the two units tend to complement each other in use diesel-electric hybrids are rarer. “Mild” hybrids are just that – they have only a small ethic motor and minimal battery storage just to give a slight edge to reduce emissions and improve economy. The green advantage is quite marginal.\u0026nbspPlug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) have the additional option of charging from the mains, as with an electric car, but it is not necessary to do so.\u0026nbspThe drawback with the hybrid technology is the constant trade-offs that have to made between the energy saved through the battery-electric motor system, set against the additional weight of them, which of course tends to raise fuel consumption. Clever software can minimise these trade-offs to more acceptable levels, but they will always be there, as compared to a\u0026nbspBEV. Hybrids, indeed, in their complexity and weight, can represent the e worst of both worlds.\u0026nbsp10 Aren’t electric cars all a bit oddball?They have been, yes, but the next few months year will see the launch of some very well-known models with full-electric versions.\u0026nbsp These will include: the Vauxhall\u0026nbspCorsa-e Peugeot 208 electric Volvo\u0026nbspXC40\u0026nbspRecharge and the Mini electric. They join an already quiet impressive variety of electric cars on sale or soon to go on sale.From the tiny\u0026nbspSkoda\u0026nbspCiti GOe-iV\u0026nbspand Smart EQ through the Renault Zoe to the Nissan leaf to MG ZS and the Jaguar\u0026nbspiPace\u0026nbspthere are already options to match your tastes and budget. And there is also a small market in used models such as the Renault\u0026nbspFluence, Mitsubishi\u0026nbspIMEV, Vauxhall\u0026nbspAmpera\u0026nbspor first generation Nissan Leaf that might also suit.These cars will tend to have shorter ranges, though, while older Renaults may still have their batteries on monthly lease from the company. As always – do your own research, but you can approach an electric car with more positivity than ever before.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That’s almost one a week. Let that sink in for a moment.It wasn’t done intentionally – but, perhaps even worse, completely obliviously. Every other weekend, off I trotted, to Moscow, Doha, Rome and the rest, usually for no more than a weekend at a time. I could say that I excused my high flying lifestyle – pun very much intended – by arguing that it was all for work. With the best will in the world, being a travel journalist was always going to involve a certain amount of travel.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut, sadly, that would be giving me way too much credit. The truth is, I didn’t excuse it at all. It never even crossed my mind that I needed to.\u0026nbspUntil, of course, a previously unimaginable and unprecedented shift in the public perception of flying started to emerge. The first time I really realised that a sea change was coming was Emma Thompson’s much-publicised fall from grace, when she flew 5,400 miles from LA to London in the spring to participate in the Extinction Rebellion demonstrations that were bringing the capital to a standstill. The actor and activist was pilloried by the Right and Left in equal measure (the former labelling her a hypocrite, the latter asserting they didn’t need her carbon-tainted help, thank you very much).Created with Sketch.Climate change: Decade\u0027s defining issue in pictures Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.In this decade, humans have become ever more aware of climate change.

What was the big deal? She was using her platform to add clout to a much-needed protest demanding action on the coming climate crisis. Surely that was a good thing?It wasn’t long afterwards that I heard of the flygskam (flight shame) and tågskryt (train brag) movements for the first time. Originating in Sweden and publicised by high-profile figures including Olympic athlete Bjorn Ferry and opera singer Malena Ernman, mother of teenage activist Greta Thunberg, the idea was to make the notion of flying something a little unsavoury – something you might not want to admit to doing in polite company. On the flip side, the “train brag” movement is all about celebrating rail travel, with participants posting pictures and videos of their beauty-filled overland journeys on social media.Meet the people who’ve given up flyingThe concept has even made its way over the North Sea, as I discovered when I came across the Flight Free UK movement. Founder Anna Hughes’ original aim was to get 100,000 people to sign up and pledge to stay grounded for a whole year.\u0026nbsp“I haven’t flown for about 10 years,” she said, “but given the situation we’re now in, I felt like it wasn’t enough to reduce my own carbon footprint – I needed to open it up and do more. And it took over my life!”I didn’t really expect to be joining the swelling ranks of do-gooders, to be perfectly honest. As journalists, we can easily become accomplished fantasists, convincing ourselves that we are somehow set apart from reality – here to observe and report, rather than participate.But something changed in me after I spoke to Anna, along with a number of other committed non-flyers. They were, to a fault, impassioned and persuasive yet polite and non-judgemental. They were happy to take on huge personal expense and inconvenience, all in the hopes that it might help save the only habitable planet we’ve got. A seed was planted in my brain which grew – slowly but unstoppably – day by day, and has already led to me significantly cutting down on the number\u0026nbspof flights I took in the latter half of 2019.Now, it’s time to take the next step: a year of keeping both feet on the ground. Far from being some po-faced exercise in restraint, more than anything I hope this experience will prove that travel, in all its adventurous, erse and mind-opening glory, is not only possible with clipped wings, but can even be enhanced by taking it slow.I produced somewhere in the region of 6,000kg of CO2 from flying in 2019. Here’s to it being 0kg in 2020.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

While the details are sparse in terms of sources and specific tactics, there are some startling revelations, including how Gwyneth Paltrow became a helping hand and the extreme lengths Weinstein’s team went to in order to thwart both reporters and silence the alleged victims. (OP)Future Sex is perhaps one of the few nonfiction books about sex and relationships that came before #MeToo and somehow remains relevant today. Finding herself suddenly single at the age of 30, Witt immerses herself in the sexual subcultures of San Francisco, trying her hand at everything from polyamory to orgasmic meditation. It’s a fascinating piece of work, one that illustrates Witt’s talents as an essayist and gives plenty of room to many astute observations on sexual liberation. (OP)Every now and then a book comes along that tilts your perspective on the world. This internationally best-selling phenomenon is one of them. Covering just about the entire sweep of human history, it makes you understand the fits, starts and savagery of progress. (CR)The Girls is about exploring the appeal of being in a cult. Inspired by Charles Manson’s murderous “family”, the book serves up a more tense, richer depiction than Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, one that puts women at the centre, examining what motivates and captivates them. (OP)840 Marlon James: A Brief History of Seven Killings (2014)The Booker-winning A Brief History of Seven Killings, by Jamaican-born Marlon James, follows the lives and deaths of seven of the would-be killers in the failed 1976 assassination attempt on Bob Marley. The novel cleverly weaves fiction and fact – and the language has a musical rhythm. Some of the epiphanies in the book are linked to songs. (MC)Terminal illness and bankruptcy shouldn’t make for an inspiring read but they somehow do in Raynor Winn’s poetic, provocative memoir. After losing the family home, Win and her husband set out to walk the South West Coast path, shaking a fist at his grim diagnosis. It’s as much a meditation on the power of nature as 1040 Nina Stibbe – Love, Nina: Despatches from Family Life (2013)There’s deadpan and then there’s Nina Stibbe, who proves herself the heir to Adrian Mole in this novel written in the form of letters to her sister from a child-minding job in London. A provincial girl grappling with the strange salads of the metropolitan literary elite, Stibbe is comic gold. (CR) The assassins Eli and Charlie Sisters were played by John C Reilly and Joaquin Phoenix in the film version of Canadian-born writer Patrick deWitt’s second novel. The narrator Eli captures the lawless, unpredictable nature of frontier life in the mid-19th century. The Sisters Brothers is a compelling, unsettling tale of the Gold Rush era. (MC)Every office has its misfit, and this is the funny, deeply touching story of a woman whose aversion to social niceties and the work Christmas lunch hides a traumatic past. Common acts of kindness rekindle the protagonist in this beautifully told debut.

(OP)1540 Anne Tyler – A Spool of Blue Thread (2015)Anne Tyler is a master of stories about family life in middle-class America. A Spool of Blue Thread, the 20th novel from the author of The Accidental Tourist, adroitly shines a light on sibling rivalry, family secrets and the wounding power of grief. Her tale of four generations of the Whitshanks demonstrates again her gift for comic detail. (MC)The Green Road, by Dublin-born Anne Enright, is set in County Clare, a wild place geographically and emotionally. Enright’s keen gift for observation is at play in this family saga based around Hanna, Dan, Constance and Emmet’s Christmas return to the home that their scary matriarch, Rosaleen, is selling. A funny, painful tale of selfishness and compassion. (MC)1740 Amor Towles – A Gentleman in Moscow (2016)The gentleman in question is Count Rostov, a bon vivant and aristocrat placed under house arrest in a fancy Moscow hotel after the communists seize control. His wit and enduring humanity make this charming, quirky novel sing. (CR)When fact meets fiction, the result is almost always fascinating as the reader spends hours trying to discern which is which. Such is the appeal of The Idiot, Elif Batuman’s debut novel, which tells the semi-autobiographical tale of a young woman studying at Harvard in the mid-Nineties. After pontificating on the purpose of email, she soon becomes obsessed with an enigmatic Hungarian student whose insouciance will leave you spinning in a state of total frustration. (OP)Nobel Prize winner Orhan Pamuk’s 10th novel was the short, stunning The Red-Haired Woman, which is at once a fable and a gripping tale of youthful obsession, exploring protagonist Cem Celik’s desire for the red-haired, enigmatic member of a theatre troupe.

(MC)A dazzling insight into the mind of one of The New Yorker’s most prolific writers, Ariel Levy’s memoir will seem relatable to all those who have at one time or another felt a startling sense of dissociation from their life, which is probably most of us. Levy’s personal tragedies will leave readers reeling. There is one passage in particular that will stay with you for months in which Levy describes how she suffered a miscarriage on a hotel room floor while on an assignment in Mongolia. She was 19 weeks pregnant at the time and her son, born alive, died in her arms. It is a story of resilience to the highest degree. (OP)Lila was the third novel in Marilynne Robinson’s Gilead Chronicles – following Gilead (2004) and Home (2008) – and tells, in unflinching terms, the story of Lila, the young woman who married the elderly Reverend Ames in a dusty Iowa town. Robinson writes beautifully and, as a sophisticated religious thinker, asks searching questions about faith and doubt. (MC)There are few writers as gloriously strange, acerbic, funny and faintly ruthless as Sedaris, who once again mines his family history in this collection of autobiographical short stories. It includes a tale in which he feeds his Both a love story and a look at how racial ides play out in the UK and the USA, Americanah is as enchanting as it is thought-provoking.

He is forced to face up to “the accumulation, the multiplication, of loss”. (MC)No matter how many documentaries you watch or books you read on Mormonism, it’s almost impossible to understand such a community from the outside. Tara Westover opened people’s eyes with Educated, explaining how she went from growing up in a Mormon fundamentalist family in Idaho to studying for a PhD at the University of Cambridge. It’s an inspiring story of grit and determination that doubles up as an homage to the power of self-education and, well, reading.

It subjects romantic love, pregnancy, motherhood and all the attendant tedious cultural baggage to an intensely intelligent, glittering critique. (CR)In Canada, retired English teacher Dell Parsons, the son of hapless bank robbers, looks back on the heart-breaking events of his teenage years and tries to “take account” of how his life was shaped.

(CR)Walter and Patty Berglund, the seemingly perfect couple who meet at college in the 1970s, are at the heart of Jonathan Franzen’s fourth novel. The story of their unravelling marriage is explored in a rich, nuanced novel. Freedom is more than just a tale of wedded unbliss: it is about the messiness of love and longing in the modern world. (MC)A sprawling, multi-generational tale of a Turkish family who make a new life in London, this novel has a so-called ‘honour killing’ as its centre of gravity. Shafak, a best-selling author in Turkey and many other countries, conjures up the hypocrisy that holds women to different standards, with devastating results. (CR) 3140 Helen Macdonald – H Is for Hawk (2016)When Helen Macdonald lost her father, she acquired a hawk. This idiosyncratic approach to grief makes for a lyrical, moving probe into both the process of mourning and our relationship with the natural world. (CR)Not just a novel but a fully fledged cultural phenomenon, the sequel to the Handmaid’s Tale was met with midnight readings and fans decked out in the creepy red and white gowns from the TV adaptation of the original.

(MC)3440 Matt Haig – Reasons to Stay Alive (2015)There’s a reason why Matt Haig’s writing on mental health has earned him such high praise, with the Duchess of Sussex among his fans. And it all started with this bestselling memoir in which the children’s fiction author describes falling into a deep depression in his early twenties that left him contemplating taking his own life. It’s not an easy read, but in a society where suicide remains grossly misunderstood and gender stereotypes hinder men from speaking openly about their mental wellbeing, it’s a crucial one. (OP) 3540 Arundhati Roy – The Ministry of Utmost Happiness (2017)Twenty years after her stunning debut The God of Small Things, Arundhati Roy followed up with the mesmerising The Ministry of Utmost Happiness. With biting ironic wit, Roy’s epic dissects life in India in the wake of the partition conflict. The characters, including the transgender woman Anjum, are intimately drawn.

While Rooney has gone on to publish a second novel, Normal People, which was shortlisted for this year’s Man Booker Prize, Conversations with Friends remains her best work. With its snappy short sentences, sophisticated plot and characters so complex that it’s hard to like any of them, the novel established Rooney as one of the most exciting new writers around. (OP)3740 George Saunders – Lincoln in the Bardo (2017)Lincoln in the Bardo tells the story of a single night in the life of Abraham Lincoln – when his 11-year-old son was buried – through an experimental tale involving 166 narrators in the bardo, the transitional state between one’s death and rebirth, according to Tibetan Buddhism. George Saunders’ enchanting tour-de-force won the 2017 Man Booker Prize. (MC)In 2019, female desire warrants shrewd examination more than ever. Thank goodness, then, for Lisa Taddeo, who spent eight years documenting the sexual experiences of three very relatable but very different women. The result is a powerful collection of interspersed narratives that probe the most intimate corners of the female psyche. I can think of nothing like it. (OP)An outrageous satire of contemporary race relations, Beatty’s The Sellout tells the story of a black man called Bonbon who is seeking to reinstitute slavery and segregation. When it won the Booker, the chair of the judges compared Beatty to Swift and Twain. (CR)4040 . Hilary Mantel –  Bring Up the Bodies (2012)The sequel to Mantel’s Booker-winning Tudor tour de force, Wolf Hall, Bring up the Bodies did not Let Down the Readers. Her immersive prose takes us back into the poetic, rigorous mind of the archetypal career politician, Thomas Cromwell. The subject is the stuff of school days – Henry Tudor’s marriage to Anne Boleyn, and her fatal failure to produce a male heir. To allow another marriage and safeguard the stability of the country, Cromwell engineers Boleyn’s downfall, constructing capital charges against the queen along with a few of his old enemies to boot.

Expectations about the economy were reflected in real household spending per person, which grew at its slowest annualised rate since the end of 2016. On average, people spent less on cars in over the period than they did in 2016, with spending on recreation and culture, and utilities growing more slowly over the same time.“This is the first time that ratings of life satisfaction significantly fell,” ONS researchers said. “It is the first significant change since early 2015 in what was a stable picture of life satisfaction in the UK.“After this period, average life satisfaction ratings reached a plateau, with fluctuations quarter on quarter but no significant changes up to their deterioration in the latest quarter.”Prioritise citizens’ wellbeing over GDP in budgets, Iceland PM urgesMeanwhile figures from the organisation for Economic Cooperation and development showed that the UK was the only member of the Group of 7 (G7) rich nations to suffer a fall in people’s average income.The OECD, known as the rich countries’ think tank, said real household income per capita contracted significantly in the third quarter of 2019, by minus 0.7 per cent, unwinding much of the 0.9 per cent growth recorded in the previous three months.Households income per person grew by 1.5 per cent during the two years to September 2019, just half the average of 3.0 per cent for the G7 as whole.A barometer of consumer confidence among British consumers also fell in October. However, the January reading by GfK’s long-running Consumer Confidence Index increased two points to minus nine for January adding to evidence to an upturn in spirits decision the General Election.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Now is the crucial moment when so many young people are thinking about their options for September.\u0026nbsp“I recognise it can be challenging, particularly when schools have their own post-16 offer. But we all have a responsibility to support young people to make choices based on their skills, interests and aspirations.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Seven more courses will be on offer from 2021 and the remaining 15 will be launched in 2022 and 2023.Lord Agnew said: “T-levels are launching in September this year, offering high-quality technical alternatives to A-levels. It is more important than ever that headteachers give their pupils the chance to talk with providers so they are able to work out whether a technical education might be right for them.“We have a responsibility to make sure that young people are able to make informed choices based on their aptitudes and ambitions. This will give them the chance to realise their full potential.”David Hughes, chief executive of the Association of Colleges (AoC), said: “At its heart it is simply unfair of schools not to positively promote and explain the full range of options.\u0026nbsp“I hope, therefore, that this nudge from Lord Agnew makes a marked difference, but would encourage the government to think about further measures to make sure that it does.”\u0026nbspDepartment for Education\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

From there, you\u0027ll see the normal list of everyone you follow, but also the new update.There is an option for looking at the Instagram accounts that appear most in your feed. Those are also likely to be the ones you interact with most, given that Instagram prizes things like likes when deciding what to show, but could also be annoying accounts that post too much.The other option shows users who they interact with least. That can include dozens of people that might be worth unfollowing if their feed or stories are becoming overwhelming.The new feature was found in testing late last year, but has finally rolled out to everyone with a new update and announcement from Instagram.It comes after the app also added the option to see the people you follow sorted by how recently you started doing so. That is similarly intended to allow people to better understand their feed, and get rid of anyone they followed a long time ago but no longer wish to see posts from.Selena Gomez says Instagram is ‘destroying’ some of her generationAll of the features are intended to allow people to have more control of their news feed and hopefully better curate what they want to see.“Instagram is really about bringing you closer to the people and things you care about — but we know that over time, your interests and relationships can evolve and change,” a spokesperson said.“Whether you graduate, move to a new city, or become obsessed with a new interest and find a community, we want to make it easier to manage the accounts you follow on Instagram so that they best represent your current connections and interests.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Daniel Kaluuya and Jodie Turner-Smith are the unlikely couple thrust together on a go-nowhere blind date, only for tragedy to transform them into folk heroes roaming across the USA searching for shelter. It’s a spellbinding debut. (Adam White) Guaranteed to be one of the major players in next year’s Oscars, Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite works better the less you know about it. What you should know is that it is a devilishly inventive deconstruction of class, brimming with energy, dark humour and nervous tension. (Adam White) Rising from the ashes of the aborted Universal Monsters multiverse, which was due to star Johnny Depp and Tom Cruise, this rebooted Invisible Man uses the iconic branding to tell the smaller and far more intriguing story of a woman on the run from her invisible ex. Elisabeth Moss is the domestic violence survivor convinced that her supposedly dead boyfriend has merely mastered the art of invisibility. Leigh Whannell, who directed 2018’s wonderfully inventive sci-fi thriller Upgrade, is behind the camera. (Adam White) A Quiet Place would surely have been better off as a standalone film, but the financial success of writer-director John Krasinski’s B-movie-style horror tale put paid to that. This isn’t to say there’s no more story to tell. In fact, Krasinski made no secret of the fact he had a whole universe he could one day explore, and sure enough, joining returning stars Emily Blunt, Millicent Thomas and Noah Jupe (so brilliant in Honey Boy) are new additions in the form of Cillian Murphy and Djimon Honsou. (Jacob Stolworthy) 519 No Time to DieWhile Daniel Craig’s Bond tenure has been marked by severe whiplash in terms of quality, there remains something incredibly exciting about the arrival of a new 007 movie. No Time to Die, Craig’s final outing as the super-spy, also boasts an intoxicating array of talent on and off screen, from Cary Fukunaga on directorial duties, to a script co-written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge and cast newcomers including Ana de Armas, Rami Malek and Lashana Lynch. (Adam White) Little is known about the plot for Antebellum, the feature film debut of artists and music video directors Gerard Bush and Christopher Renz. But the thriller\u0027s trailer is a visual feast, with Janelle Monáe appearing to be caught between the present day and the horrors of a 19th century plantation. From producer Jordan Peele, director of Get Out and Us, it also features Jena Malone, Gabourey Sidibe and Kiersey Clemons. (Adam White)719 The Woman in the WindowAn adaptation of the pulpy bestseller (which itself was engulfed in mystery when a New Yorker feature claimed its author, AJ Finn, had extensively lied about his personal life and history), The Woman in the Window puts Amy Adams centre stage for the first time since 2018’s Sharp Objects. She’s an agoraphobic psychologist convinced she has witnessed a murder across the street from her apartment. Julianne Moore, Gary Oldman and Brian Tyree Henry co-star. (Adam White) Watchmen star Yahya Abdul-Mateen III continues his incredible ascent with the starring role in this remake. Produced by the ubiquitous Jordan Peele, the new Candyman revives the hook-handed killer originated in 1992’s genuinely terrifying Bernard Rose film, but with a black and female director and predominantly black cast – which ought to mean the frustratingly ambiguous racial themes of the original can finally be given their due. (Adam White) The sequel to 2017’s mega successful Wonder Woman is a rare thing: a DC film worthy of excitement. The first outing saw Patty Jenkins become the highest-grossing woman director in cinema history, and she’s looking to beat her own record with a follow-up centred on the Amazon princess’s battle against a villain named Cheetah (Kristen Wiig in her superhero film debut). That Jenkins describes it as “a grand tentpole like they use to make in the 1980s” is reason alone to mark its release on your 2020 calendar. (Jacob Stolworthy) Soul is a curious new Pixar film that appears to emulate the philosophical wonder of Inside Out with the lived-in cultural exploration of Coco. Jamie Foxx is a struggling musician who finally gets his big break, only to experience a freak accident that propels him into a mysterious netherworld in which souls are imbued with talents and passions, before being implanted in newborn babies. It looks gorgeous, is potentially insane, and is co-written by Tina Fey. (Adam White) Hours after the first reviews of both Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker and Cats took over social media, Warner Bros dropped the trailer for Tenet, Christopher Nolan’s top secret espionage thriller. It’s fair to say plenty of sunshine was stolen – and for good reason. Tenet marks Nolan’s return to the mind-melting thrills of Inception and, while the plot remains unknown, it seems to focus on a team of heroes who must rewind time to prevent the outbreak of war. Sign us up. (Jacob Stolworthy) Tom Cruise is taking a (short) break from carrying out impossible missions in 2020. Instead, he’ll return to the cockpit for a sequel to the daddy of all Eighties films, Top Gun. There’ll surely be an element of “teach new dogs old tricks” in the Joseph Kosinski-directed film as Pete “Maverick” Mitchell mentors a new generation of US Navy fighter pilots. We’re hopeful the result will – wait for it – take our breath away. (Jacob Stolworthy) 1319 Barb and Star Go to Vista Del MarIt’s not the Bridesmaids sequel everyone begged for nearly a decade ago, but Barb and Star is its spiritual follow-up at least. Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumulo, the women behind the 2011 smash, write and star in this new comedy, playing two best friends who venture out of their small Midwestern community for the very first time. They soon get mixed up in a villainous plot to kill an entire town, while Jamie Dornan and Damon Wayans Jr also star. (Adam White) 1419 The Many Saints of NewarkWhether you like it or not, a film prequel based on The Sopranos is being released in 2020. The presence of David Chase, the HBO show’s creator, goes a long way to abate any concerns fans might have, and it’ll at least be a fine chance to explore the mobsters’s family history. The film is expected to focus on Dickie Moltisanti, the father of Christopher, whose memory loomed large over the series. (Jacob Stolworthy) 1519 Last Night in SohoEdgar Wright is adding “psychological horror” to his filmmaking repertoire with Last Night in Soho, a neon-soaked thrill ride starring quite the ensemble (Anya Taylor-Joy, Matt Smith, Diana Rigg). The intriguing plot focuses on a young girl for whom “time falls apart” after she’s somehow transported to the 1960s. It sounds like a cult hit in waiting. (Jacob Stolworthy) The feel-good West End smash is transformed into a feel-good movie, with Richard E Grant, Sarah Lancashire and Sharon Horgan leading the story of a teenage boy who overcomes insecurity by embracing drag. Newcomer Max Harwood portrays the title character. (Adam White) Regardless of whether you’re a keen follower of the Marvel Cinematic Universe or not, The Eternals should pique your interest. Sure, it may be spearheading a brand new phase of Marvel franchises – there really is no end to the studios’ box office stronghold – but it features what has to be one of the most eclectic casts ever seen in a superhero film: Angelina Jolie, Kit Harington, Kumail Nanjiani, Brian Tyree Henry and Salma Hayek. Colour us intrigued. (Jacob Stolworthy) Alberto E. RodriguezGetty Images for DisneyA remake of David Lynch’s Dune would ordinarily cause our eyeballs to rattle around our sockets, but not when Denis Villeneuve’s in the director’s chair. So committed to his vision is Warner Bros that they ignored the fact his breathtaking Blade Runner sequel flopped and handed him the keys to a fresh adaptation of Herbert Ross’ novel. He did direct Prisoners, Enemy and Arrival, after all. Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya head up the cast. (Jacob Stolworthy) Long in the works, Steven Spielberg’s West Side Story looks set to be a festive smash this time next year. Speculated to be closer in spirit to the original Stephen Sondheim musical than the iconic 1961 film, this new version casts Ansel Elgort as Tony and newcomer Rachel Zegler as Maria – the latter, incredibly, beat out more than 30,000 candidates for the role, after submitting an audition video via Twitter.

We’re hopeful the result will – wait for it – take our breath away. (Jacob Stolworthy) 1319 Barb and Star Go to Vista Del MarIt’s not the Bridesmaids sequel everyone begged for nearly a decade ago, but Barb and Star is its spiritual follow-up at least. Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumulo, the women behind the 2011 smash, write and star in this new comedy, playing two best friends who venture out of their small Midwestern community for the very first time. They soon get mixed up in a villainous plot to kill an entire town, while Jamie Dornan and Damon Wayans Jr also star. (Adam White) 1419 The Many Saints of NewarkWhether you like it or not, a film prequel based on The Sopranos is being released in 2020. The presence of David Chase, the HBO show’s creator, goes a long way to abate any concerns fans might have, and it’ll at least be a fine chance to explore the mobsters’s family history. The film is expected to focus on Dickie Moltisanti, the father of Christopher, whose memory loomed large over the series. (Jacob Stolworthy) 1519 Last Night in SohoEdgar Wright is adding “psychological horror” to his filmmaking repertoire with Last Night in Soho, a neon-soaked thrill ride starring quite the ensemble (Anya Taylor-Joy, Matt Smith, Diana Rigg). The intriguing plot focuses on a young girl for whom “time falls apart” after she’s somehow transported to the 1960s. It sounds like a cult hit in waiting. (Jacob Stolworthy) The feel-good West End smash is transformed into a feel-good movie, with Richard E Grant, Sarah Lancashire and Sharon Horgan leading the story of a teenage boy who overcomes insecurity by embracing drag. Newcomer Max Harwood portrays the title character. (Adam White) Regardless of whether you’re a keen follower of the Marvel Cinematic Universe or not, The Eternals should pique your interest. Sure, it may be spearheading a brand new phase of Marvel franchises – there really is no end to the studios’ box office stronghold – but it features what has to be one of the most eclectic casts ever seen in a superhero film: Angelina Jolie, Kit Harington, Kumail Nanjiani, Brian Tyree Henry and Salma Hayek. Colour us intrigued. (Jacob Stolworthy) Alberto E. RodriguezGetty Images for DisneyA remake of David Lynch’s Dune would ordinarily cause our eyeballs to rattle around our sockets, but not when Denis Villeneuve’s in the director’s chair. So committed to his vision is Warner Bros that they ignored the fact his breathtaking Blade Runner sequel flopped and handed him the keys to a fresh adaptation of Herbert Ross’ novel. He did direct Prisoners, Enemy and Arrival, after all. Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya head up the cast. (Jacob Stolworthy) Long in the works, Steven Spielberg’s West Side Story looks set to be a festive smash this time next year. Speculated to be closer in spirit to the original Stephen Sondheim musical than the iconic 1961 film, this new version casts Ansel Elgort as Tony and newcomer Rachel Zegler as Maria – the latter, incredibly, beat out more than 30,000 candidates for the role, after submitting an audition video via Twitter. (Adam White)Cats, which stars Taylor Swift, Idris Elba, Judi Dench and Ian McKellen, had an\u0026nbspextremely poor critical reception, dominating headlines for its strange use of CGI.It was\u0026nbspawarded two stars\u0026nbspby\u0026nbspThe Independent’s critic Clarisse Loughrey, who wrote that the film is “one of those rare cinematic events that feels like a collective hallucination”.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

While its win was a coup for DreamWorks – the film was the studio\u0027s third victor in a row– it was far from a deserving recipient, especially considering Ron Howard won Best Director over Robert Altman and David Lynch for Gosford Park and Mulholland Drive, respectively.219 Chariots of Fire (1981)While Chariots of Fire is precisely the type of film the Academy usually takes under its wing, the fact it won was a big surprise, considering everybody present had expected Reds to win the top prize. The Warren Beatty film would have been a far worthier winner, too.Cold Mountain lucked out by being nominated in what was a particularly weak year for Best Supporting Actress. Renée Zellweger recovered from failing to win for Chicago the previous year and, in doing so, earnt the unremarkable drama its Oscar-winning tag.Viewers of the Oscars have grown used to unexpected victories, but none was more ill-judged than when Paul Haggis\u0027 drama Crash beat Brokeback Mountain to Best Picture.519 Dances with Wolves (1990)It\u0027s quite soul-destroying to think that Dances with Wolves scooped a total of seven Oscars in the same year that Goodfellas was nominated.Alicia Vikander\u0027s performance in The Danish Girl is by no means weak, but it was nothing on Rooney Mara\u0027s affecting turn in Todd Haynes\u0027 film Carol. Had Tom Hooper not won five years before for The King\u0027s Speech, it seems unlikely that the drama would have picked up any nominations.Put simply, The English Patient isn\u0027t a very good film. Of the nine (nine!) Oscars it won, Juliette Binoche\u0027s trophy for Best Supporting Actress was perhaps the most surprising. The French star herself could barely contain her shock. This will most likely be this list\u0027s most controversial placement, but let\u0027s be honest: Gladiator is not the fantastic film it\u0027s regularly hailed as. Ridley Scott\u0027s overlong historical drama boasts plenty of swords-and-sandal bravado, but not much else.The musical Going My Way may have been the biggest cinematic hit of its year, but it certainly wasn\u0027t better that classic noir Double Indemnity, which it beat to win Best Picture. In fact, it\u0027s nowhere near director Leo McCarey\u0027s greatest film (he won six years previous for the Awful Truth and would be nominated again for The Bells of St Mary\u0027s two years later).There\u0027s a reason why Grand Hotel is the only film to ever win Best Picture without receiving a nomination in any other category. An entertaining film, sure, but nothing more.1119 The Greatest Show on Earth (1952)It\u0027s ironic that a film with the word greatest in its title has gone down as one of the worst winners in Oscars history. A prime example of when the Academy voted for spectacle over quality.To those who don\u0027t care about awards ceremonies, Green Book is a crowdpleaser that boasts decent performances from Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali. To everyone else, it\u0027s the damp squib that somehow came out of nowhere to snatch Best Picture from under Roma\u0027s nose. The Imitation Game won Best Adapted Screenplay, which begs the question: what the hell was this distinctly average film doing having any nominations at all?Meryl Streep has won enough Oscars for the world to know she\u0027s evidently one of the finest actors who\u0027ll ever live. Her win for The Iron Lady, though, was one Oscar too many.The year of 1999 marked one of the most remarkable Oscar ceremonies in history for the sole reason that the majority of its winners were terrible choices. Right up there was Roberto Benigni, who beat Tom Hanks (Saving Private Ryan) and Edward Norton (American History X) to win Best Actor for, of all things, Life is Beautiful.It might finally be accepted that disgraced film director Roman Polanski shouldn\u0027t be handed accolades, but back in 2003, this was still what the Oscars were doing. He won Best Director for The Pianist, an award the French-Polish filmmaker could have done without.1719 A Place in the SunA Place in the Sun is a fine little film, but fine little films shouldn\u0027t be winning Oscars –\u0026nbspespecially when they see off competition from more deserving opposition. In this case, director George Stevens beat John Huston (The African Queen), William Wyler (Detective Story) and Elia Kazan (A Streetcar Named Desire) to the Director prize.1819 Shakespeare in LoveYou have to hand it to Shakespeare in Love, it played the Oscars campaign trail perfectly, overtaking war favourites Saving Private Ryan and The Thin Red Line to win the evening\u0027s biggest prize. This doesn\u0027t mean its success has gone down as anything more than evidence of poor judgement from the Academy.It\u0027s often good to hold your hands up and admit that a film is nowhere near as good as you recall. Sadly, Slumdog Millionaire is one of those. While its win no doubt put smiles on the faces of commuters reading the morning papers the next day, the shine has worn off its success in recent years. The rightful winner –\u0026nbspThe Dark Knight – wasn\u0027t even nominated for Best Picture.A Beautiful Mind is one of the mustier Best Pictures winners of the century so far.

The moon will appear full for around three days, ning from Saturday to Monday.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe time of year means this full moon has traditionally been known as the Full Snow Moon or the Full Hunger Moon, as it often coincided with heavy snowfall and difficult hunting conditions.The arrival of\u0026nbspStorm Ciara\u0026nbspmay affect viewing conditions for people in the UK, with the Met Office forecasting cloud and rain across most of the country on Sunday morning.Created with Sketch.Super worm moon - last supermoon of 2019 in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Worm moon rises over the Karancs Hills in HungaryWorm moon over the Empire State Building in New YorkWorm moon rises over the Galicia Massif mountains in SpainWorm moon rises over the Santiago de Compostela cathedral in Galicia, SpainWorm moon rises over silhouettes of the Beatles in LiverpoolWorm moon over the Guggenheim Museum in Bibao, SpainWorm moon rises over the Karancs Hills in HungaryWorm moon over the Empire State Building in New YorkWorm moon rises over the Galicia Massif mountains in SpainWorm moon rises over the Santiago de Compostela cathedral in Galicia, SpainWorm moon rises over silhouettes of the Beatles in LiverpoolWorm moon over the Guggenheim Museum in Bibao, SpainFortunately, it will not be long to wait until the next supermoon.

I Am MotherRickety-looking science fiction thriller I Am Mother delivers where it counts with a twisting, turning plot and several genuine surprises. In the far future, a maternal robot (voiced by Rose Byrne) raises a young woman (Clara Rugaard) as her daughter. But when an outsider (Hilary Swank) makes her way to their bunker their perfect life is shattered forever.In Private Life, a bohemian middle-aged couple struggle to have a child. Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti are hilarious and poignant. And the pathos is piled on as twenty-something college drop-out Sadie (Kayli Carter) parachutes into their life. High-jinks follow, though director Tamara Jenkins ensures the existential sadness that has become part of the protagonists daily life never quite fades. Steven Soderbergh has become something of a Netflix regular, with his Meryl Streep-starring The Laundromat recently premiering on the service. His earlier movie High Flying Bird is about a basketball agent (André Holland) in a game of skulduggery between players (mostly black and uneducated) and team owners (white and wealthy). It’s a great sports film and also a commentary on the racial and social schisms that ide America. 425 22. I Don\u0027t Feel at Home in this World AnymoreA quirky though ultimately quite dark indie movie about two misfits, Ruth (Melanie Lynskey) and Tony (Elijah Wood), on the trail off a burglar who made off with a silver spoon belonging to Ruth’s grandmother. Whimsical on the surface, I Don’t Feel at Home in this World Anymore is in fact a meditation on what happens when you’ve had enough of life’s fundamental unfairness and lash out. Team-up heist movie Triple Frontier stars Ben Affleck, Oscar Isaac, Charlie Hunnum and Pedro Pascal as old marine corps buddies headed to South America for one final pay-day. It’s hugely flawed – but Affleck is convincing as a guy losing his way amidst orce and middle age. And JC Chandor (Collateral) directs the action scenes with pizzaz. It comes close to being a great action flick for grown-ups before ultimately fizzling out. 625 20. A Futile and Stupid GestureStraight-to-video production values don’t do it any favours, but A Futile and Stupid Gesture – a biopic about the founder of American satirical magazine National Lampoon, Douglas Kenney (Will Forte) – has its heart in the right place. It’s a by turns poignant and hilarious accent of Forte’s rise, his descent into drugs and infidelity – and his strained relationship with Lampoon co-founder Henry Beard (an unrecognisable Domhnall Gleeson). Critics trounced this stylised horror starring Jake Gyllenhaal are a vainglorious art critic. Certainly, as commentary on the vacuousness of the art world it’s a whole lot of stating the obvious. Yet enjoyed as a Argento-esque OTT romp, Velvet Buzzsaw is a delight, as director Dan Gilroy subjects his victims to a series of ever more absurdist and grisly ends. El Camino would be higher on the list were it not for the fact it really isn’t a film. Best thought of as a two-hour Breaking Bad episode, it takes up the story of Jesse Pinkman after he’s fled the dying Walter White and driven into the blue yonder. The milieu is the familiar New Mexico underworld of Breaking Bad and its gentler prequel, Better Call Saul. BB fans will nonetheless relish a return, however brief, to the Vince Gilligan expanded universe. Plus all – yes ALL – your faves from the Ballad of Walter White are back for cameos. With his Doctor Sleep adaptation forthcoming, Mike Flanagan has established himself as the latter-day top dog off Stephen King retellings. He gave us a taste of what he was capable of via his gruelling adaptation of 1992 King novel Gerald\u0027s Game, which is about a woman (Carla Gugino) who ends up bound to a bed when her husband dies during a sex game. Don’t try this at a home – or anyone else for that matter – kids. Former Daily Show correspondent Jessica Williams is a revelation in The Incredible Jessica James, which follows a romantically adrift young playwright who tries to come to terms with a break up by projecting blinding over-confidence. She strikes up an unlikely chemistry with Chris O’Dowd’s awkward everyman – with results that achieve a rarefied mix of funny and sweet. Sandra Bullock in a blindfold whispering to two terrified children might not sound like the stuff of blockbuster gold. Sci-fi horror Bird Box is certainly flawed. It also had the ill fortune to come out six months after the thematically adjacent A Quiet Place. Nonetheless, there’s an undeniable pulpy thrill to this tale of aliens that drive you mad on sight (hence the blind-folds). Keep an eye out, too, for a fantastic cameo from Tom Hollander. Ali Wong and Randall Park play former childhood sweethearts from San Fransisco whose lives take very different paths after they consummate their friendship. She becomes a celebrity chef engaged to a dead-eyed property developer he’s a home town schlub still living with his dad. Screwball antics ensue as their paths cross again. So far, so cliche. But there are enough surprises – and one hilarious cameo – to prevent Always Be My Maybe feeling hopelessly formulaic. Netflix has become an unexpected champion of the humble romcom and To All The Boys I’ve Loved Before was the movie that established its reputation in the genre. Lana Condor plays a shy high-school student who writes pretend letters to her crushes. But when the missives are stolen and made public, she feels obliged to enter a fake relationship in order to preserve her dignity. All your favourite romcom tropes are ticked off – but with a knowingness that falls satisfyingly short of cynical.1425 12. The Fundamentals of CaringPaul Rudd takes a break from Ant-Man to play the carer of teenager Trevor (Craig Roberts), who has muscular dystrophy, in The Fundamentals of Caring. A heart-warming road movie ensues as they somehow end up crossing America in the company of flinty hitchhiker Dot (Selena Gomez). Rudd’s likability is dialled all the way up in a feel-good weepie sure to shred the heartstrings1525 11. Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle King of motion capture Andy Serkis ropes in some famous pals – Christian Bale, Cate Blanchett. Benedict Cumberbatch etc – for a fang-baring tilt at Rudyard Kipling. Shunted back because of Disney’s own “live action” Jungle Book remake, Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle is far grittier – a children’s movie with enough tooth and claw not to feel like a fairytale. Eddie Murphy puts in one of his best performances in years in Dolemite Is My Name, a biopic about Blaxploitation comedian Rudy Ray Moore, whose potty-mouthed albums and movies in the mid Seventies were credited with helping invent hip hop. Moore’s “Dolemite” character was based on old black homeless man he encountered in San Fransisco and caused both a sensation and a scandal at the time. Murphy brings this complex figure to life with an alternately hilarious and affecting turn. Lovecraftian weirdness by the bucketful from director Alex Garland. Natalie Portman heads a team of researchers venturing into a quarantined swampland where the laws of nature have been rebuilt from the cellular level up. Annihilation is mind-bending body horror, with echoes of Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey.1825 8. Beasts of No NationCary Joji Fukunaga will shortly make his Bond debut with No Time To Die. But he was better known for directing original season of True Detective when his adaptation of Uzodinma Iweala’s Ghanian civil war novel Beasts of No Nation was acquired by Netflix. It’s a nightmarish tale of child soldiers dehumanised by conflict, with Idris Elba chilling as the adult commander of the boy combatants. Netflix has been churning out serviceable horror movies for several years now. Apostle, a Wicker Man updating by Raid director Gareth Evans, features the standard feral yokels, to which he brings his own innovation via oceans of gore. Dan Stevens is a naive outsider who, in 1905, travels to a remote Welsh island hoping to locate his vanished sister. He discovers a cult headed by Michael Sheen’s crazed preacherman, a whole lot of trouble and something terrible hiding in the dark.With Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite winning the Palme d\u0027Or, what better moment to revisit his brilliantly weird and charming morality fable from 2017. Co-written with John Ronson, Okja is a by turns heart-warming and chilling story of a young girl (Ahn Seo-hyun) and her friendship with the titular bio-engineered super-pig. It sounds, and frequently is, bonkers but Joon-ho plays with our heartstrings as if manipulating a Straarius, while Cate Blanchett is outstanding as an evil tech messiah masquerading as an environmentalist. 2125 5. The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected)Adam Sandler, Ben Stiller, Dustin Hoffman, and Emma Thompson head the cast in Noah Baumbach’s comedy drama The Meyerowitz Stories about worldly Manhattanites struggling with their lives of sophisticated privilege. Baumbach is on solid ground marshalling the inter-familial tension. But he also reminds us why he’s a master at locating universal truths within the self-involved lives of neurotic Americans. Mudbound is an unflinching survey of race and politics in the Southern United States immediately before and after the Second World War. Carey Mulligan and Mary J Blige head the cast, while Dee Rees guides the story with tremendous tautness. Mudbound was expected to receive a clean sweep of Oscar nominations in 2017. In the end it received just four, in relatively minor categories. The first rumblings of Hollywood’s hostility towards streaming and its impact on cinema? 2325 3. The Other Side of the WindFor a reminder how unhinged film-making became in the Seventies, buckle up and lose yourself in this posthumous restoration of never-completed Orson Welles movie, The Other Side of the Wind. What would have been Welles’s swansong is a maniacal, meta meditation on art and fame, with John Huston playing a buccaneering director – in essence, a heightened composite of himself and Welles. There are also parts for Peter Bogdanovich and Dennis Hopper. Welles’s editor, Bob Murawski, together with Bogdanovich and Welles’s daughter Beatrice, assembled the cut from 100 hours of footage. It only occasionally makes sense – but, as an experience, it\u0027s unforgettable. 2425 2. The Ballad of Buster ScruggsWhen Netflix asked the Coen brothers to make a binge-friendly TV series, Hollywood’s quirkiest siblings obviously went their own way. This anthology movie, titled The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, features six stories set amid the Coens’ deeply quirky and revisionist take on the Old West. The spirit of their classic O Brother, Where Art Thou? is tapped enthusiastically, with Liam Neeson, Zoe Kazan, Tim Blake Nelson, James Franco and Tom Waits heading the starry cast. The privileged Mexico City childhood of director Alfonso Cuarón inspired his affecting, quasi-autobiographical treatise on class, privilege and love. Yalitza Aparicio is the semi-invisible maid to a wealthy family, her life a story of small moments unfolding against the backdrop of political upheaval. Netflix was denied its Best Picture Oscar for Roma, but Cuarón was an uncontroversial pick for Best Director at the 2018 awards.  125 25. I Am MotherRickety-looking science fiction thriller I Am Mother delivers where it counts with a twisting, turning plot and several genuine surprises. In the far future, a maternal robot (voiced by Rose Byrne) raises a young woman (Clara Rugaard) as her daughter. But when an outsider (Hilary Swank) makes her way to their bunker their perfect life is shattered forever.In Private Life, a bohemian middle-aged couple struggle to have a child. Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti are hilarious and poignant. And the pathos is piled on as twenty-something college drop-out Sadie (Kayli Carter) parachutes into their life. High-jinks follow, though director Tamara Jenkins ensures the existential sadness that has become part of the protagonists daily life never quite fades. Steven Soderbergh has become something of a Netflix regular, with his Meryl Streep-starring The Laundromat recently premiering on the service. His earlier movie High Flying Bird is about a basketball agent (André Holland) in a game of skulduggery between players (mostly black and uneducated) and team owners (white and wealthy). It’s a great sports film and also a commentary on the racial and social schisms that ide America. 425 22. I Don\u0027t Feel at Home in this World AnymoreA quirky though ultimately quite dark indie movie about two misfits, Ruth (Melanie Lynskey) and Tony (Elijah Wood), on the trail off a burglar who made off with a silver spoon belonging to Ruth’s grandmother. Whimsical on the surface, I Don’t Feel at Home in this World Anymore is in fact a meditation on what happens when you’ve had enough of life’s fundamental unfairness and lash out. Team-up heist movie Triple Frontier stars Ben Affleck, Oscar Isaac, Charlie Hunnum and Pedro Pascal as old marine corps buddies headed to South America for one final pay-day. It’s hugely flawed – but Affleck is convincing as a guy losing his way amidst orce and middle age. And JC Chandor (Collateral) directs the action scenes with pizzaz. It comes close to being a great action flick for grown-ups before ultimately fizzling out. 625 20. A Futile and Stupid GestureStraight-to-video production values don’t do it any favours, but A Futile and Stupid Gesture – a biopic about the founder of American satirical magazine National Lampoon, Douglas Kenney (Will Forte) – has its heart in the right place. It’s a by turns poignant and hilarious accent of Forte’s rise, his descent into drugs and infidelity – and his strained relationship with Lampoon co-founder Henry Beard (an unrecognisable Domhnall Gleeson). Critics trounced this stylised horror starring Jake Gyllenhaal are a vainglorious art critic. Certainly, as commentary on the vacuousness of the art world it’s a whole lot of stating the obvious. Yet enjoyed as a Argento-esque OTT romp, Velvet Buzzsaw is a delight, as director Dan Gilroy subjects his victims to a series of ever more absurdist and grisly ends. El Camino would be higher on the list were it not for the fact it really isn’t a film. Best thought of as a two-hour Breaking Bad episode, it takes up the story of Jesse Pinkman after he’s fled the dying Walter White and driven into the blue yonder. The milieu is the familiar New Mexico underworld of Breaking Bad and its gentler prequel, Better Call Saul. BB fans will nonetheless relish a return, however brief, to the Vince Gilligan expanded universe. Plus all – yes ALL – your faves from the Ballad of Walter White are back for cameos.

I think he should be given a chance. If you don’t give him a chance to rehabilitate himself, how can he learn? He made a mistake, he apologised for it, he’s moved on,” she said.It comes as the Home Office admitted there had been a mobile phone outage at Heathrow detention centres since 13 January, making it\u0026nbspdifficult for detainees to access legal advice and challenge deportation orders.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The deportation flight to Jamaica next week must be cancelled. No more deportations until the review’s recommendations are implemented.”The draft copy of the review states: “Government should review its policy and approach to foreign national offenders, if necessary through primary legislation. It should consider ending all deportation of foreign national offenders where they arrived in the UK as children (say before the age of 13). Alternatively, deportation should only be considered in the most severe cases.”A spokesperson for the Home Office\u0026nbspsaid it did not comment on leaked reviews, adding: “The planned charter flight to Jamaica is specifically for removing foreign criminals. Those detained for removal include people convicted of manslaughter, rape, violent crime and dealing class A drugs.”Bella Sankey, the director of Detention Action, said that among\u0026nbsp​those set to be deported were clients who had lived in the UK since the ages of five and eight. They had all their families in the country – most of them British citizens – and almost no connection to Jamaica.“It’s shameful that the government has suppressed the Windrush report while scheduling next week’s mass deportation flight to Jamaica,” she said.\u0026nbsp“We now know that one of the key recommendations of the review is that the automatic deportation of those that come to the UK as children should end. “Yet Tuesday’s flight is full of such people, who, like so many of our clients, have deep roots and families in the UK.\u0026nbspThis cruel policy is double and discriminatory punishment, it rips children from their parents and causes deep and lifelong trauma. After the scandal of Windrush, government must now make amends to the communities it has shamefully scapegoated.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But what exactly is coronavirus and what are the symptoms Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause infections ranging from the common cold to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome .The virus attacks the respiratory system, causing pneumonia-like lung lesions.Some of the virus types cause less serious disease, while others - like the one that caused Middle East Respiratory Syndrome- are far more severe.In  an outbreak of a similar virus, Sars, killed more than  around the world within weeks.Symptoms are similar to a common cold.They include:In most cases, you wont know whether you have a coronavirus or a dferent cold-causing virus, such as rhinovirus.Buta coronavirus infection spreads to the lower respiratory tract , it can cause pneumonia, especially in older people, people with heart disease or those with weakened immune systems.There is no vaccine for coronavirus.To help prevent infection, do the same things you do to avoid the common cold such as using alcohol-based anti-bacterial soaps and sprays.People should also avoid touching their eyes, nose and mouth - and avoid contact with people who are infected.A coronavirus infection should be treated the same way a cold is treated.Medics dressed in hazmat suits have delivered the lb oz boy at Wuhan Union Hospital on Saturday.The Wuhan hospitals isolation unit, inside the quarantined Hubei province, is the designated national location for pregnant coronavirus patients.As a result, medics such as Doctor Song have been sent from numerous other provinces to assist with the influx of people.The new mother has been held in isolation as a suspected carrier of the deadly virus, while her husband remains in quarantine after he was diagnosed.Pictures from inside Wuhan Union Hospital, one of the facilities on the front line of the viral outbreak in Central Chinas Hubei Province, show the newborn boy in the arms of Doctor Song Bo.The doctor said: The child is healthy and everyone is very happy,” explaining the baby boy would be transferred to Wuhan Childrens Hospital for further tests.He added: As a father-of-two myself, its been tough being on the front line day and night, but were all so excited to see this new le.”I believe we will win the fight against this disease.Coronavirus is an airborne virus, spread in a similar way to colds and the flu.It is incredibly contagious and is spread through contact with anything the virus is on as well as infected breath, coughs or sneezes.This means that anyone who is infected can pass it on to any surface or person they breathe on or touch.In spite of efforts to contain the virus, it has gone international.There have been , cases confirmed so far.China, Japan, Thailand, Singapore, Hong Kong, South Korea, Australia, Taiwan, Malaysia, US, Germany, Vietnam, Macao, France, UAE, Canada, Italy, UK, India, Philippines, Russia, Nepal, Cambodia, Finland, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Belgium and Sweden have all reported cases.On January ,  the first two cases were reported in the UK.On February , a third Brit tested positive for coronavirus. The global death toll currently stands at more than .In China, the majority of those deaths were all in the central province of Hubei.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I suddenly had to find a months money.I didnt know what I was going to do.Nichola, who works for a charity and used to be a benefits adviser, wasnt eligible for the Flexible Support Fund or a budgeting loan to help with the costs.She added: I looked at every opportunity for some help, but I dont have a wealthy family, or someone in the area to look after my child.Nichola says the current system unfairly penalises lower earners, when other childcare systems dont require Brits to fork up upfront.And like many working mums, over the school holidays she has to folk out thousands of pounds extra upfront too.Its women who are struggling the most here,  per cent of single-parent families are women, she added.I dread to think what its like for people on minimum wage, how they can afford it.How can you justy paying childcare costs upfront for someone earning £, in advance, but not someone who is on £, Its so frustrating, so detrimental, to iniduals lives, and potentially hundreds of thousands of lives.One million people are already receiving it and by the time the system is fully rolled out in , nearly  million will be on it.But there are big problems with the flagship new system - it takes  weeks to get the first payment and it could leave some families worse off by thousands of pounds a year.And while working families can claim back up to  per cent of their childcare costs, they must find the money to pay for childcare upfront - we’ve heard of families waiting up to  months for the money.Working parents across the country told us they’ve been unable to take on more hours - or have even turned down better paid jobs or more hours because of the amount they get their benefits cut.It’s time to Make Universal Credit work.

Look out for that.”So I did, but still can’t isolate the exact moment it arrived at last week’s National Television Awards, on ITV, where the industry had assembled for the th time and, quite possibly, the last as well.If it was the NTA’s farewell, then it’d be a mercy ­killing for an event where shock results have come along about as regularly as Hezbollah ­isions have arrived at the Changing of the Guard.Five years ago, you could’ve bet the house Ant and Dec would claim their th presenting title, and This ­Morning’s Phillip and Holly would milk their tenth consecutive Best Magazine Show hangover, to the point their long-suffering audience were probably feeling homicidal.This year’s only vague surprise being, it transpired, Ant and Dec thought the same way as the viewers, with Dec admitting they: “Feel more and more sick every year.”There was a flip side to all these set-in-stone voting patterns, of course.The NTAs remained the one place on ­television earth where Mrs Brown’s Boys could be relied upon to beat the massively overrated Fleabag.Considering how regimented the actual voting is, though, the far more remarkable thing about the NTAs is that it’s nearly always a shambolic production.Categories come, go, mutate and ide into three drama sections .Some are accompanied by clips . Others, like New Drama, aren’t. It also whores itself out commercially and jumps on every available bandwagon.So David Mitchell trudged on randomly, dressed as Shakespeare, to promote a stage show, and the Impact Award was given to Gavin  Stacey, when it had “Caroline Flack’s bedside lamp” written all over it.A lot of this was down to the fact the NTAs still don’t know their own mind.They want to be both popular and highbrow, which meant poor old Michael Palin was left describing it as “a hotbed of talent”, while the camera went looking for Tess Daly.Through it all , Ant, Dec and This Morning have endured, and it’s possible to have a bit of sympathy for the production, with such stubbornly repetitive voting habits.The NTAs and ITV really are the authors of most of their own misfortune here, though.Insecure television networks need a Best Magazine category, TV awards don’t.Nor do they need a Best Judge, which was the section that eventually lumbered them with four-times winner David Walliams, the trouserless host — a man whose world begins and ends with himself and, when required to do something , like pay tribute to Nicholas Parsons, performs it with all the sincerity of a “mind the gap” announcement.As luck would have it, however, two very obvious solutions to the hosting problem presented themselves in the audience, on Tuesday.One was Ricky Gervais, who probably wouldn’t do it.The other, in about row , was Bradley Walsh, who stole the entire show by virtue of winning and saying nothing, but pulling all the right faces.Bradley would be the most obvious fit in the event’s history and I’m sure it would be warmly welcomed by most people,only the National Television Awards were worth saving.THREE and a half meandering years it took us to reach Friday night’s pm Brexit countdown.Yet in all that time I can’t remember one occasion when British TV’s satirical shows actually had something laugh-out-loud funny to say on the subject.That’s almost certainly because Have I Got News For You, The Last Leg, The Mash Report and Frankie Boyle’s New World Order all decided their left-of-centre anti-Brexit opinion was far more important than mere comedy.The wonderful irony is that the collective fury and bile has definitely had an effect.It’s made a minor star out of Geoff Norcott, one of those very rare comedians who’s not just a Conservative Leaver, he’s actually likeable as well.As the token voice of Brexit, Channel  and the BBC, very grudgingly, have had to include Geoff on almost every comedy show, including The Last Leg: Countdown To Brexit, where they’ve been trying and failing to screw a laugh out of Adam Hills’ beard for months now.I gave up on the latest attempt after about half an hour, which meant I was still looking for a show to make sense of Britain’s relationship with Europe and had only two reasonable options available, as the clock ticked down to pm.One was calm, sober analysis from the BBC, the other was ITV+’s screening of Love Island.Obviously, I took the more credible option and discovered men in lederhosen were flinging jugs of beer at scantily clad Frauleins while the commentator explained: “We sent a runner to buy strap-on harnesses and stuff poles on them.“The girls’ job is to toss pretzels at the boys and the couple with the least amount of pretzels on their pole at the end is out.”MAN Like Mobeen Man don’t like Mobeen.THE dressing-up box brigade lulled me into a  sense of security, at Sunday night’s Baftas, on BBC.True, host Graham Norton made sure there was an undercurrent of hostility to “white men” , from the start, and there was all the usual self-aggrandising flannel about “giving a voice to the voiceless”.But Andy “Gollum” Serkis made a two-minute -second speech, accepting his Outstanding Contribution award, that was so beautully judged it seemed to pacy them for nearly an hour and a half.Then Rebel Wilsonjoked that it was only sexism that stopped her joining Martin Scorsese and Sam Mendes in the Best Director category and it was like she’d flipped a switch on the entire room.Suddenly, Joaquin Phoenix was agonising about “systemic racism” and Prince William was lecturing everyone about “ersity” without the entire Royal Albert Hall gasping at his brass neck.Then, just when I thought it couldn’t get worse, up popped Hugh Grant to announce he was so impressed with the Best Film contenders His Lordship had actually condescended to vote for one of them, which I’m assuming lost.For a couple of seconds at least, though, it really was possible to think, “Maybe the National TV Awards weren’t so bad, after all.”WINTERWATCH, prediction of the week, Iolo Williams to Chris Packham: “In ten years’ time, we’ll probably have penduline tits.”Arthritic groins, Spacehopper-sized prostates and chronic flatulence.Further to last week’s allegations, Good Morning Britain weather girl Laura Tobin says: “I do not crave attention. I like to have attention for my work, good climate change stories and Nasa trips.”As I noticed myself, when I saw Laura appear in Tipping Point: Lucky Stars, Drive, with Vernon Kay, Pointless Celebrities and Sharknado : Global Swarming.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

What is the future of the BBC  Should China build our telecoms network Seldom has the political news agenda been so packed. But what is the story gaining traction at Westminster  For the latest, let’s go straight to our correspondent outside  Downing Street - who, oh dear, is stomping away in protest like Dick Emery’s Honky Tonks, having just had a blazing row with Boris Johnson’s media strategist.Yes, the big story, crazily, is the stand-off between political journalists and the PM’s media advisers. The reporters, hardly the most delicate bunch of dahlias, are wailing that the Government is being beastly to them.In the blue corner we have Downing Street’s press officers who, in an unusual interpretation of the Trade Description Act, are refusing to speak to the Press. When newspapers write about themselves, readers are entitled to roll their eyes.Political news, like the mass-production of pork bangers, is a manufacturing process best conducted away from the view of consumers. Not unless you want to turn the whole country vegan.I’ve been in newspapers since the mid-s, much of the time at Westminster, and have met drunkards, liars, gropers, cheats — and that was just the religious-affairs writers. Don’t let’s pretend journalism or politics attracts innocent hayseeds. Which makes the over-reacting on both sides of the ide in recent days so ridiculous.Creative tension between reporters and politicians’ media handlers is a healthy thing, but the system has suddenly snapped. This follows a general election in which it sometimes felt as though the media, particularly broadcasters, niggled Boris Johnson more effectively than Jeremy Corbyn did.When Boris won a thumping majority, his aides may have thought: “Right, now we can exact revenge on our media tormentors.” If so, they are foolish and unprofessional.First, they started mucking about with the daily briefings to the Westminster press lobby, the club of accredited journalists who report on politics.Then, on Monday, they tried to bar some members of that lobby from a briefing by David Frost, Boris’s main adviser on the European trade negotiations. Some scribes were told they could attend, others were told they were barred.Downing Street claimed that the briefing was too specialised for general politics writers to appreciate. The reporters took a dferent view.They reckoned Downing Street strategist Dominic Cummings and his sidekick Lee Cain were trying to ide and rule, and to winnow out the journalistic troublemakers. In a rare moment of solidarity among hacks, the newshounds upped and left. Walkout!This squabble is now headline news. Urgent questions were raised in the Commons and many papers and broadcasters are protesting that the Government is trying to censor the free Press in a “sinister” way.They compare this tactic to Donald Trump’s denunciation of mainstream US media for spreading “fake news” . Sir Keir Starmer, would-be leader of the Labour Party, joined the outcry, siding with the journalists. We could have done without that slippery little bit of opportunism.The same Starmer boasted recently that he would refuse to talk to reporters from The Sun, presumably because this paper is not in his pocket.Attempts to neutralise awkward reporters are not exactly new. During the  election, as a scurvy political sketch writer, I was locked out of a Tony Blair campaign event in The Wrekin.Gordon Brown’s people stopped me attending a media event with the president of South Africa.Tory party cronies barred me from witnessing a leadership debate between David Cameron and David Davis in . In the last election, non-sympathetic journalists were not given access to Jeremy Corbyn’s battle bus. Mind you, we were lucky. As one Leftie reporter told me: “You couldn’t get on Corbyn’s bus but I couldn’t get OFF it!”Despite some of those historic precedents, the current “lobby war” is more problematic because it looks more concerted and because it comes at a time when traditional news sources are under challenge from the internet.Online news sites can be shady and unreliable. Traditional lobby journalists, for all their faults, are at least reasonably accountable.Both sides should cool it. The lobby should admit that its clique is unacceptably clubby for st-century politics. And Boris’s henchmen should drop the macho posturing. Why are they picking this fight at a time when the Government is so popular  Never a better time for it, they might say. They want to show who’s boss.You could compare their aggression to that of an inmate who on arrival in prison butts the first guy he meets in order to show other prisoners he’s a tough guy. In my experience, journalists respond badly to this approach.Look at the damage Tony Blair’s thuggish spokesman Alastair Campbell did to the government he served.It is not beyond the wit of ministers to palm favourable stories to selected journaliststhey so wish. But the central media unit at No should remember — as they have repeatedly told us — that they are “the people’s Government” and not merely the servants of Boris Johnson.Their juicy salaries come from the taxpayer and the taxpayer does not expect them to abuse their privileged position.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He went into everything and left no stone unturned.The truth is, I have always done everything asked of me and Ive co-operated with everyone.Essex Polices own QC has said that we know that Mr Barrymore has nothing to do with this and that there is no evidence linking him to the injuries on Mr Lubbock or the pool.I have had nothing to do with this whatsoever and yet I keep getting bashed and bullied by the media.A  inquest recorded an open verdict after failing to conclude what caused Stuart’s death.Cops believe Stuart was assaulted then either died in the hot tub or went unconscious and was dumped in the pool to make it look like drowning.Despite several arrests, no criminal charges have been brought over the death due to lack of evidence.This week The Sun doubled the £, reward put up for information to £, - after cops blasted the “lies” spun over the past  years.Investigators were looking into the possibility Stuarts murder was “covered up”.A swimming pool thermometer from the hot tub — which could have been used in a sexual assault on the victim — later went missing.A broken shed handle, seen by officers, also disappeared and was not found in any bins at the property in Roydon.Cops said the brutality of the sex assault would match one or both of the objects.A  inquest heard that Barrymore’s then-PA Michael Browne was called to the house.On Wednesday, police said other unnamed men “close to Barrymore” were also allowed in — giving the perfect opportunity to clean up the scene.DCI Stephen  Jennings said: One line of inquiry has to be that this could have been a cover-up.“But there is a chance whoever did this just got lucky and no evidence was left at the scene.”He added: “Let me be clear — I believe Stuart Lubbock was murdered. And we will catch whoever did it.“I don’t think there’s anyone  there — realistically — other than the eight people that were there on the night. Of the people arrested, no one has been eliminated from inquiries.We believe at least one person is responsible — but it could be two or more.“I can’t rule out a single inidual being responsible — but on balance of probability there was more than likely more than one person involved.”Stuarts body was found in Barrymores swimming pool. He had ecstasy, cocaine and alcohol in his system Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Their bosses make mind-boggling salaries.It’s payback time.Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick’s imaginative plan will cut prices for local first-time buyers by a third —  a huge dference.But the Government must ensure hundreds of thousands of affordable homes get built this way.Previous over-hyped initiatives have produced derisory numbers.Long-term we need a bonfire of planning restrictions,  more developers able to compete and far more houses built.Campaigners warned the new homes must not come at the expense of losing new social housing.Polly Neate, boss of Shelter, said: “The country desperately needs more low-cost homes which are genuinely affordable to those people struggling at the sharp end of the housing crisis.“But, instead of offering a route to building additional low cost homes, this policy simply puts at risk the social homes currently being built.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There is often hope where we may first see ­dficulty. You just have to look a bit harder sometimes.In Portpatrick, at Scotland’s bottom left corner, the harbour had fallen into miserable disrepair. A plan was hatched to stop the rot.A local hero organised a share issue for locals to raise the money to buy the harbour and restore the buildings around it. The village now has its pecker up again and the future looks bright.It’s a similar story on Anglesey. At Halen Mon a thriving family business draws water out of the Menai Strait, harvests the salt and sells it all over the world.Near there I met a woman called Sian Sykes who cared about those waters so much she paddle-boarded  miles around Anglesey picking out the plastic.Asthat wasn’t enough, she then paddled the whole coast of Wales doing exactly the same.But my favourite character round there is no longer with us. On the very western tip of Holy Island off Anglesey’s west coast, there is the South Stack lighthouse. It’s been saving sailors from watery deaths since .A hundred years ago, John Jones was its keeper and it was his great granddaughter Denise Shaw who took me up to the top of it.Denise showed me a photograph of her great-grandad sporting a magnicent moustache the seagulls must have coveted for their nests.He was no loner, though. Denise remembers her mum saying old great-gramps was a bit of a ladies’ man.And what a chat-up line he had at his disposal: “Do you want to come back to my place to see how bright my light is ”All four of the areas we’ve looked at for this series of Our Coast are around the Irish Sea. I had a brilliant time at Belfast docks where I joined the harbour pilots, whose work astounded me.It’s their job to bring the giant ships safely into port.I sort of assumed they did this by chugging out to meet them, lighting up a sign saying, “follow me” and gently leading them to their berths.Far from it. Round the clock, all year round, whatever the weather, they race out several miles to pull up alongside these huge vessels.Incredibly, a rope ladder is dropped over the side for the pilots to clamber aboard, make their way to the bridge, take over the controls and steer these monsters into tight spaces on the docks.The ship I boarded with them, somewhat terried, was carrying grain from Romania.As my man took the helm I asked the Polish skipper which country had the best harbour pilots. “You do,” he said, with feeling.Back across the Irish Sea, in Formby, north of Liverpool, I met Mike McComb in the £million place he’s built himself a stone’s throw from the sea.He has more bedrooms, bathrooms and children than I could count .His fortune could have bought him a lavish home anywhere in the world. But it was up here, along the endless beach, that back in the day he and his mates would come on their bikes from their tiny homes in Bootle.So, he tells me as we stand on the beach, lashed by rain and wind, you can keep St Tropez or Malibu. This coast, his coast, is where he’ll stay.The sea seems to be a magnet for the most memorable people, from Grace the crane engineer in Belfast Docks who played rugby for Ireland in three rugby world cups, to Sandy the tattooed pagan near Stranraer who says the sea’s our mother, and the Bulgarian dissident I chanced upon sitting in a hot tub ­surveying Liverpool from the deck of the Queen Mary .My grandad used to tell me that when you put your toe in the sea you’re connected with the whole world.With that in mind, I’ve enjoyed many a paddle this summer reflecting on the power and history of what our island nation is all about.And I urge you to do it, too. After all, it’s pretty easy. Britain’s most landlocked place — Coton in the Elms in Derbyshire — is just  miles from the coast.

Because very often it sure as hell ain’t the product.Last Saturday, the most read piece on the BBC news homepage was a clickbait “story” — taken from Twitter — about how Kim Kardashian eats chicken nuggets.Yes, you read that right. With £.billion of your money to its name, one of the most popular “stories” on the BBC’s news website was an item which didn’t cost a penny to make, wasn’t news and stretched the definition of “public service” far beyond breaking point. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg.James Purnell — a particularly puffed-up BBC exec — announced  months ago that he and his Radio  Education team would be expanding into podcasts. He stayed horribly true to his word.In , Auntie produces podcasts on everything from football and Love Island to what Towie star Gemma ­Collins’ latest musings are, which — thanks to the big names at the helm — are ­raking in listeners.For Purnell, this is something to be celebrated. Successful podcasts presumably mean more money in his already overstuffed pockets.But for the hundreds of private podcast makers out there, it spells the beginning of the end. Competing with a company which uses public funds to net the likes of Peter Crouch is nigh-on impossible.How, I ask you, can a state broadcaster justy putting hard-working private firms out of business Yes, Ollie Williams discussing his shock exit from the Love Island villamight be entertaining, but what ­“service” is it providing the public Can the BBC — which doesn’t make Love Island — really do a better job of a Love Island podcast than ITV, which does You’d think the BBC top dogs, who are desperate to cling on to the Royal Charter, would be asking these vital questions too.But in their desperate quest for “yoof” audiences, they’ve chucked their critical faculties out of the window.And it’s all for nothing. Because the quest is a wild goose chase. According to the latest Ofcom report, most kids don’t watch ANY linear TV.So the BBC is defending a dying, analogue means of ­communication. But no one in the corporation can bear to face this unwelcome reality.So instead of cutting their own whopping salaries, they scrap well-known and well- respected current affairs ­programmes such as the ­Victoria Derbyshire show.Why  Because the more ­visible the cut, the easier it is for luvvies to pretend that the BBC is the blameless ­victim of evil Tory austerity.Nothing, of course, could be further from the truth. In fact,anything, it is the Tories and their tens of ­millions of voters who are ­victims of the BBC.The repeated Horrible Histories ­“comedy” — which mockingly undermined the existence of “British things” — and the ­ludicrously PC recent East-Enders storyline, in which a deranged killer embraces Islam and becomes a hero, are the latest in a long line of ultra- liberal BBC content seemingly designed to rub ordinary, ­patriotic Brits up the wrong way.Things can’t go on like this. If the state broadcaster is to survive, there must be an urgent and fundamental rethink.First, the BBC’s parasitical website must be shut down. The stories it features are mostly dross, or  adapted from newspaper reports.To list just one example, when Brits want to know what’s happening with Megxit, they can buy The Sun — which was responsible for the scoop in the first place.If the BBC wants a web presencethey can use it to broadcast News . Next, the salaries of fat cat managers and C-list celebs must be slashed.Then the corporation must think hard about its media offering. BBC and its often extremely niche arts offering should be folded into BBC.Radio  and , with content already well covered by ­commercial markets, must be shut down. As must every ­programme across BBC ­channels which is designed to damage ITV’s ­ratings.And of course Brits should not be punished for refusing to pay a licence fee for a service they may not use.Decriminalising it — as Boris Johnson is understood to be seriously ­considering — is the right thing to do.If Auntie can swallow a big slice of humble pie, accept her glory days are over and slim right down to size, she may have a future.

But Labour accused the Government of giving “yet another empty promise” on housing.  In  the Tories promised to create , new homes in England for first-time buyers - but zero homes were built. Shadow housing secretary John Healey said: “We’ve heard this all before. “Conservative ministers previously pledged to build , cut-price homes for first-time buyers, but the National Audit Office has confirmed they haven’t built a single one, despite wasting almost five years and spending millions of pounds.” Polly Neate, chief executive of Shelter, added: The country desperately needs more low cost homes which are genuinely affordable to those people who are struggling at the sharp end of the housing crisis.However instead of offering a route to building additional low cost homes this policy simply puts at risk the social homes currently being built.” David Renard, housing spokesman at the Local Government Association, said: “Councils support measures to enable home ownership. It is important that this does not come at the expense of providing truly affordable homes for rent. “Not everybody is ready to buy and we will be making the case in this consultation that local areas will need discretion on the number of First Homes required in new developments.

Aspiring politician Shaun also told how he felt unable to tell Mackay to leave him alone because of his high profile in the SNP. On one occasion, the MSP wrote: “Would you like to come stay with me sometime ” The last message he sent was on Sunday. He told Shaun he was “finishing the budget papers” but was free to see him in the city. Shaun said Mackay, , asked himwas gay. Despite Shaun telling him he was straight and in a long-term relationship, the politician continued to insist they meet.  After Shaun got married last May, Mackay told him he looked “loved up” but continued to contact him. Shaun said he felt “pressurised” to respond to Mackay due to his standing in the party – otherwise he would have told him to “f-off”. He called him a “predator” who didn’t “take the hint” despite repeated demurrals. Mackay resigned as finance secretary yesterday – hours before he was due to deliver the budget – after it emerged he sent messages to a -year-old boy. In the online messages, Mackay invited the teen to dinner and a rugby event as well as calling him “cute”.He contacted the boy over a six-month period on Instagram and Facebook.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon revealed Mackay has been suspended from the SNP amid the fallout from the scandal. Shaun said he met Mackay at a SNP fundraising dinner at the Cairndale Hotel in Dumfries in March .  He said: “It was a fundraiser to help getJoan McAlpine re-elected. There were  to  people there. Alex Salmond delivered a speech and Joan was there along with Derek Mackay, who also gave a speech. “I was . I would say Derek Mackay made a beeline for me. “I was with my then partner and introduced her so he knew what the situation was. He was asking general things, such as, ‘What brings you here tonight ’ “I thought it was a bit strange he’d walked past two or three tables to come and talk to me.” Mackay then tracked Shaun down on social media. Shaun has  Facebook friends and counts several SNP MSPs among them. He said: “About a week after the event, I got a friend request from him on Facebook. It was strange because I don’t know how he found out my name. “I wondered why he wanted to be Facebook friends but didn’t think too much about it and accepted. The Facebook Messenger messages started almost immediately. He askedI was gay andI knew what his political position was. He knew fine well I was straight.

I knew what he was after. It was quite obvious.  “He would askthe conversation was strictly between us. He was quite pushy. I’m obviously a happily married man. He was being quite sexual, quite suggestive. You would think the messages would stop after being ignored two or three times but I have pages and pages of him messaging me and getting no response. It’s quite creepy.” Shaun said he mostly ignored the messages, which were often sent at night. In January , Mackay messaged: “Are these conversations just between us ” Shaun assured him: “Yeah, of course.” Mackay replies: “Good, would you like to come stay with me sometime ” He added: “I could treat you to some drinks.” After receiving no reply, Mackay said: “Maybe not.” In September that year, Mackay sent a message asking: “Got any naughty pics ” Months later, after receiving no replies from Shaun, the MSP asked: “You not talking to me ” Shaun told the Record: “It was never public Facebook messages, always private. Sometimes he would send ‘hey’ or a wave emoji. It was like he wanted to start a conversation. “I told my we about it. She was angry but I kind of turned a blind eye. I’m an SNP supporter so it was dficult for me to admit this was bad. “I got married last year and kind of ignored him altogether. It had got tiresome and he disappeared for a while. Then he sent messages at the end of last year saying I looked ‘all loved up’ because he would have seen wedding photos on my timeline.” Shaun, who works for a pension firm, is a part-time DJ in nightclubs. He’s been an activist in the SNP for six years. He said: “I responded to the minority of his messages. I’d maybe get  for every one I replied to. I never led him on. “I didn’t respond because I wanted to get rid of him – but he didn’t take the hint.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailWhen a loyal Labour voter asked Emma Reynolds about her newborn baby in one breath and confessed they would not vote for her in the next, the sitting MP knew she would lose. Ms Reynolds won Wolverhampton North East with a , majority in  and increased it to , five years later. In  her majority dipped to ,. But in December last year, her Tory rival seized the seat with a , majority on a .% swing – another brick in Labouraposs “Red Wall” heartlands demolished. Speaking to the Mirror, Ms Reynolds admitted she was “pretty pessimistic quite early on”. She said: “I had a particularly bad campaign session one Friday afternoon in an area thataposs usually strong for us. “But in order to keep going you have to convince yourself youaposre not on a hiding to nothing, you persuade yourself that actually itaposs just one bad campaigning session. “But looking back, thataposs when I really realised we were probably going to lose.” Ms Reynolds gave birth to her second child over the summer. But she still hit the streets with her campaign team when the election was triggered. They were knocking doors of voters who previously said they would back Labour.But this time electors “were either very aggressively against us – slamming the door in our face and saying, aposNo wayapos – or saying, aposOooh, howaposs your second baby  I donapost think I can vote for you this time, Iaposm really sorryapos. “Some were in anger, some in sorrow. “But a lot of people in that particular session were just turning away from us.”  Ms Reynoldsapos old seat sits on the edge of Wolverhampton city centre and leads towards the outskirts. Her now-defunct constituency office is at the heart of the patch in the suburb of Oxley. A shopping centre lies either side of the busy A Stafford Road dual carriageway, carrying cars the two miles into town past smart, semi-detached houses. Businesses include two Chinese takeaways, three bookies, four off licences and four funeral directors in the space of  yards. Many shopfronts are shuttered – and they now include Ms Reynoldsapos office after her defeat on December . As the campaign wore on, attempts to convince traditional backers to stick with the party failed“We got a mixture of not liking and not trusting Jeremy Corbyn and thinking the Labour Party was therefore a joke, and the idea they would vote for us again was something they wouldnapost give the time of day – totally impossible to persuade,” she said.“They didnapost trust him on the economy, they didnapost believe all the things we were promising could be done without paying more in tax. “There was a general dislike of him, a distrust – not wanting him to be Prime Minister. “We tried what we tried in  – aposDonapost worry he wonapost be Prime Minister, weaposre not doing very well in the polls, but you can afford to vote for me as your local MPapos.  “But that wasnapost getting any traction this time. “We used that in  relatively effectively. “But the problem was we did better than anybody thought we would in  and they had another two-and-a-half years to look at Jeremy, and Iaposm afraid they didnapost like what they saw.” People perceived him to be “weak, a terrorist-sympathiser and a traitor”, she said. “Anybody who had worked in the Armed Forces said, aposI could never vote for that manapos,” admitted Ms Reynolds. Issues around economic credibility hampered Labouraposs campaign. “We said we would throw money around left, right and centre, and people just didnapost buy it, they thought that was a recipe for disaster – either the country would go bankrupt or they would have to pay more money in taxes,” she said. “People didnapost feel like he was going to do things for them. It was a deep distrust.” She wanted the party to hammer home three priorities: the NHS, schools and police.But Labouraposs scatter-gun approach lacked focus – allowing the Tories to press their Brexit message.“We underestimated the Brexit fatigue,” said Ms Reynolds, who represented a seat where two thirds of people voted Leave.  “I am sick of Brexit as well – weaposre all sick of it – but people did buy the aposGet Brexit Doneapos message and we were getting it back at us on the doorstep. “They thought MPs from all parties were standing in the way of it. “The combination of that and Jeremy was killer because you could perhaps persuade people about one of those things but … there was nothing you could doboth of those things were in their minds.” On polling day, one Labour loyalist tearfully admitted she would not back the party this time. Ms Reynolds recalled: “She said, aposI have always voted Labour but I cannot bring myself to vote Labourapos – and she literally had a tear in her eye. “She was visibly upset and that is the position we put people in. “I think it is a huge betrayal of people we traditionally represent.” Ms Reynolds was a staunch critic of the Corbyn regime, long warning of the implosion which unfolded just before Christmas. “In a way Iaposm weirdly vindicated because this is what I said would happen,” she said. “But I lost my seat as a result.  “Itaposs hugely frustrating because there was nothing I could do about Jeremy being the leader.” As leadership hopefuls prepare for Sundayaposs Mirror hustings in nearby Dudley, she urged the party not to back a “continuity Corbyn” candidate. “We need to elect a leader who turns the page on Corbyn and all that he represents – not just him but the whole experiment that has failed,” she said. “If there is any aposcontinuity Corbynapos leader, that would be a disaster and could be the end of the party.” Ms Reynolds wants the next leader to “show people they are listening on controversial issues” like immigration. She added: “Weaposve got a lot of work to do and the next leader firstly has to change the party. “In order to be credible again we need a dferent kind of party, a dferent kind of leadership, dferent Shadow Cabinet. “We need to front up to the people who thought Jeremy Corbyn was going to lead this socialist revolution and say, aposNo, it was never ever going to be successful, and thataposs never going to win us electionsapos. “Whoever it is has got to tell some hard truths to the party – and the partyaposs got to be able to listen.” She warned: “Iaposm not sure this is a five-year project. “I would very much hope it can be turned around in five years but it might not be possible.” Shoppers in the Wolverhampton North East suburb of Oxley delivered a scathing verdict on Labour torday – particularly outgoing leader Jeremy Corbyn. Charity shop worker Liz Thomas, , said: “I voted Conservative, always have done. “Boris is a little bit daft but heaposs lovely. “Iaposm hoping I havenapost done the wrong thing.  “I hated Jeremy Corbyn, heaposs just horrible, heaposs slimy – itaposs a woman thing. “I voted for Brexit but it wasnapost a big part of why I voted Conservative in December.” John OaposConnor, , a retired bricklayer, said: “Personally I thought the best party got in. “I voted for their principles. “Boris is OK, heaposs down to earth.  “Jeremy Corbyn made a few mistakes but he wasnapost the only person who spoke to members of the IRA, yet that went against him.”Unemployed hairdresser Nathan Lawrence, , said: “Iaposve never voted in any general election and now I wonapost ever do so.“I made the biggest mistake of my le – I voted for Brexit. “They told me that my NHS was going to get £million extra.  “I feel cheated, I feel lied to. I have lived here all my le and now my backyard, where I grew up, has become a UKIP heartland. “Iaposm disgusted.” Retired builder James Dell, , voted Conservative because it was “the only sensible thing to do”. The Brexiteer said: “Thereaposs no point voting Labour, they stood no chance of getting in because of their views on Brexit, their incompetence on Brexit, their ision on Brexit. “Iaposve always been a Tory voter but there was no real option this time anyway.  “Jeremy Corbyn was just ridiculous as a leader, far too left. “It shouldnapost be about personas but, as everybody says, heaposs like Steptoe, heaposs not presentable, his views are outdated. “I think people want a more centrist Labour Party.” His we Evelyn Dell, , a retired businesswoman, also backed the Conservatives. She said: “I couldnapost vote Jeremy Corbyn because of the whole anti-Semitism thing. “I didnapost agree with how that was dealt with by the party.  “Boris is great, I donapost get it when people mock him. “He doesnapost take the job too seriously until it needs to be and then he does. “When I listen to him, everything he says makes sense to me. “Labour needs to be more centrist.” Linda Wilding, , a retired bookies shop worker, voted Tory because she wanted a crackdown on immigration. She said: “Immigration was on lots of peopleaposs minds with Brexit and they are the best party to lead us out of the EU. “I like Boris Johnson, he talks a lot of sense.“I donapost think Jeremy Corbyn has got a clue. “They need somebody who is more in touch with the average person, somebody more in the middle as opposed to being totally left wing.” Student Marnie Wilding, , planned to vote Labour but was too tired to visit her polling station after a long day in college. She believed Labour would have done more to help “the homeless and people who go to foodbanks”.

University law graduate Sarah Harvey was working as a PA for a luxury hotel group and lived in an apartment at the iconic ,ft high Marina Torch building in Dubai Marina. But she had been battling depression and anxiety and had been prescribed anti- depressants. An inquest heard that on August  , Miss Harvey, , whose mother is a parish councillor in the village of Rainow, near Macclesfield Cheshire, wrote five suicide notes before leaping from her the window of her flat. She fell  floors before landing on a balcony on floor . Miss Harvey suffered multiple injuries and died at the scene. Police who examined the notes found they expressed Miss Harveyaposs sorrow and of her desire to end it. The hearing in Warrington was told Miss Harvey who attended Fallibroome Academy school in Macclesfield had moved to Dubai after completing a law degree at university in . She had initially decided to travel the world and joined Emirates Airways as a flight attendant before pursuing a career as an assistant company secretary for a luxury hotel group. Her parents John and Carole Harvey said in a statement: “She graduated from Sheffield university with a degree in Law and German in the summer of . But she joined Emirates Airways rather than pursuing a career in law. She wanted to travel before utilising her academic qualications. She spent a number of years there and then moved to private flights for the rulers of Dubai then Abu Dhabi. Eventually she decided toto her academic skills, obtaining membership at the institute of company secretaries - a global luxury hotel group. “Her general health in the final months appeared excellent. There were visits to the UK and phone calls but they revealed nothing and she acted very well. “Sarah discussed with us that she was being prescribed anti depressants but she didn’t elaborate to the depth of her despair. Her friends had noticed a change in her normal going out appearance in the final weeks and they recommended that she sought help which she did do. “But she had made no attempts on her le of any serious nature other than in her first year of university when she suffered with self doubt in her ability. This was swtly corrected on her examination. “The notes that where found, there were five in total were addressed to dferent iniduals. In these notes Sarah expressed her sorrow about what she’s about to do but that she cannot live any longer with her anxiety and depression. And she was expressing a desire to end it.” Dr Fawzi Benomran, the head of the Dubai police general department of forensic science and criminology, said: “In response to a report from Dubai police I went to the Dubai Marina at pm on Tuesday August , . “Her friend reported that the deceased had suffered from depression and was taking medication for it. I sent a sample of blood to be analysed and it indicated a low concentration of anti depressants. But there was no alcohol or narcotic substances.” A post mortem examination found that Miss Harvey died from multiple injuries and fractures, consistent with falling from a considerable height.

Mr Trainer, from Aintree, who is a repeat aposnoise pollution offenderapos, was previously jailed for the same offence yet continued to play music at a level I enjoy.Prosecution Barrister, Simon Leong, told Liverpool Magistrates Cour t how Mr Trainer’s neighbour, Thomas Michael Thompson, had experienced “noise pollution” from his neighbouraposs property for a number of years.On Tuesday, December , , a police officer attended Mr Traineraposs property after being called out for a complaint of noise by Mr Thompson. However the court heard, when a police officer arrested him on suspicion of breaching a condition of a restraining order, Mr Trainer told the officer “I like playing music at a level I enjoy.” The statement, read in court, also reported that Mr Trainer had said he had a bad cold and “could only hear in one ear”. He also told the officer that being on steroids for a medical condition meant he couldnapost wear headphones as they “irritated his ears.” In court, Mr Trainer, who is hard of hearing, was allowed out of the dock to sit in court and was provided with a listening device so he could hear proceedings. Giving evidence, neighbour Mr Thompson, said: “It’s not just one day of the week, it’s every day of the week. “I go out early morning and stay out until late afternoon to avoid the noise. “It’s just unbelievable at times.”  The court was shown a number of video recordings made by Mr Thompson on his mobile phone, to show what he could hear from his house, which adjoins Mr Trainersapos. In one clip Mr Thompson was seen walking closely to his living room wall, which meets Mr Trainer’s property and music from Classic FM could clearly be heard, which included the sound of the presenters talking. Defending Keith Webster suggested to the court that Mr Thompson had been angry about Mr Traineraposs early release from a previous prison sentence. He also told the court how on one occasion, when police had been called out to the defendantaposs home, the noise was considered too low for the officers to do anything about.

Soil without earthworms is less fertile and more prone to flooding. A study led by Professor Jean-Lou Justine of the Natural History Museum in Paris found the worm in  European locations. He said the worm was “a potential threat to the bioersity and ecology of the soils in Europe”. It is thought to be spread by the potted plant trade. The charity Bugle says it is one of  pest flatworm species in Europe. The worm was first seen in Europe on Guernsey in , but has spread through France and into Spain and has also been confirmed at a number of locations in the UK.

Mistress Hayley Leeanna, , is lavished each February  with gold jewellery, designer watches and expensive sunshine breaks in exotic locations by her harem of cheating partners. Hayley cashes in during the run-up to Valentines as her lovers feel guilty about ditching her for their wives on the big day, she says. Some of the extra special gts she has received in recent years include a £, thick gold chain from American department store Macyaposs, bought by a married investor she has been seeing for three years. Her haul also includes a gold and amethyst musical note pendant costing £, a gt from a married stockbroker lover plus a £ Dolce  Gabbana watch and a £ gold Gucci watch paid for by a rich businessman she was dating. Ahead of the romantic day she shared beach pictures from a pre-Valentineaposs break in Thailand with a businessman who has made a fortune investing in the luxury beach retreats in the Far East. Hayley said: Valentineaposs is a great time to be a mistress because you can make a fortune with the gorgeous gts. I get the very best jewellery, watches and always ensure that I get a bit of winter sun in the run-up to February with a free break with one of my wealthy lovers.  Married men are always a little more generous at this time of year because they feel guilty about abandoning their mistresses on Valentineaposs when they know they will have to be with their wives. I donapost mind at all because the last thing I want them to do is break up with their wives. I like being a bit on the side - you are treated much better that way and the gts are more expensive. Hayley of Peterborough, Cambs meets her lovers on IllicitEncounters, the UKaposs leading dating site for married people. She added: Valentineaposs is my favourite time of year - itaposs when I replenish my jewellery drawer, get a new designer watch and get away to the sun when it is wet and cold.  I have been seeing the investor who bought the gold chain on and off for the last three years. He is in New York a lot for business which is where he bought the gorgeous gold chain. I see him once a month in London. We meet for dinner and then normally go to a hotel for sex. Hayley went on to discuss the tradition she shares with her man. We have a nice tradition of him spoiling me at Valentineaposs - I always get a beautully wrapped little box at the start of our date, she said. It is always jewellery. His we lives in the Home Counties and he stays in London hotels a lot because he works long hours. It provides a perfect cover for his affairs.  The musical note pendant is from a stockbroker lover who has a largely sex-less marriage with his we. She lost interest years ago and turns a blind eye to his affairs. I know I am not his only lover and Iaposm cool with that. Itaposs not asI am exclusive with him. Hayley was taken to Phuket in Thailand by her business man lover. He spends most of the winter travelling out to his ious retreats to check they are well run and normally bring a lover along with him for the ride, she said. He is separated from his we but still uses IllicitEncounters because he says that the woman are low maintenance and that suits his circumstances.  He is one of the wealthiest men on the site and is worth several millions. He likes to make love on the beach with the waves lapping on our toes. Itaposs a lovely thing to do at night after a romantic meal. We always fly first class so the breaks must cost him an absolute fortune. Another of her men on the side is a big fan of watches. He always has a huge new timepiece on his wrist and loves to pick his favourite female watches for me, Hayley continued.  Last year, I got a very bling DG watch which I adore and this year he gave me a more elegant gold one from Gucci which is pretty special. Hayley insists all her married lovers were cheating on their wives long before she came along.

The way my assessment period works I’ve been deducted £ from my Universal Credit payment today. If they did it from the beginning of the month to the end then I could have kept £ of December’s wage and £ of January. Instead, they say I’ve been paid twice in one month so they’ve deducted £. I’m also in debt to them by nearly £ a month to pay back the loan I took out to cover January’s nursery bill. I genuinely would have been better off financially not bothering to even get the Tesco job because now she’sin nursery already they won’t pay for anything to help me.I honestly wish I didn’t apply for it but it’s too good an opportunity to pass up. It’s just so disheartening that I’m now in debt and will be struggling with money for the next month or two to the point that I might have to use a food bank in order to have a better job le for my family. I’m feeling really stressed about it and can’t believe there isn’t a better option for women with children who get stung by huge nursery bills when they start a new job. Hollie was a lecturer at Yeovil College when she became pregnant with her second daughter in . Needing help with housing for herself and two daughters, she was advised to enrol on the Universal Credit scheme. As a single parent trying to start a career, Hollie says itaposs not enough to cover nursery fees. In December , she was offered a job as Communication and Community Officer. Though happy with the thought of a new job, the increase in her working hours means that her youngest daughter will need to spend more time at nursery meaning a signicant increase in nursery fees of around £.

Seven of them were aposfree-birthedapos meaning she had no medical assistance throughout pregnancy or delivery. She gave birth to her twins while standing in her living room - as her other children played around her between pushes. Mrs Schmid, who trained to be a doctor but opted to become a stay-at-home mum, has had children in a range of unusual places, including a Swedish forest and her back garden. Her twins Samuel and Sarah are now -months-old. Since she began her free birthing journey, Mrs Schmid has opted to film each of the deliveries - and has built up a YouTube following of more than ,. Mrs Schmid along with husband Tim, , are also parents to Johanna, , Jonathan, , Emanuel, nine, Elisabeth, seven, Konstantin, five, and Kiran, three.  The mum said: I was surprisingly fearless with the twins. I suspected twins when my belly got larger, and as I had monitored all my pregnancies myself, I had taught myself to feel how the baby is lying in my belly. But when I felt it, it was dferent, and it could only be explained by twins. I had always declined having ultrasounds, but as there is more risk with a multiple pregnancy, I had one, to check all was well. I had a friend who was a midwe, and at  weeks, I went to her to have it done, to confirm that I was having twins.  The birth itself only took about five hours and my husband caught both twins, Samuel and Sarah. Mrs Schmid said a photographer, a friend and her children all watched the birth. She added: I had no fear - I prepared thoroughly for a twin birth, and I felt like it was an adventure into unknown territory. I paid more attention to everything, did more research and talked to midwives, more than I would have done with a singleton. Mrs Schmid hopes that by sharing her experiences of birth, it will take away the fear for other women and instead empower mothers.  The mum says she chose to have her children in obscure locations because it brought her closer to nature and made her relax. Yet she accepts that she has received a fair share of criticism, as some believe it is irresponsible and could result in death. Mrs Schmid added: I would like to educate women, so that more will chose their mode of birth not based on fears and feelings of inferiority but based on trust, knowledge and intuition. I feel like the media promotes birth as a medical emergency where doctors are saving a baby from a screaming mother.

Unfortunately, it sounds like he’ll sit out the rest of the campaign as well.But it’s a sign of the quality they have in their squad that Clark and Sow can be missing and you still have a striker of the calibre of Lawrence Shankland to lead the line. vw, px\"  Sow being out leaves a great chance for youngsters like Declan Glass and Chris Mochrie to show what they can do in the No  position.It’s unfortanute for people to get injured but also a great chance for some of United’s youngsters to impress.On top of Sow’s injury, Paul McMullan, Louis Appere and Calum Butcher have been carrying injuries recently, too.This week is an ideal time to give the players a bit of a break and recharge the batteries for the run-in.The Tangerines want to get that title wrapped up as soon as possible but this breather couldn’t have been better timed.Once again, other teams weren’t really able to make up any ground on the runaway leaders – Inverness clawed one point back at home to Alloa.United are the only team that have managed any sort of consistency this season – a wee break is just what they need to get going again."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/02/Gary-and-Piacquiao-940x531.jpg ","title":"boxing fanatic gary todd describes brushes with the biggest stars in the sport since move from st marys to sydney","story":"Interviewing Muhammad Ali, having lunch with Manny Pacquiao and tracking down Deontay Wilder # it#s all in a day#s work for Dundee-born Gary Todd.Growing up in St Mary#s, Gary never would have imagined that one day he#d get the chance to meet boxing legends such as Mike Tyson and Julio César Chávez, however after moving to Sydney in  his le changed completely.The former Rockwell High School pupil now has two international bestselling books on the sport of boxing, and has had the chance to travel to countries such as Japan, Canada, the Bahamas, Hong Kong and the USA.He said: #I grew up in St Mary#s andI#m honest I didn#t go to school a lot.#I went to MacAlpine Primary School and I was at Rockwell for a year, but I dropped out to start working and earning some money.#I got a job at the slaughterhouse, but after a while I felt like I couldn#t see a future for myself in Dundee, so I decided to do a bit of travelling.#I went to Australia on a visa and loved it so much I decided to stay.#My we Jenny came with me and we got married and started a family here.#The boxing fanatic decided to join a local gym near his new home in Sydney, and soon found himself interviewing some of boxing#s greatest legends for a book on all the dferent workouts used in the sport.He said: #I#ve always been passionate about the sport, so I joined the gym.#I started training there and I made some connections and pals, then I kind of slipped into writing my book.#Throughout the course of writing his workout book, Gary has travelled across the globe, getting interviews and pictures with over  boxing champions.However, it hasn#t all been a walk in the park for the father of three.He said: #One time, a bodyguard threatened to shoot me.#I was talking to Marvin Hagler, who#s actually my favourite boxer of all time.#His bodyguard was annoying me and getting in the way and we started arguing.#He threatened to take me outside and shoot me, and Marvin Hagler just had to stand between us.#Gary, whose day job is as a director at a construction company in Australia, has gained a large amount of fame and respect in the boxing community for his work.He has produced two books, Workouts from Boxing#s Greatest Champs Volume  and , which have been popular among fans of the sport.The -year-old has been invited to watch Deontay Wilder#s fight against Tyson Fury later this month in Nevada, and plans to continue his work interviewing the biggest names in the sport.He said: #I#m a family man, I#m a construction worker, and I#ve got a passion in le which is boxing.#I#ve been into it since I was  years old, when the first Rocky film came out in cinemas.#It took me around  years to finish my first book, and I went all over the world.#I saved up my money and frequent flyer miles, flying all over the world economy class.#In two weeks, I#m planning to fly to Las Vegas to watch the Tyson Fury vs Deontay Wilder fight as part a member on a press accreditation.#He also confessed that his thick Dundonian accent does present a bit of a challenge at times, saying: #I do get some comments on it.

There is no suggestion that I personally falsied this email.“The suggestion is that I forwarded the email after it had been falsied by someone .“I refute the allegations made against me and I can confirm I will be appealing against my removal from my post.Mr Christie also said he felt that the penalty seemed to be “disproportionate” to the accusations made against him.“No other allegations have been made against me,” he said.“I have worked in my current role for  years and have had an association with the council for  years.“I continue to have a huge respect for my council colleagues, council officers and elected members.“This is a very unfortunate time for me and I will need to take time to look at things moving forward.“I don’t wish to say anything further at this stage but will be making my intentions clear in due course.”Blue Parrot had provided sound equipment for DSMT for previous shows.DSMT producer and manager Lina Waghorn said: “I am shocked and saddened that Kenny Christie is no longer working with the council.“He was a great asset to DSMT and an inspirational teacher.”It’s understood students at DSMT were informed on Sunday January  that Mr Christie was “moving on to new projects”.It was made clear to students he was not ing and that Kris Mordente, a St John’s Academy teacher, would be taking over director permanently.A source at DSMT said: “It’s just a bit strange that he’s gone. Kenny was DSMT and DSMT was Kenny. I don’t think anyone knows how we’re going to operate without him.“He had been growing distant for a while, we have only seen him three times since August and at one point Lina mentioned bringing in an assistant director.“It’s not something we’d expect, I think everyone here including Lina would be reluctant to let him go.”A Blue Parrot spokesman said the company was not awarded the DSMT contract because “strictly speaking, we did not meet the deadline.”A Dundee City Council spokesman said: “We do not comment on inidual personnel matters.”Kenny Christie has been described as one of the most “sought-after” musical theatre directors in the country.He has worked with DSMT for over  years, producing several musicals like Les Miserables and Annie.His directing career began at the age of , producing a one-act play as part of the SCDA drama festival.In , Mr Christie became the world record holder for the fastest theatrical production, taking one piece from book to stage in just . hours.He has also taught and organised dance workshops ,in Dundee and Perth, and has worked with Dundee City Council to organise dance activities for school pupils.Mr Christie has also held the title of chairman of the Heads of Instrumental Teaching Scotland, as well as being the first Youth Adviser for Scotland for the National Operatic and Dramatic Association.Kenny Christie’s sacking comes in the wake of a separate fraud scandal that has rocked Dundee City Council in the past year.In October, the council’s head of construction Mark Ross quit in the midst of an investigation into claims he was treated to a golfing trip on the Spanish coast by bosses of a firm awarded an £ million local authority contract.The £.m deal to provide heat and smoke and carbon monoxide detectors was awarded to Edmundson Electrical without going out to tender.The trip to Spain took place weeks after the contract was awarded and included Mr Ross, a senior Edmundson staff member, another council employee and representatives of two other firms.It was later revealed that the second council employee was Kenny Muir, who also worked in the council’s construction department.He was sacked from his role earlier this month.Mr Muir is the fourth senior employee to leave construction services since September, following the resignations of Mr Ross and electrical supervisor Iain Gardyne, who is accused of selling thousands of pounds’ worth of council smoke alarms online."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/02/5e3930203b5672.98108232-836x564.jpg ","title":"mcpake id like another striker but im happy to go with just two","story":"Dundee boss James McPake admits he’d like another striker in his squad but slim pickings in the free agent market means he’s happy to stick with just two for the rest of the campaign.An ultimately failed deal to bring in St Mirren frontman Danny Mullen went right to the wire on transfer deadline day.That was frustrating for the Dens boss but he’s more than happy with the quality of the two strikers he has at his disposal.Andrew Nelson ed to full training today after surgery to fix a broken hand while Kane Hemmings notched his seventh league goal of the season at Morton on Saturday .James said: “I would like another striker. We have Kane Hemmings and Andrew Nelson, though.“We did try to bring in another one in the window, that’s no secret.“There still is a chance because there are free agents out there but we won’t just go out and sign somebody for the sake of filling a space.“I am delighted Andrew Nelson is back.“Even a game like Saturday at Morton, we could have done with him on the pitch with his energy and the tempo he brings.“Kane got reward for his hard work with a good goal and is then unlucky with another effort. vw, px\"  “No manager will ever say they are completely happy with the squad, you always want to improve, but I am happy with the work we did in January.”He added: “Andrew had his final bit of work on his hand done yesterday, he’s done all his conditioning and we’ll get him up to speed to be ready to go on Saturday.”In terms of possibly adding another player to his squad outside of the window, there is nothing imminent.However, a deal for -year-old former Celtic and Burnley man Ross Wallace is still a possibility.Whether there are more new faces at Dens Park or not, James does expect his team to start putting together performances in a way they have failed to do all season.And he hopes, after having new signings Christophe Berra, Tom Field and Christie Elliott in training for a week, that can start to do that this coming weekend at home to Partick.The Dens gaffer added: “I think there is a lot more to come from this team.“There has to be a consistency where we know what we are getting from both ends of the pitch.“I think we got a bit of that on Saturday.“Morton are the team that puts most balls into your box and make you defend more than anybody  in this league.“They are direct but do it with effect.

That’s been an issue for us at times. We created chances and Declan McDaid’s one on another day goes in.

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation. So on the day of the swap four operations took place and two needy people received le-giving new organs.Although not presently being considered in the UK, with the ethical issues sorted, this multi-swap procedure opens the way for extended chains of donors and many more lives saved.*Torres et al Am J transplant. :-."},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll rugby players pictured in their prime","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowA black and white photograph featuring a Mid Argyll Rugby team, handed to the Argyllshire Advertiser by Tayvallich reader Donald Carmichael, has generated a great deal of interest.After we asked our knowledgeable readers to tell us a little more about the photograph, Lochgilphead#s Murray MacFarlane visited the office to offer some background information on the image.Murray named every member of the team in the photograph, but added: #I was playing rugby as stand-off at that time as well, so I must have had a hangover or something when the photo was taken.#He recalled that Mid Argyll Rugby Club played in the Glasgow District League and only just missed out on promotion to the national leagues during the s.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets.

We did not have the new kitchen then. The hotel has always cooked the turkeys for us but cooking big pots of potatoes and vegetables was quite a job with just the gas rings. Back then, we had ice-cream and jelly for dessert.#Jean added: #It was all good fun and we had loads of laughs.#Elma continued: #We used to have sales to raise money for the dinner. Santa was on the stage and Jean’s children were his elves. They were only little then.#We modelled the clothes and the older women loved the bargains. We thought they were old, but they were probably the age we are now,# Elma said laughing. #We would shout #Roll up, roll up# to get them to come and see what we had on offer.#After a warm welcome from compère Martin Jefferies and a prayer of thanks for the food, the five-course meal was expertly served by members of the organising committee and their youthful helpers.A raffle, again free of charge, saw a large number of guests receive prizes and no-one was left disappointed as the remainder of the guests received selection boxes.Tarbert’s seniors showed they know how to party as dancers left their seats and enthusiastically took to the floor as soon as the musical entertainment began.A stunned Margaret Henderson was named #Citizen of the Year#, confessing she never expected to win the award.For more than  years, Margaret has collected money to support the Tarbert Sea Food Festival and Music Festival. Later, Margaret dressed up as Mrs Brown from Mrs Brown’s Boys to entertain the audience, something for which she is well-known.Martin Jefferies thanked everyone who had helped make the evening such a success with the happy gathering agreeing with loud applause.By Joan Crooks"},{"url":null,"title":"winning start to new year for star youths","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe Now kicked off with a flying start for both Red Star s and s.The s headed to Glasgow in a top of the table clash against Glasgow Boys.

A wee van and a motorbike were behind them at the time and they let them pass and they disappeared down the twisty road at an incrediblespeed.They reached Tighnabruaich at about  o#clock and saw Fulmar in the water, but when they stopped to speak to Johnny Malcolm and Donald Turner they were told she was not in the water more than # an hour and still not fully rigged. They were quite right but George Smith said they were busy getting Psyche ready for launchingbut they would be out first thing in the morning to bend on the sails and finish off the rigging.They got their storesin the yard and with these and their luggage went aboard in two trips. Things were soon put sufficiently enough in order to allow them to get to bed and after watching Psyche go down the slip they were soon in their bunks. It was a beautully clear evening but distinctly cold.Next morning they were up at sevenand about eight the yard men came out and finished up their jobs. Jimmy Smith fixed up the slipping clutch and suggested we do away with the present gear lever fancy arrangement which was not strong enough for its work. This the Skipper agreed to though it meant a less handy working but it did away with the pin and shield that broke up the dog-house seat, they being replaced by a removable hatch cover. It certainly made sitting in the dog-house more comfortable.The Skipper went ashore to the village for meat and some curtain hooks while Archie watered ship and the other two continued cleaning and clearing up aboard.At quarter to twelve they were away under full sail and in brilliant sunshine but with a cold north-westerly they ran to Ardlamont then beat up to Tarbert, being passed just outside Tarbert as an aeroplane flew close overhead, by Blink. They noticed a huge oil tanker doing trials just off Arran.They were anchored off the herring pier before  o#clock and they had supper-cum-lunch then went ashore. The Pilot to visit a friend, the others to get milk in the village then to walk to the end of the road on Loch Fyne. On their way they spoke to an enthusiastic English pair, working in their garden, who wanted to know off which yacht they had come.During the evening Arcturus and Tunnag came in and one or two motor boats. Zaidie was in when they arrived and Leonora was anchored across Loch Fyne in Buck Bay.All aboard, Margaret and Archie went off to the islet in the harbour to get some roots for their new garden then soon afterwards all turned in, for though it was a glorious looking evening it was perishingly cold and the stove, lit as soon as they anchored, had been very welcome.On Sunday they were again up early and found a dull overcast day. The Pilot, ashore for water, heard a poor weather forecastfrom a fishing board. On the strength of this they hurried breakfast and by  o’clock were away with a south-westerly breeze.The Skipper gave the first beacon a rap with the boom-end as they ran out of the harbour. The beat down to Ardlamontand thee ran the engine for five minutes to get out of a nasty lop. The sun came out for about five minutes but by the time they had reached the Carry Buoythe rain had started and it got heavier and heavier.The wind strengthened with the rain and they moved up very fast into Tighnabruaich Bay then up to Loch Riddon to anchor off the pier at Ormidale. As they passed Tighnabruaich they saw Torridon was on Fulmar’s mooring and they watched her crew panicking to get off before Fulmar arrived. They wondered what the Torridons said when they saw Fulmar pass on through and realised that they could have stayed where they were. As they passed Glen Caladh the new Jansi of Kames passed under a not very healthy-sounding engine.They had lunch and the stove was lit then Margaret and Archie went ashore to visit friends and when they came back they brought with them a big sack of coal . The late afternoon and evening were spent below talking and listening to the rain hammering on the deck.Monday morning it was dry but blowing hard. They got the anchor early and motored to the moorings. The sails were hoisted to dry them and St Roma came close by to make their number and at one time a big school of thrasher whales went through the Kyles heading east and at a great speed.About noon they went ashore for a visit to the hotel and for a run round the Ardlamont road . Back aboard they had lunch and soon after packed up and came home."},{"url":null,"title":"the cinema on wheels returns","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe screen machine will be rolling back into Mid Argyll at the end of the month.Bringing with it a host of movies for film fans the Screen Machine will be in Campbeltown Road car park in Tarbert from Wednesday January  to Thursday January  and Lochgilphead Resource Centre car park from Friday January  to Sunday February .Musical fantasy film Cats, based on the Andrew Lloyd Webber stage musical, features an ensemble cast including James Corden, Judi Dench, Jason Derulo, Idris Elba, Jenner Hudson, Ian McKellen, Taylor Swt, Rebel Wilson, and Francesca Hayward.Also known as Star Wars: Episode IX, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an epic space-opera film.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"hair raising happenings at the co op","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Co-op staff are on a fundraising mission which they hope will raise awareness and help overcome stigma around mental illness.Trusting her hairdresser Nicky MacDougall, from Casa in Ardrishaig, Tina Holloway will have her hair shaved off to raise funds for the Scottish Association for Mental Health .Explaining why she decided to take on the challenge, Tina said: #I didn#t really think before I opened my mouth.

homes for historical documents and artefacts after a Borders estate has claimed back its building.The historic Reading Room were built in the town during the mid-th century to encourage education.A Trust was responsible for the running of the popular Market Square building for more than a century.Although the three-storey building hasnt been used as a private subscription library since the s, it had remained as a meeting room and storage area for historic books and documents, as well as the towns vast array of Christmas lights.Attempts have been made in recent years to form a Trust to bring the Reading Room back to their former glory.And surveys have been carried out to establish the viability of a community facility.But a shock email from legal representatives of Mellerstain Estate towards the end of last year has ended the plans.Solicitors acting on behalf of the Earl of Haddington, owner of Mellerstain, indicated that the estate had ownership of the building - and they wanted it back.The lawyers were also investigating the ownership of books within the rooms.Sheila Gibb, chair of Earlston Community Council, told us: \"The Community Council and Scottish Borders Council have been working together to establish the position regarding the Reading Room.\"Its a very complex legal situation as well as a building that is in a poor state of disrepair.\"At the moment Scottish Borders Council are supporting us as we look to relocate the books and artefacts held in the building.\"The Christmas Lights Committee are doing the same for their equipment and displays.\"A meeting was first held to gauge support for the creation of a Reading Room in .It was reported at the time, Major Baillie of Mellerstain offered an initial donation of  books for the library.A committee was formed with Major Baillie as President, with a librarian appointed as manager.Many prominent members of the Earlston community, including the headmaster, minister and surgeon, served on the committee.Both the Reading Room and the Recreation Room were open every day, between the hours of am and pm, except Sundays and New Years Day.A wide selection of books were gted and loaned to the Reading Room during the years which followed.By  the facility had amassed around  volumes with a membership of  local people.A billiards table was also placed in the Recreation Room.During a celebration to mark the centenary of the opening on June ,  it was noted that among the valuable possessions being held in the Reading Room were a lock of Sir Walter Scotts hair as well as his autograph.But the opening of a public library in the s as well as the deaths of the Trustees over the following decade or so, led to a gradual decline in both the popularity and condition of the building.,params: .pushIt is thought the Reading Room Trust stopped operating in the s.In recent years attempts have been made to restore the building and bring it back into community use.A feasibility study was carried out by Scottish Borders Council last year which estimated that around pound, would be required to complete any community restoration project.But the recent correspondence by Mellerstain Estate over ownership has put a spanner in the works.Local councillor David Parker believes it is unlikely the community will be able to oppose the claims.He said: \"The community has had an aspiration to do something with the Reading Rooms, and in  I was handed some information about the historical operation.\"That information suggested that Mellerstain Estate had always had a claim on the building but the Reading Room had been operated under a Trust model, with the Trust basically becoming extinct in the late s.\"If the community wanted to use the Reading Room again, it would need to try to reactivate the Trust and get permission to do that from the Sherf Court and then find new Trustees.\"However, the building is in a poor state of internal repair, it requires quite

I thought it was worth a concerted effort to seewe could make a dference to the state of our streets to benefit everyone. I was prepared to make a personal commitment of time and effort to this cause.The project got off ground last January when Innerleithen community councillors made the decision to try and rid the streets of dog mess.Reflecting on the actions they undertook, Jackie said: ldquoI became involved after Gordon Daly taped plastic bottles to lampposts to dispense free poo bags to those in need.\"Susan Meikle and I offered to help these from supplies Gordon had procured from the Dogs Trust.The following month, the community council was encouraged by local authority councillors to apply for funding through the Localities Area Bid Fund.ldquoThis concentrated my mind and I took it upon myself to complete the application with offers of help from both a previous applicant and The Bridge, said Jackie.ldquoWe heard our project had been shortlisted to be put to the public vote in time for our May community council meeting.But the timetable for the public voting process was disrupted by other political happenings, and after a tense wait and a flurry of activity to encourage voting, good news was delivered.Jackie added: ldquoWe heard our bid was successful in time for our July meeting.\"Various conditions had to be met before the funds could be released, including  percent of the amount applied for supplied by us, copies of our constitution and accounts.ldquoHaving won the funding, final details of ordering, delivery, installation and maintenance had to be agreed.Whilst waiting on the new bins to arrive, the community councillors did not rest on their laurels.With the help of SBC leader Shona Haslam, Jackie and Gordon stencilled anti-fouling signs on problem pavements in Innerleithen.Community councillors also mapped out locations for the new bins and Scottish Borders Council agreed to install these and remove or relocate the redundant ones.ldquoOperationally, the local authority agreed to provide the litter bags and to replenish the poo bags with us taking responsibility for funding them, added Jackie.With the bins now in place, the community council is due to meet on Monday to discuss further fundraising initiatives.The townrsquos community council, in particular, the poo-busting trio of Jackie, Gordon and Susan, have worked tirelessly this last year to combat the dog fouling issue in Innerleithen.Nevertheless, inevitable questions remain.Will they no longer witness the flattened deposit bearing the imprint of a shoe, the stressed parent quickly steering their child away from the offending brown mess, or irritated adult repeatedly scraping their foot off a kerb Probably not says Jackie, adding: ldquoWas it worth it  Yes.\"And in the shorter term it has made a dference.\"Longer term, my feeling is that it will depend on continuing effort and collective ownership of the problem. People have generally been very supportive although every post on social media has triggered lsquothey wonrsquot ever pick up commentsrsquo.\"Despite the campaign Jackie says itrsquos unlikely that everyone will become law abiding citizens and pick up after their dog, but says shersquod do it all again in an effort to keep clean the streets and grass verges of the bonnie town she resides in."},{"url":null,"title":"council-asked-declare-interest-planet","story":"CAMPAIGNERS descended on Thursdays meeting of Scottish Borders Council in a bid to convince the local authority to declare a Climate Emergency.So far  councils across Scotland have made the declaration as efforts continue to halt and reverse the damage being done to the planet.Despite the Extinction Rebellion protest outside the council headquarters at Newtown St Boswells, bosses have yet to issue any statement.Protestor Jennie Gibson said: \"The declaration is the first step to deal with the problem.\"It shows the council takes climate crisis seriously and so should we.\"It means they have to make plans to cut emissions and we can seethey do it or not.

the Scotland-wide pound,.Although an argument can be made regarding the additional amount of carriageway in the rural Borders, similar authorities, such as Highland, Aberdeenshire, Moray and both North and East Ayrshire, all spent considerably more.Only Dumfries and Galloway, and Eilean Siar authorities spent less during  .Scottish Borders Council also spent below the national average on every aspect of education.Across Scotland the average spend per pupil in secondary education was pound,, while in the Borders it was only pound,.Primary pupil spend in Scotland was pound,, while in the Borders during   it was pound,.And pre-school spend per pupil in the Borders was only pound, against a national average of pound,.The number of sick days taken by teachers in the Borders was also worse than the national average.While spending on frontline education is well below Scottish averages, the amount spent on office-based administration and support across the whole authority during  , at seven percent of budget, was almost double the national level of four percent.Local MSP Christine Grahame believes Scottish Borders Council should re-prioritise its spending.She told us: \"I am sure Borderers will be angry at the information coming to light from this given how clearly it demonstrates the councilrsquos deeply skewed priorities for its spending.ldquoTime and time again constituents have contacted me to complain about the frankly dangerous state of some roads in the Borders and I have repeatedly raised it with SBC.\"To now find out it has the third lowest spend per kilometre on roads in the country, and that the area has the second worst A roads and B roads is an unsuprising but damning indictment of the councilrsquos priorities.ldquoWhy is this Tory-led administration spending poundm on vanity projects like the purchase of the Lowood Estate for speculative development, whilst it underspends on our schools, tourism and helping people back to work  Why does it spends so little on economic development to bring down the  percent of shops that lie empty in our town centres ldquoThere are serious questions for SBC to answer here and I for one will certainly look to see them held to account.Investment in helping people back to work was the second lowest, at . percent, of all the  authorities in Scotland.Scottish Borders Council also spent less than half the national average when it came to economic development and tourism.Across Scotland authorities averaged pound, per , population on attracting tourists and improving the local economy, in the Borders the spend was just pound,.And the figures also show that there was a higher proportion of empty town centre propertiesin the Borders than the Scottish average .Elderly care was also ranked poorly with only  percent of council services rated as good or above - the fourth worst in all Scotland - compared to a national average of  percent.Ron Sutherland, who had a successful career in corporate governance, finance and management, has been a strong critic of spending at Newtown St Boswells in recent years.The retired consultant from Innerleithen told us: \"As those who have attempted in recent times to get to the heart of topical issues, transactions and dealings will already be aware, it is often dficult to ascertain what goes on at SBC, through the barrier of smoke and mirrors around the councils Newtown St Boswells nerve centre.\"It might be thought that senior officials - of which we evidently have many - and elected members prefer to inhabit those parts of Council HQ located away from the spotlight of public scrutiny and accountability!\"However, the Local Government Benchmarking Framework provides an excellent opportunity for outsiders to gain an insight into our local authoritys performance in comparison with other councils across the country, and indeed against those with similar characteristics to SBC.\"Revelations of shortcomings in expenditure, or investment of council taxpayers money last year in several key local authority areas of responsibility such as roads, schools and education, tourism, economic and social development, etc. are unsurprising.\"There are fewany bright spots - especially worrying when SBC allocates almost twice the national average funding to administration support, doing little to dispel impressions of a top-heavy, inefficient organisation.\"This resonates with the recent eye-wateringly costly and confused SB Cares debacle - indicative of poor planning and organisational management allied to woefully inept financial control and monitoring by those senior people charged with doing just that, and paid handsomely into the bargain.For the record in the year to March , its last full year of operation, provisional accounts for SB Cares LLP disclosed a net loss of over pound. million, with net current liabilities - effectively, accumulated insolvency - in excess of pound. million - plus an audit report casting material uncertainty and signicant doubt on the organisations viability as a going concern.,params: .push\"In most peoples book, that would read like mismanagement, which would be little short of a scandal.\"Moreover, in the four years of so of employment, the CEO of SB Cares took home more than half a million pounds for his efforts and he was also employed as an executive director of SBC, in clear contravention of relevant guidelines relating to conflict of interest.\"Will anyone be held accountable \"In a statement from Scottish Borders Council, bosses attempted to highlight the amount of money spent with local suppliers and contractors was signicantly higher than the national average.But it didnt mention that only  percent of invoices were paid on time - against a national average of  percent, making it the fth worst for paying bills in the country.Rather than being disappointed SBC Chief Executive Tracey Logan prefers to look at more locally sourced surveys.She said: ldquoThese statistics are just one element of how we regularly monitor and report the performance of the council.\"Many of these figures are not new, and in some areas we believe that some of the local data we collect, for example the Scottish Borders Household Survey and those undertaken with Live Borders customers, are more representative due to the volume of responses received.\"These show much higher levels of satisfaction with services.ldquoHowever, every piece of information on our service delivery is useful, and we will use the statistics and comparison data to look at how we can continue to change, improve and invest to provide the best possible services to the residents of the Scottish Borders.Scottish Borders Council did fare well in council tax collections and support offered for looked-after children.And it has the second highest spend of any authority, at pound, per , population, on parks and outdoor spaces, with the national average being pound,.The signicant spend is down to the investment in new parks and the additional cost of staff from other departments.Council leader Shona Haslam said: \"It is abundantly clear when you look at the full range of data released that council services are under pressure across the country, with average performance falling across many areas.ldquoIn some measures this follows long periods of improvement, suggesting that we may be reaching a tipping point in how council services are being affected by the need for us all to make savings due to the gap between the funding required to maintain and improve services and that actually available.ldquoScottish Borders Council continues to make and maintain progress in some key areas, but we have to be realistic and acknowledge that services, particularly non-statutory ones, are impacted by reductions in spending.\""},{"url":null,"title":"borders-holiday-inspires-authors-debut-novel","story":"A NEW author has set his debut novel

In the case of fully electric cars, those emissions are zero.There are plenty of electric cars to choose from. There are the self-charging hybrids. These use a combination of an engine with a battery and have the ability to run for a short while in zero emission mode. Such vehicles do not require charging by you.On the other hand, Plug-in Electric Hybrids - often abbreviated to PHEV - have an engine but feature a larger battery that can be charged from the mains or from a home charging unit. These have the ability to run emission-free for around - miles - enough for your daily commute.Finally electric cars - often called EVsor BEVs- only have a battery. They require charging from a home charging unit to run continuously in zero emission mode.Of course, technology is fast-moving. Where once a fully electric car had a range of barely  miles, todayrsquos electric cars offer in excess of  miles.So how do you stay ahead of technology without incurring huge costs and loss of value in a car One way is through car leasing. Leasing companies, such as Intelligent Car Leasing, are specialists in electric car leasing.Although you never own the car, you can lease the vehicle over ,  or even  months for regular and affordable monthly payments.At the end of each lease, you simply renew for a brand new, more technologically advanced vehicle. The process is very simple. No haggling with pushy car sales people over price no issues with selling it later on.There are certain conditions you have to be aware of - such as the carrsquos appearance and the number of miles travelled.

Despite there being more than a quarter of a million electric cars registrations in the UK between  and , many prospective buyers remain cautious.The top concern of car-buyers is the range of EVs. Of course, itrsquos true that in some of the fledgling models, range was an issue, but technology has moved on. The Nissan Leaf, for example, will drive for  miles before needing a recharge. The range is clearly displayed on the dashboard, so therersquos no danger of getting caught short. And the reality is,  per cent of journeys in the UK are shorter than  miles, so there is a high likelihood that it will meet the needs of most people.Charge times are another concern. A full charge on the Leaf takes eight hours but a quick charge will provide  per cent capacity in only half an hour. And with more and more investment being ploughed into EV infrastructure and charging points around the country, filling up the tank is becoming easier and easier every day.Speed is a popular misconception too. If when you think about an electric car, golf buggies and dodgem cars spring to mind, it might be time to think again. Far from being sluggish, modern EVs have excellent acceleration. The new Leaf can go from -mph in . seconds and has a top speed of mph. And they produce instant torque, meaning the start-stop transition is slick and immediate.Fully electric vehicles are, of course, only the tip of the iceberg for the eco-conscious, eager to get ahead of the curve on green issues. Hybrid cars have batteries which are charged up on long motorway journeys, enabling them to power shorter trips about town, saving fuel without the need to schedule trips around charging points.Hybrids are a good compromise for those who arenrsquot necessarily ready to make the full leap to electric, combining some of the benefits of EVs like lower road tax, savings on fuels and reduced carbon footprint, without taking the plunge into completely new territory.Both Macklin Motors Nissan Glasgow Central and Macklin Motors Nissan Glasgow South have gained Electric Vehicle Approved Status , so the teams there are well-equipped to advise customers about changing to an electric or hybrid vehicle.Macklin Motors Nissan Glasgow South,  Welbeck Road, Darnley, Glasgow, G SDwww.macklinmotors find-a-dealer nissan-glasgow-south Macklin Motors Nissan Glasgow Central,  Port Dundas Road, Glasgow, G HZwww.macklinmotors find-a-dealer nissan-glasgow-central ------------------------------------------------------------------------Helensburgh Toyota For Toyota, hybrid really isnrsquot anything new as they first manufactured hybrid vehicles more than  years ago.

Whether in the town or on the motorway, hybrids feel no dferent to drive than a petrol car, offering a quiet and relaxing ride and still delivers the power you need.Speaking about the increase in hybrid orders, Kirsteen McGuire, Helensburgh Toyota Sales Manager said: ldquoThe hybrid message across the car industry is finally hitting home. More and more people are making the switch to hybrid and in turn benefitting from lower tax and petrol costs. Where other car manufacturers are playing catch up, Toyota has been a trusted advocate of hybrid technology for many years. The reality is that manufacturers are moving to eventually producing only hybrid vehicles.

And then Johnson decided to ban media he doesnrsquot like from official briefings.Trump had the press by the throat from day one. It was either lick his boots, or suffer. Strongmen wannabes like to keep critics quiet. Erdogan in Turkey, Orban in Hungary ndash like Johnson, theyrsquore big Trump buddies ndash and like Trump they want a tame press.Once the press is dealt with, then itrsquos time to start tinkering with other inconveniences which check power, like judges. Johnson has hinted that the judiciary will have a price to pay for meddling in Brexit.So buckle up for a bumpy ride, while Johnson gets Brexit done.How will the Scottish Government and the SNP deal with this  Strongmen-types also like an enemy. Thatrsquos the role Johnson wants the SNP to play.Johnson is an agent of chaos. He wins by creating drama and then letting his rivals drown amid a welter of headlines as they try to figure out what the hell is going on. He causes chaos, others step in to clean up the mess, and they take the bullet for their troubles. Just ask David Cameron and Theresa May. Or cast an eye over what remains of the Labour party.The SNP may think being pitted against Johnson is good for them, but is it also good for Scotland So far, the SNPrsquos response to Johnson has been to shout \"independence\" at every opportunity. Party managers might believe this to be a great strategy ndash that it keeps passion burning in the hearts of true believers ndash but itrsquos already getting wearying.Throughout the torture of Brexit ndash in fact, in response to almost anything that ever happens at Westminster ndash itrsquos looked to the public asall the SNP does is simply shout independence.The tactic is beginning to suffer from the law of diminishing s. The more itrsquos heard, the more meaningless it becomes. And the more itrsquos shouted, the more one wondersthe party has any other ideas.Johnson knows the public in Scotland is as tired as the public where on these islands after Brexit. The idea of more endless constitutional warfare is far from appealing. Every time the SNP shouts independence at Johnson, many voters wince at the thought of more ision. Johnson also knows that all the SNP can do is shout ndash as, like it or not, he decidesand when therersquos a referendum.If the SNP continues to endlessly shout independence when we all know there wonrsquot be a referendum any time soon then it will appear not just like a grievance machine, but weak. Even worse, the SNP will look like itrsquos playing the public for fools.Endless cries of independence will also achieve little in Scotland. The Yes and No side are polling pretty evenly. Only clever, original politicking will change minds.Nicola Sturgeon has admitted there may not be another referendum until after the next Scottish elections. Everyone  knew this was the case, but to the marchers and flag-wavers, it was betrayal. You can see why ndash they were led by the nose, the mantra of independence fed to them daily. Now they feel cheated. So, the strategy of endlessly crying independence has already caused harm within the party.To many average Yes voters, the endless calls for independence are now like background static. The SNP risks becoming boring, a one-note tune that everyone knows. In modern politics, boredom means defeat. Itrsquos not that the Yes movement is boring, we expect the Yes movement to play one instrument and play it well. But with a party, you want an orchestra.Of course, the party would say that it does much more than shout about independence. True, but impressions matter, and it seems the SNP has only one word as answer to every question.The party itself is tired. Itrsquos record in government is increasingly anaemic when it comes to big domestic issues like health and schools.Perhaps, the party thinks concentrating on independence takes the focus off poor hospitals and education  Well, maybe it would,the SNP could stick to one message on independence.Therersquos constant mixed messaging. Some take pots shots at the leadership. Others are loyal. Some fancy wildcat referendums. Others donrsquot. Some say stop marching. Others wave their Saltire. Some cosy up to online bullies. Others decry them.Then lsquoexcitementrsquo around Nicola Sturgeonrsquos much-awaited speech last week on the future of independence turns anti-climactic. It was staid, managerial. She called for patience, said therersquod be no shortcuts, and urged the party to build the case for independence.Voters would be forgiven for asking whatrsquos going on  Run the country, quit bickering, and stop leading us all on. Outside the twin bubbles of politics and the press, and the echo chamber of social media, the public cares about jobs, schools, cops on the beat, and hospitals.Sturgeon also plans a Constitutional Convention and a series of papers on independence. This work needs done, but it will also add to the narrative that all the SNP talks about is independence.And whisper it, unlikely though it is, Brexit may not usher in a new Dark Age. It might go OK. It might just be a bit awful. If the cataclysm doesnrsquot appear, what does that mean for independence The one thing which will help independence  Good government. Run this country well and No voters may slowly but surely switch to Yes.Noel Dolan, Sturgeonrsquos former senior adviser, made clear yesterday that itrsquos pointless to simply demand that Johnson grants another referendum. Dolanrsquos right. The only path to another referendum is for the SNP and Labour to cut a deal in order to get the Tories out of power. The SNP supports the next Labour government, and then Labour agrees to a second independence referendum.Itrsquoll take time, but the strategy is correct: donrsquot just talk ndash do.

Unless that changes, Orkney will be left with the oldest fleet and the highest fares in the country — and that can only be described as blatant discrimination.”In a response to Councillor Stockan, the minister for energy, connectivity and the islands, Paul Wheelhouse, says Orkney Islands Council is “wholly responsible for the inter-island ferry services which they provide.”He says minsters understand the “signicant financial challenges that can fall on inidual local authorities with responsibility for ferries” and that the Government has “made clear our commitment to Orkney’s internal ferry services” with additional funding of £. million in total over the past two years.Councillor Stockan said: “I am extremely disappointed that the First Minister has chosen not to respond to our considerable concerns directly, or to meet with me to discuss an issue of fundamental importance to our community.“I can only describe the Government’s current position as irrefutable discrimination against the people of Orkney. The additional funding we received over the last two years was welcome, but fell far short of what is needed to fully fund our internal ferry service.“I call on the Government to address this when the budget is published this week — and I have asked the other parties at Holyrood to offer us their full support in securing full and fair funding for Orkney.“The running and replacement costs of Western Isles ferries are fully subsidised by the Government. It is only right and proper that we in Orkney should be treated in the same way.”In the letter, Councillor Stockan also criticises the Government for its continued failure to introduce Road Equivalent Tarf on routes linking Orkney to the Scottish Mainland.“The roll-out of RET began on West of Scotland ferry routes more than a decade ago, reducing fares for local people and visitors alike,” he added.“It is our firm belief that there is no impediment preventing RET being introduced on Orkney routes, and that any further delay is unfair and will result in signicant prejudice against local ferry users.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

And, just to be clear, it would be equally as seriousthe teenager in question had been a girl.It is likely there is cross-party agreement that the -year-old Mackay should now stand down as MSP for Renfrewshire North and West. However, Nicola Sturgeon was right when she said that “no matter how upset and shocked all of us are in these situations, there’s a need for due process”.Despite the scale of the justied outrage, the full facts need to be established in a calm and considered way. After all, there may be questions for others to answer.It has long been known that those in positions of power will sometimes abuse it, but the MeToo movement should have spelt out the full consequences to anyone failing to grasp them.Once such conduct might have been brushed under the carpet, but society has changed, considerably and for the better, in refusing to tolerate it.MSPs are the democratically elected leaders of this country and their actions must be beyond reproach. It is, or at least should be, part of their job to send a message to those in positions of power in wider society about what is and is not acceptable behaviour.And an MSP, let alone a Cabinet minister, sending scores of unsolicited messages of the type described to a -year-old is, in the words of the First Minister, “unacceptable”. This is not a party political issue, but a moral one.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"brian cox scottish independence is a case of when not if","story":"Actor Brian Cox has said Scotlands independence is a case of when not  - as he called on the SNP to change its name.Cox, , said he does not like nationalism and wishes the political party would rename it the Scottish Independence Party.: Hollywood actor Brian Cox calls for second Scottish independence referendumThe dad-of-four, who comes from a working class background, is a lelong Labour supporter, but also an advocate for Scottish independence.Cox, from Dundee, was speaking on the next series of the podcast, titled Football, Feminism and Everything in Between.: Police call for information on Derek Mackay allegations: Derek Mackay: Married SNP activist allegedly bombarded with creepy messages for years by ex Finance SecretaryHe said: \"I am an internationalist.\"It is possible for us to be independent and internationalist and I would be much happierthey were the Scottish Independence Party.\"If I felt Scotland could be an independent country in Europe, that would be my ideal now.\"The idea that this government has the faintest clue or interest in Scotland - forget it.\"Cox was speaking to podcasts hosts, Alastair Campbell, the ex-Downing Street Press Secretary, and his daughter Grace, a comedian and activist.Back in the UK briefly before filming begins for series three of hit show Succession, Cox discussed the global success of his latest TV venture.Set in New York, award winning Succession follows the Roy family who control the biggest media and entertainment company in the world.Cox plays head of the family, media tycoon Logan Roy, in the hit HBO show and despite the unscrupulous nature of the character, Cox - an ardent socialist - relishes the role.He said the show has absolutely been good for Scottish tourism, with parts filmed in Dundee, also the birthplace of Coxs fictional protagonist.Cox said: \"It was hard work though, we had to do the filming of the main scenes in the museum through the night when the place was closed.\"And I was a bit pissed off about some of the other shots - the house Loganwas supposed to have grown up in - they shot it in Glasgow.\"Dundee has very dferent stone on the houses.\"I took some of the team on a tour of the real Dundee, showed them where I was born, where I grew up.

Ms Sturgeon has insisted she’s not going anywhere in response to speculation about her future, but it would seem that justice secretary Humza Yousaf now has a clear run at the top job – should it one day become available.The immediate headache for Ms Sturgeon is who to fill the breach as new finance secretary – one of the most important and responsible roles in Government given the suite of tax new powers that are now presided over at Holyrood.Public finance minister Kate Forbes did her hopes no harm after a strong andpolished performance at Holyrood yesterday, stepping into the breach to deliver the Budget in Mr Mackay’s absence.Widely seen as a rising star of Scottish politics, she won plaudits recently from the business community after blocking unpopular plans to hand control of rates over to councils.But at  and having only become a minister a year-and-a-half ago, she may be deemed to lack the experience required for the one of the most challenging and high-profile roles in the Scottish Government.It may be that Ms Sturgeon could look to promote a junior minister such as Paul Wheelhouse, who has the energy brief, into the role or possibly sht Michael Matheson from transport.Universities minister Richard Lochhead, who has nine years of experience as a Cabinet secretary, could also be a contender. The dilemma Ms \u2028Sturgeon faces is that whoever is appointed will not just be presiding over the devolved public finances under the constitutional \u2028set-up at Holyrood.This needs to be someone who can sell the economic case for independence as the Scottish Government demands the right to hold a second referendum on leaving the UK.Mr Mackay sat on the SNP’s Growth Commission, which set out a financial blueprint for independence and had already tasked civil servants with drawing up an “alternative” to the controversial Government Expenditure and Revenue in Scotlandfigures, which set out the deficit that Scotland runs inside the UK.Mr Mackay had pledged his new paper would present the opportunities of independence.The economic argument was where the Yes campaign fell down in  and the new finance secretary will play a critical role in convincing voters that Scotland is strong enoughto go it alone economically after independencea referendum is to take place in the next year.And, of course, this shock resignation for Ms Sturgeon comes just a month before her predecessor and mentor, former first minister Alex Salmond, is scheduled to go on trial where he faces a string of sexual assault charges after ten women brought complaints against him.Salmond denies all wrongdoing.The fallout from the Mackay case, with opposition parties demanding his departure as an MSP, could well drag out over coming weeks.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"brian pendreigh remembering kirk douglas the most scottish sounding of hollywood superstars","story":"In the s, when I was a boy, I used to press my finger into my chin to replicate Kirk Douglas#s dimple. I grew up on his historical adventures and westerns, preferring his complex, flawed characters to John Wayne#s barrel-chested dimwits. I wanted the dimple and the swagger and the grand gestures. I wanted to say: #I am Spartacus#.This most Scottish-sounding of Hollywood superstars was of east European Jewish stock, but Kirk Douglas sounded more like a movie star than Issur Danielovitch. He did come to Scotland in the early s to make Catch Me a Spy. Pursued across the Highlands, he is seen fishing on Loch Awe, at the local railway station, on the Ballachulish ferry and running through a herd of Highland cattle.Years later I met him at a film festival in Palm Springs, where he lived and where there is a street called the Kirk Douglas Way. He had had a stroke a few years previous and was very frail. I would have said he had only a few months remaining. That was  years ago.Kirk was a fighter on screen and off, standing side by side with Burt Lancaster at the OK Corral and doing as much as anyone in the battle against the Hollywood “blacklist”. As producer of Spartacus he hired the blacklisted Dalton Trumbo to pen this tale of an uprising against tyranny.Ten years after I met Kirk in Calornia I went to interview a little old lady called Kay Mander over lunch in Kirkcudbrightshire. She was in her mid-s, living anonymously in a local authority bungalow, though she had been a pioneer documentary-maker during the Second World War. Suddenly out of the blue she revealed she and Kirk had been lovers.They worked together on Heroes of Telemark half a century earlier. They were both married. For her it was a big deal, but not for Kirk. “He had this awful reputation,” she said. “He flew his ladies in first class, kept them there for a long weekend, and sent them back tourist.” It was the Kirk Douglas way. And yet Kay Mander thought he was “wonderful”. Her only regret was the pain it caused her husband. “Kirk Douglas was my passion,” she said.Kirk appeared in a string of acclaimed classics – Spartacus, Ace in the Hole, Paths of Glory. He was great as Doc Holliday coughing up his lungs in Gunfight at the OK Corral. He was never the subtlest actor – John Kricfalusi, creator of the cartoon Ren and Stimpy, said: “He doesn’t just act with his face– he can act with his back. Kirk’s the only actor I’ve ever seen who can act with his back. They’ll have a shot of him from behind and you’ll see muscles twitching.”Kirk was compelling too in a string of films no one has ever heard of.I included two in my top  favourite obscure films when I edited the book The Times on Cinema. A Gunfight boiled the western down to a setpiece as Kirk faced off against Johnny Cash. You needed two iconic figures to make it work. And in The Last Sunset he was an outlaw who turns up on the doorstep of an old flame and discovers she has a husband and a grown-up daughter. He falls in love with the daughter, only to discover he is her father – Greek tragedy in Wild West clothing.He could do dark. But he could also do light. He put everything into acting and into le. He was a charmer, a fighter, a legend and it seemed like he would go on forever. There was never a time he was not in my le. I was in the pub on Wednesday night enjoying a pint or two with my mate Niall and telling him Kirk was now . “I thought he was dead,” said Niall. It must have been right about that time that he did finally pass away. A few hours later I was looking at the news online and there it was – Kirk Douglas was dead.I still have the dimple and the memories, but in that headline a little part of me died too.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"nafc pair shortlisted in national lantra finals ","story":"Valentina Romano and Jimmy Dakin are in the running for the Lantra Scotland awards.Jimmy Dakin from Sanday in Orkney has been shortlisted as Aquaculture Learner of the Year.

I already knew that the library held old copies of newspapers from previous research but I was unaware of the sheer volume of information available, and the fact that the library holds documents dating back to the early s.The open day allowed members of the public to come in, ask questions, get to know the department and find out how to use the resources to discover their family history and also the story of Ballymena‘ was like years ago’s growth as a town.The Heritage Collection will mean dferent things to dferent people. Some will have a purpose for their search, such as finding a long lost relative or tracing a map of their home area from years gone by. Others will simply visit and get lost in the vast records, pictures and resources on offer.As a bit of a history buff, I was transported back to my university and school days as Daniel Brown, the senior library assistant for the Heritage Department spoke of some of the hidden treasures within the library.He said past records of the old workhouse are available, giving an extraordinary insight into who was actually in the dreaded facility down through the years, and also into the meetings held by some of the officers.We have artefacts dating back hundreds of years. Some are very valuable to us today, such as a complete map of the original Adair estate from  as much can be learned from this. We also have lots of interesting memorabilia including war rationing books and images of the Queens visit to Ballymena after her coronation.Daniel, who has a personal interest in history, really enjoys showing people around the department, whether they be locals or from further afield.He told me: Weve had many tourists come in, especially Americans who are keen to learn more about their ancestry and research old family names. Its interesting looking back and helping people discover where they come from!You can also trace old church history through births, deaths and marriages, communion and membership rolls and even church offerings.It was down this path that I met Mary Carson and Anne McCaughey as they browsed through the pew rental records of Buckna Presbyterian Church dating back to .Both ladies are members of the Broughshane History Society and were looking through the old records searching for ious recognisable names, however their inidual interest in local and family history was not hard to see.Mary spoke about tracing her family tree and how her curiosity was fuelled by seeing two old pictures of her grandparents at her aunt’s house.She followed rthe trail to a local heritage collection where she was able to find out through old newspapers that her grandfather’s death had made front page news many years before.Her search also revealed that a family member she always believed to be her uncle actually turned out to be her cousin!Researching and delving into the past is so interesting in my opinion, and can also be rewarding, Mary told me. I have found out that Im related to, so many people I didnt know about.Anne agreed, and was full of praise for the resources available in the library. She recalled happy times of listening to older family members talk about the past but said it is often not like that today.Today the younger generation dont seem to be as interested. They are busy working on phones or listening to their earphones that they dont seem to care whats going on around them or what has went before, so they are going to have to depend on information and places like this library to trace their past.As I left them to their church history search, my eyes were drawn to the vast arrays of cases containing maps along a wall.Here there are ordnance survey maps from the s right up to the s. There are also Grfith valuation maps for Co. Antrim and Co. Londonderry as well as th century town plans and local government maps - it really is a local history lovers dream!There are far too many resources to list, but some that need a mention include the vast photograph collection from around Co. Antrim as well as multiple information packs on local schools, people and places all arranged by location and subject.Two of the special collections housed in Ballymena library is the Langford Lodge Collection and the  census for parishes in Co. Antrim.The Collection Officer for the library is Maria Diamond, who is always on hand to direct the public to what they are looking for.She was keen to point out the many online resources made available by the library, so as your search doesnt have to end when you go home!Family history and researching your ancestry has really taken off in the last few years, Maria told me.Therefore we have listed many online resources that can help people trace their history in their own time, or when the library may be closed.Maria enjoys her job, and said she has noticed an increase in the number of people using the department.We are generally a busy department, and we try to always be on hand to help guide people to their desired field of study.“We also enjoy welcoming groups and school classes to the Heritage Collection and tailor the activities to their age or field of study. We have lots of resources for children, and a wealth of information on the local area and how it was affected during major events in history, such as the two world wars or the famine. Teachers or groups just need to get in touch to arrange a visit.I was thoroughly impressed by my visit to the local studies department.Yes, I knew alot of information was available, however I was overwhelmed by the sheer volume of resources, how far back it dated and the way in which it was displayed.No matter what period you are interested in, or what local area there is sure to be some information that will aid your study.My visit to the Cultural heritage open day may have been for business, but my next visit to discover Ballymena of old will more than likely be for pleasure!

He attended St Mary’s Primary School in Portglenone and St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena.Speaking about his early involvement in music, he said: My parents didn’t play but they sent all of us to music and dancing for years and drove us to lessons and events every night of the week, I owe them a lot for that. They had a keen interest and were very supportive.I was sent to the local Comhaltas Ceoltoacuteiriacute Eacuteireannbranch in Portglenone when I was around .I started tin whistle classes with the late John Kennedy first, then progressed onto the button accordion with Tommy Doherty.My parents then started taking us to The Crosskey’s Inn every week for sessions and I also joined the Comahltas branch there too.That place had a huge effect on me, there were great musicians there of all ages and they really helped cultivate my interest growing up. I still go there when I can.As part of the Crosskeys Comhaltas we won many All-Irelands. We had a great gang at the time along with dedicated parents that were also passionate about the music.Going to the Fleadhs was as much about socialising with other kids in music as it was competing. We got up to all sorts of ilment that I won’t get into here!I started on the tin whistle, moved to button accordion then started to teach myself guitar when I was . I quickly became obsessed with the guitar.Its such a versatile instrument and one that you can literally play or learn any style of music on.From playing the guitar I was able to give a few other stringed instruments a go - bouzouki, tenor guitar, bass, electric guitar.Its not a big stretch to adapt the same skills on guitar over to other instruments, and its nice to have dferent colours available, especially when writing.Sometimes I write on the piano - because I’m not great at playing piano, you’re forced to think dferently and that can work in your favour.In terms of my influences, for the accordion it would be Mairtin OConnor or Dermot Byrne. For the guitar, its harder to narrow it down, but three that stand out are Arty Mc Glynn, Steve Cooney and John Doyle. My own style is probably some hybrid mix of those three.I have worked with Grammy nominated fiddler Liz Carroll, folk singer Karan Casey, Duke Special, Liam O’Maonlaiand Bela Fleck.I am involved with ‘Ulaid’ with John Mc Sherry and Donal O’Connor, and Scottish group ‘Fiddlers Bid’. As a guitar player I regularly work with a lot of other traditional bands including Lunasa, Flook, Buille, and the Mairtin O’Connor Band.BEOGABeoga was formed while Seaacuten was a pupil at St Louis Grammar School.He continued: At St Louis, I was involved with the Traditional Group the whole time I was there.Frank Cassidy directed it and was always very encouraging. We competed in ‘Slogadh’ competitionsand had great craic travelling around to the dferent competitions.Beoga was formed around this time and the teachers were very understanding about me missing days here and there to play gigs.I used to go to the States for these long weekends and be catching up on school work on the plane home.Whilst at St Louis I never actually studied music as an option. I didn’t have a classical background and for some reason never thought it would be a viable career option!Whilst studying for my A levels, I started to become really obsessed with music and decided that was it - I couldn’t even think about doing anything .Up until that point I was looking at careers in IT. I heard about a new course in University of Limerick offering a degree in Irish music, that didn’t require A level music, you just had to go for an interview and perform.I got in anyway and I met Niamh there. We were in the same class and became big pals and she ended up joining the band.She’s an amazing fiddle player and singer and I’m lucky to have found her!ED SHEERANBeoga have been together for around  years and they have been afforded the opportunity to travel the world doing what they love.Seaacuten said: We’ve toured a lot around Europe and North America but have also been lucky to tour in more exotic places like Japan, Australia and Russia. We’re travelling a bit less now, thankfully, but at one stage I was definitely seeing more of the band than my own family.One of the biggest audiences the band have performed to was a , strong crowd at the Glastonbury festival in  alongside Ed Sheeran.Sheeran, whose grandparents hail from the Emerald Isle, is well-known for his love of Irish traditional and folk music, even recording a version of The Parting Glass.He has said that one of his earliest musical memories is listening to the Irish Heartbeat album by Van Morrison and The Chieftains and he is also a fan of The Bothy Band and Planxty. Close friend of the band, Foy Vance, shares the same record label as Sheeran and had been supporting him on tour. They had listened to a few of Beogas tunes on the road, and Ed reached out to the band to help with his album.Seaacuten explained: We went to over to his house in Suffolk for a couple of days. It was all very relaxed, he made everyone feel completely at ease.The weather was amazing so we were outside in the garden a lot. We played on four tracks and two made it to the album so we’re delighted.One of them, ‘Galway Girl’, came about just jamming in the garden outside the studio. He was completely sound, we stayed in his house and had a few beers and even played a game of football at one stage.Working with Ed has presented a lot of new opportunities to play and write with other artists.Our friend Foy Vance was the guy responsible for introducing us to Ed. We’ve written a good few songs with Foy now and will hopefully keep creating more with him, he’s an amazing singer and an even more amazing songwriter and is finally being recognised as such.We’ve also worked with Johnny McDaid on the songwriting and production side of things, although he’s been crazy busy since Snow Patrol started touring again.Just recently we’ve been writing a bit with Cormac Neeson from ‘The Answer’. The collaborations are really exciting to me, you just don’t know whats going to come out of a writing session but that buzz of finishing the day with a song is a real high.Seaacuten believes there is a great local traditional music scene stating: I think traditional music is stronger than ever.He encourages all age groups to get involved and give it a try, commenting: If I had any advice, it would be to not to get too worked up about competitions and instead focus more on the social side of the music.While competitions can be good to focus on something, it can put a lot of unnecessary pressure on kids.In his rare free time, Seaacuten has a purpose built recording studio in Portglenone called Bannview Studios.He has been recording for about  years and recently moved into his current space about five years ago.He said:I regularly engineer and produce other artists here, so that keeps me busy outside of the bands schedule.Beoga will be releasing a new album in the Spring. It will include singles released over the last few months along with some new songs and instrumentals that the group have been working on over the last year.Beogas latest release is called ‘Make a Mark’ and features Co. Down singer Ryan Mc Mullan.

I’ve written about music and been to a lot of concerts over the years. The list below is typical of the tracks that stand out in my memory. I haven’t mentioned the Small Faces or Bruce Springsteen, SLF or other old favourites. I like to hear a lot of contemporary music too. Starchild and the New Romantic for example - a NY soulster I came across last week. Locally, Brand New Friend from Castlerock, are an outstanding punk pop sound. Anyway, here goes…!. Town Called Malice - The Jam. Laser eyed social poetry from Weller, tight Tamla baseline from Foxton and finger clicking rhythm from Buckler. Classic mod. . The Highest Apple - Runrig. Spiritual Scots Gaelic song. Our wedding dance, along with Van the Man of course,  years ago. . This Beautul Day - Levi Jackson. I used to be a Northern Soul DJ and had quite a collection of original vinyl singles. I love the genre still. This track has it all: dance, clear gospel uplt, a black civil rights cry for hope. It’s worth hundreds. I once tried to buy it on eBay behind my we’s back. Thankfully the bid didn’t make it. Confession is good for the soul. . Kennedy - The Wedding Present. Indie student guitar based noise. Great band live from the late s. Still going. Much the same as Copper Blue by Sugar - another favorite indie band.. Live Forever - Oasis. Slightly later and closer to the football culture of which I was a part in my youth. I interviewed them twice for music fanzines before they were famous. Influenced greatly by the Stone Roses - another favourite band. . At Least That’s What You Said - Wilco. Existential American alternative musings. Another great band live. Profound sentiments from Jeff Tweedy.. So Danco Samba - Stan Getz. Much into jazz as I’ve aged. I love Mile Davis up to the late s. This track is gentle samba. Relaxing.. Prelude to Cello Solo No.  in G Major- Pierre Fournier. One of the most moving pieces of music I’ve ever heard. I feel unworthy when I hear it. It touches the eternal. . In the Hours - Emily Deloach, Incredible Grace. I listen to Christian praise a lot, it comes with the calling. This track oozes gratitude for the Gospel. Always make me thankful. I love City Alight songs and a Presbyterian praise group called Red Mountain.. Dig a Little Deeper - The Watson Twins. Smoky, sultry, southern Americana. Played this song driving through mid State Tennessee last year. Right song in the right place. Something like Lucinda Williams or Gillian Welch.

They’ve carried a Lambeg drum up to the top of Ben Nevis and cycled from John O’Groats to Landsend with a Lambeg on the back of a bike. “They also did the four peaks of the UK in four days, and walked the route of King Billy from the south of England to Carrickfergus and down to the Boyne, also bringing the Lambeg.”Banbridge Orange Hall is home to several dferent lodges including LOL  and LOL  of which Stuart is a member. “This time it will be our lodge that’s doing Kilimanjaro though we won’t be bringing a Lambeg – it’s going to be hard enough as it is,” he continued. “It’s a follow up to the Walk of Remembrance when we walked  miles from Thiepval Memorial to Menin Gate.”The -year-old added: “It was my idea to climb Killimanjaro.

There’s a big build to allow us to pay for it, the cost of the trip is coming out of each person’s pocket so that every penny raised is going to the charity.

During treatment for the condition, she developed the rare le threatening condition necrotizing fasciitis, also known as the flesh eating disease, resulting in surgeons removing large parts of the soft tissue in her face.Despite the trauma, Janine survived but her story made local headlines back in February  when she approached the North Belfast News for help after suffering abuse on the street and online because of the way she looks.In a heartbreaking interview, she revealed that she’d had to start wearing earphones when she left the house to block out the abuse and insults she was receiving from young people.

He has alerted the relevant authorities. The site is just yards from the St Gall’s GAC clubrooms. Belfast City Council waste bags, household fridges, cemetery headstones, construction rubble, wood and huge amounts of other waste have een dumped on to the land and the massive mound is sliding close to the Ballymurphy Stream.The land is known as Milltown Glen and is situated between Maguire’s Garage, Milltown Cemetery and the Bog Meadows.Michael Culbert of St Gall’s GAC said that the issue of land ownership needs to be claried. “There is a gateway that runs from Milltown Cemetery, a lane, and it’s that land that is being dumped on,” he said. “We want a clean environment, we care about the environment. We have all age groups at St Gall’s, from six-year-olds up and have been in this area for approximately  years. We have never seen the like of this. This is a beautul glen, you have the Bog Meadows and here it’s the epitome of fly tipping. This is going on in the heart of West Belfast and it’s not on. We need someone with responsibility to hold whoever is doing this to account for the contamination of this area. We don’t want the river polluted.“It needs to stop and it needs to be cleared up and now our local councillor Steven Corr has taken up this issue.”Ulster Wildle Nature Reserve Officer Deborah McLaughlin told the Andersonstown News that the dumping has got worse since the start of the New Year.“This is an absolute eyesore and I have contact DAERAin relation to it as a lot of the rubbish will end up in the stream,” she said. “We are concerned at the level of fly tipping going on and concerned for health and safety. DAERA are aware of the issue and at the minute we are waiting to hear back from them.”Local Sinn Féin Councillor Steven Corr said the illegal dumping is “destroying the landscape”.“What we are seeing is a localised environmental nightmare,” he went on. “We are only a few feet away from this stream being contaminated. I can’t get my head around why somebody thinks it’s ok to do this. There are lorry loads of rubbish being dumped down a riverbank, killing wildle as it goes. I’ve never seen anything like this, on this scale, in West Belfast. This is fly tipping on an industrial scale, there is industrial waste on the site, glass, headstones. There is confusion as to who is responsible for the land but we would be calling on the Rivers Agency and the NIEAto work with us. Belfast City Council have offered support as their bags are also being dumped on the site. This land needs to be secured as a matter of urgency.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"martin rings the bell for the final time","story":"THE beginning of February will mark the start of spring and change for one West Belfast primary school principal as he prepares to retire.Holy Child Primary School principal Martin Short, himself a past pupil of the Andersonstown school, will hear the bell ring for the last time this week as he calls an end to the role that he has held for the past  years.“I started at Holy Child in September , I’m a local guy, came from Slemish Way, my three brothers came here, my sister went here, my three grandchildren are at the school now,” he said.“For me to think back then that I’d be the Principal of the school, it never crossed my mind but I’m so proud.”Martin told the Andersonstown News that he always wanted to teach.“I got that from the teaching and education I received at Holy Child, at St Mary’s Grammar School. The expectations in Holy Child are as high as anywhere  in Belfast and that has continued on.”Martin said that there were many moments throughout his career at Holy Child that stand out.“Our standards in literacy and numeracy, I’m very, very proud of those. We received an exceptionally good inspection report in  where there were no areas for improvement.“I took great pride in the whole business of ‘opening up the school’, so that the children could come in earlier for breakfast club, afterschools clubs. I’ve enjoyed working with our parents and the links our school has with the local post primaries in the area.“I think I’ve improved the fabric of the building. I fought to get the new windows installed and the final jigsaw of that project will be completed next month with the new windows in the foyer. We had a new roof, new heating system.“We won the big Gaelic Raffo Cup last year which was a great achievement, our shows, our choir, I’ve always been very proud of the strong links with St Agnes’ parish.”Martin spoke of the challenges he faced as school head.“The big challenge was finance. Budgetary constraints. Also the complexities of the special educational needs that children now encounter and the school having to meet those needs, was a massive challenge – all the while not getting enough funding. The big challenge of mental health within children and the influence of social media. We were three years without an Executive, with no direction from the department and that was a challenge for the school.”While not sailing around the world or taking up golf as part of his retirement plans, Martin explained that he will still be assisting and helping other schools through advisory work with CCMS.“I’ll be onhand to tell people to basically not make the same mistakes I’ve made, we all make mistakes what about trying this, try that and don’t be worrying about that too much.“I have a photo in my office from when I was here as a child, it has always reminded me to keep my feet on the ground and that the children are the most important thing.”When it comes to not pulling into the Holy Child car park next week, Martin said it will be a time of “mixed emotions”.“I will be very sad to leave the children, to leave the staff, the staff have been brilliant, the parents have been brilliant and I will miss that. I’ve done two ‘cycles of seven’,  years but I will be in and out of the school. I’m emotionally attached to this building, I’ve been here since I was four and I’m  now. I’ve loved every minute of it.”"},{"url":null,"title":"continuity ira blamed for brexit day ferry bomb plot","story":"Police searched  vehicles in bid to find deadly device which was located in Co ArmaghExpand\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming c .ece AUTOCROP wh Belfast_Ports.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming c .ece AUTOCROP wh Belfast_Ports.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming c .ece AUTOCROP wh Belfast_Ports.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming c .ece AUTOCROP wh Belfast_Ports.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"ExpandPreviousNext\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClosePSNI pictured in the area of Silverwood Industrial Estate in Lurgan on Thursday.

There was a police response in relation to that, ACC Clarke said.I strongly condemn the actions of those who placed a bomb on a heavy goods vehicle in Lurgan.

David , his we Claireand first daughter Emilyhad just ed from their holidays, but a routine scan sparked the start of their heartbreak.The midwe measured Claire#s bump and thought it was too large - she was measuring  weeks when she was only  weeks pregnant.A consultant outpatient appointment revealed there was a lot of fluid around the baby and Claire was sent to the Royal Jubilee Maternity Hospital in Belfast where she was diagnosed with a condition called Fetal Hydrops - a symptom which indicates another problem. However, tests came back clear and that weekend Claire went into labour and had to have an emergency section.David said the medical staff were fantastic but he sadly knew his little girl wasn#t going to survive.Rachel wasn#t responding to treatment and the couple treasure the precious time they spent with her before she passed away.David said: She died in Claire#s arms surrounded by her family.

I remember when Emily was born she screamed and cried and I knew in that silence, that complete silence, that it wasn#t going to work.It was here the family first encountered the charity Sands, when they provided a memory box when Rachel died, which included a little blanket, teddy bear and a camera.Sands NI is part of the UK charity which supports anyone affected by the death of a baby, and works in partnership with health professionals to try to ensure that bereaved parents and families receive the best possible care.It also funds research to help reduce the numbers of babies dying. Now, in memory of Rachel in her th birthday year, David is taking part in  cycling challenges to raise money for the charity.He recalled one of the hardest things was their journey home without their baby.When we brought Emily home it was a brilliant, exciting time, whereas when we were coming home the second time around, it was so much more tragic, we were just walking in ourselves and not with Rachel.The couple found comfort in going to the Sands NI support group, where they could share, listen, cry or just sit with other parents in similar situations.You are effectively sharing with people that have experienced similar losses and who really understand.Claire continued to go and she#s now a leader and takes the Sands NI support group in Antrim. She#s also on the Sands NI committee. For us, it#s been about giving something back.The family, who live in Doagh, Co Antrim, make sure they talk about Rachel and remember her as part of the family. And the loss of their child makes them appreciate their other daughters Emily and Naomiall the more.We don#t dwell on the sadness, it#s more a positive mindset that we had her for that short period of time but she had such an impact in terms of the good, David added. It#s still tough at times, but we try to be positive in a negative situation.He also drew comfort from seeing how much of an impact the Sands NI meetings had on his we, who also suffered a dficult birth with their third child Naomi.And for any parents that are going through the devastating death of their baby, David urges them to remember that it#s okay to talk about their child.David, who has started training for his gruelling cycle challenge at the end of March, added: It depends on your personal beliefs. I believe that I#ll see Rachel one day again, which is massively important to me. There is something, it#s almost like a stigma, the loss of a baby is so dficult to talk about.It#s worsepeople ignore it, that#s harder, because it#s almost like she didn#t exist and we know that she did.To donate visit: https:www.justgiving fundraising  david-charlesBelfast ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadGoogling the changes in Belfast as images show cityscape transformation in  yearsPaul Quinn murder: Sammy Wilson calls for Sinn Fein to do #decent thing# and sack Conor MurphyFormer Sinn Fein MLA Francie Brolly dies Coronavirus: Northern Ireland hospital was on #lockdown# as baby testedGarda want to quiz Conor Murphy over murder denial by IRA,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleTravelSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Over the decade-and-a-half, the industrial and shipbuilding legacy that once dominated the space within the city centre has gradually been stripped away, as commercial and tourism industries shape the planning and development of Belfast.While some of the most dramatic changes over the years have been the development of the docks in the city, there have also been signicant alterations to the Cathedral Quarter, Victoria Square and the Ulster University site among others.Clare Mulholland is a professor at the Queen#s University School of Natural and Built Environment. She explained that the pace of change in such a short period of time can be traced to a number of factors including the de-industrialisation of the city and the legacy of the Troubles.Since the Good Friday Agreement and in the last  to  years there has been huge changes in the city, but obviously the urban environment particularly, she explained.The city centre has become a shared space. The best comparison for the development of Belfast would maybe best be to somewhere like Sheffield and Bristol.Ours was more pronounced though because it was people fleeing the city and living where. The urban environment of Belfast changed because of the Troubles.The regeneration of the Cathedral Quarter changed what was previously a very local area into a vibrant part of the city.What can happen with those larger scale developments is that they have great potential to act as a catalyst in the community.While bright new buildings and hotels have popped up, Professor Mulholland does strike a cautionary note about the importance of adequate connection and ensuring Belfast meets future challenges, particularly around climate change. Going forward, she believes we should have an eye on how to ensure the city is sustainable.It depends on careful city planning to make sure the infrastructure is there, she added. There has to be a focus on building a connected city. One that is accessible, particularly by walking and cycling routes.One thing which could be really exciting for Belfast is Stormont declaring a climate emergency, which creates a focus on what is good for this city.I am a big believer that Belfast could be one of the most beautul cities in the world. It is a really beautul size in terms of everything being in walking distance. It has that potential to harness.Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.RegisterAlready have an account Log in  Belfast ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadGoogling the changes in Belfast as images show cityscape transformation in  yearsPaul Quinn murder: Sammy Wilson calls for Sinn Fein to do #decent thing# and sack Conor MurphyFormer Sinn Fein MLA Francie Brolly dies Coronavirus: Northern Ireland hospital was on #lockdown# as baby testedGarda want to quiz Conor Murphy over murder denial by IRA,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleTravelSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

There are two sides to every story and we#re working to find a point in the middle.High street pharmacists have claimed they are on the point of collapse - and even losing money when they dispense medication.Some pharmacists are missing medical appointments or discharging themselves from hospital against their doctors# advice because they cannot afford to pay for cover while they are ill.Gerard Greene, chief executive of Community Pharmacy Northern Ireland , said: Of course we#re disappointed at Mr Pengelly#s comments.We#re aware that funding of community pharmacy has been the subject of much debate over the last  years, which is why the Department of Health was asked by the courts to carry out an analysis of what it costs to run the service.The subsequent PwC report identied the cost of the service and the shortfall.This was further backed up by the recent Northern Ireland Affairs Committee review, which also stated that community pharmacy here is underfunded.We understand that there are a lot of competing pressures in the health service, but Mr Pengelly has described it as a fantastic resource, he said. Under the transformation agenda, more work is being shted left into the community, but the funding has to follow and that isn#t happening at the moment. As it stands, community pharmacists are dispensing medication at a loss, pharmaceutical wholesalers have even warned the Department of Health that community pharmacists are finding it increasingly dficult to pay for medication.Obviously,the supply of medication is impacted, this will impact on the supply to patients and there is the risk that patients will go without their medication.This then results in unplanned attendances at emergency departments and people needing to see their GP and we know GP and emergency services are already under massive pressure.Mr Greene said CPNI is seeking a meeting with Health Minister Robin Swann to impress on him the importance of adequate funding for the service.The situation we are in is serious, we have an increasing workload, funding isn#t sufficient and we have a workforce crisis as well, he said. There are already concerns about the supply of medicines with Brexit, so we need to ensure the stability of the service in the coming months.Belfast ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadGoogling the changes in Belfast as images show cityscape transformation in  yearsPaul Quinn murder: Sammy Wilson calls for Sinn Fein to do #decent thing# and sack Conor MurphyFormer Sinn Fein MLA Francie Brolly dies Coronavirus: Northern Ireland hospital was on #lockdown# as baby testedGarda want to quiz Conor Murphy over murder denial by IRA,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleTravelSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

After receiving information of a possible device police searched some  vehicles in a wide-ranging search operation before making the discovery.The report of the potential device was first made on Friday, January  - the day the UK left the EU.On Wednesday, police were criticised by Ulster Unionist MLA Doug Beattie for not releasing more information about the bomb after businesses within Silverwood Industrial Estate in Lurgan were evacuated after the discovery and while the device was made safe.Sinn Fein MLA Gerry Kelly said the device could have caused a catastrophic loss of le after attending a policing board meeting in Belfast on Thursday.Details of the find were not released until Wednesday afternoon but Detective Superintendent Sean Wright, from the PSNI’s Terrorism Investigation Unit, explained on Thursday that a search in Belfast docks on Friday occurred after police were told that an explosive device loaded on a lorry, was bound for Scotland.However, after searching the docks area and working with a ferry company, Belfast harbour authorities and Police Scotland, they found nothing as the ferry sailed and arrived safely in Scotland.On Monday police received a further report that the explosive device was attached to a lorry belonging to a “named haulage company”.“This more detailed information enabled police to conduct focused investigations with the haulage company,” continued Detective Superintendent Wright. “Working throughout the evening of Monday, February , and Tuesday, February , police and the haulage company eliminated in the region of  vehicles in order to locate the explosive device. “The device was subsequently found attached to a heavy goods vehicle in the Silverwood Industrial Estate.

However, they also recognise that they don#t develop the relevant social skills they will need in later le.East Belfast-based Mr Wilson said he dealt with youths from across the city, from both comfortable and underprivileged backgrounds.Young people have been coming here for the last four years from everywhere and they#re all presenting with the same issues, he explained.Their self-worth is very low and they have no confidence. Some of the youngsters I meet haven#t spoken to another human being for months because they#ve become so isolated.Loneliness has become a much bigger issue today than it ever has been. The main problem is that now everything is done online. Kids order food online, they can do their benefits online and they have friends online. Often, interaction with other people just doesn#t happen. It#s a huge problem - and it#s getting worse. Among Nisra#s key findings was that approximately one in every  adults in Northern Ireland reported feeling lonely always or often.It also emerged that women were more likely to be more often lonely than men. The group most likely to feel more often lonely, on .%, was people whose partners had died.Meanwhile, approximately two-thirdsof respondents who described their general health as bad or very bad felt more often lonely. In comparison, just over a fthof those who said they were in very good health felt the same.Eddie Lynch, the Commissioner for Older People in Northern Ireland, said that Nisra#s latest figures reinforce the loneliness epidemic that older people are facing.

In addition, , people are waiting to access psychological therapies. No patient is supposed to wait longer than thirteen weeks, however,  have done so - the longest wait recorded  weeks. It was recently announced that the Stormont executive is to set up a new working group on mental wellbeing and resilience. googletag.cmd.push It is the first time that the executive has collectively demonstrated determination and unity to tackle mental health issues including suicide.

Within a day it had , members and less than a week later it has amassed over ,. Built in the s, Creggan is one of Derry’s best-known estates. It has been home to an abundance of artistic and sporting talent, including Olympic athletes, a Eurovision winner, a Top Ten rock band and international footballers. googletag.cmd.push In the late s and early s, Creggan became a byword for political resistance all over the world. On the Memories of Creggan Facebook page, people have been sharing cherished photos of relatives, historically signicant portraits of the Troubles, images of friends playing on the street, tales of famed characters from the estate, all sorts of myths and legends true and untrue, and everything in between. Former Creggan residents who have emigrated all over the world, including those from America and Australia, have joined the page to reminisce and share old tales from their childhood. “Everybody is enjoying it,” Tony explained, “they’re all sharing old memories.” googletag.cmd.push Friends contacted Tony to tell him that they can’t get their mothers off the page, one of the ladies is -years-old and is “loving all the old photos so much”. He added: “They’ve said they’re getting no housework done and no wains are being watched because they’re all too busy on the page. People are talking about their schooldays and friends who haven’t been in touch for many years are reconnecting.”  Memories Tony spent most of his childhood in Creggan and lived there until he got married at the age of . His brother, Peggy, still lives in Creggan and Tony has happy memories of “great neighbours and friends”. “The page brings back good memories. Nobody had anything but everybody shared what they had with each other.” The Troubles were never far from peoples’ minds, and people had their own troubles, but Tony prefers to recall the joyful times. “There was a lot of heartbreak at that time. But I like to remember all the positive experiences I had growing up. Playing football in the street all day when there were barely any cars around. “I remember the first TV on the street, it was the Kennedy’s and we used to go in to watch the FA Cup final. I also remember watching Popeye and the Lone Ranger. “I had a bad leg at one time and I remember a friend of mines carrying me to Grianan Fort and back again.” Moving forward, Tony would simply like to see people use the page in a positive way. “There are no real rules, we’re just asking people to keep it clean and to refrain from any insults. “Everyone is finding it funny going through all the old photos and that’s what it’s all about.” With that said Tony was off to the attic to unearth a few more boxes of photographic treasures from his boyhood.  ‘Heroes’ Peggy McCourt has lived in Creggan Heights for sixty-two years, asked what the estate means to him, he proclaimed: “Creggan means community.” He explained: “It was tight-knit no one had very much but what they had they shared be it a cup of milk to a drop of sugar, or can you lend me ma three slices of bread. “We all grew up in the Creggan, most of the families came from the Springtown Camp so hardship was a way of le but they made sure their wains were fed and watered, even going without themselves. “Then came the civil rights movement, then a full-blown war on the streets but again the Creggan community rallied around those who were affected by the conflict. “So many young people were first interned just because they were Catholic, many were arrested, put though interrogation centres and ended up in prison.” Peggy continued: “The hunger strikes took their toll on many families but no matter what went on Creggan grew into the best estate in Derry – in the world. “Growing up was hard at the time we lost so many friends and family members but it was a fun place to grow up, friendships formed that still last to this day. The friends I had sixty odd years ago are as strong as when we first met.  “No video games, all street games, football, rounders, even cricket, hopscotch, all these plus many more sitting out till  or  telling ghost stories, then you ran home the living day lights scared out of you. “Creggan is more than a council estate, its a way of le, its in your blood, we don’t even have to look anywhere for heroes, Creggan is full of them they are called ma’s and da’s.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

With  minutes gone in the second-half Claudy led by a point. With their defence beginning to get the upper hand the momentum was turning in their favour. Then everything changed. The Claudy bench asked referee Mickey McCarron for clarication on the scoreline. The reported - to - was instantly changed on the scoreboard to the officials - to -, in the Monaghan sides favour. googletag.cmd.push The winning margin was more than the two point swing and there was ample time for the Derry men to recover but the remaining theme of the story was of uncertainty. The young Claudy players lost their focus at a critical conjuncture and by the time Matthew Marrons nd minute penalty hit the net, their grip on the cup was almost gone. After the game, Brian Rainey hailed his sides spirit and although they battled back against the odds. For the most part, it was a terric contest between two well matched teams but Claudy will always look back on this game with regret. They will ponder how the game wouldve panned out had the score not been changed during their spell of dominance. googletag.cmd.push When you have team of young lads fighting for every inch of the game, they look up at the scoreboard and they have been docked two points, it is hard for those young cubs to take, Rainey commented after the game. Still, they battled on and still they gave everything. Unfortunately, that decision, which wasnt explained - I dont know how it happened or how it came about - I am just very frustrated that something like that can affect the game in such a way. Claudy carried the underdogs tag but a ninth minute goal from Niall McGonagle gave them the perfect confidence boost. Oisin Kearns-Madden won a kick-out and it was Tiarnan OConnors high ball that found McGonagle on the edge of the square before he slotted home. Matthew Marron, who finished with -, notched two early Blayney points but it was Claudy who held the upper hand and were full value for their - to - lead after  minutes. A mark, called by referee McCarron, saw Niall Rice reply for the Monaghan men who swtly scored again after McGonagle spilled a kick-out and Joseph McMahon passed to Rice for another score. An energised Castleblayney side were level though Marron before centre-back Liam Martin put them into the lead for the first time after  minutes. However, it was Claudy who finished the half strongly. McGonagle, who played at midfield for the second quarter, floated a perfect ball to OConnor who cleverly snaked inside the Blayney cover before firing to the roof of the net, helping his side go in at the break - to - ahead. Like he did at the start of the first-half, OConnor won the breaking ball from the throw-in but Claudys move broke down. It was Blayney who hit the first two scores of the second-half, from Rice and Marron. A touch of McGonagle magic from an acute angle saw him squeeze over a point before the Monaghan men hit the net. Dylan McKenna made the catch at midfield and at the end of the move, Rice raced clear. Despite the clutches of Ben Cooke, he blasted to the net, giving goalkeeper McCormick no chance. In the next play, Claudy almost found the net and couldve had a penalty. Adam Murphy passed to Niall Barr who squared the ball for the in-rushing Keelin Hasson who was impeded by goalkeeper McCully in the goalmouth. Play continued before Claudy were awarded a free in and Hasson was replaced with a head injury. McGonagles free tied the game once again. The Dungiven man then slotted over the bar, with a hint of goal on, and Claudy were back in the lead. Or so they thought. After the score was changed, Claudy were shell-shocked and Castleblayney took full advantage. Marron slotted home a penalty, with defenders Nathan and Zachary McArdle chipping in with points. McGonagle had a close range free blocked by a wall of Blayney players and OConnor saw a late shot blocked by keeper McCully as the brave Claudy fightback came up short.

Born and raised in Derry until the age of , I always had a calling for adventure and opportunity, and it was at this stage in my le I took a huge leap of faith and went in chase of the American Dream. A little Irish girl lost in the big city of New York awaiting my immigration papers is where I learned so many le lessons and character building. At the age of  I stumbled upon a movie The Secret which would eventually change my le and my direction. googletag.cmd.push This movie for me was a beginning, an awakeningyou will. I had opened my eyes to a whole new world of self-belief, ambitions and possibilities. At the age of  I opened my first business which was a Health Care Call Centre. Alongside this I worked for a healthcare administration business which was family run and set up by my mother in New York. Whilst I found great business acumen and skillset in my work, it took its toll on me. The corporate pace and stress fuelled environment was not my fit so I sold my shares in the family business and sold my own business. googletag.cmd.push This was an important and pivotal moment for me in my le where I would embark on a journey of self-discovery and promise. From the beginning of le as I know it until now, I have never known fulfilment like being a mom. Being we to my husband, Dr Frank Dos Santos, and mother to our gorgeous and amazing children and brought me happiness like no other and for this I am eternally blessed and grateful. The le we share together is precious and I value this every day. There came a point for me personally, where I had reached that feeling of fulfilment and happiness and these feelings are what I embrace and evoke everyday in le. Drawing on my previous experiences and knowledge of The Secret as well as the process of le which had led me to this point, spurred me on to find my true passion in le. Helping others. I thought, whatI can pass on these feelings that I’m feeling  WhatI can help others to feel joy, hope and happiness whatever their environment or circumstance  So, in , alongside my business partner Chiara I set up a company Joy In The Workplace whose sole aim was to bring and implement productivity and joy into the workplace. This was my fit. The gratication and sense of fulfilment in helping others became a part of me. I knew I could do this, loved doing it and I did not want to stop here. I knew that feeling of being in a corporate environment and feeling stressed, overworked and unfulfilled and being able to approach and work with iniduals and groups who were in the same position and offer them a road to productivity and happiness in their role was le changing. I wanted to do more. In the Secret Bob Proctor was the clear definitive practitioner for me. I got in touch with the Proctor Gallagher Institute and trained in becoming a PGI Consultant The programmes set by Bob Proctor and Sandy Gallagher are some of the most effective and efficient I have ever seen and I was thrilled to become a part of it and be able to offer coaching to clients in both the U.S and Ireland. I recently was promoted within this company to Senior Coach and Account Executive which now enables me to offer some of the most elite personal development programmes PGI has to offer. Working alongside these esteemed colleagues has been a huge ambition of mine and I have learned so many invaluable skills and ideologies that I cannot wait to share with more and more clients whether personal or in a group setting. As my journey to date describes, I have achieved some great things and I am still achieving and believing every day. But there has been for quite some time, a feeling of wanting to offer something back home. I often would hear stories in the news, and reports from my hometown Derry in Ireland of the suicide epidemic which has been playing on my mind for quite some time. It is with such sadness and despair that I have felt the strong urge to help in some way. Derry is such a beautul town steeped in wonderful facts of history and monument but there is a huge cry for help and I simply cannot and will not ignore this. In understanding these facts, I have purchased a building in the city and will be hosting mindset workshops for both adults and children in the near future. It is never too early to implement positivity and to teach the importance of le and its value. In addition to this my foundation for suicide prevention is well underway as I have been working constructively with a team of like minded professionals from the city in order to structure and further develop and implement this project which I know in my heart will instil a new light of positivity and hope for those going through tough times and needing some guidance. My connection to Derry has been growing as of lately and I have found myself travelling back and forward trying to help in ious ways. Myself alongside Catrina Crillyhave set up “Bee Me LTD” which is the first children’s personal development company of its kind. We will be launching a child friendly app and host Bee Me Camps which will have a fun and friendly environment where children will learn about self-image, empowerment, positivity and how thoughts create things. We’re excited about this project and cannot wait to see it develop. My journey has come with its teachings, its blessings and its le changing moments and I for one would not change any of it. I am at this point in my le where I am seeing my dreams come to reality. I am helping others to see THEIR dreams and make them a reality. My work is not work for me anymore, it is my passion and I feel incredibly lucky to wake up everyday to the le I have and to be able to share my teachings that will help my clients achieve the le they too want. It is my pleasure and my honour. The world is ours and we can think it into whatever we want it to be. And together, we are making it happen.

Born and raised in Derry until the age of , I always had a calling for adventure and opportunity, and it was at this stage in my le I took a huge leap of faith and went in chase of the American Dream. A little Irish girl lost in the big city of New York awaiting my immigration papers is where I learned so many le lessons and character building. At the age of  I stumbled upon a movie The Secret which would eventually change my le and my direction. googletag.cmd.push This movie for me was a beginning, an awakeningyou will. I had opened my eyes to a whole new world of self-belief, ambitions and possibilities. At the age of  I opened my first business which was a Health Care Call Centre. Alongside this I worked for a healthcare administration business which was family run and set up by my mother in New York. Whilst I found great business acumen and skillset in my work, it took its toll on me. The corporate pace and stress fuelled environment was not my fit so I sold my shares in the family business and sold my own business. googletag.cmd.push This was an important and pivotal moment for me in my le where I would embark on a journey of self-discovery and promise. From the beginning of le as I know it until now, I have never known fulfilment like being a mom. Being we to my husband, Dr Frank Dos Santos, and mother to our gorgeous and amazing children and brought me happiness like no other and for this I am eternally blessed and grateful. The le we share together is precious and I value this every day. There came a point for me personally, where I had reached that feeling of fulfilment and happiness and these feelings are what I embrace and evoke everyday in le. Drawing on my previous experiences and knowledge of The Secret as well as the process of le which had led me to this point, spurred me on to find my true passion in le. Helping others. I thought, whatI can pass on these feelings that I’m feeling  WhatI can help others to feel joy, hope and happiness whatever their environment or circumstance  So, in , alongside my business partner Chiara I set up a company Joy In The Workplace whose sole aim was to bring and implement productivity and joy into the workplace. This was my fit. The gratication and sense of fulfilment in helping others became a part of me. I knew I could do this, loved doing it and I did not want to stop here. I knew that feeling of being in a corporate environment and feeling stressed, overworked and unfulfilled and being able to approach and work with iniduals and groups who were in the same position and offer them a road to productivity and happiness in their role was le changing. I wanted to do more. In the Secret Bob Proctor was the clear definitive practitioner for me. I got in touch with the Proctor Gallagher Institute and trained in becoming a PGI Consultant The programmes set by Bob Proctor and Sandy Gallagher are some of the most effective and efficient I have ever seen and I was thrilled to become a part of it and be able to offer coaching to clients in both the U.S and Ireland. I recently was promoted within this company to Senior Coach and Account Executive which now enables me to offer some of the most elite personal development programmes PGI has to offer. Working alongside these esteemed colleagues has been a huge ambition of mine and I have learned so many invaluable skills and ideologies that I cannot wait to share with more and more clients whether personal or in a group setting. As my journey to date describes, I have achieved some great things and I am still achieving and believing every day. But there has been for quite some time, a feeling of wanting to offer something back home. I often would hear stories in the news, and reports from my hometown Derry in Ireland of the suicide epidemic which has been playing on my mind for quite some time. It is with such sadness and despair that I have felt the strong urge to help in some way. Derry is such a beautul town steeped in wonderful facts of history and monument but there is a huge cry for help and I simply cannot and will not ignore this. In understanding these facts, I have purchased a building in the city and will be hosting mindset workshops for both adults and children in the near future. It is never too early to implement positivity and to teach the importance of le and its value. In addition to this my foundation for suicide prevention is well underway as I have been working constructively with a team of like minded professionals from the city in order to structure and further develop and implement this project which I know in my heart will instil a new light of positivity and hope for those going through tough times and needing some guidance. My connection to Derry has been growing as of lately and I have found myself travelling back and forward trying to help in ious ways.

The -acre estate, which includes the derelict Boom Hall, stretches across a large section of land close to the Foyle Bridge at Culmore. Appeals have been made in recent years for more to be done to preserve the famous hall which is such bad condition that the land around it has been secured off. The new company, which has charitable status, is called the Boomhall Trust. It is understood that the new companys plans are separate from other plans which have put forward to transform the Boomhall site as part of the Foyle River Gardens project. googletag.cmd.push You can find out more about the Foyle River Gardens project here -http:bit.ly uoCd Boomhall Trust chairman, Jim Sammon, said the buildings and land on the site have been unused and ‘run down for the past  years’. “A restored Boomhall Estate will be a powerful statement of optimism and confidence in the future of the region, and send the strongest signal to everyone that five decades of decay are coming to an end in the North West,” he said. Mr Sammon said the Boomhall Estate is mostly owned by Derry City and Strabane District Council which has commissioned a conservation plan for the buildings and landscape. googletag.cmd.push He said the new company is consulting with the council on the options for the site. He added that the Department of Communities has also part-funded the Boomhall Trust to undertake an archaeological investigation of the site in partnership with the archaeology department of Queens University of Belfast. “Our intention is that Boomhall will remain in public ownership and generate resources for local communities to sustain themselves for generations to come,” said Mr Sammon. “As the place where the boom across the river was broken in , Boomhall is one of the most signicant battle sites in European History. “The landscape is also home to the biggest concentration of heritage trees in the city including many magnicent oaks. “We aim to protect this unique human and natural heritage and make it accessible for everyone’s enjoyment without spoiling it with inappropriate and intrusive overdevelopment. “We are proposing that the council designate Boomhall legally as a local nature reserve. This will protect the whole estate from inappropriate new build proposals which can be accommodated on other sites in the city.” Among the trustess of the new company are Pauline Ross, founder of the Playhouse in Derry, Jim Foster, formerly a senior figure in the Londonderry Development Commission, and architect Marie Donaghy was involved in the restoration of the Guildhall. Mr Sammon said the trust is currently developing ‘appropriate proposals’ for the conservation and on-going use of both the buildings and the wider estate for the consideration of the council and local community.

We are blessed in team Sinn Feacutein to have depth in leadership, from Vice President Michelle ONeill and our new chief whip, John ODowd.Since Stormont was reinstated, lots of things are learning curves for myself, but the mix of enthusiastic newbies and more experienced older heads in our group means that help with issues is never far away.Over the next two years, I am determined to see delivery for this area coming out of Stormont, and membership of these committees, Communities and The Executive Office in particular, will aid with this.

However, the persuasive powers of the members and their supporters eventually began to make progress, additional money was found, designs were modied and planning approval was eventually granted.He continued: Without the passion and determination of this board of governors my work and that of others wouldnot have achieved the success it did and now Limavady can look forward to having a state-of-the-art school which meets the capacity and needs of wonderful children that are entitled to equality of opportunity to address their educational needs. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It was good to be with family to watch it, they were all very excited and the atmosphere was good.”The south Derry man, who works as a janitor at St Anne’s Cathedral in Belfast, said he was delighted to link up with Tom Jones but that he was relieved any judges had turned their chairs.“It’s a long six seconds that you have to wait before starting. You’re thinking ‘please, just anybody’ but I was over the moon when both Tom and Olly turned.“Going into it, I thoughtI could have anyone to turn it would have been Tom, ideally. I just respect him massively for what he’s done in his career and I thought he’d have great advice.”Tom Jones was thrilled to add Jonny to his team and tweeted on Saturday night: “Every team needs a voice like @BrooksFresh! Authentic, soulful and raw! That was very special. I am over the moon Jonny is joining #TeamTom.”By opting for the Welsh star, Jonny has put himself in competition with Brooke, who linked up with Meghan Trainor, but in a previous era, the two performers’ grandads were on the same side.Jonny’s grandad Roddy Gribbin was manager of the Derry senior football team that reached the  All-Ireland Final, while Brooke’s grandad, Patsy McLarnon, was corner back on the team.The pair also starred for Newbridge club side Sean O’Leary’s in  when the team took home the Derry senior championship cup.Jonny and Brooke have clearly inherited that competitive edge from their grandfathers, and both siners are no strangers to on-field success either. Brooke collected a Derry intermediate camogie championship title in , while Jonny starred in the Newbridge side who won the Derry U B Football Championship in . googletag.cmd.push Jonny was full of praise for his fellow Oakleaf contender: “Brooke has that big, bright, bubbly personality and everyone gets on well with her. When I heard her accent I said ‘you have to be from somewhere nearby’, and when she said she was from Bellaghy I couldn’t believe it.“You get a lot of time to sit and chat and because Brooke and I had that bond of where we were from we connected almost immediately.”Each coach needs to recruit  acts to bring through to the second stage of the competition – the battle rounds – but that number will be halved before they move to the next stage.Both Tom and Meghan will be hoping to channel the competitive streak of both performers’ grandads as they move forward in the competition, but the two Co Derry natives could yet end up on the same team.Judges have an opportunity to steal one act from another coach before the competition reaches the live shows and fans will be hoping the two County Derry stars remain on their screens for a few weeks longer. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

This year, Craig Holmes, who works at the Savers Store in Lisnagelvin Shopping Centre in the Waterside area of Derry, has emerged as one of the top performers in the region. The event takes place today during Appren- ticeship Weekwhich is being co-ordinated centrally by the Department for the Economy and supported by Councils, education providers and training providers across Northern Ireland.Craig first began his apprenticeship in retail with Babcock Training, one of a number of private training organisations working with Derry City and Strabane District Council to provide employment opportunities to those keen to get on the career ladder.Since then, Craig has already gained the title of Savers UK Apprentice of the Year following his participation in Council’s ‘Get Paid, Get Qualied, Get Ahead’ apprenticeship campaign. He will now face competition from apprentices across NI for the title of DfE Apprentice of the Year before a winner is announced. The Awards recognise dedication to pro- fessional development and learning, and acknowledge the efforts of those who have made a signicant contribution to their workplace.Speaking ahead of the awards, Craig said he was thrilled to have been selected among the top talent in the region. He has found the apprenticeship scheme personally rewarding, fuelling his ambitions to complete further qualications and move up within the business.“I started with assisting customers on the sales floor, handling their purchases, helping to create window and in-store displays and stock handling,” he explained. “Since then I’ve completed a level two qualication and I’m working towards a level three qualication. With an apprenticeship, you get to see everything that the job involves. I’m now at supervisor level and really enjoy having the responsibility, it’s a great place to work.“It’s been a fantastic experience and to be nominated for the Apprentice of the Year title really is the icing on the cake.”Savers Superdrug area manager, Marie Graffin, said the apprenticeship experience had been a positive one for the store, and warmly acknowledged Craig’s contribution to the business. “Craig is such an honest and hard-working young man, he’s given his all and is a real team player in the store,” she stressed. “He’s always so willing to learn and to acquire new skills to develop personally and professionally.”Tina Gillespie, skills manager with Derry City and Strabane District Council, said: “I am delighted to see Craig’s success continue, he exemplies what can be achieved through the apprenticeship programme with the right attitude and determination.“The council is working very proactively with a number of education providers, private training organisations, careers service and companies to encourage people to avail of apprenticeship opportunities that exist across the council area. The promotion of apprenticeships is a key element of the education and skills outcomes set out in the council’s Strategic Growth Plan and overseen by the Education and Skills Partnership “The partnership was established to support the education and skills ambitions outlined in the plan. Along with our partners, we are supporting employers to secure and develop the skills they need to increase productivity, and enable iniduals to find fulfilling employment and progress in today’s competitive and dynamic world of work.“I want to take this opportunity to wish Craig all the very best in the competition and in his career, I hope to see many more young people following a similar path to success through the programme.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Today, Derry Credit Union – whose motto is “For people, not for profit” - has a staff of , over , members with shares totalling almost pound million. Last year,  new members joined Derry Credit Union, bringing its membership to , adults and , minors. At the end of the last financial year, members’ sharestotalled pound,,. As at September , the loan book was valued at pound,,. This is an increase of pound, in the year and brought the total of loans issue since the Credit Unions inception to pound million. googletag.cmd.push At its annual general meeting in November last, the credit committee reported that in the period from October , , to September , last year, , loanswere issued to the value of pound,,.. This was an increase of pound, compared to the previous year and brought the loan book to pound,,. The Abbey Street financial institution has a number of events lined up to mark its th anniversary.  Civic reception One of the first was held on Tuesday night last when management, committee members, staff and members attended a civic reception held by Derry City and Strabane District Council. googletag.cmd.push At the event in the Guildhall, hosted by Deputy Mayor Cara Hunter, tributes were paid to the “Derry Six” - Seamus Bonner, George Coyle, Paddyand Eileen Doherty, Paddy Joe Doherty and John Hume – for their “forward-thinking” decision to set up the non-profit-making organisation which, since its inception, has loaned out pound million to its members. Cllr Hunter said it was a “delight” to host the civic reception for the Credit Union. She added: “The Credit Union has enabled so many families and people to be on their feet over the past  years. It has been the backbone of the development of Derry. “Through the loyalty and dedication of its members, Derry Credit Union has flourished to become the success that it is today. I hope its success will continue long into the future.” Speaking to the Derry News, Joan Gallagher, Derry Credit Union general manager, said she was “absolutely delighted” at the honour bestowed by the Council. She added: “Derry Credit Union has been a very important institution for Derry and it is appropriate the council mark it with a civic reception. “This kicks off the start of the celebrations for the th anniversary.” Mrs Gallagher described the founders of Northern Irelands first and Irelands third credit union as “absolutely amazing.” She added: “I only recently realised how young they all were – Paddy Joe Doherty passed away recently at the age of , so  years ago he was only  when they started out on the road to developing the Credit Union. “I think Paddy Joe was one of the younger ones and having had a look at the ages of the others, there was none of them over  and I think Paddy Bogside was the oldest.” Looking to the future, Mrs Gallagher said Derry Credit Union would “still be here” in another  years and Brexit would have very little impact on it. She said: “Those guysgave us a gt and for those of us who are still involved, it is our responsibility to protect that and we leave it in a suitable position to hand on. I do believe Derry Credit Union will be here in another  years – for it is part of the city. “Brexit will have very little impact on us – the members have their shares, have their savings – we will still be able to provie the services we have. “We have invested a lot over the past number of years modernising the Credit Union. “At Derry Credit Union, you can come in to the office and do all you business or you can do all your business online.”Mrs Gallagher revealed membership at the Abbey Street office stretched far beyond the citys boundaries. She said: “Our members are not just in Derry – we have members in America, Australia and a number of other countries – we are a sort of worldwide organisation now. We have an e-banking  on which you can apply for your loan at night, we look at your loan application in the morning, we will send you an SMS text to sign and we will have your money in your account that day.”  Not a bank Mrs Gallagher stressed Derry Credit Union was “not a bank.” She said: “We will never be a bank. What distinguishes us is that we have  operating principles which we very closely adhere to. We are a not-for-profit organisation – the banks are for profit and they look at every opportunity to maximise afor themselves. “We charge an interest rate which is very reasonable and we have a rebate on that – once we cover our costs, we give back what we have left to our members.” Mrs Gallagher said Derry had become a very dferent place thanks to the Credit Union. She said: “Since our inception we have loaned out pound million –you take that out of Dderry, what would it be ” Colm McCauley, treasurer, said it was a “great honour and privilege” to be honoured with a civic reception, the first of a number of events planned to mark the landmark anniversary. He added: “There will be a number of events throughout the year and this is one of the first – it is great it is happening. “Hopefully, the Credit Union will grow. We dont keep our heads buried in the sand, we are always thinking strategically at how we can consolidate – we cannot just standstill and we do have a strategic plan to carry that on.” Mr McCauley pointed to the financial situations many people found themselves in at the time the Derry Credit Union was formed as to why so many in the city – over a third of its population – were members of the local institution. He said: “You need to go back a bit when credit facilicities for a large section of the population in Derry were virtually non-existent. The Credit Union was born out of that and it has grown ever since – it is not a profit-making organisation and any surplus goes back to the members.” Sean Hegarty, president, also paid tribute to the six founding members. He said: “It is virtually unheard of that a credit union established  years ago has achieved the volume of growth that Derry Credit Union has – it is very appropriate and we are delighted to be invited along to this civic reception. “Those peoplewere very young by todays standards and they took the brave step forward and had the vision for the benefit of the community. “It is a very emotional time. There have been a lot of people involved from the absolute origins, right through the decades to this very day. “We currently have a board of directors who volunteer and give up their time freely and willingly. “The world has changed greatly and the Credit Union has had to move to stay up with those changes.” Mr Hegarty said there would be a “lot of families” who would find it much dferent without the Credit Union. He added: “They would find it very dficult when it comes to key things in their lives, from simple things from birthdays to Christmas, to the education of their children, needing a bit of work done to their house, needing a new car. “I am not talking necessarily needing a big help but when they do need a bit of help, there is an organisation there for them.” Helen Kivlehan was one of the Credit Unions members in attendance. She said she has a member almost since its inception and revealed what her first loan was for. She said: “My father enrolled us as children and I went on to become an adult member. My first loan was for my wedding. My husband now and I were both members and we both saved in the Credit Union towards our wedding because in our day our parents couldnt really afford it. “We saved up and borrowed the money against our savings and then paid it off.” Mrs Kivlehan said Derry “wouldnt be the place it is now without the Credit Union.” She added: “It is a lesaver for people like my mother and father, who was a docker. “The Credit Union has been very good to me. I have been able to provide education for my children and my grandchildren are all now in the Credit Union and it should be something that is passed on.” Orla ODoherty, a member of the youth committee, encouraged young people to get involved in the Credit Union. She said: “It is a good experience and helps build confidence and to learn new skills.”  How it all began The Credit Union Movement was introduced in Ireland in  by Nora Herlihy with the support of a number of other dedicated pioneers. The experience of most people in Derry in the s and early s was that of high unemployment. Banks and other financial institutions did not advance credit without substantial collateral or guarantees - you had to be a homeowner in order to get a loan and very few people owned their own homes in the late s. Money lenders charged exorbitant rates of interest perpetuating the cycle of hardship. Consequently, the ordinary working class people in the city had only very costly sources of credit available to them. Derry Credit Union was founded by six iniduals whose commitment to their community is beyond refute. Six locals - Seamus Bonner, George Coyle, Paddyand Eileen Doherty, Paddy Joe Doherty and John Hume - believed the credit union could be a source of fair and reasonable credit for the ordinary man and woman. They met in a house in the Bogside on October ,  to combine their total savings of eight pounds ten shillings to establish the first credit union in Northern Ireland - and only third on the island of Ireland – a move that changed the fortunes and futures of generations in Derry people for the better.

Today, Derry Credit Union – whose motto is “For people, not for profit” - has a staff of , over , members with shares totalling almost pound million. Last year,  new members joined Derry Credit Union, bringing its membership to , adults and , minors. At the end of the last financial year, members’ sharestotalled pound,,. As at September , the loan book was valued at pound,,. This is an increase of pound, in the year and brought the total of loans issue since the Credit Unions inception to pound million. googletag.cmd.push At its annual general meeting in November last, the credit committee reported that in the period from October , , to September , last year, , loanswere issued to the value of pound,,.. This was an increase of pound, compared to the previous year and brought the loan book to pound,,. The Abbey Street financial institution has a number of events lined up to mark its th anniversary.  Civic reception One of the first was held on Tuesday night last when management, committee members, staff and members attended a civic reception held by Derry City and Strabane District Council. googletag.cmd.push At the event in the Guildhall, hosted by Deputy Mayor Cara Hunter, tributes were paid to the “Derry Six” - Seamus Bonner, George Coyle, Paddyand Eileen Doherty, Paddy Joe Doherty and John Hume – for their “forward-thinking” decision to set up the non-profit-making organisation which, since its inception, has loaned out pound million to its members. Cllr Hunter said it was a “delight” to host the civic reception for the Credit Union. She added: “The Credit Union has enabled so many families and people to be on their feet over the past  years. It has been the backbone of the development of Derry. “Through the loyalty and dedication of its members, Derry Credit Union has flourished to become the success that it is today. I hope its success will continue long into the future.” Speaking to the Derry News, Joan Gallagher, Derry Credit Union general manager, said she was “absolutely delighted” at the honour bestowed by the Council. She added: “Derry Credit Union has been a very important institution for Derry and it is appropriate the council mark it with a civic reception. “This kicks off the start of the celebrations for the th anniversary.” Mrs Gallagher described the founders of Northern Irelands first and Irelands third credit union as “absolutely amazing.” She added: “I only recently realised how young they all were – Paddy Joe Doherty passed away recently at the age of , so  years ago he was only  when they started out on the road to developing the Credit Union. “I think Paddy Joe was one of the younger ones and having had a look at the ages of the others, there was none of them over  and I think Paddy Bogside was the oldest.” Looking to the future, Mrs Gallagher said Derry Credit Union would “still be here” in another  years and Brexit would have very little impact on it. She said: “Those guysgave us a gt and for those of us who are still involved, it is our responsibility to protect that and we leave it in a suitable position to hand on. I do believe Derry Credit Union will be here in another  years – for it is part of the city. “Brexit will have very little impact on us – the members have their shares, have their savings – we will still be able to provie the services we have. “We have invested a lot over the past number of years modernising the Credit Union. “At Derry Credit Union, you can come in to the office and do all you business or you can do all your business online.”Mrs Gallagher revealed membership at the Abbey Street office stretched far beyond the citys boundaries. She said: “Our members are not just in Derry – we have members in America, Australia and a number of other countries – we are a sort of worldwide organisation now. We have an e-banking  on which you can apply for your loan at night, we look at your loan application in the morning, we will send you an SMS text to sign and we will have your money in your account that day.”  Not a bank Mrs Gallagher stressed Derry Credit Union was “not a bank.” She said: “We will never be a bank. What distinguishes us is that we have  operating principles which we very closely adhere to. We are a not-for-profit organisation – the banks are for profit and they look at every opportunity to maximise afor themselves. “We charge an interest rate which is very reasonable and we have a rebate on that – once we cover our costs, we give back what we have left to our members.” Mrs Gallagher said Derry had become a very dferent place thanks to the Credit Union. She said: “Since our inception we have loaned out pound million –you take that out of Dderry, what would it be ” Colm McCauley, treasurer, said it was a “great honour and privilege” to be honoured with a civic reception, the first of a number of events planned to mark the landmark anniversary. He added: “There will be a number of events throughout the year and this is one of the first – it is great it is happening. “Hopefully, the Credit Union will grow. We dont keep our heads buried in the sand, we are always thinking strategically at how we can consolidate – we cannot just standstill and we do have a strategic plan to carry that on.” Mr McCauley pointed to the financial situations many people found themselves in at the time the Derry Credit Union was formed as to why so many in the city – over a third of its population – were members of the local institution. He said: “You need to go back a bit when credit facilicities for a large section of the population in Derry were virtually non-existent. The Credit Union was born out of that and it has grown ever since – it is not a profit-making organisation and any surplus goes back to the members.” Sean Hegarty, president, also paid tribute to the six founding members. He said: “It is virtually unheard of that a credit union established  years ago has achieved the volume of growth that Derry Credit Union has – it is very appropriate and we are delighted to be invited along to this civic reception. “Those peoplewere very young by todays standards and they took the brave step forward and had the vision for the benefit of the community. “It is a very emotional time. There have been a lot of people involved from the absolute origins, right through the decades to this very day. “We currently have a board of directors who volunteer and give up their time freely and willingly. “The world has changed greatly and the Credit Union has had to move to stay up with those changes.” Mr Hegarty said there would be a “lot of families” who would find it much dferent without the Credit Union. He added: “They would find it very dficult when it comes to key things in their lives, from simple things from birthdays to Christmas, to the education of their children, needing a bit of work done to their house, needing a new car. “I am not talking necessarily needing a big help but when they do need a bit of help, there is an organisation there for them.” Helen Kivlehan was one of the Credit Unions members in attendance. She said she has a member almost since its inception and revealed what her first loan was for. She said: “My father enrolled us as children and I went on to become an adult member. My first loan was for my wedding. My husband now and I were both members and we both saved in the Credit Union towards our wedding because in our day our parents couldnt really afford it. “We saved up and borrowed the money against our savings and then paid it off.” Mrs Kivlehan said Derry “wouldnt be the place it is now without the Credit Union.” She added: “It is a lesaver for people like my mother and father, who was a docker. “The Credit Union has been very good to me. I have been able to provide education for my children and my grandchildren are all now in the Credit Union and it should be something that is passed on.” Orla ODoherty, a member of the youth committee, encouraged young people to get involved in the Credit Union.

The small group of volunteers who have been keeping the league alive for the past few years say that they have had enough. The league, known locally as the DD, has been one of the best local sporting organisations for many decades. It was set up in  and some of the top players in Ireland have played in the league. However, in recent years, the number of teams have fallen. Changes in society and working patterns are among some of the reasons put forward for the decline in teams. googletag.cmd.push However, the time has come for the organisers to decide whether they will continue on with the league. The DD committee say that unless they can register enough teams to form a league by February , the association will cease to exist. Match Secretary, Liam Smyth, described the situation as heartbreaking. “I have put everything into the DD and its soul destroying to be honest and it will be a real shame to see it go,” he said. In tomorrows Derry News, sports editor Gary Ferry speaks to long-standing members of the DD committee and reveals how much it will hurt them to see the demise of the league. googletag.cmd.push    If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The bypass is the single biggest road scheme ever proposed for the district.Roads officials have previously insisted that the planned scheme will greatly benefit both strategic and local road users by reducing journey times and improving road safety. In addition, officials are confident that the schemersquos economic assessment demonstrates that the bypass would provide a good economic .Designed to alleviate chronic town centre congestion in Ballynahinch and along the main approach roads to the town, major new roundabouts are proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road.Overtaking lanes stretching almost  metres are proposed at either end of the bypass where major new roundabouts are to be constructed, with the scheme also including a shared footpath and cycle lane.Cllr Walker argued that the Newry, Mourne and Down area has missed out on signicant roads funding for decades, with many major schemes constructed in other parts of the Province.ldquoI believe the time has come for this council to demand its fair share of infrastructure funding, he declared. ldquoI have been a councillor for over  years and the bypass issue has been raised during every one of them.ldquoThe government department has now moved to a position with all its ducks in this particular scheme now in a row. The public enquiry has been completed and the only thing delaying the scheme is funding.Cllr Walker said he believed that with the Assembly restored and a local minister at the helm of the Department for Infrastructure, the council needs to seek an urgent meeting with Ms Mallon to seek the immediate release of bypass funding to not only alleviate town centre congestion in Ballynahinch, but provide a major boost for the wider South Down area, in particular, tourism.Slieve Croob councillor, Cathy Mason, described the market town as the ldquogateway to the wider South Down area through which all traffic must pass, including HGVs.ldquoThis not only frustrates drivers who are part of the through traffic, but increases tension and danger for those living, shopping and working in the town. The proposed bypass will run round the eastern periphery of the town with a grade-separated junction at the Crossgar Road, she continued.ldquoHousing is also being permitted up to the line of the planned new road and includes the potential for a park and ride site. The bypass has been proposed since the s and for decades local community and political representatives from all parties have demanded this new road.Cllr Mason said the new infrastructure minister must signal the start of work on the multi-million pound road scheme as soon as possible.She said that in , the then Infrastructure Minister Chris Hazzard announced his decision to proceed with the bypass proposal and instructed officials to continue to prioritise this scheme until completion unless instructed otherwise by a new minister. Cllr Mason continued: ldquoWith the infrastructure minister now in place following the restoration of Stormont, funding should now be signed off and construction allowed to commence as soon as possible.She said the tender process for construction should begin as soon as possible, suggesting there is no reason why construction cannot commence this time next year, with the scheme complete and open to vehicles by .Rowallane councillor Robert Burgess is also keen to see work on the bypass get underway and hopes that the new infrastructure minister will also formally sign off the scheme to upgrade the final section of the A between Doranrsquos Rock and Rowallane Garden in Saintfield.ldquoThe bypass is critically important to the social and economic regeneration of not only Ballynahinch but the wider South Down area, he said.Cllr Burgess added: ldquoIn addition, the A is the main link between Downpatrick and Belfast and while there have been ious upgrades, the section between Doranrsquos Rock and Rowallane Garden is simply not suitable for the huge volume of traffic which uses this busy road. Itrsquos upgrade is also a priority..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th February 2020 Caroline.jpg","title":"Caroline’s love of Newcastle beach inspires St Patrick Centre exhibition  ","story":"A NEWCASTLE artistrsquos fascination with the townrsquos famous beach has inspired her latest exhibition.Caroline Williamson is showing over  pieces of her work throughout February at the St Patrickrsquos Centre in Downpatrick.Just opened this week, Caroline said that the exhibition is called lsquoShell Sounds from the Shorersquo.She said: ldquoOne of my fondest memories is walking down the Newcastle beach, collecting shells with my grandmother.

Other local issues highlighted included tackling litter , mental health , drug misuseand protecting the local environment . These were followed by building a bridge between Strangford and Portaferry .The results were detailed in a report written by Cormac, who said he was ldquodelighted to have been able to recognise the dedication of young volunteers across South Down in helping their peers have their voices heard.He added: ldquoOrganising Make Your Mark for the past two years has been a challenge each time but one which I enjoy greatly and am privileged to be faced with. Itrsquos now time for politicians and decision makers to act upon the issues raised by local young people.Cormacrsquos role in seeking out the opinions of his peers was praised by Baroness Ritchie, former South Down MP.She said: ldquoCongratulations are due to Cormac for his tenacity, ingenuity, hard work, enthusiasm and attention to detail. He is an example to all of us of what a campaigner should be doing. ldquoIn many ways Cormac, you are the Greta Thunberg of South Down. You must be able to use that capacity to challenge your peers, government departments and even your teachers to improve the world we all live and recreate in.ldquoYou also need to challenge our communities to awaken and re-engage with ordinary politics in a way in which people have resonated with the problems presented by Brexit.Focusong on the local issues, Baroness Ritchie described these as ldquodominant topics that occupy young people, highlighting the need for investment of resources and the deployment of new and dferent policy directives to accommodate the challenges of the geographical area, given the myriad of problems facing our young people.Regarding the issues raised under the devolved government category, Baroness Ritchie said she wanted a copy of the findings sent to Ministers in the NI Executive and to the chairs of the relevant Assembly Committees ldquoto identy policy and spending priorities for them in the Programme for Government and Budget.Last weekrsquos event was also attended by local councillors Dermot Curran, Patrick Brown, Oonagh Hanlon and Harold McKee.Baroness Ritchie and Cllr Andrews presented the school awards to the teachers who co-ordinated the vote in their respective schools and they included Mrs Mairead Arkins ,Mrs Jackie Bogues , Miss Aine McMullanand Year  pupil Cloacutedagh Bogues who single-handedly co-ordinated the vote in her school, collected Ballynahinch Assumption Grammar Schoolrsquos award.Down High and De La Salle High schools also took part in the consultation, but representatives were unable to attend last weekrsquos event..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th February 2020 Destructive.jpg","title":"Destructive Natasha is too hot for Fermanagh  ","story":"DOWN Ladies made it two wins from two with a hard-fought victory over Ulster neighbours Fermanagh in Teconnaught on Sunday afternoon.Down began well, but struggled to turn lots of possession into scores, with Fermanagh getting plenty of bodies behind the ball, making it dficult for the home side to find space.Downrsquos superb work rate, defensive structure and high rate of turnovers, provided the  for a half time lead of - to -.With four of Fermanaghrsquos scores from frees, plus a missed penalty and disallowed goal by Down, clearly showed the superiority of the Mourne girls in the first half.It was Fermanagh, though, who began the second half the stronger side, keeping the majority of possession and getting back to within a point on the scoreboard.However, Down found another gear in the final quarter to power home as convincing winners on a scoreline of - to -.Many thanks to Teconnaught GAC for their superb hospitality and facilities.Also a very special mention is due to Teconnaughtrsquos Aimee Greene, who made herto county colours after a  month lay-off with a cruciate knee ligament injury.Next up is a trip to Sligo on Sunday.Down scorers: Natasha Ferris , Aoe Laverty , Anna McKee , Mary Adegbamiye , Lauren Cunningham ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th February 2020 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C February 5%2C 1980  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK mdash Plans for a major four-lane carriageway through the heart of Downpatrickrsquos town centre were unveiled this week by anxious Department of Environment officials.The scheme is the result of ten years of research into the townrsquos planning and environmental future mdash a future which has now become totally dependent on a traffic plan solution.The details of the new road proposals were given at a special two-hour press briefing on Friday afternoon and Department of Environmental officials admit they are anxiously awaiting public response.The speculation that the town was to get a lsquoring roadrsquo has been quashed by the proposal mdash in fact, say officials, it was never really on the cards mdash and the new system is simply a means of distributing the traffic inside the town rather than re-routing outside the town limits.Eleven separate routes for a new road were studied and the choice narrowed down to four. The pick of those four has now been decided after years of exploratory talks and detailed investigations. Ironically, the final choice is of a route which dfers only slightly from one suggested by the  Downpatrick Area Plan.The new road will begin, effectively, from the entrance to the Meadowlands housing estate in Church Street and will run behind existing Church Street premises on a widening parallel, into the town centre.It will emerge onto the lower part of Scotch Street, across the rear of the Town Hall building and into Irish Street. Use of the present entrance to the new Irish Street car park will probably be made to swing the road through the rear of Market Street into St Patrickrsquos Avenue and on into the Ballydugan Road.KILLYLEAGH mdash A row is brewing in Killyleagh over proposals to open a pool hall in the townrsquos High Street.Angry residents in the area have drawn up a petition objecting to it being opened because they say that area has already suffered severely at the hands of vandals.Local councillor, Mr Sam Osborne, explained that  objectors had signed the petition because they were concerned that the pool hall would bring with it a sinister element.He said people in the immediate vicinity of the empty premises to be turned into a pool room were afraid to go to bed at the weekends and they fear this could escalate.Mr Osborne stressed he did not object to the idea of the pool room, he hoped it would take young people off the street, but he felt it was being sited in the wrong area of town.BALLYHORNAN mdash Plannersrsquo refusal to allow a new caravan site at Ballyhornan will have a major effect on Down Councilrsquos development programmes for the area, it was claimed this week.The claim was made by Downpatrick councillor, Mr Eddie McGrady, who said planners were wrong to issue such a decision until a general development policy had been worked out.Mr McGrady also said he could not understand why there should not be potential for a new holiday location on the Lecale coast, where a number of such locations already existed.He stressed that in the absence of an Area Plan the council should have a policy on this.A planning spokesman confirmed there would be a policy on locations for caravan development when the area plan was published.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Mrs Margaret Atkins, we of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr Humphrey Atkins, made a surprise visit to the Plessey Telecommunications factory in Ballynahinch on Tuesday morning.While her husband was at Stormont trying to thrash out the provincersquos problems in the round table talks, Mrs Atkins was having an extensive two-hour tour of the factory, under the guidance of senior Plessey officials.Mrs Atkins arrived shortly after .am and after a y talk with senior management, including Mr Harold Davies, regional director, and Mr Gerry OrsquoNeill, manager at Ballynahinch, she was shown around the factory.She met and spoke to many of the factoryrsquos -plus employees, sharing jokes and listening and enquiring about what kind of work was done.CROSSGAR mdash Sgt Matthew Cuffey, of st Crossgar Boysrsquo Brigade, has won the Northern Ireland Squad Commanderrsquos Shield at the annual squad drill finals in Omagh on Saturday.Matthew and the st Crossgar Company were representing Down Battalion at the finals, and although the squad finished third mdash three points behind hat-trick winners st Castlederg mdash there was some consolation in the squad commanderrsquos success.This very high honour for Down Battalion and indeed, has been won four times previously by Crossgar boys since the competitionrsquos inception in .Down Battalion officers were delighted at the results, and congratulations are extended to the companyrsquos captain, Mr R Dickson, and drill officers, Mr D Nesbitt, and to the boys themselves.DUNDRUM mdash The controversy over whether a section of lane way in Dundrum would remain open is almost over mdash and itrsquos now virtually certain that it will not be closed.Members of the Dundrum and District Community Committee were told of this at their monthly meeting in the Bay Inn on Tuesday night by the secretary, who read letters received from the estate agents and solicitors of the Lord Downshire Estate, who previously owned the lane.The controversy, highlighted by the Recorder last week, had flared up when local residents sensed Mr Albert Donnelly, the owner of the caravan sites on either side of the lane, which runs from Castle Hill to the junction with the Dromara Road, was preparing to close the lane.Pillars had been erected on the lane and residents were adamant gates would not be put up to block their right of way. The lane had been sold by Lord Downshirersquos estate to Mr Donnelly, but there had been some doubt whether a right of way clause had been ed.This has now been cleared up by the letters from Lord Downshirersquos estate agents and solicitors, who pointed out that the lane way had been sold but that the right of way was reserved. The letters added that they hoped this would allay the fears of villagers.The committee, however, have decided to seek legal assistance on the matter to clear it up permanently.ARDGLASS mdash Hopes are high this week that the EEC will grant aid a fish processing unit in Ardglass.Euro MP, Mr John Hume, has taken up the case in Brussels and yesterday he reported that the ECC Commission was ldquocarefully considering grant aiding the locally financed scheme.One of the biggest problems with the fishing industry at Ardglass has been the lack of fish processing facilities, despite the economic benefits from it.Mr Hume told the Recorder yesterday he was ldquofairly confident the EEC would give aid to a fish offal plant at the harbour.He has been in constant touch with local fishermen in the area and yesterday announced another major breakthrough in his battle to secure a better deal for them.In reply to a parliamentary question he tabled in Brussels, Mr Hume has been told a study of fishing industry in Northern Ireland to be undertaken.ldquoI regard this as a welcome first step and hope the study will concentrate on developing the potential of the fishing industry in Northern Ireland with a view to greater investment in its development, he said.Mr Hume is at present awaiting a reply from the European Commission on ldquothe scientic justication for its ban on barring fishermen off the Co Down coast..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th February 2020 Late.jpg","title":"Late points give Down huge boost  ","story":"FINGERNAILS were being bitten to the quick by worried Down fans in the main stand at Pairc Esler on Saturday night as this encounter hurtled to conclusion.The sides had been locked in a fierce battle for supremacy and with time almost up, nothing separated them at - apiece.However, Down had a sting in the tail and just when it looked asthey were heading for another draw, Barry OrsquoHagan, Jerome Johnston and Donal OrsquoHare plundered points to maintain their unbeaten start to the campaign.All Derry could manage in reply was a single point from Chris Bradley, leaving manager Rory Gallagher lots to ponder on after his side squandered a host of great scoring opportunities.Now for Division  favourites Cork away this weekend with a place in the new top tier of All-Ireland Championship very much at stake.Derry, who also fancy a place at the top table and who drew their opener with Leitrim, last weekend, opened well with Shane McGuigan taking a marvellous score in the first minute.Down responded well and Kilcoorsquos Jerome Johnston, who wasnrsquot expected to start, quickly brought the sides level.However, Derry re-established their lead with two well-taken scores from Benny Heron and Shea Downey.

Across the resort,  street lights are not working.Other district hot-spots include Ballynahinch where  street lights are currently out of order, with faults reported in Killyleagh and  brought to the government departmentrsquos attention in Castlewellan and Crossgar. In Saintfield,  faults have been reported.Elsewhere,  street lights are currently out of order in Ballygowan, with  and  faults reported in Ardglass and Killough respectively.Sixteen street lights are out of order in Dundrum with  faults reported in Drumaness. The figures for the Spa and Clough are  and nine respectively.Downpatrick area councillor, Dermot Curran, who hopes to meet with Ms Mallon to discuss the issue, said investment must be found to address the street lighting debacle.He said that repairs are generally limited to those that can be carried out by the government departmentrsquos internal street lighting workforce which only consists of five full and three part time electricians.Cllr Curran described the number of street lights not working across East Down and Lecale as ldquoalarming and hopes that the money to expedite much-needed repairs will be earmarked by the new Stormont Executive.ldquoFaulty street lights represent a health and safety issue for drivers and pedestrians and there is not one area in the district which is not affected, he continued.ldquoWhile the new infrastructure minister will be inundated with requests for meetings and investment in key projects, repairing faulty street lights has to be a priority. The fact that in the local area there are  broken lights beggars belief. I have no doubt that the number will increase before the government department can begin to get to grips with this issue.Cllr Curran said street lights which are not working in areas where elderly people and indeed young families live poses a major problem.He said a fully working street lighting system provides residents with a sense of security and helps deter would-be criminals.ldquoI recognise that the new minister will have an overflowing intray and will have to work with her officials to determine the priorities in the months ahead. It is my contention that repairing faulty street lights must be one of those priorities, said Cllr Curran.ldquoThe new ministerrsquos department faces budgetary challenges, but the resources required to deliver a full street lighting repair service must be made available..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th February 2020 Men.jpg","title":"Men form football team to help with grief of losing baby  ","story":"THE love of football is helping men deal with the grief of losing a baby before, during or after birth.Downpatrick man Pat Moore has teamed up with personal trainer John Fegan from Rostrevor to formthe first Sands United County Down team.The team plays its first match against County Down Masters at the end of the month.Sands is a Northern Ireland charity which provides support to bereaved parents who have lost a baby either through miscarriage, stillbirth or within days or weeks of birth.Both men were helped by Sands when they lost babies before birth and admit they have struggled to deal with their own loss while supporting their partners.By coming together to play the sport they love, Pat, whorsquos better known locally as chairman of Celtic Bhoys FC, hopes that it will help him and other men find support and understanding with other menwho are going dealing with the same thing.The  year-old father of two said that he and his partner lost a much wanted baby during pregnancy nearly two years ago.ldquoOnce we knew we were going to have our first baby together, we were so happy about it and immediately began to plan for its arrival, said Pat.ldquoI expect a lot of men are the same but at the time it happened I had to step up and do all the organising while supporting my partner who was just devastated. When your partner is lying in hospital like that, all you want to do is to take the pain away but, at the same time, you have to put on a brave face for everyone involved.While the team is about football, Pat hopes that the members will be able to socialise after matches and share their experiences.Pat and seven of his friends are also fundraising for Sands by running in the Carlingford half marathon in March and the Belfast Marathon in May.He connected with John Fegan, whose family used to live in Downpatrick, on Facebook after John announced his intention to create the football team.John and his fiancee Kathryn Cole lost their first baby, Faith, at around  weeks into the pregnancy three years ago, although they are now parents to two children, Jude and Matilda.Like Pat, the  year-old knows the importance of physical activity and sport to help with mensrsquo mental health and being able to cope with the loss of baby in this way.He said: ldquoI was encouraged to do this when I realised there were other Sands football teams in Northern Ireland but none for County Down.ldquoThis is for fathers, uncles, brothers, grandfathers, cousins, whatever men who have been affected by the loss of a child. We share that we are united by angels, which is our motto.John said that there are now over  men who have joined the club and he and Pat hope to welcome more throughout the year.The first match will be held at Assumption Grammar School, Ballynahinch on Friday, February  at pm. Men who have been affected by the loss of a child are invited to come along to spectate.Further details can be found on the Sands United County Down Facebook page..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th February 2020 In Demand.jpg","title":"Newcastle super gran loving life with ten grandchildren attending primary school  ","story":"MEET Newcastlersquos super gran Karen Cunningham.The  year-old is grandmother to ten pupils who all attend the townrsquos St Maryrsquos Primary School and nursery unit.The eight boys and two girls mdash who include a set of twins mdash are the sons and daughters of Karenrsquos three eldest children.While it may not be an official record, St Maryrsquos believe that this is the first time this has happened for as long as staff can recall.With a  week-old baby boy and another baby due in April, it looks like St Maryrsquos can rest assured of having one of Karenrsquos grandchildren at the school for the next decade at least.Karenrsquos son Andrew and his we Kristen have four children at St Maryrsquos mdash Reece in P, Keelie in P, Kai in P and Emie in nursery daughter Charlene Hamill and husband Dominic have four boys, Dara Hamill in P, twins Tiernan and Riley Hamill in P and Morgan Hamill in P and have a baby on the way daughter Kerrie-Louise Aspel and her partner Gary Kearney are parents to Nathan Kearney in P and Keegan Kearney in nursery school and  week-old Carly.While the mother of four, whose -year-old son Corey Madden still lives at home, admits to not always remembering the ages of her grandchildren, she could not be happier with her brood.ldquoMy grandchildren are the light of my le.

Elliersquos father Peter, brother-in-law Kieran and a neighbour were also quickly on the scene to help.

But credit due to both Paddy and Alec for their performances against regular league players.Group four, headed up by Colin McKinty, always a dangerous competitor in competitions, but he had to contend with an equally talented player in Sean Poland, who has been in great form recently.John Campbell, another player who is in sight of a regular place in the Strangford C team and the affable Katy Rice, improving with every game she plays, completed the group.The first spot in this group was always going to be tight, but McKintyrsquos steady defence was the key factor in finishing top of this group with Poland second.Group four with Michael Carey having steered Strangford B to their third consecutive isional title, was the clear favourite to finish in first place, but would have to contend with the Drumaness No  Pat Mulholland, who has been in excellent form throughout the league campaign.Also in this five-man group were Michael Deery, team-mate Niall Houghan and Drumaness man Seamus McGivern, more at home on the snooker table, but still no stranger to the plastic ball.The games in this group were hotly contested, but in the final game of the group Mulholland and Carey would battle it out for the top place.The first game could have gone either way with Pat just edging home -.The next was equally close but, in the end, it was the Drumaness man who finished in top place with just five points the dference.The first quarter-final match was an all-Strangford clash between McKinty and McCusker.The first two games were shared, but the steady place of McCusker, mixed with well-judged attack, saw him take the next two games to progress to the semi-finals.The second match featured the Drumanessrsquo Pat Mulholland and Charlie Murray. This was easily the match of the round.Mulholland won the first two games, the next two went to Murray with a nip and tuck decider before Mulholland just edged it -. The third match of the round involved second seed Donald Campbell taking on his skipper Michael Carey.The games were all close, but the blistering attack of Campbell saw him progress in straight games. Vincey Poland had perhaps the easiest match of the round against new comer John Campbell.As expected, Poland had too much iation for his opponent and ran out a comfortable - winner.McCusker stated this competition a dark horse to a least reach the final.His opponent in the semi-finals was Donald Campbell and he started as favourite.This semi-final turned out to be the closest match of the competition. John won the first two games and looked confident to reach the final.Back came Campbell to even the score, but McCusker won the first four points of the game and held on win -, leaving Donald to reflect on a match he should have won when he held a game point in the first encounter of the match.The next match was a close affair, but Poland was always in control with Pat Mulholland delighted to have reached this stage of the competition.It was a gallant effort from the Drumaness man but, in the end, Poland booked his final place with a straight game victoryThe home crowd was pleased to see a local man in the final of the competition, but knew he needed to produce something special to beat a player of Polandrsquos stature.The games were close and John, encouraged by his supporters, did everything he could to stem the flow of winners from one of the leaguersquos best backhand exponent, but to no avail and lost in straight games.League secretary, Jim Ritchie, thanked the Strangford club for staging this event and providing refreshment throughout the evening and the competitors for their generous contribution to the charity fund.Competition referee, Peter Deeny, also acknowledged the friendly, competitive spirit in which this event was enjoyed by all participants..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/ource srcset=/resources/images/10980271.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"bandstand malcolm mcdowell","story":"How long have you been performing Where do you perform What is your favourite song to perform and why What has been your biggest gig to date Any funny gig rehearsal stories Who are your major influences What would be your dream gig Best moment as a musician so far What is the most unusual venue you have played What is your lsquogo-torsquo encore song Whats the best thing about performing Do you always perform solo or do you also play with a band What does  hold for you Any last words This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He said: ldquoThe old ones that I had purchased were worn through and I was on the verge of buying more.Rubbish found in River BannHe added: ldquoJordyn from JD Tipler, who has been following the page for a number of weeks and is astounded at the amount of litter that has been removed from the river, has offered me a free meal for all the work Irsquove been doing. Jon also revealed that he had an offer from Dr Mowers Garden and Small Plant Repair.Jon has raised concerns about the huge volume of trash found and has been critical of some local businesses whose rubbish has ended up in the river.Last week Jon went to a spot used by anglers opposite Portadown Golf Club.New year, new do for Banbury landlordStorm Ciara: Met Office upgrades weather warning to severe Amber as disruption expected Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"He said: ldquoIt has been in use for quite a while, going by the rubbish that has been left behind, and each time I pass here the amount increases.Rubbish found in River BannldquoThree black bags lted. I wouldnrsquot class this person or people as anglers going by the mess they have left. Irsquom sure there are more descriptive words that could be used.Last week he was joined by Campbell Best from The Y Zonewho noticed the work Jon was doing on the Bann River.Jon said: ldquoThese guys, as part of their detached outreach work, engage with the young people who drink down by the river at the weekends and, as part of their work, have been trying to encourage them to find other, more positive ways to spend their time and to make more positive le choices.ldquoIn order to help me, The Y Zone team try and encourage the young people to use the bins and clean up after themselves.ldquoWith the Hoys Meadow area being one place which has been used over the past few years as a gathering area for the Buckfast, Echo Falls and Dragon Soup crews, Campbell askedI could bring my dinghy along and help them with a cleanup of the area. ldquoHopefully, going forward, the young folk and others who use this amazing area can keep it clean and tidy, and fit for everyone to enjoy. Thanks to Campbell Best, Keith Whitmarsh and Warren Quinn from The Y Zone .John has had ongoing complications with finding the right department to deal with certain items he has found in the river, including dead animals. And he has voiced frustration at being sent from one department to another.In response to a query, a Department for Infrastructurespokesman said: ldquoThe Department maintains the River Bann on a cyclical basis to reduce flood risk and maintain the drainageof the watercourse.There are both rural and urban sections ofthe River Bann, that the Department maintains, with inspection frequencies ranging from every six years for rural sections to annually for urban sections.The urban section of the River Bann running through Portadown was last inspected on  January,  and no maintenance works were identied.ldquoThe Department does not have statutory responsibility for the removal of fallen livestock from a watercourse unless it is causing a signicant impediment to the flow of water. On designated watercourses the Department would only consider removing fallen livestock to the nearest bankit was causing, or likely to cause, a flooding problem. Such incidents where dead animals are found in a watercourse should be referred to the riparian landowner or the appropriate Local Authority.This week John discovered: , plastic bottles , glass bottles  cans  footballs  tennis balls  plastic buckets  black bags of rubbish .try catch  TrendingMan killed partner before killing and raping her teenage daughter in Newry apartment, inquest hearsStorm Ciara to batter NI with mph gales - weather warning upgraded to amber - possible impact on travel and electricity supplyBody of man found outside Antrim during search for missing Patrick Gibbons - post mortem to take placeThe funerals have taken place for the three McGinley children who were found leless at their west Dublin home last weekAlastair Stewart tweet: Julia Nightingale pays tribute to ITV news presenter forced to step down after social media error of judgement        v.. -  applyImgSrcs\" i sb  for   sb* sb u  o.dataset.srcu  u.replaceo.setAttributeo.setAttributedocumentwindowapplyImgSrcs JP  JP  JP  \"NA-BELFNEWS-\"JP  \"Latest News\"      Follow Us On       Explore News Sport Irish League Football Whats On Lestyle   Farming Le   More from the Belfast News Letter  Announcements Buy a Photo  Directory Jobs Homes Cars Local Guide  Public Notices  Reader Shop Must Read Read This Events   Useful Links Contact Us   Place your Ad Advertise a Job Subscribe  Readers Charter        ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"opinion","story":" getRequiredClientIdforjpiconsole.log requiredClientIdcatch]EV.Core.updateUserProfile]EV.Core.updateUserProfile....... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast News Letter and agreeing to JPIMedia Publishing Ltd#s standard Terms and Conditions.

This year, she will celebrate her ninety second birthday and she discusses a letime of activism across Europe.Veganuary is an annual event which encourages people to go vegan for a month. In last yearrsquos campaign, a quarter of a million people pledged to try a vegan diet.More NewsVale school pals brave the shave for animal charityPenarth father of four is recognised in New Year Honour list for services to cricketHouse prices increased in the Vale of Glamorgan, latest figures showOnce a fringe movement, veganism is quickly gaining a vast appeal, especially amongst the young, as the environmental benefits of a plant-based diet become clearer.According to a study by the Vegan Society, , people in the UK were vegan in  ndash  and a half times higher than in . Almost half of these were people aged below .Veganism has brought with it a lucrative trade in plant-based produce as businesses move to accommodate the concerns of their customers and promote ethical alternatives to meat.Long before veganism became a dietary and commercial trendsetter, however, June Holder, a -year-old woman from Penarth, had her eyes opened to the costly effects of meat consumption. After eating a vegan breakfast at a local cafeacute, she settled down to tell me her story.ldquoIrsquove been vegan for  years, she said. ldquoMy daughter had a stall at Camden Market, and she used to collect masses of money for animal rights there. It was her who first introduced me to the cause.ldquoLater on, I organized a charity coffee morning and sent the money I raised to Compassion in World Farming. In , they sent me a magazine which showed what happened to the animals. Well, I sat down that morning and read what theyrsquod sent me ndash and I was vegan!Whilst the public has become more receptive to veganism, June still encounters hostility: ldquoPeoplersquos reactions y when I tell them Irsquom vegan. They become hostile because theyrsquore guilty, I suppose.ldquoI remember that a vegan group had a stall in the market a few years ago. They were advertising parts of Alsatians to eat. People were horried. So, when they were angry, I had a chance to talk to them. lsquoYou accept that any animal can be treated like this except when it comes to your dogsrsquo, I told them. Well, they had to accept it. How could they not Originally from Penarth, June moved to Dinas Powys from Barry after her husband, Derrick, passed away  years ago.Derrick was the owner of Holders Menswear, a menrsquos fashion store which was once renowned throughout the Vale of Glamorgan and beyond.Junersquos decision to become vegan sparked  years of dedication to activism. She joined the Animal Welfare Party, and, in her sixties and seventies, she travelled across the UK and Europe to campaign for animal rights.ldquoI demonstrated in many places. I went to Brussels twice to protest against the exportation of live animals. The International Fund for Animal Welfare took us in a coach.ldquoI was in the front row of the crowd, up against these spikes and razor wire. If they had started to push from the back, I dread to think what would have happened.ldquoThe night before the protest I had this thought: lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo. I wrote it on a little board.ldquoPeople kept tapping me on the shoulder and passing the board around the crowd and eventually it made its way back to me.What does the message mean ldquoIt means that it is more dangerous not to protest against these injustices that are happening.June still has a copy of the placard. Later, at her home, she retrieved it from a trove of scattered paraphernalia accumulated after years of protest.She has written prolically throughout her le about events which have provoked and enthused her. One poem describes the day of protest in Brussels. It reflects Junersquos unceasing dedication to animal welfare but also her frustration at the pace of change:ldquoThe writer of these verses was, quite some time ago, in Brussels with a poster which now rings yet more true. lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo is what the message said.ldquoThen round it went to young and old for everyone to read. From countries all round Europe, but the farmers paid no heed. Live transport, a huge issue then, continues just the same.Another poem read:ldquoChristmas is a time to spend, but why not save instead  In sheds around the country to sate the publicrsquos lust for something huge to set their feast. The turkeys just exist.ldquoTen million in this country at Christmas time alone. Is this the way to talk of peace and teach our children love Veganuary runs throughout January.

The UKrsquos withdrawal from the EU will begin later this month and we have a Conservative Government in Westminster until at least .Regardless of the numbers in the Commons, the Labour Party still has to stand up for those we represent. I am confident that my colleague, Stephen Doughty MP will continue to do that.The Labour Party will now move to elect a new Leader and Deputy Leader, a chance to reunite the Party and hold the Prime Minister to account for his actions.I am truly glad to see that several MPs from across the Party have put their names forward to stand for both positions. This offers the membership and the country a broader choice.I am yet to decide who I will back in the forthcoming election but I know that I want to see a vision from each of the candidates. For me, that vision needs to be a realistic reflection of our last decade out of government in Westminster, but also a strategy for reconnecting with our voters and securing a Labour government which can deliver for those who need us most.Finally, I want to thank the staff across the NHS and wider public services for their hard work under increasing pressures, particularly during the winter period.Our public services work hard all year round and many take the sacrice of working over the Christmas and New Year period for which I, and many others, are extremely grateful.As everyou would like to speak with me, you can call my office on    or write to me at Vaughan.Gething@assembly.wales or Office of Vaughan Gething AM, Room C, National Assembly for Wales, CF NA. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Who they are will have a real influence on Welsh Labourrsquos prospects in  and beyond. We are the most successful part of the UK Labour family over the last decade in terms of winning elections and running a national government. However, that cannot be taken for granted. An unpopular UK leader could make our task much harder next May.The first and most important attribute the next UK leader must have is the ability to fulfil the mission of our party - to become a party of government again across the UK, not just a party of protest. I want someone who can implement our labour values in government, not just talk about them.That requires some honesty about why we took such a beating at the general election, together with the willingness and strength to do something about it. Offering more of the same would be a betrayal of people who need a UK Labour government and will condemn the UK [or what is left of it] to a further decade of the Tories.We didnrsquot get hammered in  for one reason alone - there were a number of them. Agreeing to the election in the first place when we plainly were not prepared. Agreeing to an election certain to be dominated by Brexit. Our vacillation on Brexit when people wanted certainty and leadership. The factional infighting. The demonisation of the last UK Labour government, asthat would encourage people to vote for us. I grew up with  Tory years in power and I know that things really did get better following Labourrsquos victory in .An overloaded manesto with some popular policies but without a key central message. A costed manesto that then had a huge extra spending pledge added to it, meaning that people didnrsquot believe that we were serious or credible one even the policies they liked. A staggeringly inept UK campaign that wasted the amazing dedication of our volunteers, prepared to go out in the cold and rain to campaign. Our abject failure on anti-Semitism. This and much more.Many people recognised that Boris Johnson is a dishonest man who is completely out of touch with most peoplersquos lives. Lots of people still voted for him or refused to vote Labour because they could not trust and support us. Our own people - long term Labour voters - struggled to support us. Our leader was undeniably part of the reason why. Blaming our defeat solely on the mainstream media or whichever side of the Brexit ide we favour isnt honest and will not help us to win in the future.I donrsquot much care whether someone claims they are from the left, soft left, centre or old right of the Labour Party. We all have a stake in our party and the countries of the UK. These are serious times and we need a serious figure who can nail the Tories and the clown in number ten.Irsquove been interested in what Lisa Nandy has to say and believe that Lisa and many other figures have a key role to play in rebuilding our party ndash first as a credible opposition, then as a credible alternative government at the next UK General Election.However, I think the person best placed to win the argument, and even more importantly to help us win an election, is Keir Starmer. Itrsquos not the protesting, or the taking part that counts. Itrsquos the winning and the decisions you get to make in government that can change peoplesrsquo lives and change the country for the better. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He acted to prosecute MPs who had abused expenses and Murdoch journalists in the phone-hacking scandal when he was Director of Public Prosecutions.We need to win back these voters that we lost in the last general election. It was heart-breaking on election night, to see Labour lose places like Wrexham and Bridgend.The UK Labour Party must get back to being a party that votersrsquo can trust. That means we cannot just have a ldquoone more heave approach. We need someone who can speak to the whole of our country, not just one region or subset of voters, with the values and vision to win. Keir fits the bill. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here.

The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay. While still a draft schedule of values, each council will also have to apply its own regional rate, based on the new proposed figures.“The Cathedral Quarter isn’t just about eating and drinking,” Gareth Neill, BID manager, Destination CQ told Ulster Business.“We have a vibrant ecosystem of arts and culture and fantastic built heritage that makes this area stand out, hospitality plays an integral part to the quality of le in this part of Belfast – for a city to be striving to attract new residents, increase our tourism offer these are crucial to the city’s success. “We are concerned about that the potential knock-on effects to the affected business owners and there’s a very real possibility it will have an impact on the price of a pint to the people who come to socialise in Cathedral Quarter. The knock-on effect of outdated methodology for calculation of rates on licensed premiseshas a potentially crippling effect on jobs and character of this area.”A spokesman for Land  Property Services said: “In Northern Ireland, nearly % of pubs will have no change or a decrease in their Net Annual Value .“Any business rate payer who thinks their new valuation may be incorrect, can contact LPS to arrange an informal review and supply any relevant information before the new valuation list comes into force on  April .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mip1.jpg","title":"mipim taking belfast to the world","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Joe ONeill and Suzanne Wylie Belfast Harbour boss Joe O’Neill will help lead a private and public sector delegation to MIPIM – the world’s biggest commercial property event – as chairman of the taskforce. He chats to John Mulgrew about the big announcements, fighting off the competition and attracting a global giant to Northern Ireland For Joe O’Neill and the wider delegation heading to potentially warmer climates, the proposition of selling the city and wider region to major investors has gotten easier.In the five years since Belfast ed to MIPIM – an event which sees tens of thousands descend on Cannes in France for four days of real estate and development – the private and public team, and taskforce, have developed a “strong ” in which to sell the city and Northern Ireland, with hopes of attracting a big name insurance or tech firm on the list.“MIPIM is a great  for the promotion of city-wide initiatives, and demonstrating to investors and to occupiers the growth potential in the city, and the opportunities for them and that the key stakeholders are all aligned behind an appropriate growth agenda,” Joe says.“You see dferent sizes and scales of stands out there – you see some really ambitious stands and proposed developments, so Belfast has to see it’s entry point into that. Belfast first and foremost will be competing against peer group cities within the UK… but then it is a worldwide show, so you will be competing against other cities.”Belfast is leading a major delegation this year, and will also be joined by representatives from other Northern Ireland councils, including those that are part of the Belfast Region City Deal, such as Mid  East Antrim. That deal is also going to be a focus for announcements and development, during the event.This year’s delegation will be led by a host of top private sector developers in Northern Ireland, alongside Belfast City Council and organisations such as Belfast Harbour. That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors. This year we are looking at launching schemes around digital innovation. That aligns with one of the themes in the Belfast Region City Deal, for the city and councils in the deal. We have a particular focus on cyber-security as an investment and operating location – particular those from the US.”Joe says that would be in addition to the already well-established cyber-security development at Catalyst in the Titanic Quarter, and that new names are coming in to the marketplace creating a “cluster” around the sector, and setting up Belfast and beyond as a new global hub.“We are looking at announcing some details around the Belfast-Dublin-London corridor,” Joe says.“As an economic corridor, or triangle. Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/johnm1.jpg","title":"companies must act quickly on new ir legislation reforms","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business At the start of this year the government launched a review into the changes to IR legislation which will affect medium and large private sector organisations and have far-reaching impacts on the way they engage with non-permanent workers, writes John Moore, managing director, Hays NI.The timeframe between the review and the reforms coming into effect in April is shorter than many would have liked but with the reforms now on the horizon, companies need to act, particularly those in sectors such as technology, construction and finance where use of contractors operating as personal services companiesis common. At a basic level, the reforms to IR legislation sht the responsibility of determining the tax status of personal services company workers to the company that engages them where previously they could self-certy. The original rules required the freelance contractor to determine their tax status, but HMRC believed non-compliance was common.Now,a person’s assignment falls outside of IR legislation, they are deemed to be self-employed, so gross payment will be made to the PSC. Butthe assignment falls inside of IR, the professional should be treated as an employee, applying PAYE and NIC deductions from their payment. In simple terms, the tax arrangements for contractors are changing so that they won’t get such a good dealthey can’t demonstrate their work is out of scope and employers will have to pay more for using and keeping what were previously non-payroll workers.This will have a big effect on how people choose to work and who they choose to work for, not to mention how organisations plan and budget. An organisation’s policy towards contractors will affect how attractive they are to freelancers. But on the other side we’ve already seen some risk averse companies adopt a blanket ban on freelancers just to be safe – meaning they are missing out on skilled professionals they need to deliver projects.In Northern Ireland, as where, it’s likely the IR reforms will hit technology hardest, but the effects could be wide ranging across roles in construction, project management and finance.We’ve heard anecdotal evidence of IT contractors leaving the big banks and starting to view early stage tech companies with less than  employees more favourably because they fall outside the scope of the legislation. When similar legislation was introduced in the public sector in , hundreds of highly skilled contractors left roles to join organisations who were prepared, often leading to projects being scrapped. Now the private sector is catching up, preparation is key and anyone who hasn’t done a review of what it means for their capacity should do so urgently. A Hays survey showed % of private sector firms expect cost increases when IR reforms come into effect, % expect to lose key talent and % think it will be harder to bring in non-permanent workers. A third of organisations surveyed were completely unaware of the reforms – a big concern given how tight the labour market is.So, first you need to determine whether assignments are inside or outside of IR. You need to have full visibility of all workers your organisation engages who are paid via agencies and consultancies as well as knowledge of how they are paid. You will also need to have the expertise to determine the tax status of each assignment. When you know that you can then start communicating with freelance workers, renegotiating working arrangements, standardising onboarding procedures and decidingany specialist skills need to be brought in house to get projects over the line.If you expect to use a high volume of temporary workers in , outsourcing your temporary worker provision through a managed services programme could be an option, as an expert would carry out accurate assessments for every temporary worker placed with you.Whatever stage you are at, don’t ignore IR. It’s coming and you need to understand it.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
