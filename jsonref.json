There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.\u0027The action was hugely controversial in the US, with critics saying it disrespected soldiers and the flag.

To re-employ some of the 400 or so “grandmasters” – his term for the highly skilled and experienced factory workers responsible for creating garments – who lost their jobs in 2002. Thanks to soaring demand, there are now 30 people on the payroll. With a focus on sustainability and ethically made fashion, the future looked promising. Alongside initiatives such as “free repairs for life”, the brand has launched inventive ranges such as jeans made from banana fibres. Then Covid-19 struck.“If you’re a business owner who’s spent a decade or two building up your company, the idea of it all disappearing in the space of a month or so is heartbreaking,” recalls Hieatt. The announcement that the UK government would provide support came as a huge relief.But the company’s production line didn’t completely shut down during the crisis. Hieatt’s team used their skills to make NHS scrubs. “We thought we should try and do something, so we bought fabric and made stuff, giving that to the NHS,” he explains. Garments were sent to the Royal Free in London, as well as local hospitals. “The one good thing that has come out of this is a sense of trying to help each other,” Hieatt adds.With the production team now back in full swing, the company’s future looks positive, despite the challenges. “Demand still seems to be strong and we’re in a pretty specialised market – super-high premium denim,” says Hieatt. “People might not be buying much, but they do buy special things. It feels like we might just come out of this strongly …”Alongside running a firm set up by his grandfather and seeing his company’s castings crop up everywhere from sculptures to submarines, one of the things that Andrew Young is proudest of at his Kirkintilloch foundry is its low turnover of staff. Ever since Archibald Young set up his eponymous firm in 1959, by buying a secondhand furnace for £5, its workers have had a tendency to stick around.Step inside the foundry today and you could meet an employee who has worked at the firm for 41 years, having started as a 16-year-old. Or the thirtysomethings who joined as teen apprentices and haven’t left. Earlier this year, the economic fallout from Covid-19 threatened to tarnish this remarkable retention rate. “To lose any of our staff would be hurtful,” says Young, the managing director. “We’d do anything to stave off redundancies.”It’s a problem the third-generation firm averted thanks to the UK government’s multi-billion pound job retention scheme, which has so far protected 8.5 million workers and 1m businesses. Having furloughed 27 out of Archibald Young’s 29 staff in late-March – Young and a finance manager stayed on – everybody returned to work after just three weeks.The word foundries may summon up Peaky Blinders-style visions of fiery furnaces, twisted metal and ash falling over murky towpaths. But these factories that produce metal castings (objects made by pouring molten metal into a mould) form an industry valued at more than £2.2bn and employing 17,000 people. By recycling scrap metal into new components, foundries help boost the circular economy too. Over the past 61 years, the foundry has made doors for the UK’s iconic red telephone boxes and a bronze St Cuthbert statue for the Holy Island of Lindisfarne. Today, it produces castings for customers in marine, civil and general engineering, shipbuilding and mining. It also makes nickel bronze castings for the UK’s submarine fleet.“Yes, our stuff is found at the bottom of the ocean,” jokes Young. “But at least it’s still operating.”Given Archibald Young’s work in the energy sector, as well as for the Ministry of Defence, its business was deemed “essential” so all employees were able to return from furlough on 20 April.The story doesn’t end there. Although the company is currently busy, Young notes that its robust workflow is largely the result of staff working on contracts predating the Covid-19 pandemic. The future is less certain. “One of the reasons we came back in April is because our order book was pretty healthy, but that’s based on what customers required before entering shutdown,” he points out. “But it’s taking a dip now. General engineering will see things go quieter over the next quarter. Based on that, I can see the possibility of us utilising the job retention scheme again.”However, he doesn’t envisage placing the majority of Archibald Young staff on furlough as he did in March. Instead, he intends to rotate them. Under the job retention scheme, employers have the freedom to rotate their workforce (with the minimum of three weeks off, then three weeks on). It’s given businesses reassurance that most of their employees’ wages will be covered should demand wane. From 1 July, companies will also be able to bring furloughed employees back to work part-time.“Things aren’t over yet,” says Young. “The job retention scheme was absolutely helpful for Archibald Young and we’ll be dipping back into it, no doubt … Business has been reasonable to the family for 61 years, and long may it continue …”This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

It retains a total of $2.6bn in customers’ cash, with many having accepted vouchers for future sailings in 2021.Many ships – with crew onboard – remain offshore and unable to dock because of restrictions imposed by governments. Carnival said 21,000 employees were still on its ships, about a quarter of its crew, but it expected to return most of them home by the end of June.The company warned it would face ongoing operating and administrative costs of about $250m per month once all of its ships are in “paused status”. Only 61 of more than 100 ships in the fleet have so far managed to reach harbour.The group plans to sell six cruise ships, which typically cost between $500m and $1bn new, as it seeks to adjust to an uncertain future.Carnival said it could not predict when normal business would resume. However, it “expects to resume guest operations, after collaboration with both government and health authorities, in a phased manner, with specific ships and brands returning to service over time”.It expects the first cruise holidays to return “will be from a select number of easily accessible homeports”, rather than the fly-cruise market, and that its fleets will be smaller.Carnival said it had raised more than $6.6bn this year in bonds and share issues to boost its liquidity.It said earlier this year that the sector may never fully recover, after being centre stage during the early part of the pandemic. Passengers on the Diamond Princess were confined to a cabin off Japan in February, while the Ruby Princess was identified as a key importer of Covid-19 to Australia.The cruise operator, which had to repatriate passengers at a huge cost, faces lawsuits from passengers on coronavirus-hit ships.In another sign of the industry’s struggles, the British cruise line company Cruise and Maritime Voyages said on Wednesday it was in emergency discussions with prospective investors and lenders after a potential loan deal collapsed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fdebc0aff7a9fb21747eafb0f09960b57587326f/0_118_3737_2242/master/3737.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026s=25ec43bc6f9ead70b2360bd48fc30e68","title":"i dont want to go to university next year what can i do instead","story":"If you’re planning to defer your university place until next year, you have gap year options in the meantimeOne in five students said\u0026nbspthey were willing to defer going to university in the event that, come September, uni isn’t back to normal, according to a recent poll by the University and College Union. That leaves a whole lot of school-leavers –\u0026nbsp120,000 to be precise – potentially twiddling their thumbs.\u0026nbspHistorically there has been a direct correlation between times of economic strife and hikes in student enrolment, so industry observers are sceptical that there will be mass deferrals. Then again, the sheer ubiquity of the catchphrase “these unprecedented times” suggests that nothing is certain. For the University Guys’ David Hawkins, rethinking your options involves having an honest conversation with yourself about risk versus reward. What were your reasons before January for going to university? How has the pandemic changed your circumstances, your motivations and your finances? To what extent will it continue to threaten your health?Of course, one reason for not going to uni this year might be that you’re simply unhappy with your A-level results. Retaking your exams in the autumn is possible, but bear in mind that the 2020 applicant cohort was going to be the smallest in 18 years, even before Covid-19 hit. Moreover, with the gap left by those international students who don’t take up their offers, universities will have seats to fill. While the government has warned against unconditional offers and lowering standards, admissions processes will potentially be more flexible. Clearing starts on 6 July, so keep an eye out. Most importantly, though, deferrals in 2020 will only result in greater competition in 2021. Not only will there be more people applying: if universities have to make cuts this year, there will be fewer places.The pandemic has led Griffith Smith, currently in year 13 in Hackney, London, to a switch from the anthropology degree he’d applied for to architecture. And then, in the light of the protests he has taken part in, to really questioning whether architecture was the right way to go too. “Seeing so much injustice in the world makes me, and many other people my age, want to get involved in politics.” His gap year plans – traveling around New Zealand – have been similarly shaken up. The same applies to studying abroad. Charlie Ball, Prospects’ head of higher education intelligence, says there are no nations telling students not to come in September. Australia is mooting a shorter quarantine period for students from as early as next month and New Zealand’s 14-day group quarantine for international student arrivals will double up as an induction period. But, Ball warns, if a second bout of coronavirus piggybacks on flu season next year, will you be OK being in lockdown that far from home? In Canada, McGill University has announced that autumn 2020 courses will primarily be delivered online, meaning you could in theory not even travel to Montreal to get stuck in. It can help to remember that everyone’s plans have been affected. As YouTuber Jack Edwards, who has just done his finals in English literature at Durham University, points out, “when a future employer or university sees we’re the class of 2020, it’s not like we’ll have to add a disclaimer. They’re going to know.” His advice is to seize the day and set up opportunities for yourself.Resit A-levels? You will be able to retake your exams in the autumn – most likely in November – either through your school, a sixth-form college or online, via the likes of Pearson Edexcel and Cambridge Assessment International.Work in the UK? You could apply to be a seasonal fruit picker (Pick For Britain), a courier (Hermes, say, or Citysprint) or a supermarket freshness specialist. The NHS contact tracing recruitment process has been paused, but given the fluid situation there, it’s worth looking out for future position call-outs.Travel abroad? While the UK governmental advice that all non-essential travel be avoided still holds, there are no countries expressly ruling out foreign arrivals from September. STA, StudentUniverse and other student-focused travel agencies are all taking risk-free bookings (no date changes or cancellation fees). For tours, work schemes and other activities check back in closer to the time, as they will be contingent on social distancing measures. And make sure you are aware of any visa requirements, and consulate or embassy closures.Study abroad? No countries are saying international students will not be able to come in September. Each university however is working out their own approach to social distancing and possible remote learning facilities in the event of a future lockdown. Pay close attention to how well the university you’re interested in communicates these plans with you. Bear in mind that the student loan is not portable outside the UK."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b49548517d4c8d9072a6ebe0e4f5847bd47fdbfc/0_49_3616_2168/master/3616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dcbdca5aeb011e7dfda5ad88e4ef4b1b","title":"from pressure to the last tree 10 of the best black british films","story":"A celebration of the pioneering films reflecting black life in Britain over the last 40 years As UK Black Lives Matter protests roar, and the foulness of the Windrush scandal festers, it is a crucial time to e into black British history. “Historic” certainly describes the first ever black British feature film: Horace Ové’s Pressure, an absorbing 1976 drama about the everyday struggles of a London-born son (Herbert Norville) of Trinidadian parents. Amazon Prime VideoBFI Player (£)This riveting and uncompromising documentary from 1978 features a host of black British civil rights activists describing and crisply critiquing institutional and everyday racism across the country in the 1970s.

The average spend at Waitrose is £8.16 a bottle, more than for other still wines. So what can you get for under that?I had to plough through a fair number to kiss my prince, but there are some good buys under £8, and not just those on promotion. True, Provence is a struggle but the rest of southern France can even deliver under £7, as can neighbouring Spain and, occasionally, Italy.\u0026nbspThis peach-coloured Spanish rosé is, surprisingly, also peachy flavoured – almost as if it did have peaches or nectarines in it. Soft, rounded and voluptuous, the wine to sip on a warm afternoon or drink with a fat squidgy burrata.Ignoring the slightly irritating “proudly vegan” labelling, given a lot of wines are suitable for vegans nowadays, this is a satisfyingly characterful rosé. Frutti without being tutti. Brownie points too for some interesting pairings, including fried okra with spices, quinoa salad, and tomato and olive crostini. And, er, vegan in case you hadn’t got the message.The name and slightly girly-looking bottle may put off the brosé brigade (that is, men who drink rosé) but this is a convincing Provence drinkalike – pale, crisp and attractively citrusy. Have a glass with some prawns or smoked salmon.Fruité is the right word for this deep-coloured rosé, which is full of redcurrant and raspberry flavours. Despite the modest alcohol, it is quite gutsy and more of a barbecue than a picnic wine. And proof, at this price, that the Wine Society can and does compete with the supermarkets.You have to go for the mix-six deal to get this Italian rosé for under £8 but you would be mad to buy from Majestic on any other basis. A delicate, pale rosé with a fresh lemony bite that would be perfect with a plate of linguine and prawns with a fresh tomato sauce.\u0026nbsp This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

The camera moved to show an Asian man before zooming in on a bottle of antiseptic handwash.“I feel very, very sorry that Dele is not playing,” Mourinho said. “He’s a player that works so, so hard during all this period and he’s really frustrated that he cannot play the first match. I don’t think he deserves a one-match ban compared with wrong behaviours at much bigger dimensions that happened during this period without any consequences.“I don’t like these kind of contradictions. It’s for everybody or it’s for nobody and it’s quite unfair for a kid who made a mistake and apologised for it … I really don’t agree with it.”Mourinho was asked to name who he was thinking about in terms of people who had broken the lockdown rules and he brought up his own breach – when he was pictured with the Spurs midfielder Tanguy Ndombele on a common in north London, together with a couple of other men. At that point, people were permitted to exercise outdoors only with members of their own household.The manager said he had “spent two minutes” with Ndombele, “nothing more than that”, trying to teach him how to use the “wifi GPS” vests with which the club monitor player performance.“The pictures taken in the park of me speaking with a little group of young men … they were not my players, they were players from a Championship club. I was there at the right distance having a little talk with them and the pictures gave the idea I was with my players, which was not true. It was still a mistake.”Mourinho is waiting to hear whether he will lose another player to suspension with an FA panel still to rule on Eric Dier’s charge for entering the stands after the FA Cup penalty shootout loss at home to Norwich on 4 March. Dier wanted to confront an abusive fan who had become embroiled in an argument with his youngest brother. The FA has given no updates and, in the meantime, Dier is expected to start in central defence against United alongside Toby Alderweireld.Mourinho said Harry Kane, Son Heung-min and Moussa Sissoko would start against United after recovering fitness but there is a doubt over Giovani Lo Celso, who had a groin injury before the shutdown.Mourinho discussed the stark reality of Spurs’s financial situation, acknowledging how clubs such as United and Chelsea were effectively operating in different markets. “We are going, as always, to be very balanced,” Mourinho said. “But I expect us to do some little important things … to improve in two or three positions.”Jan Vertonghen, who is out of contract on 30 June, is expected to sign a short-term extension to keep him at the club for the final matches of the season, before leaving for Italy or Spain."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/34cdad4fa23acc1961af913a48a2821a8b11aeda/2_0_3020_1814/master/3020.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=01070c602f13e525e28ade2d51b0d94b","title":"all at stake championship resumes world cup leeds west brom","story":"A captivating yet fragile ision begins its frenzied run-in on Saturday with Leeds and West Brom well-placed for promotion but much else is hard to call and precarious finances loom largeOn the face of it, it is not the most mouthwatering Championship ding-dong but if anything sums up the increasingly dog-eat-dog nature of the ision it is confirmation that the bottom club, Barnsley, this week refused to allow Mallik Wilks to extend his loan at Hull for the remainder of the season for fear of strengthening a relegation rival. Looking after number one is the priority with nine games remaining, even if they are clinging on to their second-tier status by a thread and so, at the end of the month, Wilks will return to Barnsley, ineligible to join their fight for survival.That is not even the worst bit as far as Hull are concerned given their captain, Eric Lichaj, and vice-captain, Jackson Irvine, will play no part in the run-in after failing to agree short-term extensions. Hull were in freefall when the season was paused in March – they hover a place above the relegation zone after taking two points from the past available 33 – and, despite welcoming back a handful of players from injury, they resume in an arguably bigger pickle.Saturday’s match at home to Charlton is seismic. Win for the first time since New Year’s Day and they earn some respite lose and they are in the mire. But Charlton badly need a pick-me-up, too Lee Bowyer rallied his squad after Lyle Taylor opted out of playing for fear of jeopardising a “life-changing move” and the club recently changed hands for the third time this season, though the takeover is yet to be approved by the English Football League.Last week mid-table Queens Park Rangers allowed Marc Pugh to depart because they could not afford for him to trigger a 12-month contract extension, and Gary Sweet, the Luton chief executive, has warned his club could face “financial oblivion” if Nathan Jones, reappointed as manager last month, fails to steer them clear of relegation. Dropping into the third tier would be catastrophic for Stoke, Huddersfield or Middlesbrough, all of whom had designs of competing at the other end of the table but are dangling precariously above the bottom three. The outlook looks particularly bleak for Jonathan Woodgate, whose Boro side have won one of their past 13 matches and are the ision’s lowest scorers.Leeds on the other hand appear to be crisis-free at the top of the table after racking up five wins (and five clean sheets) on the bounce following a winter wobble and boast the best defence. In Kalvin Phillips and Ben White, both of whom are on the radar of the England manager, Gareth Southgate, they possess two of the most exciting players outside the top flight, and the spine of the side is another year wiser.This time last season Leeds ran out of puff and, even though Marcelo Bielsa has been working his players hard during lockdown, the prolonged break could prove a blessing in disguise. Leeds supporters may be unable to attend stadiums to watch their team attempt to get over the line but more than 15,000 fan cutouts will have a seat at Elland Road as the drama unfolds.At West Bromwich Albion, who sit a point behind Leeds, Slaven Bilic has been referring to the run-in as a “small World Cup” and, given his experience at major tournaments with Croatia, that bodes well. West Brom, too, are more than capable of going the distance, with Grady Diangana’s return a major boon for the ision’s joint-highest scorers.There is a good chance the top two could be out of sight within eight days of the restart but much hinges on a sometimes-erratic Fulham, who have the ammunition to make life interesting. Brentford, for whom Pontus Jansson is back fit, need to rediscover some rhythm to make sure of a top-six berth, while Nottingham Forest are fifth but have work to do having won one of their past six matches.And then there is the Championship’s pièce de résistance: a tantalising play-off race encompassing at least nine teams stretching as far down as 13th-placed QPR. Preston are primed, Bristol City can go close after Benik Afobe’s return from injury and, across the Severn Bridge, Cardiff, who have been steady if not spectacular since Neil Harris took charge, are confident of mounting a challenge.Meanwhile Millwall are free of expectation and have a kind run-in a youthful Swansea side including the talented Conor Gallagher could yet click it would be foolish to discount Derby, whose captain, Wayne Rooney, craves a fairytale finish and Blackburn being overlooked for the initial round of televised matches suggests they are strangely unfancied. Predicting how the final table will look on 22 July is anyone’s guess."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c09e3ad4c5c22ea4d604d89e0eda74348ab7d6a/0_346_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a1dbd3d05e3c6fc48f9a084f17921b30","title":"mumbai discovers life isnt so sweet without the workers it once ignored","story":"Lockdown precipitated an exodus of day labourers and “wallahs” but as monsoon season breaks their loss is being feltAs the monsoon lashes Mumbai and black clouds darken the skyline, the city is in the grip of nostalgia for the men who used to keep daily life ticking as rhythmically and comfortingly as a Swiss watch. Men who are missing.The men who cleared the drains of silt so that the rains don’t cause flooding and water-borne diseases such as leptospirosis. The electricians who came to fix breakdowns caused by wind and rain. The sanitation workers who used to spray neighbourhoods with mosquito repellent before the monsoon to prevent vector-borne diseases such as malaria, dengue fever and chikungunya. All are missing even though the monsoon officially arrived last weekend.Many of these workers and handymen were migrant labourers. They fled the city when the pandemic left them destitute and hungry. “Although the government of Maharashtra boasted it was giving them cooked meals, it used to deliver 5,000 food packets for 10,000 people. Families starved,” said Sarita Sable, a voluntary worker in Dharavi slum.Before their mass exodus, well-heeled residents had never noticed them. They were always there, cheap cogs tucked away in the crevices of the city, their presence visible only when needed to fix a blocked toilet or deliver pizzas, and instantly forgotten.Now their absence is felt. A city already buckling under coronavirus and facing the annual ritual of catastrophic flooding from the rains is realising its dependence on daily wage labourers.For the average family, the fruit and vegetable vendors parked so conveniently on the road outside their homes in a high-rise are absent. Lots of other “wallahs” are also gone: the chai wallah pouring out steaming masala tea from old-fashioned metal teapots, the juice wallah serving oxidant-rich pomegranate juice, the press wallah who ironed your clothes and delivered them, neatly folded and wrapped inside a sheet like a gift, to your door, and the autorickshaw wallah who dropped your child off at school.Rekha Sabharwal, whose family manufactures ceiling fans, said the words of Joni Mitchell’s song Big Yellow Taxi – Don’t it always seem to go, that you don’t know what you’ve got till it’s gone – keeps going around in her head. “Now they aren’t around, I realise they made up the sights and sounds of the city. When I can’t get a plumber or the grocery store owner says he hasn’t got any delivery boys, I get frustrated,” she said.Worst of all perhaps for a city that loves home-cooked food for lunch, the famous dabbawallas (yet another wallah) have also disappeared. These men have been studied by Harvard for their logistical feat in picking up lunch from a customer’s home and dropping it off at their office, armed only with a unique code for every lunchbox, and rarely getting any delivery late or wrong.For the first time in 125 years, most of the 5,000 dabbawallas have gone home to their villages, defeated by the virus and the lockdown. Given the nature of their work, involving contact with dozens of people on public transport to deliver some 200,000 lunchboxes every day, who was going to hire their services in the middle of a contagion?Apart from the labour shortage whittling away all the little comforts that make daily life pleasant, industrialists are also frustrated. They are gearing up for business again as the city gradually starts easing the lockdown but cannot find guards, technicians, electricians, sweepers, packers or assembly-line workers. The chief minister of Maharashtra, Uddhav Thackeray, has expressed concern that the city’s infrastructure projects should not be delayed. He has urged employers to hire local workers rather than those from other states. Few want to take him up on this suggestion.“Migrant workers accept less pay, longer hours and harsher working conditions. Local people will not tolerate this – they have a sense of justice, are rooted in society and enjoy social support. Migrant labourers are herded into factories and hostels and feel cut off and isolated from the society around them,” said DL Karad, national vice-president of the Centre of Indian Trade Unions.He is amused at how employers, many of which ignored migrant workers at their time of greatest need, are now desperate for them to return. Employers have sent out “contractors” who, for a commission, scour villages in the states around Mumbai for skilled and semi-skilled workers to work for daily wages.“Most of them aren’t coming back. First they were treated like slaves by employers and then they were treated like stray dogs by society during the lockdown. Some, perhaps, may return. But only if they are starving,” said Karad.For the moment, the immediate concern is the drains. By now, the city’s 2,900km drain network (which dates to British times) should have been cleared of silt and debris in preparation for the monsoon flooding to avoid people having to wade through filthy water up to their waists.The annual deluge invariably leads to hospitals being besieged by people with water-borne diseases, particularly those from densely populated areas and slums. This year, with hospitals buckling under the strain of coronavirus, the health system might just collapse if it has to cope with monsoon-related diseases too.“Though some work has been done on de-silting the drains, a lot still remains because of the manpower shortage. The biggest concern is the low-lying areas which flood first,” said Ashwini Thakur of Mumbai First, which works to improve the quality of life in the city.“We are just hoping for the best.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7c17bc1a12ad7300614b87a684125e18197d7a7/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b49f4c2e4d8c57236b5a76442457a0b","title":"experience i built the first skatepark in syria","story":"When we built the bowl, I put the kids on a board one by one – they were amazed by the feeling of rolling alongSkateboarding has been my life since I was eight years old. Before I knew how to stand up, I would sit on my cousin’s old board and roll down the hills of Cáceres, my home town in Spain. My mum always worried I’d break a bone.When I was at university, I heard about Skate-Aid, an organisation that builds skateparks for children in disadvantaged communities. I’ve always wanted to make a positive impact on the world, and if there was a way to do that through skateboarding, then I was in. Every project is different. In Rwanda and Kenya, I worked with orphans and children from very poor backgrounds. In Namibia, I taught kids who were visually impaired. Part of the reason skating is good for kids psychologically is that it is challenging. If you want to learn a new trick you have to practise, and if you persevere, you’ll get there. The philosophy is simple: get up and try again. It’s an amazing form of self-development.I got a call in early 2019 to say the next project would be in Syria. I was apprehensive. While I was living in Africa, I got used to walking past soldiers with guns slung over their shoulders, but Syria was a different story. When I told my family I was considering going, they thought I was crazy, but I wanted to see the country with my own eyes.We flew to Lebanon and drove the rest of the way, taking a half-destroyed road from Beirut to Damascus. We stopped at military checkpoints every few minutes. I was anxious – I didn’t understand Arabic, and all the men I could see were armed. But our driver would hand over water or cigarettes, and we’d be allowed through.Our destination was Qudsaya, a city 7km west of Damascus that was held by rebels until 2016. As we drove through the centre, the scars from the fighting were everywhere: roads were puckered with cracks buildings covered in bullet holes, in which birds had built nests.I was immediately touched by people’s generosity. The area where we were building the skatepark had been largely destroyed, except for a small concrete structure where a family of four were living. They’d had to flee their home in the north. The mother was so welcoming, bringing us tea and coffee every morning before she even knew why we were there.It took our group 28 days to build the park. We’d get up early and spend all day working. Most people didn’t understand what we were doing at first – this was going to be Syria’s first skatepark – but once we showed them videos of our other projects, they wanted to help.We stayed in a house close to the site, and on the walk home from work we would buy falafels and fruit from nearby shops. Someone would always start speaking to us in French, Italian or German, because many locals had family abroad. The first time we went in, they wouldn’t let us pay. No tourists had been to the city in years and they were grateful we were there.We only had power once a day, so there wasn’t much electricity or hot water, but everyone in the area was in the same situation. We didn’t need luxury our days were so exhausting we’d just come home and sleep.There were moments I’ll never forget. One night I was woken by a huge blast and told there had been a missile strike on a military store 50km away. You fear for your life in those situations, but then you look at the children and realise this is what they face every day.The kids would watch us skating down the street and were so excited. When we finished the bowl, I put them on a board one by one and they were amazed by the feeling of rolling along. One boy was a natural he had never skated before, but within a week he was already dropping in from the edge. It can take kids months to do that.We stayed for two months, then local volunteers took over. I keep in touch with the kids on Facebook and they send me videos of the tricks they’ve learned. When we left, there were 400 children involved, going to the park every day. I’ve been to so many countries, but Syria was special. I built friendships with people even if we could only communicate with gestures. I’ll go back as soon as I can. • As told to Pip Cook.Do you have an experience to share?

It feels silly to be overcome by emotion, but it’s beautiful to be part of a large group of people doing the same simple activity. I usually love running because it is solitary, for me at least – I don’t run with a buddy or a running club. But race days are special.When lockdowns first began in New York in March and everyone started to cancel – well, everything – the fate of the NYRR Brooklyn Half Marathon, which I usually run each year, seemed up in the air. As it increasingly became evident there would be no treatment or vaccine for months or years, it was obvious the race would need to be called off. It would have been the 40th running of the Brooklyn Half, which claims to be the largest half in the US. Usually close to 30,000 people run the route each May, from Prospect Park to the Coney Island boardwalk.I felt sad about it, but also guilty for feeling sad. I know I am fortunate to still have a job which can be done from home, and to like the people I’m in lockdown with (my husband, Will, and 20-month-old son, Marvin).So I decided to run a half marathon alone. But it wasn’t really on my own. Forty-four people were there with me, in my ears at least. In lieu of an in-person cheering squad, Will organized a spreadsheet of five-minute windows for friends and family to call me while I ran.The day of the race, rain was forecast – which in these times is a positive, because it means fewer people to maintain distance from on the sidewalks. The streets weren’t totally empty, but empty enough that I could pull down my face mask for a breath of fresh air during several stretches.The logistics were tricky – answering a phone call every five minutes via Bluetooth while keeping a decent pace in the rain wasn’t easy. My fingers became slippery – once I rudely hung up on a friend by accident and scrambled to call back before his allotted time was up.Several people spoke without stopping, as though leaving me a live voice message, insisting that I not waste my breath by responding. Others played me songs to keep up my stamina – I was serenaded with Robyn, Gang of Four and 90s-era Jock Jams staples. My parents walked in solidarity while on the call, others were in a different time zone and still in bed. I gave a lot of live weather reports – not raining now, a few drops coming down, now it’s a heavy downpour!Two very creative friends booked two time slots so that they could perform impossibly bad dialogue from a scene in Showgirls (“I used to love doggie chow, too!”), and I laughed so much I drew confused looks from the few people I passed on the wide running path by the water.My pace was slower than usual, but I didn’t mind – the distance was my goal, which felt more possible as the time flew by in five-minute bursts of conversation. The hardest part was ending conversations when I wanted to keep talking.At the end of the Brooklyn half, thousands of runners are forced to funnel onto a slim wooden ramp that leads to the boardwalk in Coney Island. It’s joyously chaotic. The finish line is a crowded assemblage of sweaty runners, boardwalk eateries, volunteers handing out water, and bystanders. It’s staggering to even picture such a scene in these times.Meanwhile during my solo half, as I approached the New York Harbor, the rain held off for a moment while a spectral fog made the Verrazzano Bridge barely visible. It was quietly striking – a moment to absorb the solitude before my phone rang again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a77d7095c64a953486f66664c496ed18cd9ab378/78_157_4114_2469/master/4114.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=97fe9c26ea97b385aef1664fe3cd1c45","title":"this night owl would love to be a lark the things i could do before midmorning","story":"It’s a small miracle to wake up naturally feeling refreshedRise and shine! Something I have never said in my life, except perhaps to a one-night stand, to give them a hint. In the language of lifestyle magazines, wellbeing websites and, well, nature: are you a night owl or an early-morning lark?I am a night owl, though that is usually under the duress of insomnia. Rather than lying in the dark and fretting about how little sleep I am going to get, and how tired this will make me the next day, I try to get up and do something productive (I use the word very loosely). If I had the ability to change myself in this particular regard (believe me, I have tried many things, at much expense to my finances and dignity), I would choose to be a lark.It’s not that I don’t sometimes quite like to have the world to myself in the tiny hours of the morning, although it doesn’t feel that way as much now that we are globally connected and I can hear the latest idiocy Trump has spouted before the UK awakes. (I have also written before about my night bus jaunts.)And I would never aim to be as irritating as the Silicon Valley tech bros, who claim to run marathons and cure certain cancers and then, and only then, settle down for their first coffee at 7am. But it would be nice to have a chunk of achievement under one’s belt by my midmorning banana. It would be nice to peel it with a greater sense of satisfaction, reflecting on a to-do list that isn’t quite as long.I’m loth to go too much into the science of rapid-eye movement and 90-minute sleep cycles, lest I sound like an app or those printouts the GP hands you, received with disappointment – even though you know the addiction stats on sleeping pills. We are in agreement that the modern normal of being brutally woken by an alarm, having our sleep pick-pocketed and emptied and scattered all over the bedroom floor, isn’t great.Which leads me to the smug delectation of waking up naturally. Not, you understand, waking before the alarm and knowing one hasn’t had enough sleep and that it’s too close to the set time to do anything about it but waking up naturally and feeling refreshed. Feeling that the day will be a good one, because the brain’s engine has kicked into gear with a full tank of gas. It is a sort of small miracle, and I have yet to discover a better way to start the day this smug boost, this gentle blessing. This brief sojourn as an early bird pumped to catch each and every worm."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/724a3dbff4aacde0bf1f84a541470acc25179ce1/0_19_2160_1297/master/2160.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9ccfae668842f587c7b830b83d9d5c6f","title":"uk extends payments freeze for consumers struggling with debt","story":"People in financial difficulty can defer payments on credit cards and loans until 31 OctoberThe UK’s financial watchdog has extended emergency measures to allow consumers struggling financially due to the coronavirus outbreak to freeze loan and credit card payments until 31 October.The measures, which were announced by the Financial Conduct Authority in April for an initial period of three months, also includes overdrafts, store cards and catalogue credit.In April the UK government set out these five tests it said had to be met before they would consider easing coronavirus lockdown restrictions:Customers who have yet to request a payment freeze, or an arranged interest-free overdraft up to £500, can apply for one until 31 October.For consumers who have already taken one and are still experiencing temporary payment difficulties due to the health emergency, the FCA said firms must continue to offer support including further payment deferral, or reducing payment amounts to a manageable level, for a further three months.“We have been working closely with other authorities, lenders and debt charities to support consumers in the current emergency,” said Christopher Woolard, interim chief executive at the FCA. “The proposals we’ve announced today would provide an expected minimum level of financial support for consumers who remain in, or enter, temporary financial difficulty due to coronavirus.”At the end of a first payment freeze, firms are expected to contact customers to see if they an afford to resume payments, and if so how they can repay missed payments.“Where consumers can afford to make payments, it is in their best long-term interest to do so, but for those who need help, it will be there,” said Woolard.Customers who have already arranged an interest free overdraft and are still struggling can request another one of up to £500. They will also be able to request a reduced interest rate on any additional borrowing in excess of £500.The FCA’s new guidance does not apply to other consumer credit products such as motor finance, pay day loans and buy-now pay-later. The regulator said that the separate guidance it has previously issued covering these products will be updated soon."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5bd079178d76cda8ba53e12f0a5d85d9d93c2192/0_0_7952_4770/master/7952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f21ae59e96582ae2e42c8779b98b0a6d","title":"norah jones i worried about being swallowed up by success","story":"The singer-songwriter reflects on her eclectic back catalogue, from a breakthrough mellow jazz smash to collaborations with Danger Mouse and Jeff Tweedy To this day, it is hard to reconcile the supernatural success of Norah Jones’s debut album with the shy 22-year-old at its centre. Released in 2002, Come Away With Me went many times platinum around the world, and remains one of the biggest-selling records of all time. Jones did not enjoy the frenzy that emerged around her, particularly the media’s fixation with her relationship with the sitar great Ravi Shankar, the once-estranged father with whom she had only recently been reacquainted. “I was trying to have fun with the success, but at the same time, I was a little too worried about getting swallowed up by it all,” she says.Today, she is calling from her Brooklyn bedroom around the start of lockdown, stealing an hour away from homeschooling her two young children to discuss the musical highlights of her career. There is a parallel there with the song she selects from Come Away With Me. Jones wrote only a few songs on her debut album, and Seven Years was not one of them her then-boyfriend, the bassist Lee Alexander, wrote it after seeing a home video of Jones dancing as a child. “It was just a very sweet sentiment,” she says. “A child in her own world, being happy and content.”As breezy as Come Away With Me sounded, recording it took two attempts. Jones’s voice got lost on the first recordings, although Seven Years survived those sessions. “I was in the studio with a bunch of musicians that I respected so much but just didn’t know that well,” she says. “Because I wasn’t super comfortable, maybe that’s why I didn’t come through.” A second go, aided by the renowned producer Arif Mardin, provided the goods, and made Jones the seminal jazz label Blue Note’s first pop icon.While only a fraction older than the likes of Britney and Christina, Jones existed in an another universe, although she thinks she attended one MTV video music awards ceremony. “I felt like I was crashing a lot of parties, I’ll put it that way.” Some critics theorised that listeners were drawn to the album’s comforting vibe in the aftermath of 911. She disagreed at the time, “but looking back, I definitely think that could have been part of it”.The only way to follow such a smash was to let go, says Jones. The dreamy Sunrise is a testament to the easy feeling she got from playing with the guitarists Kevin Breit and Adam Levy, recording her second album on a mountain in upstate New York and channelling the her love of Dolly Parton, who guested on Feels Like Home. Contradicting critics who dismissed it as bland, the New Yorker described Jones’s second album as “one big booty call” and claimed her music was all about sex. “I definitely don’t agree!” she laughs. “Though people relate to music how they relate to it, so I don’t disagree, either. In college, I had an album I liked to listen to with my boyfriend at the time. Everybody has that album, right? Fine with me if it’s one of mine.”The more pointed criticisms sometimes got to her. “But whatever, should I crawl in a hole and not release music because of some other person?” The music industry, however, couldn’t get enough, and the “Norah effect” precipitated the signing of Amy Winehouse, Katie Melua, Joss Stone and numerous other soulful young women. Jones didn’t mind their music but was less keen on the association. “It wasn’t stuff I wanted to listen to, and when people would put me in the same category as someone else, I wouldn’t agree,” she says. “But I had to separate myself from it all. The truth is some great artists came out of that and that’s awesome.”Jones wrote Rosie’s Lullaby while touring Australia, about a friend who was going through a hard time. But it is not hard to interpret the lyrics about a woman “feelin’ so small  At the bottom of the world” as self-reflection. “It was probably about both of us,” she admits. Jones felt “kinda depressed” when making her third album, Not Too Late. “I was lonely and sad and the world was kinda falling apart.” Touring the second album had been crazier still than the first. “I was just trying to keep together, to be honest,” she says. “I was drinking on tour, and I was never a super-destructive drinker, which is good, but I was still just drinking a lot, which is not great.” There were fun times, she recalls, and good meals, but touring for the best part of a year, “you get a little delirious”.Looseness became a release valve. Not Too Late came together from off-the-cuff recording sessions that Jones hid from her label. She started various side projects: the countrified Little Willies, the rockier El Madmo. “We were playing sports arenas in France, which was insane,” she says of her day job. “We set up our instruments backstage in some men’s locker room and would write silly pop songs that became the El Madmo record, trying to find ways to stay sane.”Jones’s “mind’s racing” on this song from The Fall, as a message from a lover leaves her “mixed up”. The sentiment could be anxious or anticipatory. “I was probably feeling both things, to be honest,” says Jones. She and Alexander had broken up, prompting her to seek an entirely new band and a different sound.The Fall is darker and smokier than her previous albums, intermingling the spirits of Dusty Springfield and Massive Attack. It was also her first album primarily comprised of her own writing: she credits Ryan Adams, who plays on the album, with encouraging her when she felt insecure about her abilities. “It lifted me up as a songwriter and made me feel validated.” She says she doesn’t know much about the allegations against him. “It just wasn’t my experience with him. I feel bad for everybody involved.”You can hear Jones coming into her own on The Fall, her dramatic vocals standing out instead of following the flow as she had on previous records. Performing covers, she says, “you’re listening to the sound of your voice a little more instead of delivering the lyrics”. But writing original material, “I was delivering the lyrics a little more”. Coming out of a relationship that she had been in for most of her 20s was jarring. “We had been together since before my first album came out, so then it became navigating who I was post-success, without that partner who was with me through it all,” she says. “It was a very strange time. But I had a lot of good friends who I knew from before, and in New York, there’s always some good music to go and hear.”Jones’s fifth album, Little Broken Hearts, reinvented her process even more starkly. After collaborating with Danger Mouse, AKA Brian Burton, on his 2011 album Rome, she asked if he would work with her on a new set of songs that she had written. But Burton likes to start with a blank slate. “At the time I was a little confused, but once we started, I completely understood,” say Jones.All a Dream was one of the first songs they made together: a noir meditation on the lingering effects of a bad love affair. They worked on the fly, prompting Jones to embrace roughness, using recordings that she had intended as scratch demos. It was a transformative experience. “Before, I was terrified of having to finish songs before I went into the studio,” she says. “Now, with the new album that I’m putting out, a lot of these songs were not finished. I went in having faith in the process and the lightning bolt of inspiration that comes with making music. I learned a lot of that from working with Brian.”Day Breaks was hailed as Jones’s return to jazz, although there is a sly maturity to the album, and especially Wonderful Time, that Jones says would have eluded her at 22. This song, she says, is the rare example of “something that happens when you capture exactly what you want, what you’re hearing in your head plus what other musicians play and bring to the table that you couldn’t even have imagined”.One of those musicians was the jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter, whose solo albums – and work on Joni Mitchell’s early 90s records – are among Jones’s favourites. “He’s an incredible human,” she says. “My favourite thing about him is that he doesn’t play unless he’s feeling it. He’s not just gonna noodle around and find the tune, he’s gonna sit there and listen until he feels something and it moves him, and then he plays the most incredible thing. That’s different from anyone I’ve ever worked with.”Wonderful Time scans as a love song, but it’s “more of a romantic humanity song”, says Jones. It was written as the US lurched towards Trumpism. “It’s more about: let’s lift each other up and send love to each other in a hard time,” she says. “Instead of saying: let’s get together romantically. It’s more than that.”On her seventh record, Jones applied the lessons she learned from Danger Mouse with such commitment that it is hard to call Begin Again an album. It is a collection of seven songs, made off the cuff in the studio with collaborators including Wilco’s Jeff Tweedy and the pianist Thomas Bartlett. She released them one by one and compiled them later.The title track, written with Emily Fiskio and produced by Jones, was a true bolt from the blue. “I didn’t know what it was about until after we recorded it.” She is shy about saying what it meant to her: “It feels a little bit like it’s about God to me.” There was no literal, spiritual shift in her life, “but I was definitely feeling a lot of things at the time, maybe a little sad about certain things in my life. I think as we get older, that comes in and out more and more: we think about our humanity and happiness and our family and our loved ones.”Despite the heavy themes, the making of Begin Again only continued to lift any burden of expectation from Jones’s career. Releasing one track at a time, she was excited to embrace the possibilities offered by streaming services, “and also give myself a break”, she says. “To get inspired to make music without having a huge album arc. It really freed me up and made me more inspired than ever.”For her eighth album, Jones took some inspiration from an unlikely source. “Reading Dr Seuss stories to my children every night, I feel rhymes in my head constantly,” she says. That, plus the encouragement of a poet friend, led Jones to start writing her own poetry, which she turned into three of the songs on her new record. “I’m certainly not going to release a book of poetry at this point in my life,” she says emphatically.Once again, Jones hadn’t intended to make an album – until she realised this group of songs “all matched”. The ad hoc assembly reminded her of a photograph her husband took of her on the ground, so she called the record Pick Me Up Off the Floor. It has a heavy mood, dramatic vocals, songs about ision and irreconcilable differences. Jones has previously said: “If there’s a darkness to this album, it’s not meant to be an impending sense of doom. It feels more like a human longing for connection.”It is an eerie sentiment for an album that is ultimately being released into social isolation. “It feels kind of silly to talk about my music when people are sick, but at the same time, music lifts people up and I hope that they connect to it,” says Jones. She and her husband have been listening to John Prine (this interview was done before his death from the virus), Townes Van Zandt and Guns N’ Roses. “It’s certainly been making me feel better in this weird time,” she says. “What are you gonna do except what you do, right?”• Pick Me Up Off the Floor is out now on EMI"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7527670448f183da39582a9c977177e477bb1257/317_280_4308_2587/master/4308.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2c47f4ee441862d0ed0521f3a609ea53","title":"dame vera lynn a life in pictures","story":"Vera Lynn has died at the age of 103.

Of the £1bn, £350m will subsidise a nationwide tutoring programme to help pupils most at need.Gibb, the minister for school standards, said on Friday the £650m could be used at the discretion of headteachers with advice from the Department for Education and the Education Endowment Foundation.He said the funding would start to be paid in the academic year starting in September, meaning schools will in the meantime have to use their own resources to provide catch-up classes over the summer holidays.Speaking on BBC Breakfast, Gibb said: “Schools will know it’s coming and they will be able to budget on that basis if they want to do things before September. But the money will start being distributed to schools, we’ll have more to say about that shortly, from the next academic year, September.”The funding announcement follows criticism that Boris Johnson’s government has failed to reopen schools quickly enough to avoid damaging the education of hundreds of thousands of disadvantaged pupils.He added: “We have over a million children now in our school system’ we’re doing so in a phased, careful approach because the safety of the teachers and pupils lies at the heart of all our decision-making.”The health secretary, Matt Hancock, told the daily Downing Street briefing on Thursday that there would not be a return to full-time education in England until the virus was “under control”.There was disappointment for the early-years sector after the government initially announced that it would benefit from the £650m pot as well as colleges.Following a clarification late on Thursday night that the money was going to state primary and secondary schools only, the Early Years Alliance said it “beggars belief” that the sector had been “excluded”.Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Gibb said early years was “absolutely key” and that the government was working with experts on how best to support the under-fives and those aged 16-18 and “we’ll have more to say on that soon”.Gibb confirmed that just under half of the 230,000 laptops promised to vulnerable pupils had been delivered to local authorities – a figure disclosed earlier this week – but insisted that the programme had been delivered “on time”.He added: “This is a fast moving, very challenging set of circumstances that the government is facing – all governments around the world are facing. But we are delivering, we are doing the things that we need to do.“Obviously there are some things we can always do better but this is a government that’s working tirelessly to make sure that children’s education, while we’re during this crisis, continues as best we can.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6f3bbce794d03ad12996c7729d4a1ceb21b96333/1302_1181_9703_5824/master/9703.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2c98bbfc7abce133c1694934fc599f0c","title":"can sharing a family playlist bring harmony at home","story":"Spending quality time with her partner and kids, Kala Paul-Worika uses Spotify Premium’s Family streaming feature and gets everyone singing along to the same playlistThere’s rarely a day that passes without music being played in our household. It’s the backdrop to everything from Saturday-morning pancakes to extended family get-togethers.\u0026nbspI grew up with my Nigerian parents, listening to a mix of jazz-infused African highlife, UB40 and Madonna. Along with my sisters and brothers, I loved to go through my dad’s vinyl collection in the living-room cabinet – while Stevie Wonder’s Happy Birthday would be pulled out for every anniversary celebration.My husband and I met dancing in a West End bar to 90s R\u0026ampB – think Faith Evans, Blackstreet, Puff DaddyDiddy and Ginuwine, interspersed with a touch of house, dancehall and reggae. Yep.So it was more than interesting to spend the week using Spotify’s Premium Family plan, where our music tastes and those of our two children could come together on the exclusive Family Mix feature.With the Premium Family subscription you can have up to six Premium accounts for family members living at the same address.The Family Mix then picks a selection of songs and genres that anyone on the plan has listened to, and creates a playlist.To a certain extent, my Jamaican husband and I have similar tastes when it comes to music – he will basically listen to anything with a reggae “riddim” put over it – whether it’s Beenie Man, Celine Dion or Westlife.But alongside the likes of Whitney Houston, Boyz II Men and Mark Ronson, a few surprises did pop up and I couldn’t help but wonder if there was a hidden message he was trying to convey. Like most people, the type of music I listen to depends on my mood, so when the Family Mix revealed hubby had been listening to You Win Again by the Bee Gees, I couldn’t help but smile, taking it that he had conceded defeat after a recent disagreement.\u0026nbspThe last time I played the Bee Gees to my daughter, she was six and it was less How Deep Is Your Love and more Tragedy. Their infamous high-pitched singing style did not sit well with her and she recoiled in horror asking: “What is that?”, followed by “Make it stop!”She’s now the grand old age of 10 and teetering on the edge of that weird “not quite a teenager but I want to give you the attitude of one” stage. Luckily, this time around, she had less of a profound reaction and allowed the song to play until the end.Her personal taste in music is the result of a mix of influences: her peers, favourite YouTubers and what’s popular on the online interactive gaming app, Roblox. Being younger than 13, I’m still choosing the songs for her on my profile, and that definitely came in handy when she attempted to add some of Melanie Martinez’s more unsavoury-themed songs to her playlist. Whatever she does choose still feeds into the Family Mix, so nothing is lost from her sharing my account.My youngest recently turned three, and we had a little boogie to the Family Mix in the dining room as he enjoyed his birthday breakfast. The planned barbecue was put on hold thanks to the good old British weather, but we still managed to enjoy ourselves. The Family Mix was in full flow, throwing up hits from Destiny’s Child, Janet Jackson, 112, Ariana Grande, Anne-Marie and Years \u0026amp Years – a mix of old-school classics which my tweenager enjoyed, and some more current hits for her to sing along to at the top of her voice.She always fails to reign in her surprise at seeing me singing along to artists of the moment like Billie Eilish. I mean, as her mum, I couldn’t possibly be that cool, right? We also had fun with the option to change up the tempo of the Family Mix depending on your mood, or the occasion.A moon sign represents the option for a chilled and laid-back selection, then simply tap on the sun for something a little more upbeat and fast-paced – clicking off either takes you back to the standard mix.Our week is up, but you can guarantee we’ll still be tuning in for some family listening.Spotify Premium gives you music without the interruptions.

Following extensive debate, they appear to have landed on an answer: go bigger or go home.Cern’s council is expected to announce its backing on Friday for a proposed new collider with a 100km circular tunnel, four times the size and six times as powerful as the LHC. A formal vote on the plan is due to go ahead on Friday.The proposed particle-smashing machine, referred to as the Future Circular Collider (FCC), would allow scientists to hunt for particles and other new phenomena at higher energies, study the Higgs boson with greater precision, and may offer insights into dark matter.Speaking before Cern’s council meeting, Prof Jon Butterworth, of University College London, said a scaled-up collider would allow scientists to make unprecedented measurements of nature at the subatomic scale. “It’s probing nature at the shortest distances and looking for the smallest things we can see … it’s a real exploratory mission,” he said. “Everyone agrees that’s what we need to do. The question has been: what’s the best machine to do it?”But some question whether the scientific promise of the gigantic machine justifies the anticipated €20bn price tag for construction.If approved in Friday’s vote, Cern is expected to assess the technical and financial feasibility of the FCC, with initial efforts going into a geological survey to check there are no underground lakes or other show-stopping features beneath Geneva that would require the plan to be reconsidered. Research and development efforts into high-field superconducting magnets and other technologies required for the proposed collider will also be ramped up.There is no guarantee the machine will be built. Capital investment from EU member states and other Cern participants such as the UK will be required for construction to go ahead – and a commitment to continue funding operations into the 2050s. If the financial backing is secured, construction could begin within a decade and it would take 10 years to build, meaning it would not be operational until the 2040s.The FCC proposal won out against alternative visions of what to do when the LHC winds down around a decade from now. Competing plans included a large linear collider, which some viewed as a safer option because it could have been extended in stages, whereas the size of a circular collider must be decided at the outset. A circular collider has the advantage of being able to house more experiments along the same tunnel.The planned machine would be built up in stages. For the first phase, the FCC would collide electrons and their positive counterparts, positrons. Then it would collide electrons with much heavier nuclei of lead atoms. By the 2050s, it could be smashing protons together with an energy of 100 teraelectronvolts (TeV), around six times higher than the LHC’s maximum capability.The new machine would act as a “Higgs factory”, allowing scientists to target the production of large numbers of Higgs bosons and study more precisely how they decay, which has not been possible with the LHC. Some theories suggest the Higgs particle may decay into dark matter particles, the nature of which remains one of the central mysteries in modern physics. “If there’s any missing, you know there’s something weird going on,” said Butterworth.Moving to higher energy regimes could also uncover new phenomena yet to be predicted. However, there is not the same guaranteed win that the LHC offered before it was built, when scientists knew the collider would sweep through the predicted energy range for the Higgs and either confirm its existence or prove that theoretical physics needed a complete overhaul.“With the LHC, we knew we’d either find the Higgs or break the Standard Model, and that’s a very luxurious position to be in,” said Butterworth. “There is no equivalent scenario now, it’s much more exploratory. It’s definitely higher risk.”The LHC itself has highlighted the uncertain nature of progress. Many hoped that after finding the Higgs, further questions in fundamental physics would be resolved, such as a hypothesis called supersymmetry, which predicts that subatomic particles that make up normal matter possess mirror, or supersymmetrical, versions of themselves. However, the LHC is yet to observe any supersymmetric entities, or any dark matter particles, which had also been in scientists’ sights.Sabine Hossenfelder, a theoretical physicist at the Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies in Germany, said open-ended exploration and the refining of existing knowledge was not enough to justify the enormous cost of the proposed machine. “On some level I find it irresponsible,” she said. “Why don’t we put the money into an international centre for climate models or pandemic models?”The LHC is currently being upgraded and is due to restart in May 2021 and run until the end of 2024, with a final run expected to begin at the end of 2027."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50e65b7f52b4af0ce843e41fbe47ca9eef748d7a/0_315_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7605a9d0606921e84a58af87dd1ddd4a","title":"rspca to make nearly a fifth of staff redundant amid pandemic","story":"Animal welfare charity is latest victim of financial storm battering voluntary sector The RSPCA, the UK’s biggest animal welfare charity, has become the latest victim of the coronavirus-related financial storm battering the voluntary sector, announcing it is to make nearly a fifth of its 1,600 staff redundant.The charity, which each year rescues thousands of neglected and abused animals and prosecutes their owners, faces a shortfall of £20m-£25m this year, caused in part by the collapse in charity fundraising since lockdown.A new analysis has indicated that UK charities face collective financial losses of £12.4bn by the end of this financial year as a result of rising costs and a steep fall in donations.The RSPCA said it was unable to say whether frontline animal care and protection roles would be affected by the cuts until the proposals had been presented to staff as part of a formal consultation next week.The charity rescued 103,000 animals in 2018, according to its latest available figures, and rehomed nearly 40,000 animals in 2019. It prosecuted 661 people for animal abuses and gave out more than 48,000 advice and welfare notices to help owners improve how they care for their animals.“We know this is a really difficult time for our staff and the proposals we are putting forward have not been taken lightly. This is an incredibly challenging time for charities – the current crisis has exacerbated an already difficult financial situation our organisation faces,” the chief executive, Chris Sherwood, said.“We are a large animal charity offering many welfare services for pets, wildlife, farm animals and research animals both here and abroad. We are the only charity with a team of inspectors across England and Wales going out 365 days a year, rescuing animals and then caring for, treating and rehabilitating those animals, sometimes for many months on end, which is incredibly costly.”Charities in the UK lost almost a third of their expected income during the first two months of lockdown, according to the Institute of Fundraising (IoF) and Charity Finance Group (CFG), with donation levels over the year expected to plunge by nearly half as the recession takes hold.Caron Bradshaw, the chief executive of the CFG, said: “This isn’t about the survival of the institution of charity, or inidual charities, but the devastating impact that this will have on those who rely on the services charities provide.”Peter Lewis, the chief executive of the IoF, said: “The government urgently needs to review and enhance its emergency support for charities, with a further bespoke package of support, an extension to the job retention scheme specifically supporting those charitable activities which are still unable to take place, or both.”The survey is broadly in line with an analysis published last week by the charity Pro Bono Economics that estimated a £10bn shortfall for the sector by Christmas.In April, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, announced £750m of extra funding for frontline charities across the UK, a move that was criticised as not going far enough to save many third-sector organisations from collapse."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53fd32a3e23cf16ac32eebe0350b2392e071a6d7/0_831_4696_2817/master/4696.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d585e7e8266d1f2224d19d45fd66d8df","title":"brooks koepka lets fly wearing mic telling tv crew to shut up and listen","story":"There was a time when attaching a microphone to Brooks Koepka during a round of golf did not seem remotely appealing. As the 30-year-old has risen to the level of multi-major champion, he has simultaneously discovered his voice. The entertainment level is generally high.Koepka was shooting from the hip again after signing for a four-under-par 67 to open the RBC Heritage in South Carolina. Coverage of the PGA Tour’s spectator-free return has been boosted by some players wearing microphones. Not so Koepka, who replied “I do” when asked if he had thoughts on the concept. He duly let fly.“I don’t understand why they want us to wear a mic when there’s a boom mic that stands 10 feet away from every shot that I hit,” Koepka said. “If the announcers would just shut up and listen, you could hear every word that we’re talking about. I don’t understand what the thing is. Half the time the lady’s holding a boom mic, and she’s listening to everything we’re saying all the way down. If they would just shut up, they could hear everything.”After a sluggish start to 2020, Koepka’s clubs are finally talking again. Yet Koepka finds himself trailing Ian Poulter by three after day one at Hilton Head. The Englishman produced a blemish-free scorecard and back nine of only 31.Poulter’s pandemic approach was interesting. He played only four rounds during the Tour’s 91-day suspension, instead spending his time on detailed range sessions. “I’m not one that plays round after round after round after round to feel that I need to be ready to play golf,” Poulter said.Poulter stopped short of echoing Rory Mcllroy’s stark remarks about European players who have opted not to travel to the US for the PGA Tour’s restart. The world rankings system began with the US events and has triggered controversy. “What’s the right and what’s the wrong thing to do in this scenario when you’ve got 16 of the top 20 players playing here this week?” Poulter asked. “It feels a little unjust to the guys in Europe that aren’t playing, but how can you not have world ranking points in a tournament like this when you’ve got this level of field?”McIlroy admitted to not feeling entirely settled during a round of 72. This marks his first visit to the RBC Heritage site since 2009. “I can remember not being that comfortable around here back then,” the world No 1 said. “It’s still sort of the same. I’m just not comfortable trying to pick lines and really committing to shots. I just wasn’t as committed today as I need to be around here.”Viktor Hovland signed for a 65. Jordan Spieth’s 66 was one for the ages the Texan made a triple bogey on his third hole and played the front nine, his second half, in 29. “I really enjoy playing this golf course,” Spieth said. “It’s one of the cooler courses. I haven’t had necessarily a ton of success but I also haven’t played it very often.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a583b76bf0dab70cbc6a77b9d69b32fb57cf6f8/0_168_4362_2618/master/4362.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7da833cb101d72ec4e40d62b62d049fe","title":"rfu may urge england fans against singing swing low slavery","story":"The Rugby Football Union is conducting a review into the singing of Swing Low, Sweet Chariot by England supporters, admitting that many of them are unaware of its origins as a song about slavery.England fans have previously been criticised for “cross-cultural appropriation of a US slave song” by academics, and the Black Lives Matter movement has brought renewed focus on its airing at Twickenham and matches abroad.Maro Itoje recently described the background of the song as “complicated” and the RFU – aware that the lyrics are plastered all over Twickenham – is set to take action. The union told the  it is reviewing the song’s “historical context” and acknowledged the need to educate supporters.The RFU did not rule out urging supporters not to sing the song altogether at a time when institutions in England with historical links to slavery are coming under increasing pressure to act.Sell-out crowds will not return to Twickenham in the short term but the RFU’s chief executive, Bill Sweeney, is optimistic England could host up to 40,000 fans this autumn if the government relaxes its physical distancing rule to one metre.An RFU spokesperson said: “The RFU has stated we need to do more to achieve ersity and we are determined to accelerate change and grow awareness. The Swing Low, Sweet Chariot song has long been part of the culture of rugby and is sung by many who have no awareness of its origins or sensitivities. We are reviewing its historical context and our role in educating fans to make informed decisions.”It is believed the song was first sung at Twickenham when Martin “Chariots” Offiah was playing in the 1987 Middlesex Sevens tournament. The following year it became a popular refrain among England supporters when Chris Oti scored a hat-trick against Ireland. The song’s origins are rooted in US slavery however and it is believed to have been written by the American slave Wallace Willis around the 1860s.England players have often spoken of the lift they get from the crowd when Swing Low, Sweet Chariot echoes around the stadium and supporters were urged to sing it during the haka when England last hosted New Zealand in November 2018. During his time as national captain, however, Dylan Hartley admitted he was unaware of the song’s origins and a number of other England players have said the same.This week Sweeney vowed to increase ersity within the RFU following the appointment of Genevieve Glover as chair of the union’s ersity and inclusion implementation working group. There has never been a black member of the RFU’s 14-strong board and of the 55 council members only Maggie Alphonsi is black. “We have undertaken some very good initiatives at the grassroots level to encourage more erse participation however, that in itself is not enough,” said Sweeney. “We need to do more to achieve ersity across all areas of the game including administration.”The RFU was also one of a number of sporting bodies to sign a statement pledging a commitment to tackling inequality within sport. “The appalling death of George Floyd, the global protests that have followed and the powerful message of the Black Lives Matter movement has made every section of society take notice and confront an ugly truth,” said the statement.“Systemic change must be made at all levels so that we can become truly reflective of our wonderfully erse society. We can no longer rely on black role models at the elite level speaking out, we must join together to become better and to support every member of the sport and recreation community.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a8c224ef28313a5be652cadf9dd48b149e53053/0_351_5260_3156/master/5260.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=81402a6a4879a0ab4c500c47cfc3e782","title":"royal ascot day four horse racing commonwealth cup live updates","story":"Ascot clerk of the course Chris Stickels has been out on the track and has the latest update on the going and conditions1.15pm Palace Of Holyroodhouse HandicapArt Power 2-11.50pm Albany StakesMahale 10-1 (14s in places)2.25pm Norfolk StakesImperial Force 9-13.00pm Hardwicke StakesElarqam 5-23.35pm Commonwealth CupPierre Lapin 4-14.10pm Queen’s VaseBerkshire Rocco (nap) 4-14.40pm Duke Of Edinburgh HandicapGood Birthday (nb) 8-1Most of these are proving fairly popular, with the exception of Pierre Lapin. It’s odds to see some opposition to him, given how hot Roger Varian has been this week.After what was basically a dry night at Ascot, the official going for day four of the Royal meeting has been changed to good-to-soft on the straight course and soft, good-to-soft in place on the round, which is, by my count at least, the fifth change since Tuesday morning (and please don’t write to the editor if I’ve managed to miss a couple, it’s been that kind of week).The TurfTrax map on the Ascot going hub shows the contrast between the rate of drainage on the straight – which was relaid when the course was rebuilt from scratch 15 years ago – and the loop for the longer races, which wasn’t. The difference between the two is likely to increase over the next couple of days if, as expected, further rain is sporadic, but that does not matter quite so much today as the feature event – the Group One Commonwealth Cup – is a six-furlong sprint for three-year-olds.This is the youngest of the Group One races at the meeting, having been introduced – and, a little controversially, immediately awarded the coveted Group One status – in 2015. It has since fully justified that decision, however, rapidly becoming one of the highlights of the week.This year’s renewal is another cracker, bringing together horses that have been aimed at this race for many months (Pierre Lapin, Golden Horde) alongside others that tried their luck in a Guineas at Newmarket or the Curragh and did not quite get home. With Kimari, from Wesley Ward’s stable in the States, adding a transatlantic interest with Frankie Dettori up, it promises to be some spectacle.It really is now or never for any jockey hoping to overhaul Jim Crowley’s total of six winners so far and claim the prize for the leading rider of the week, as Crowley has just two rides today – including Elarqam, the favourite for the Hardwicke Stakes – while James Doyle has five mounts, and Ryan Moore and Frankie Dettori have six apiece.Crowley is a 4-7 chance to become the jockey other than Moore, Dettori and Johnny Murtagh to win the prize since 2007, while Moore – who rides Anthony Van Dyck, last year’s Derby winner and the second-favourite, in Elarqam’s race – is 9-4, with Doyle at 12-1 and Dettori on 20-1. If Elarqam wins, it is probably game over.Chris Cook’s selections for the fourth day are here, and the action is underway at 1.15."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/186a407771425d54937e4dbe2c19d24098eff78b/0_8_4169_2502/master/4169.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=0b6250fb5a5e9c1a8f01e5dce18853be","title":"surface earbuds review microsofts airpods rivals","story":"Pros: open fit that doesn’t enter your ear canal, secure fit, good sound, long battery life, good case, great controls, USB-C, good calling, apps for Windows 10, Android and iOS, apt XCons: no AAC for Apple, no isolation, no noise cancelling, can’t connect to two devices at the same time, no pause on remove, expensive"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d847304e1ba93a8bb053f8eb1a425cdee10b137/0_74_5226_3137/master/5226.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=488f963c0a2a0b0090f160fea78307a5","title":"abandoned bus made famous movie book into the wild removed by alaska mccandless","story":"Helicopter removed the bus where adventurer Christopher McCandless died of starvation in 1992, to prevent others trying to reach it An abandoned bus in the Alaska back country, popularized by the book Into the Wild and movie of the same name, was removed on Thursday as a public safety measure, state officials said. The bus has long attracted adventurers to an area without cellphone service and marked by unpredictable weather and at-times swollen rivers. Some have had to be rescued or have died. Christopher McCandless, the subject of the book and movie, died of starvation there in 1992. The rescue earlier this year of five Italian tourists and death last year of a woman from Belarus intensified calls from local officials for the bus, about 25 miles (40km) from the Parks Highway, to be removed. The Alaska natural resources commissioner, Corri Feige, said the Alaska Army National Guard moved the bus as part of a training mission “at no cost to the public or additional cost to the state”. The Alaska National Guard, in a release, said the bus was removed using a heavy-lift helicopter. The crew ensured the safety of a suitcase with sentimental value to the McCandless family, the release said.Feige said in a statement the bus would be kept in a secure location while her department weighed various options for what to do with it. “We encourage people to enjoy Alaska’s wild areas safely, and we understand the hold this bus has had on the popular imagination,” her statement said. “However, this is an abandoned and deteriorating vehicle that was requiring dangerous and costly rescue efforts. More importantly, it was costing some visitors their lives.” McCandless, a 24-year-old from Virginia, was prevented from seeking help by the swollen banks of the Teklanika River. He wrote in a journal about living in the bus for 114 days, right up to his death. The long-abandoned Fairbanks city bus became famous as a result of the 1996 book by Jon Krakauer, and a 2007 Sean Penn-directed movie, also called Into the Wild. The Department of Natural Resources said the 1940s-era bus had been used by a construction company to house employees during work on an access road in the area and was abandoned when the work was finished in 1961. In March, officials in the Denali Borough based in Healy, about 25 miles from the bus, voted unanimously to be rid of it.

And in April, more than 200 black women leaders and activists within the Democratic party signed an open letter calling on Biden to choose a black woman, noting that “the road to the White House is powered by black women and black women are the key to a Democratic victory in 2020”.Klobuchar, a white, moderate Democrat, has recently had to contend with her past as a prosecutor in the county that includes Minneapolis, where George Floyd was killed. During her tenure, Klobuchar declined to prosecute police accused of using excessive force against black suspects. More than two dozen mostly black and minority people died during encounters with police.Klobuchar, 60, was among a large field of Democrats who had sought the 2020 presidential nomination, running as a pragmatic Midwesterner who had passed over 100 bills. She dropped out and threw her support behind Biden before the crucial 3 March “Super Tuesday” contests after struggling to win support from black voters, who remain crucial to Democratic victories. Her best finish of the primary was in overwhelmingly white New Hampshire, where she came in third.The senator had to cancel one of her final campaign rallies after Black Lives Matter and other activists took the stage in Minnesota to protest her handling as prosecutor of a murder case that sent a black teenager to prison for life.Representative James Clyburn of South Carolina, a Biden ally and highest-ranking black person in Congress, said in the days after Floyd’s death that “this is very tough timing” for Klobuchar.During the 11th Democratic presidential debate, after Klobuchar had dropped out, Biden explicitly committed to picking a woman as vice president and nominating the first African American woman to the supreme court.Klobuchar, who has been an enthusiastic campaign surrogate for Biden, indicated she will continue to support him. In the interview with MSNBC, Klobuchar brushed aside the suggestion that her record as a prosecutor would have affected her ability to function as Biden’s running mate.“I think I could have functioned fine,” she said. “There’s a lot of untruths out there about my record and now is not the time to debate them.”After the interview aired, senior Biden adviser Symone Sanders indicated that she expected Klobuchar back on the campaign trail."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7335c8af40c0db99992784384dc252fd2f9082d/0_422_4803_2884/master/4803.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=50db62e825dbc7ee4dc2f3b949b35efd","title":"tell us how has coronavirus affected people living in the north east","story":"We’d like to hear from people in the north-east and Yorkshire about the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreakWe would like to find out about the impact of coronavirus on you and your community.We’d like to hear from people in north-east England including the county of Yorkshire and we’re particularly interested finding out how the pandemic has affected your work and the local economy.

On behalf of 35 million Canadians: we’re back.”But Trudeau’s marquee foreign policy gambit has ended in disappointment, after Canada lost its bid for a temporary United Nations security council seat. In a single round of voting on Wednesday afternoon, Ireland and Norway secured the required two-third of votes, edging Canada into third place.It was Canada’s second failed attempt to win the seat, and experts believe it raised serious questions about the messaging and clarity of the country’s foreign policy.Ahead of the vote, Trudeau tempered expectations, telling reporters that regardless of the outcome, Canada was “moving forward and leading the way” on issues such as climate change and a feminist foreign policy. But in the final days, the PM and his team mounted a frantic effort, phoning leaders in India, Pakistan, Mexico, North Macedonia and Fiji, to secure votes.For those closely watching the campaign, the last-minute push was likely too late – and the messaging from Ottawa too confused.It was only in February, months before the vote, that Trudeau and a small delegation visited Senegal, Ethiopia and Germany to pitch Canada’s candidacy. The prime minister had a planned trip to the Caribbean to court regional leaders, but scrapped the visit amid a wave of protests at home.“If you had five years, why would you wait so long for these trips and meetings? You need a really long runway to build goodwill and relations with other states that would get to the kind of guaranteed outcome of a security council seat. It’s not an easy thing to do,” said Mark Kersten, deputy director of the Wayamo Foundation.Norway and Ireland, meanwhile, had been laying the groundwork for their campaigns for years, and on Wednesday secured 130 and 128 votes respectively. Canada took 108.Canada had spent more than C$2mn on the effort, far more than Ireland. But the money was hampered by an unclear message.“We’re supposed to have a feminist foreign policy. To me, that means that every single decision that’s relevant to Canadian international relations should be examined through its gender dimensions,” said Kersten.“Are we doing that? I don’t necessarily see that with Saudi Arabia or our relations towards China.”Meanwhile, Canada’s public commitments to human rights and economic equality, were severely compromised by its defence of the engineering giant SNC-Lavalin, which has admitted fraud and bribery in Libya.For decades, Canada branded itself as a peacekeeping nation, drawing on a long history of intervening in conflicts around the world. But those efforts have eroded significantly in recent years, and current commitments are at a 60-year low.“There definitely is a big gap between rhetoric and reality,” said Thomas Juneau, a professor of international affairs at the University of Ottawa.Canada’s mission in Mali, its largest in nearly a generation, lasted one year.“The mission really reinforced the perception that we wanted to ‘tick a box’ – as opposed to really doing the heavy lifting,” said Juneau.Trudeau’s interest in the security council was seen as a way to draw a contrast with former PM Stephen Harper, whose lack of interest in courting the UN culminated in Canada’s first ever defeat for a seat on the security council in 2010. The rare loss – to Portugal – was met with shock and dismay in Canada.Wednesday’s surprise defeat, is likely to raise questions about the government’s effectiveness in managing its messaging abroad.“Another foreign affairs failure for Justin Trudeau. Keeps the streak alive! He sold out Canada’s principles for a personal vanity project and still lost. What a waste,” tweeted outgoing Conservative leader Andrew Scheer.Juneau held out hope that the loss would prompt a re-examination of Canada’s “dilettante” foreign policy.“There’s more scrutiny. And that’s important – because in this country, there’s a limited scrutiny of foreign policy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83ff9fcdf00c34d4076bfbadddff79ee2eaec72b/0_0_2904_1743/master/2904.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02f583604afa578418553f059b4949b2","title":"russian priest who called coronavirus a pseudo pandemic seizes convent","story":"Father Sergei Romanov who was banished by church leaders in April says he will only be removed by forceA rogue Russian priest who denies the existence of Covid-19 has seized a convent in the Urals region and announced he will only be removed by force.Father Sergei Romanov stormed the Sredneuralsk convent this week, after being banished by church leaders in April for protesting the closure of churches due to the coronavirus epidemic, which he called a “pseudo-pandemic”.He was backed by Cossack fighters who were guarding the convent’s perimeter, according to regional media. The mother superior and nuns had left the convent “in order to avoid unnecessary strife”, the regional diocese said in a statement. No one has been harmed as of Thursday evening.Romanov is a leader of an Orthodox religious cult of “tsar worshippers” and has legally changed his last name to that of Russia’s last imperial dynasty. He helped found the Sredneuralsk convent in the early 2000s not far from the site where the Bolsheviks buried the tsar and his family in 1918 and tried to dissolve them in acid.A former police officer, Romanov served 13 years in a prison colony for murder before joining the clergy and building a following among firebrand Orthodox believers centred at the Sredneuralsk convent, as well as other sites near Yekaterinburg, where the royal family was executed in 1917.The fundamentalist group has prominent followers among politicians and sport figures and launched vehement protests against the 2017 film Matilda, which depicted an affair between tsar Nicholas II and ballerina Matilda Kshesinskaya. There were several arson attacks targeted against the film’s director and a man drove his car into the facade of a cinema.Romanov’s raid was preceded by an ecclesiastical court hearing on Monday for violating public health orders and publicly cursing other priests who closed their churches due to coronavirus.“I will not leave the house of the mother of God,” said Romanov, referring to the convent, during the religious court. “My heart is calm, my conscience does not reproach me. They, that is the clergy, politan Kirill, will have to take the monastery by storm.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3b05518ab9ed6214572b53a97458fc8e2e8a385/0_282_720_432/master/720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=52e23e3b2b6259d43a2af8c973b56037","title":"uk poised to abandon coronavirus app in favour of apple and google models","story":"NHS to switch to alternative design by tech giants, says Matt Hancock in latest U-turnThe government has been forced to abandon a centralised coronavirus contact-tracing app after spending three months and millions of pounds on technology that experts had repeatedly warned would not work.In an embarrassing U-turn, Matt Hancock said the NHS would switch to an alternative designed by the US tech companies Apple and Google, which is months away from being ready.At the Downing Street briefing, the health secretary said the government would not “put a date” on when the new app may be launched, although officials conceded it was likely to be in the autumn or winter.The idea behind the NHS app was that it could trace anybody that a person with coronavirus symptoms came into close contact with by using the Bluetooth connectivity on a standard smartphone, and notify them to self-isolate.Ministers had insisted on using a centralised version of the untested technology in which anonymised data from people who reported feeling ill was held in an NHS database to enable better tracing and data analysis. This version was not supported by Apple and Google.That was because the design of Apple’s iPhone operating system is such that apps quickly go to sleep when they are not being used and cannot be activated by Bluetooth – a point raised by experts and reported by the  in early May.The Department of Health and Social Care refused to say how much had been spent on the effort, although official records show three contracts worth £4.8m were awarded to the developer VMWare Pivotal Labs for work on the app.Silkie Carlo, the director of the privacy charity Big Brother Watch, said: “This just shows what a mess the centralised data-hungry approach was. Government was wrong to waste precious time and millions of pounds of public money on a design that everyone warned was going to fail, and now we’re back at square one.”Hancock had been particularly enthusiastic about the NHS app and had at one point said it would be “rolling out in mid-May” across England. Officials had denied the Apple-Google alternative was being evaluated, although on Thursday it was revealed that in fact work was going on to assess it from 6 May.On Thursday, Hancock said the alternative was not ready either because it could not measure distance accurately. In some cases it cannot distinguish between phones 1 metre and 3 metres away – even though one is inside and one outside the current 2-metre physical distancing limit.Experts say an app would be useful to track the potential spread from an infected person on public transport or in any other situation where they come into contact with people they do not know. But the distance measurement problem means it cannot be relied on to make decisions about who should self-isolate.When asked whether he had unwisely stuck to the wrong approach, Hancock said: “I’m from Newmarket, we back both horses.” He went on to argue that testing the Apple–Google alternative for several weeks meant the government could make the leap from one system to another with confidence.Contact tracing is one of the most basic planks of public health responses to a pandemic\u0026nbsplike the coronavirus. It means literally tracking down anyone that somebody with an infection may have had contact with in the days before they became ill. It was – and always will be – central to the fight against Ebola, for instance. In west Africa in 2014-15, there were large teams of people who would trace relatives and knock on the doors of neighbours and friends to find anyone who might have become infected by touching the sick person.Most people who get Covid-19 will be infected by their friends, neighbours, family or work colleagues, so they will be first on the list. It is not likely anyone will get infected by someone they do not know, passing on the street.It is still assumed there has to be reasonable exposure – originally experts said people would need to be together for 15 minutes, less than 2 metres apart. So a contact tracer will want to know who the person testing positive met and talked to over the two or three days before they developed symptoms and went into isolation.South Korea has large teams of contact tracers and notably chased down all the contacts of a religious group, many of whose members fell ill. That outbreak was efficiently stamped out by contact tracing and quarantine.Singapore and Hong Kong have also espoused testing and contact tracing and so has Germany. All those countries have had relatively low death rates so far. The\u0026nbspWorld Health Organization\u0026nbspsays it should be the “backbone of the response” in every country.Apple did not immediately comment but in a statement on Thursday night, Google said: “We welcome the announcement from the UK government today. We have developed an Exposure Notification API with Apple based on consultation with public health experts around the world, including in the UK, to ensure that our efforts are useful to authorities as they build their own apps to limit the spread of Covid-19, while ensuring privacy and security are central to the design.”Earlier this week Italy and Germany launched their own apps nationwide based on the Google-Apple model. The Italian app has been downloaded 2.7m times, while the German app was taken up 6.5m times on Tuesday, its first day.Speculation about the fate of the NHS app had been circulating for weeks after Hancock’s mid-May deadline was missed. On Wednesday, James Bethell, a junior health minister responsible for the app, told MPs it would not be ready until the end of the year. “We’re seeking to get something going for the winter, but it isn’t a priority for us,” he told a parliamentary committee.At one point it had been hoped that Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland would also use the app, which is intended for England in its revised form. But the repeated delays had prompted the other nations to reconsider.Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, said: “This is unsurprising and yet another example of where the government’s response has been slow and badly managed. It’s meant precious time and money wasted.“For months, tech experts warned ministers about the flaws in their app, which is why we wrote to Matt Hancock encouraging the government to consider digital alternatives back in May.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48d6b960102f2e3352a11854c684c8669c0d0e48/0_260_2461_1476/master/2461.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a4ac7483949f8190f50324614b4cb317","title":"lamour is in the air again as french kissing returns on screen","story":"Culture minister announces on-screen smooching is back as cinemas reopen in France Actors have started kissing again on French film shoots, the country’s culture minister has said.Franck Riester said kissing had resumed on sets where the actors had been tested for coronavirus.And he insisted l’amour was not completely dead despite the pandemic.The minister told French radio that while shooting in Europe’s biggest film industry was allowed to restart earlier this month, “they waited a bit before doing that kiss that is so important in cinema”.Reister did not say which film or which actors were the first to get back to on-screen smooching.“No, the kiss is not over with,” the politician declared when asked if physical distancing was in danger of killing off love scenes altogether.French cinemas are to reopen on Monday after a three-month closure but with drastic distancing measures that mean they can never be more than half-full."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c33d997792057d949de3e3deb9e587ea42b195a9/0_284_4826_2896/master/4826.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=13bbb3338ab1926743a0bfd3dcb03f60","title":"coronavirus covid 19 live news update us questions beijing cluster figures who vaccine doses latest updates","story":"Researchers working on more than 200 vaccines, says WHO global deaths pass 450,000 Brazil nears 1m cases.

The province’s laboratory – which is responsible for testing samples of patients in Herat and nearby areas – has stopped work due to a lack of testing capacity. The province’s governor has said that the actual number of infections may be more than 60,000 in the province as 280 patients with Covid-19 symptoms died during last week.The Afghan health ministry has previously said it was unable to increase testing for coronavirus due to a lack of laboratories and an overload of suspected patients and medical workers would determine new coronavirus patients through their symptoms, rather than through testNorthern province of Takhar where at least 7 students were killed and 7 wounded in an explosion at a religious school on Thursday, reported five new infections to Covid-19. It comes as the United Nations’ annual Children in Armed Conflict report, released on Monday, found Afghanistan was the deadliest country for children for the fifth year straight.Kunduz province, also in the north, reported six new cases. At least seven security forces were killed in a clash with the Taliban in the province on Thursday night.In Italy traces of coronavirus have been found in samples taken from sewage water in Milan and Turin in December, according to a study by Italy’s Higher Health Institute (ISS).Researchers examined 40 samples collected between October 2019 and February 2020, as well as 24 control samples between September 2018 and June 2019.Coronavirus traces were also found in wastewater samples collected in Bologna on 29 January.In a statement Giuseppina La Rossa, from the ISS’s department of environment and health said:The results, confirmed in two different laboratories using two different methods, showed the presence of SARS-COV-2 RNA in samples taken in Milan and Turin on 18 December 2019 and in Bologna on 29 January 2020. Further samples taken from the same cities in January and February also found traces of Covid-19, while those collected in October and November gave negative results, La Rossa added.Italy’s first locally transmitted coronavirus case was confirmed in Lombardy, the region surrounding Milan, on 20 February, and in Turin, in Piedmont, on 22 February. The virus has so far killed over 16,500 people in Lombardy and 4,032 in Piedmont.The Lombardy region still accounts for the largest daily rise in new infections, with 226 out of 333 cases registered there on Thursday. There were 66 more fatalities on Thursday, 36 in Lombardy, bringing the death toll across the country to 34,514.Although new clusters have emerged since Italy started easing the lockdown in early May, for example in the regions of Lazio and Molise, the virus has mostly been kept at bay, with the widespread use of face masks and physical distancing believed to play a significant role. The Czech Republic reported its biggest one-day jump in new coronavirus cases in two months on Friday, with the daily rise exceeding 100 for only the third time since mid-April, Reuters reports.The number of new cases was 118 on Thursday, the Health Ministry said, the largest daily rise since April 21. The central European country has since May been relaxing rules to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus.The country had reported 10,283 cases as of Friday morning, of which almost three quarters have recovered. Its death toll of 334 is a fraction of those seen it its western neighbours.With cases waning, the government has started focusing on localised measures rather than nationwide bans to contain the spread of the virus.According to health officials, the country has two hot spots in Prague and the eastern mining region of Karvina.A potential coronavirus vaccine being developed by China’s Clover Biopharmaceuticals using GlaxoSmithKline’s vaccine booster is now in early-stage testing in humans, the companies said on Friday.Clover said initial safety data from the trial, which is enrolling about 150 adults and also investigating the vaccine in combination with Dynavax’s adjuvant, is expected in August this year, Reuters reports. Chinese officials have released genome data for the coronavirus traced to a recent cluster in Beijing, saying it has similarities to a European strain.China has been under pressure to share the data with the World Health Organisation.It comes after Beijing reported nearly 200 fresh Covid-19 infections. Tens of thousands of people are being tested in the city, where neighbourhoods are under lockdown and schools shut. The cluster has been traced to a sprawling wholesale market in the city.In an article published on Friday on the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection’s website CDC official Zhang Yong said:According to preliminary genomic and epidemiological study results, the virus is from Europe, but it is different from the virus currently spreading in Europe.It’s older than the virus currently spreading in Europe.It could have been hidden in imported frozen food products, or it was lurking in some dark and humid environment such as Xinfadi, with the environment not having been disinfected or sterilised. Scientists have been cautious over drawing early conclusion about the link.Ben Cowling, a professor at the University of Hong Kong’s School of Public Health, told the AFP news agency.It is possible that the virus now causing an outbreak in Beijing travelled from Wuhan to Europe and now back to China .He added that patient zero hadn’t been identified yet and that it may be too late to find out how the latest cluster started.The first trial results of a coronavirus vaccine being developed by CureVac in Germany are expected in two months, German news website Focus Online reported on Friday.Reuters reports that CureVac, an unlisted German company, said this week that the first meaningful results could be available in September or October and, under favourable conditions, it could be approved by the middle of next year.More on Curevac’s work from its own website here.Government borrowing in the UK in May is predicted to have hit 55.2 billion - nearly nine times higher than in the same month a year ago, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).The figure is slightly lower than the 62.1 billion of borrowing in April, according to the ONS, although the organisation also revised down that figure by 13.6 billion to 48.5 billion on Friday.Reacting to this morning’s figures, UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak said they show “coronavirus is having a severe impact on our public finances”. He said:The best way to restore our public finances to a more sustainable footing is to safely reopen our economy so people can return to work.We’ve set out our plan to do this in a gradual and safe fashion, including reopening high streets across the country this week, as we kickstart our economic recovery.Indian officials have reimposed a lockdown in the southern city of Chennai and three neighbouring districts.The BBC reports that only essential services and neighbourhood grocery shops will be permitted to function under the 12-day lockdown, set to end on 30 June.Chennai is India’s sixth-largest city and the capital of Tamil Nadu state. It has more than 37,000 of Tamil Nadu’s confirmed 50,000 infections, making it one of India’s largest hotspots.With just over 600 deaths in total, the state has a relatively low mortality rate – but its death toll is being reviewed after reports suggested that at least 200 deaths in Chennai were not included in the official tally.It is the only city to reimpose a lockdown to curb the rise in infections.India has the fourth-highest caseload in the world, with more than 350,000 confirmed cases of the disease. Daily reports of infections are increasing, with Tamil Nadu among the worst-affected states.This is Alexandra Topping taking the reins of the global coronavirus liveblog for the next few hours.

My email is alexandra.topping@the and I’m @lexytopping on Twitter, my DMs are open. That’s it from me, Helen Sullivan, for today. I leave you momentarily in the company of Armando Iannucci and his family, who are using lockdown to watch the film Cats five minutes at a time:I’m at home with my wife, children and dogs. We’ve drifted into a communal understanding of watching something chewy, like Chernobyl, then Gogglebox. It ends with us doing impressions in very bad taste of Craig Cash: “In Kiev, there’s been an explosion in reactor four …” We’ve reached the gallows humour that I expect every family has reached as we hit week 13 of lockdown.For some reason, Cats turned up unannounced on our Sky box. I’ve never been a party to that school of: it’s so bad, it’s good. But everything in Cats is so bad, from the scripts to the effects, we’ve had to restrict ourselves to five minutes a night, just to prolong the exquisite agony."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0958b753c954b9e27597842d13716e3f9bc0782d/0_487_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f7e73ff232da16b050f3f700d1a99fd","title":"this is our future how eight talented young creatives found their voice","story":"Full of ideas and uncompromising about the world they want to live in, eight exceptional iniduals have come together to have their say, their way“It’s tough starting from the bottom and trying to work your way up,” says illustrator Chris Martin. The 22-year-old from Milnthorpe in Cumbria is passionate about illustration, but also wants to stay true to his ideals about the type of work he aims to produce, rooted in skate culture. “The prospect of having my work published nationally felt so distant,” he says. But Chris’s work, along with that of seven other young creatives, will appear next Saturday, 27 June, in a supplement published with .Your Voice. Your Way is being created by young people aged between 18 and 25 from across Britain who feel strongly that they and their contemporaries need to be heard when it comes to shaping the future. “I am driven to uncover how our world is steered,” says Chris. “And how, not just as creatives, but as people, we can change it.” Commissioned by Levi’s and  Labs team, the magazine aims to give a platform to the unheard, and amplify their voices.“Their generation has what I’d call a positive stubbornness,” says Jason Kyriacou, the UK marketing and experience director for Levi’s. “An uncompromising attitude to what they believe in and the courage to act on it.”Now, that attitude is needed more than ever. When  Labs and Levi’s started recruiting for the project, in the first months of 2020, issues surrounding climate change, shifting identities and inclusiveness came up in nearly every application. What gave the project even more urgency was the outbreak of Covid-19.Suddenly the future was ever more uncertain, and the assembled contributors – all with little or no media experience – had to adjust to working on the project remotely and contacting their mentors from  Labs using video meetings.Writer Kiera Moran, 24, has had the unusual experience of self-isolating before, and writes about the experience of seeing her five-year-old son through cancer. She started writing up late at night, caring for her child. “Sleep deprived at 5am, I have spilled my heart out,” says Kiera, from Merthyr Tydfil. “My voice is honest and unassuming. Coming from a working class background, I feel I am familiar and welcoming, with a story hidden behind nightmares. I was excited to have such an amazing opportunity. I hope to develop my writing and use what I’ve learned in future work.”Another writer, Anna Marshall, 21, from Durham, drew on her experience in climate activism for the project. “I want to contribute to a fresher and more daring version of professional journalism,” she says. “I was buzzed to see what we could make together,” she says. “And I was excited to work with talented people who are dedicated to what they do.”For the other two writers, Ayat Mohamed, 18, from London, and Sam Carrick, also 18 and from Gosport, the project was a chance to think about their place in the world and how they and others are viewed. “I hope someone reads it and feels understood,” says Ayat.Illustrator Vicki Jones, 21, from Birmingham, was keen for her work to be seen by the people she depicts, often women of colour. “The message I’d like people to take from my work is to be proud of who you are regardless of skin colour, facial features or hair type,” she says. “To just love the way you look. I am passionate about this message and I want others to feel that they can be heard too.”For the two photographers, Milli Ahern, 23, from London, and Fanny Beckman, 25, lockdown meant the biggest adjustment, forcing them to think creatively about what they could shoot in and around their homes, and they responded with positivity. “I was beyond excited when I found out I was chosen to work on this zine,” says Fanny, who is from Malmö, Sweden, but lives in London. “To get advice from people in the industry I have always dreamed of being part of means a lot to me.”“We received hundreds and hundreds of applications,” says the project’s casting editor Anna Fielding. “Every single person who applied had something important to say. The eight collaborators have exceptional clarity of expression and a real drive to see a new world. They’ve been inspirational to work with.”Although it has never been easier to self-publish work, or create a social media presence or a podcast, it’s difficult to be heard among so many others doing the same.The reach of an established newspaper still matters, as does being heard by an audience beyond your peer group.  Labs and Levi’s were happy to turn over creative control and act as supporters and signal-boosters. The hope is that the conviction and passion displayed by these eight will inspire others to find their voices. The collaborators were paid for their time and work, and will be mentored for six months by  Labs staff.Beyond encouraging young people to speak out and push for positive change, the aim is to let the world see the power of their potential. “We want to create a platform that this team perhaps otherwise wouldn’t have had. And then to put it in front of people who might not otherwise read it, because it would have been in places they wouldn’t normally look,” says Jason.The team may be only eight strong, but they represent their generation and they represent Britain. Do look at what they have to say: it contains the seeds of our future.Use Your Voice ...The zine created for the Your Voice.

Photograph: Daragh Mc SweeneyProvisionA Cork bookshop owner has defended her decision to ask customers to wear masks coming into her shop to protect against Covid-19 following backlash on social media.Joan Lucey, who owns Vibes and Scribes on Lavitt’s Quay in Cork city centre, re-opened her shop on Tuesday and asked customers to wear a mask and, if they didn’t have one with them, the shop was happy to provide one.“We asked people to wear masks for the safety of our staff and our customers and if they didn’t have one, we were happy to provide them with one and they could make a donation to the Cork Sexual Violence Centre, ” said Ms Lucey.“But we were very surprised when we discovered this really bad reaction on line with some people going on to our Facebook page, accusing us of trying to humiliate them and others saying that they were going to blacklist us.”Another person expressed delight that Vibes and Scribes was after re-opening but said they would “not step a foot inside unless you remove the absurd requirement for people to wear masks”.“Happy to see you have been ‘allowed’ to reopen but very disappointed to see your mask policy! Big NO to masks!! Not necessary, not mandatory! Won’t be visiting your store or any store that has a mask policy,” said another.Another posted a message stating, “Great way to stop customers coming to your shop – nobody should be made to wear face masks, we all have free choice “ while another vowed not to visit “under these humiliating conditions.”OppositionIt appears some of those expressing strong opposition to Vibes and Scribes policy have links to the anti-vaccinations but Ms Lucey said she was simply following HSE advice on masks out of concern for her staff and customers.“We’re asking people to wear masks simply to protect our staff and customers and if for whatever reason, people refuse to wear a mask, we ask them to limit their visit to 10 minutes - again out of concern for our staff and customers.”Ms Lucey, who won Cork Retailer of the Year in 2015, said she was gratified by the many messages of support they had received online from people saying they will come into her shop as Covid 19 has had a devastating impact on retail.“Retail is on its knees. We’ve re-opened our bookshop and no matter what happens when we open up our craft supplies shop on Bridge Street, no matter how the customers feel towards us, it’s going to be very difficult.She said that she had moved all her staff to working on her online craft supplies business and nobody was left go from the Vibes and Scribes team during the pandemic but re-opening her shops presented new challenges.“Funnily enough, in our online shop we’ve been selling huge amounts of products for mask making because we sell a lot of elastics and fabrics, so I was aware that people are making masks and people were pro-masks.”“I admit we didn’t consult with anybody but to be honest I didn’t feel that it was terribly relevant, I thought I was doing the right thing for my staff and my customers and to be fair, most our customers have been supportive.”Official adviceThe latest official advice from the HSE, updated on June 15th, states that face coverings should be worn in situations where it is difficult to practice social distancing, such as in shops and on public transport.“Face coverings help to prevent people who do not know they have the virus from spreading it to others .... it may help to reduce the spread of respiratory droplets from people infected with coronavirus,” said the HSE.Just two days ago, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar launched a government campaign to urge people to wear face masks in public places and he did not rule out the possibility that the government might make the wearing of masks mandatory.“It’s seen as an additional hygiene measure that can help reduce the spread of the infection ....

Photograph: Brian LawlessPA Regulations requiring people entering the Republic from abroad to provide the address where they will be self-isolating for the required 14-day period have been extended for a further three weeks. Upon arrival in the State at airports or ports, iniduals are required to fill in a passenger locator form. The coronavirus measures are in place to allow authorities to check if iniduals are self-isolating for 14 days as advised, and for contact tracing purposes. Those who do not fill out the passenger locator form or who provide false details can face a fine of €2,500 or a prison term of six months.The regulations were introduced on May 28th to last until June 18th, at which point they would be reviewed. A Department of Health spokeswoman confirmed on Thursday the regulations had been extended until July 9th, “at which stage they will be reviewed.”“This means anyone arriving in Ireland will have to fill out a form and inform us of their whereabouts. This ensures we have an adequate contact tracing system in place,” she said. The spokeswoman said public health advice instructing people to self-isolate for 14 days upon arriving into the State from abroad remains in place. However, she added this advice was “strongly recommended,” but not mandatory. “We would ask that all persons arriving into the State follow this advice as closely as they can,” she said. In recent weeks the Cabinet has discussed the potential easing of overseas travel restrictions, with the option of permitted travel between other countries where coronavirus has been controlled under consideration. One source said Cabinet colleagues had begun to receive queries from constituents on when they could travel abroad on holidays again.Insurance claimsCurrently the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) advises “against all non-essential travel overseas until further notice,” including Britain, but not Northern Ireland. Several insurance companies have warned if holidaymakers decide to disregard the existing advice on overseas travel they will not be covered. Zurich has advised customers that if iniduals travel abroad against the DFA advice any insurance claim arising from the coronavirus pandemic could be denied. Similarly Laya states if policyholders booked trips after the advice on non-essential travel was introduced they will not be covered.In a statement, Insurance Ireland, which represents the industry, said while the wording of policies differ, “in general if a policy holder decides to travel at a time when the Government advises against non-essential travel, they would be in danger of invalidating their travel insurance.” The group said its “strong advice” is that policyholders “follow the Irish Government’s advice at all times.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4283259.1592557221!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"we are devastated vigil held for colm horkan as books of condolence open","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tHundreds gathered in Castlerea on Thursday for a vigil in memory of Colm Horkan.

Photograph: Matt DunhamAP PhotoIt was not so much a garden as a small, walled patio but as three of us sat around a large table eating fish and chips, we knew we were within either the spirit or the letter of the lockdown law, even if we were not sure which. My friend Johnny had chosen the menu earlier that day when he saw that his local fish and chip shop had reopened and he was eager to give them whatever business he could.It’s a story repeated all over London and one friend after another this week has talked up the merits of their favourite burrito stand or sandwich shop just back in business but with no customers. With most office workers still working from home, the entire economy that provides them with lunches, transport, dry cleaning and other services is struggling to come back to life.But Johnny’s concern for his local businesses reflects something else that has changed in London during the lockdown as the traditional reserve that governs relations with neighbours has crumbled. James, who was also at the fish and chip supper, said he had spent 12 years avoiding anything more than breezy cordiality with the other residents of his flat block.He was particularly keen not to get too close to the woman who lived directly below him, who seemed to be quite sociable and fond of a drink like himself. He was afraid that if he started talking to her, they might decide to have a drink together in one of their flats and soon it could become a routine that would be hard to put a stop to. And what would he do then?A serious pyrophobe who will rush home from anywhere if he thinks he left the radio plugged in, James also believed that his neighbour smoked in bed and would one day burn the house down.It started with the weekly 8pm clap for the NHS, when they found themselves on the street outside waiting for the din to begin and she told him she had found a Waitrose that was always empty and had everything that was in short supply, from eggs to toilet roll.When the lockdown rules eased, James and his neighbour started to go for socially distanced walks in Regent’s Park, slurping very strong gin and tonics from runners’ water bottles. They now have a weekly date in a garden space they have commandeered and James says he regards her as a friend.In my building, we traditionally avoid anything beyond the shortest greeting apart from at a drinks party in the lobby once a year which only a handful of us go to.During the lockdown, I would check with the hall porter every day on the health of some of the older neighbours, particularly a funny, clever couple in their late 80s, both of whom had to go into hospital before Christmas. One sunny day when I asked after the couple, he waved towards the bleak, concrete courtyard outside.“They’re out there drinking a bottle of rosé,” he said.And there they were, she in a yellow cotton frock and he in pink shorts and a blue and white striped shirt, each of them with a glass of wine and a book in front of them. Other neighbours were scattered around the usually deserted courtyard, some on their laptops, others apparently doing nothing at all.As the lockdown has eased, the lobby has become the communal space its architects probably intended and everyone is talking to one another in a way we never have before. For some, it’s probably the loneliness of working from home alone with none of the casual daily interactions of office life that have pushed them across the Rubicon of getting to know their neighbours.But something else is happening too. A psychiatrist told a friend of mine that coronavirus has “torn the skin off the world”, leaving us more vulnerable than before to our feelings and fears. And in London, many people’s greatest fear is that the economy will not recover and that they or many of the people they see every day will soon be in deep trouble.Before Johnny went to the fish and chip shop the other day, he met the builders who have made his life hell for the past few years, drilling from 6am until late in the evening. His campaign against them, which included hectoring the contractor over the phone late at night, got so far out of control that the police spoke to him about it.When he asked them if they’d like him to move his car out of their way, they told him how sorry they were for all the nuisance they caused.“No don’t, I’ve changed,” he told them.“Please make as much noise as you have to for as long as you can. I’m just happy that you all have a job.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4283222.1592555300!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"us army removes into the wild bus from alaskan wilderness","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Alaska Army National Guard uses a CH-47 Chinook helicopter to airlift an abandoned bus out of  the Alaska backcountry. Photograph: Sgt Seth LaCountAlaska National GuardA bus abandoned in the Alaskan wilderness and made famous by the book and film Into The Wild has been removed for public safety after tourists repeatedly had to be rescued while trying to reach it, the state’s National Guard said.A US Army helicopter airlifted the 1940s-era vehicle from its spot west of the Teklanika River on Thursday.The bus was made famous by adventurer Chris McCandless (24), who lived in it during the summer of 1992 and died of starvation after 114 days in the wilderness.His story was told by author Jon Krakauer in the 1996 book Into The Wild, which was adapted into a 2007 film directed by Sean Penn.The National Guard said the bus was a public safety issue because it was luring fans of McCandless to venture out into the dangerous Alaskan wild.There were 15 bus-related search and rescue operations by the state between 2009 and 2017, according to the Department of Natural Resources.Two travellers died after drowning while on their way to the vehicle in separate incidents in 2010 and 2019, officials said.As recently as February, Alaska State Troopers rescued five Italian hikers, one of whom suffered severe frostbite.Locals had called for authorities to reduce or eliminate the danger caused by the bus, the National Guard said.Corri A Feige, commissioner for the Department of Natural Resources, said: “We encourage people to enjoy Alaska’s wild areas safely, and we understand the hold this bus has had on the popular imagination.“However, this is an abandoned and deteriorating vehicle that was requiring dangerous and costly rescue efforts, but more importantly, was costing some visitors their lives. I’m glad we found a safe, respectful and economical solution to this situation.”The bus was removed by a CH-47 Chinook helicopter. The aircrew also ensured the safe transportation of a suitcase that holds sentimental value to the McCandless family, the National Guard said.Mr Feige said the bus will be stored at a “secure site” while the Department of Natural Resources considers a permanent place for it. – PAStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4192672!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"us democratic","story":"The process to choose the Democratic nominee to take on Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election is well under way.States across the country are in the process of choosing\u0026nbsptheir preferred candidate, either through a primary contest or a caucus.

at its heart - family.The President, greeted warmly by the Prince of Wales for the ceremonial arrival, spoke movingly of the Royal Family’s long friendship with his country, embodied by the Queen and her memories of wartime London.Britain in turn, said Prince Charles, harbours the “greatest possible fondness for France and her people”, with the “ties that bind us together” so closely intertwined.The time for politics was later first there was history and an endearing, enduring gratitude from one President to the British people.At its centre was the 80th anniversary of General Charles de Gaulle’s rallying Second World War cry to France, broadcast by the BBC from 1940 London urging his people to resist Nazi occupation.Now seen as a seminal moment in French history, it merited not just a post-lockdown visit with all the challenges of the new socially-distant era, but no less than the Legion d\u0027Honneur for the city and people of London.Mr Macron’s day started in Paris, hearing the recollections of 99-year-old veteran and “Companion of the Liberation” Hubert Germain, during the visit to the Ordre de la Liberation museum.A short flight to RAF Northolt, in a Dassault Falcon 7X decorated in the national colours of France, was followed by a ceremonial arrival outside Clarence House, where the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall were waiting.Under grey skies with umbrellas at the ready, the trio greeted with a knowing “namaste”, skipping the customary handshakes in favour of Covid-19-friendly procedure.Standing a careful distance apart, a ceremonial guard of honour from Number 7 Company Coldstream Guards were joined by the Band of the Coldstream Guards for the national anthems of France and the UK.As ever, when the Royal Family is hosting, it is the details that matter: the Chanel shoes worn by the Duchess in a nod to their French guest the distinctive green French Order of Agricultural Merit fastened proudly by the Prince.Both Mr Marcon and Prince Charles wore the small red pin badge of the Legion d’Honneur.Inside Clarence House, a meeting saw the Prince show exhibits from Second War War history amid half an hour of conversation. By mid-afternoon, Mr Macron laid a wreath at the statues of Charles’ grandparents, King George VI and the Queen Elizabeth in the Mall, later recalling how they stood by their people in London during the Blitz.In Carlton Gardens, the site of De Gaulle’s appeal, both the Prince and the President laid wreaths in tribute to the General in remembrance of his famous address: I call upon all Frenchmen who want to remain free to listen to my voice and follow me.In reciprocal speeches, Mr Macron thanked London for giving his Second World War countrymen a voice and platform to fight the Nazi occupation, while the Prince praised the enduring cross-channel links as important now as ever.In French, Mr Macron spoke movingly about how “Britain gave shelter to France”, inspiring the “soldiers of the shadows”.Delivering the “infinite thanks” of the French to London with the Legion d’Honneur, he pledged: “We will carry on writing together the tale of two cities.”The Prince, who delivered half of his own speech in French, reciprocated the sentiments, speaking of the “deep affection” between countries standing together then and now as they “face new threats and challenges”.After official photographs, Mr Macron was steered to Downing Street and the Prime Minister for what appeared to be a jovial socially-distanced meeting punctured by thumbs-ups, pointing and comic gestures in front of the cameras.And, as the visit drew to a close, a show of Franco-British unity in the skies: a fly past from the Red Arrows and their French equivalent, La Patrouille de France.It honoured the anniversary of the ‘Appel’ and, Mr Macron said, the helping hand from the “modest heroic spirit” of Britain that forever changed the fortunes of his nation.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"exclusive church england bank england apologise historic slavery","story":"The Rev.

Not that long ago it had statues of French officials – of which only one remains, hidden in a consulate garden. It had, a bit earlier, statues of Christian saints and Roman dignitaries, of which there is no trace. Before that, it must have had statues of Phoenician deities. All have been destroyed, and with them visible proof of the complex history of North Africa.There is nothing new about submitting statues to the trial that their subjects escaped. In the Roman Empire, when a Caesar fell out of public grace and was murdered, his successor’s first thought was about statues. Faces were erased, then redrawn in the new emperor’s image. Tearing down statues is not new, either. People re-evaluate the past, but when it comes to re-evaluating iniduals, things get trickier. How much did a person’s representation owe to its own time? Frankly, almost everything.Cecil Rhodes was not particularly loved in his own day his wealth was admired, but not his half-avowed homosexuality. He might have been too forward-thinking, for what business of his was it to create a scholarship that could be awarded regardless of race or creed? The language of his will is clear and obvious: “no student shall be qualified or disqualified for election to a Scholarship on account of his race or religious opinions.”If Rhodes was the racist we assume he was, then surely he knew what “race” meant? Five years after Rhodes’s death, in 1907, in the wake of the election of the first black Rhodes Scholar, Alain LeRoy Locke, the Rhodes Trustees argued that when Rhodes used the term “race” he might have meant “Dutch, English, Jew, and the rest.” Perhaps Rhodes was simply more progressive than his trustees, and than most people of his time.Rhodes endowed my college at Oxford, Oriel, with the means to further its work and fulfill its vocation as “The Provost and Scholars of the House of the Blessed Mary the Virgin in Oxford, commonly called Oriel College, of the Foundation of Edward the Second of famous memory, sometime King of England”. Rhodes is included in the daily college prayer said after dinner in hall, and in the yearly benefactors’ service. Does that mean that we, as a community, condone the horrors he engaged in? No of course not.History is an unyielding judge. A time will come when people will shrug their shoulders at the weariness of this overwrought generation of Britons who, having locked themselves up for more than two months, emerged to fight statues and ghosts. To remove any statue now would say: “up to June 2020, we were racist. But now, lo, we are washing our hands in the blood of our statues, we are not racist anymore.”It is alright for hands to be dirty. No hands are clean in history. The first colonisers of North Africa wiped out all its Christian and Jewish heritage, and thrived on the slave-trade. They had black slaves as well as white slaves. Any neutral view of history tells us that oppression is a matter of military power, and not of race. When I first arrived in France I found the presence of religious statues beautiful. They spoke about the past of a country I wanted to settle in, a land I wanted to become organically part of. France took me in as I took it in, with its complicated past and the painful pages of its history. Then I came to Oxford.I took Oxford in as it took me in I sincerely hope that I was admitted because I write quirky ideas about French authors who were hated in their days, then rehabilitated, and then hated again. I am at home here, walking down the High Street with Rhodes on one side and the Blessed Virgin Mary on the other. I hope Oxford did not take me in because of how my “ethnic background” makes the ersity quotas look better.I never felt more at home than when the city was deserted because of coronavirus anyway, I had nowhere else to go. To some, Oxford might be a Harry Potter setting to be enjoyed while they enhance their CVs to me, it stands as the last place on earth where people would dedicate their lives to the pursuit of truth.I will not say that as an African I am oppressed by Oriel’s statue of Rhodes and by the buildings Oxford owes to imperial largesse, nor that I feel incomplete, as a Catholic, by the absence of statues in some of the other niches. I do not wish to change a single stone of Oxford, because I love it. I love it as much, and maybe more, than I love any city I have lived in before.There is no shame in loving the country you belong to. We immigrants love it, too. It is possible to criticise a country and the people who built it, while still loving it. Without a French presence in Morocco, I doubt I would have had any chance to enjoy an international academic career, let alone as a woman. My mother insisted that I should be educated in the French system my grandmother’s pride was that I ended up teaching French to French teenagers.Could I decolonise myself? No nor do I wish to. I am proud of what the complicated past of colonialism made me. I feel no guilt about it, and the last thing I need now is the apologies of a French person feeling sorry for me.White guilt is unhelpful and condescending.

Was I still living in the real world, or had I woken up in some kind of parallel universe? While the economy goes to self-induced hell in a handcart, we find ourselves arguing about what Nelson Mandela would have thought about removing a statue of Cecil Rhodes from the façade of Oriel College, Oxford.It might be argued, I suppose, that the one follows naturally from the other: that the argument over colonial statues, slavery, racism, and the bended knee is only a manifestation of the wider crisis in society and the economy. This is what three months of lockdown has done to us, giving wing to and amplifying a seething mass of ongoing distractions, resentments and grievances.I imagine this is just the beginning. Far from bringing us closer together in a wartime spirit of solidarity, the pandemic seems to be only driving us further apart.But not all comparisons with the war are invalid. The country is facing a degree of fiscal ruin that does indeed bear some comparison with the costs of a major war. How this is all going to be paid for is an issue of infinitely more importance than the future of our colonial statues, or what Dominic Raab might think of the bended knee symbolism of the Black Lives Matter movement.It is the disadvantaged in society who will be hit hardest by the continued closure of our schools, the annihilation of large parts of the hospitality, entertainment and retail industries, and the tsunami of debt sweeping in on us. Yet rather than how to get out of the mess we have created for ourselves, the national conversation instead seems stuck in taking offence. If it wasn’t so serious, it would be laughable. We apparently prefer anger-inducing distraction to facing up to harsh realities.The Government is set to borrow between £300 billion and £350 billion this year to help finance its coronavirus response, sending the national debt spiralling to in excess of 100 per cent of GDP. To this should be added the £100 billion, and rising, of Government guaranteed or subsidised loans to private business, many of which will never be repaid. Many of these aptly named “bounce-back” loans will come bouncing back on to the public balance sheet.None of this matters, it might be argued, as long as the magic money tree of the Bank of England printing press keeps whirring. As fast as the Government issues the debt, the Bank of England hoovers it up in secondary markets. Without this so-called “monetary financing”, the Government would have struggled to borrow on the scale it has interest rates would have rocketed, the economy would have further collapsed, and the Government’s debt‑servicing costs would have spiralled out of control.Yet there are signs that even the Bank of England is beginning to worry about its role as the national piggy bank. The extra £100 billion of “quantitative easing” announced yesterday leaves total asset purchases sanctioned for this year some way short of the amount the Government needs to borrow. Clinging to the hope that the economy can recover reasonably rapidly from here on in, the Bank’s chief economist, Andy Haldane, actually refused to vote even for the additional £100 billion.As long as everyone is doing the same, then monetary financing is just about sustainable. There is safety in numbers if all major economies are equally guilty of the same thing. It is also true that Japan has been doing debt monetisation for years without any obvious adverse consequence, so why not the UK?But Japan is different. It has a very high savings rate and relatively low taxes. There is a sense in whichThe Japanese government essentially borrows from its citizens, rather than taxes them. In the UK, we tax and borrow with equal vigour. This plainly cannot go on forever.The trouble is that even if we think of today’s extraordinary levels of debt accumulation as a largely temporary phenomenon that will ease as the pandemic passes, all the political pressures are for permanently higher spending, and therefore higher deficits. It is remarkable how quickly a “temporary” giveaway becomes “permanent”. Free school meals will soon be the new winter fuel allowance.But this is trivial against the big daddy of the 1 to 2 per cent of GDP now pretty much promised for additional public spending on health and social care. The wider “levelling up” agenda, infrastructure revolution, the Project Defend programme for building national resilience, more money for police, for defence, for education, and so on – all this comes on top.We’ll get found out pretty quickly if we start printing money to fund that lot. There is only so much bending of the Bank of England’s mandate that you can do before investors call time on the currency. We face generational challenges on the balance between debt, tax and spend.

It had planned to rebrand Europe’s largest regional airline this year as Virgin Connect in a strategy to concentrate on feeding Virgin Atlantic’s hubs at Heathrow and Manchester.Jonathan Peachey, a Cyrus Capital advisor who played a key role in creating Connect Airways to acquire Flybe, told The Australian: “It’s definitely not the case that we have abandoned Flybe,” He added: “Cyrus is doing everything it can, along with the other consortium members, to ensure that a business emerges that can re-hire the many thousands of employees who were dependent on it.”Flybe handled eight million passengers annually but was hard hit when travel screeched to a halt as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. Thousands of flights were grounded as a result of lockdowns and travel restrictions. Many carriers are now resuming service, with flights planned from July 1. See our full list of airlines that have announced the resumption of flights.London City will resume flights on June 21  Cuba and the Dominican Republic will welcome tourists from July 1 Malta will reopen to British holidaymakers on July 15 Florida’s tourism businesses fear second shutdown after new spikeItaly will pay its citizens €500 to go on holidayPolitics latest news: School \u0026#39contingency plans\u0026#39 under way in case pupils cannot return in September, admits minister Coronavirus latest news: Minister unable to confirm whether government has signed contract with Google and Apple for contact-tracing app China releases genome of virus that caused Beijing outbreak saying could be linked to EuropeWithout a revival in Scotland, Labour will need to take safe Tory seats such as Jacob Rees-Mogg\u0026#39s to seize power Dutchman receives \u0026#39proof-of-life\u0026#39 photos of stolen van Gogh paintingThe Briefing: Sign up for two-minute audio news updates on WhatsApp, Apple, Spotify and Alexa twice a dayColombian army rescues two kidnapped touristsCoronavirus world round-up: China publishes genome of latest virus outbreak\u0026#39This government is failing on every single front\u0026#39 -  readers on this week’s top storiesSouth Korea\u0026#39s unification minister resigns as tensions riseZoom will become magnet for child abusers with plan to encrypt calls, warns NSPCCComment: The country is fiddling while our economy burnsComment: The country is fiddling while our economy burnsComment: A social revolution in our education system may just still be possibleThe troubled history of the NHS tracing app that was destined to failChina prosecutes two Canadian men over alleged espionageNHS test and trace app: How will the Government join forces with Apple and Google?Gunman on the run after police officer is killed and another seriously injured in New ZealandBack to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/06/16/09/annular-solar-eclipse-2020-moon.jpg","title":"annular solar eclipse 2020 live how to watch where date time","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Across large parts of the world on 21 June the sun will create a \u0027ring of fire\u0027 around the moonA rare type of solar eclipse is taking place this week across large parts of the world, as the Sun, Moon and Earth align.The total annular solar eclipse takes place when the moon is too far away in its orbit of the Earth to completely block out the sun, causing light to appear around the edges of the moon.The name annular is derived from the Latin word for ring and the effect it creates has been referred to by astronomers as a “ring of fire”.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIt takes several minutes for the moon to pass in front of the sun but the total eclipse lasts less than a second.The path of the annular solar eclipse takes it across Africa, Central Asia and South East Asia on Sunday, 21 June. Nasa has made a map of its trajectory, showing where the annular phase of the eclipse will be visible, weather permitting. Millions more will be able to witness a partial solar eclipse, though unfortunately for sky gazers in the UK and US it will not be visible.Details of object that smashed into Moon during lunar eclipse revealed“It’s much more important to watch the weather forecasts a day or two before the eclipse and choose a location with the best chance of a cloud-free sky during the eclipse.“Good weather is the key to successful eclipse viewing – better to see a shorter eclipse from clear sky than a longer eclipse under clouds.”A live stream of the eclipse will be broadcast by Timeanddate, allowing anyone to watch it no matter where they are in the world.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas from fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telescope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

Mr Uddin is one of a number of suppliers who say that Sir Philip’s fashion empire has refused to pay for millions of pounds worth of orders, leaving them struggling to pay workers and keep the lights on.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMr Uddin told The Independent that he was forced to shut down production two weeks ago because cancelled orders meant his cash flow had dried up and he could not pay money owed to suppliers of materials. He said he is now paying out $25,000 per day in costs but has no income, and now fears that without an urgent resolution he will have to close his doors for good.The Bangladesh Export Processing Zone, where Denim Expert’s factory is located, has suspended Mr Uddin’s import and export permissions because of unpaid rent and utility bills. Goods that were due to be shipped out in February and March have been sat in containers at the port incurring charges each day.“With payments virtually suspended since the outbreak started, there has been a catastrophic impact upon the cash flow of our operation, which functions on very low margins at the best of times,” Mr Uddin said.

Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailAccording to campaign group Traidcraft, around 70 per cent of the cost of the garments is for the raw materials that go into them. Most manufacturers take this material on credit and pay it off when buyers pay them for the finished goods, meaning that when money is not forthcoming they quickly run into problems. Arcadia said it had no direct relationship with Denim Expert but confirmed that it did have outstanding orders for the company’s goods via a third party which buys jeans from a number of factories.Following media coverage of Mr Uddin’s problems with Arcadia and other buyers, an Arcadia representative contacted Denim Expert but no agreement has been reached. The company offered to buy some of the goods but not until August, an offer which Mr Uddin said he could not accept. An Arcadia spokesperson said the group was “in ongoing discussions” with its suppliers, including Denim Expert, to come to an agreement about the cancelled orders. The group has been in financial difficulty in recent years, narrowly avoiding administration in June 2019 after landlords backed a rescue deal at the last minute. Under the deal, 50 stores were earmarked for closure and 1,000 people lost their jobs. Former Debenhams employees raise money for Bangladeshi workersWhy coronavirus could add fuel to fast fashion’s fireRenting could be the trick to help me curb my fast fashion habitsLike the rest of the fashion retail sector, Arcadia has also been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic and lockdown, which forced all non-essential stores to close on the 23 March.Mr Uddin is one of hundreds of suppliers to the fashion industry facing imminent closure after months of unpaid orders.While some buyers, including H\u0026ampM and Zara, have honoured the majority of contracts and paid for orders, others such as Asda, Arcadia and Edinburgh Woollen Mill have demanded steep discounts or failed to pay for goods altogether.According to data published in April by the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA), the Arcadia Group cancelled £9m worth of orders in Bangladesh alone.Usually in manufacturing industries like this, whatever the buyer wants, you have to accept. That’s how it’s been for the last 100 yearsGlobally, the group, which is owned by Sir Philip’s wife through a holding company in Monaco, cancelled as much as £100m, according to The Worker Rights Consortium (WRC).Mr Uddin added: “I am not interested to work with Arcadia any more. I want to get rid of them as a buyer. Usually in manufacturing industries like this, whatever the buyer wants, you have to accept. That’s how it’s been for the last 100 years.“I have made up my mind. I only want to work with the people who are fair and responsible.”Fiona Gooch, senior policy advisor at Traidcraft Exchange, said: “It is terrible that factories are having to close in Bangladesh, and other garment producing countries, through no fault of their own. “By refusing to pay up, brands like Philip Green’s Burton Menswear are putting thousands of workers, mainly young women and their families at risk of destitution. “Philip Green is a millionaire. Like other fashion brand owners, he can easily afford to pay for the finished clothes that they have previously ordered, and the fabric bought to make future orders for them.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But the bank’s purchasing programme provides some useful insurance against itAs the saying goes: “A billion here, a billion there – soon you’re talking serious money.”How about hundreds of billions?The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee has voted to increase its asset purchase scheme by another £100bn. This comes on top of the £200bn it committed to purchasing earlier in the year.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhat does that mean?The dirty truth about washing your handsWhat is the difference between Covid-19 and the common cold and flu?Can face masks really protect you against coronavirus or flu?The UK government’s four stages of fighting coronavirus explainedWhat are symptoms of coronavirus – and where has it spread?The first thing to note is that the bank will now be purchasing £300bn of UK government bonds in 2020.That’s roughly equivalent to the projected deficit of the UK government in the current financial year to pay for all its emergency coronavirus-related spending, including the jobs furlough scheme.It’s not quite correct to say that the bank is funding the state’s spiralling deficit during this crisis.The projected public-sector net cash requirement is actually more than £400bn and private investors will have to buy the debt first and then sell to the bank.Yet it’s abundantly clear to everyone in the financial markets that the bank is acting as an effective backstop for government’s borrowing.Does that matter?It certainly matters for UK government bond investors.They know they can be confident that when they buy UK government bonds – known as gilts – from the Debt Management Office they will be able to sell them on to the bank.That removes any fear that they will be stuck holding bonds that no one else wants to buy.This should stabilise the market for UK government debt, meaning that it can continue to borrow to support millions of ordinary British workers and businesses.It’s far from clear that there was any danger of a crisis in the UK government bond market. But the bank’s purchasing programme provides some useful insurance against it.Will it help the economy directly? The bank says the asset purchases should help support demand – or spending – in the economy. The evidence here is somewhat mixed. It’s plausible that purchases helped do that in the immediate wake of the financial crisis. But the power of successive rounds of asset purchases to support demand directly seemed to weaken.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In part that’s because previous warnings of an inflationary spiral proved unwarranted.It’s also because the Bank is no outlier it’s doing pretty much the same as other big central banks such as the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank. The Fed has effectively promised unlimited bond purchases in this crisis.£100bn is serious money in anyone’s book. But the reality is that, in the world of central banking in the era of Covid-19, it’s nothing particularly special.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Like other fashion brand owners, he can easily afford to pay for the finished clothes that they have previously ordered, and the fabric bought to make future orders for them.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by email“As partial lifting of the measures takes place, we see signs of some activity returning,” said Mr Bailey in the press conference.But he added: “We don’t want to get too carried away by this. Let’s be clear, we’re still living in very unusual times.The minutes of the MPC’s meeting warned: “While recent demand and output data had not been quite as negative as expected, other indicators suggested greater risks around the potential for longer lasting damage to the economy from the pandemic.”Voting against further stimulus measures, Mr Haldane said that the recovery was happening “sooner and materially faster” than had been forecast in May.Data on payments suggest consumer spending started to recover in May and June, and the housing market has recently begun to pick up, the bank said.Official figures released last week show that gross domestic product (GDP) slumped by a record 20.4 per cent in April as the country endured a full month of lockdown conditions, and has now contracted by a quarter since the Covid-19 outbreak began.The UK economy is forecast to be hit harder than that of any other developed nation.The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said last month that UK output will shrink 11.5 per cent this year or 14 per cent if there is a second wave of coronavirus cases.The extra £100bn stimulus announced on Thursday will be used to buy gilts – UK government debt – with purchases to be completed by the end of 2020.Government spending has soared to cover the cost of schemes to support businesses and jobs. Public sector borrowing is expected to surpass £300bn this year.The bank says the asset purchases should help support demand – or spending – in the economy, which has fallen dramatically during the pandemic.There had been some speculation that the bank might cut its key benchmark interest rate to below zero for the first time.But there was no discussion of this in the MPC minutes.At the press conference Mr Bailey said that it remained an option but stressed there was no reason to expect it to be introduced imminently.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The most disadvantaged children will have access to tutors through a £350m national programme for the 2020-21 academic year, as part of an attempt to prevent the attainment gap from widening further.The education secretary, Gavin Williamson, has also announced that a further £650m will be shared across state primary and secondary schools to help children from all backgrounds who have lost teaching time.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe prime minister, Boris Johnson, said the “catch up package” would “help head teachers to provide extra support to children who have fallen behind while out of school”, adding: “I am determined to do everything I can to get all children back in school from September, and we will bring forward plans on how this will happen as soon as possible.”The £650m can be spent at the discretion of head teachers, but is intended to be used to fund small group tuition.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.French President Emmanuel Macron gestures about social distancing alongside Prime Minister Boris Johnson as he arrives at Downing Street for a meeting.

The scale of our response must match the scale of the challenge.“This package will make sure that every young person, no matter their age or where they live, gets the education, opportunities and outcomes they deserve, by spending it on measures proven to be effective, particularly for those who are most disadvantaged.“The plan will be delivered throughout the next academic year, bringing long term reform to the educational sector that will protect a generation of children from the effects of this pandemic.”It comes as children across the country have struggled to keep up their education during lockdown – particularly those with limited access to digital resources and devices. Government risks ‘failing a generation’ if schools not reopened soonAnd concerns continue to be raised over the wellbeing of at-risk children outside of school settings designed to serve as a safeguarding tool and a support network. Yesterday an open letter from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health warned that: “For many children and their families, these interventions are the difference between surviving and thriving.

But the two-metre rule is in itself a social-distancing measure.“Removing it has an impact in terms of the transmission of the disease, so we have to make sure in that review that we have the space and the virus is under control enough to be able to make the change and replace the two-metre rule, if that is the conclusion of the review, with something that then makes it easier to do things like have people together in schools.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by email“As partial lifting of the measures takes place, we see signs of some activity returning,” said Mr Bailey in the press conference.But he added: “We don’t want to get too carried away by this. Let’s be clear, we’re still living in very unusual times.The minutes of the MPC’s meeting warned: “While recent demand and output data had not been quite as negative as expected, other indicators suggested greater risks around the potential for longer lasting damage to the economy from the pandemic.”Voting against further stimulus measures, Mr Haldane said that the recovery was happening “sooner and materially faster” than had been forecast in May.Data on payments suggest consumer spending started to recover in May and June, and the housing market has recently begun to pick up, the bank said.Official figures released last week show that gross domestic product (GDP) slumped by a record 20.4 per cent in April as the country endured a full month of lockdown conditions, and has now contracted by a quarter since the Covid-19 outbreak began.The UK economy is forecast to be hit harder than that of any other developed nation.The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said last month that UK output will shrink 11.5 per cent this year or 14 per cent if there is a second wave of coronavirus cases.The extra £100bn stimulus announced on Thursday will be used to buy gilts – UK government debt – with purchases to be completed by the end of 2020.Government spending has soared to cover the cost of schemes to support businesses and jobs. Public sector borrowing is expected to surpass £300bn this year.The bank says the asset purchases should help support demand – or spending – in the economy, which has fallen dramatically during the pandemic.There had been some speculation that the bank might cut its key benchmark interest rate to below zero for the first time.But there was no discussion of this in the MPC minutes.At the press conference Mr Bailey said that it remained an option but stressed there was no reason to expect it to be introduced imminently.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

For those that can’t figure out the puzzles for themselves, all 15 combinations are listed at the bottom of the article.Inevitably, spoilers for the game follow...In the game’s opening chapter, this safe is found in the supermarket in Jackson. The clue is found on the desk next to the safe. Look behind you, and you will see a wall with pictures of “Employees of the Month” – there should be one that stands out.In Seattle, Day 1, you have the option of exploring the Bank with Ellie in the Downtown area (located at 5th and James). You can find a note detailing the plans for a failed bank heist, which also provides the combination for the safe room. Travel through the safety deposit box room  – found at the end of the tills – and the vault should be on your left.What does The Last of Us Part II’s LGBT representation mean for games?Ellie finds this easily missable safe after going through the fence Downtown at Madison between 5th and 6th during Seattle Day 1. The combination is the same as the code used to open West Gate 2 – so check the list of gate codes that should be in your inventory.The fourth safe is found in the courthouse in Seattle Day 1. It’s located under a desk by the window before you travel into the car park. The skeletal remains of a FEDRA soldier are nearby. There’s a white board nearby with the combination written on.In the Capitol Hill segment of Seattle Day 1, you encounter this safe around the time you start seeing explosive tripwires, in a thrift shop that’s by a gym. The safe is placed right at the back, and requires solving two clues to open – the first, on the bulliten board, which leads you to the second, which is written on the walls of the thrift shop’s toilets.The final safe in Seattle Day 1 is located in a breakroom in the area where you first fight Shamblers. The clue is written on a note left on a table, which points you towards a can of soda. Smash open a vending machine, and you will find part of the answer. Tap the numbers into the lock, and you will gain access to the employee locker room.At the beginning of Seattle Day 2, you need to find a tattoo parlour, located near the bike shop. Go through the parlour, and there is a small building in the back with a dumpster propped against the door. The safe is inside you can find the combination written on a note in one of the nearby buildings. Beware though – there are infected inside too.The Last of Us Part II is a bleak and beautiful triumph – reviewLater in Seattle Day 2, when you’re en route to the hospital and walking down Route 5, you’ll reach a gate you can’t open, requiring you to use a dumpster to prop up the gate. Before doing so, however, look for a nearby apartment with a truck parked outside that you can climb to enter through the second floor. Once in, you’ll find a note telling you that the safe code corresponds to a wedding anniversary. It’s written on a calendar nearby – count back 30 years from the circled date.This safe is also found during Seattle Day 2. After travelling through the Merci building, you drop into a pool and emerge on the other side of the road. Go into Weston’s pharmacy – the note containing the full code is found on your way in.During Seattle Day 3, Ellie acquires a speedboat. After travelling a short distance, you’ll reach a point where a gate blocks your progress, and you have to leave the boat to open it. There’s a caged area in your immediate proximity containing the safe – climb up to the upper level and search one of the dead bodies for a note that discloses the combination. Shift the cart away from the wall to reveal a hole, which leads you into the cage.During Abby’s Seattle Day 1, you pass by a hardware store. After going through it and the boat repair shop, you come across a trailer. Break a window, go inside, and there’s a WLF gun cache note with the combination on it. The safe itself is then stored in a nearby building, which you can enter through a hole in the wall, around the left side.In Abby’s section of the game, you come across a row of shops, including a bakery and the Red Dragon Bar, and what looks like an antiques shop. Travel through the bar up to the second floor, and jump across into the opposite building. There’s a note on the second floor that tells you the combination to the safe – which is kept in the bakery opposite.Naughty Dog boss says The Last of Us Part 3 could be next projectThe final safe in Abby’s Seattle Day 1 is found on the crashed ship, at the back of the boat. The combination clue is written on the mutiny note.After climbing the rapids and crossing the highway overpass in Abby’s Day 2, you jump down into an apartment, which contains the safe and notes left between two of the building’s neighbours. Look at the apartment numbers on the doors in the hallway to determine the combination, as per the note’s instructions.The last safe is located in the skyscraper in Abby’s Seattle Day 2, which you must travel down on your way to the hospital. Search the storage room next to the gym entrance, before the spore-filled area. A clue for the combination is written on an artefact inside the back room – the code is the same as the Wi-fi password, which is written near the juice bar.All the combinations:The Last of Us Part 2\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Two of the stores – in Ross-on-Wye and Leominster – reopened on Monday 15 June.“Being able to shop in person, especially at smaller independents, is a joy,” owner Andy Rossiter, pictured above, says. “I think lockdown made a lot of people realise that they don’t want all their shopping to just land at their door, but booksellers also know they need to work hard for their audience. It’s not simply a case of just opening your doors.”Rossiter has been busy preparing the stores, moving fixtures and checkouts so that staff and customers can socially distance while browsing for books.Carry out a risk assessment: employers will need to carry out Covid-19 risk assessments in consultation with their workers or trade unions.Maintain social distancing: employers should redesign workspaces to maintain social distancing between people and stagger start times.Manage transmission risk:\u0026nbspemployers should look into putting barriers in shared spaces, creating workplace shift patterns or fixed teams.Reinforcing cleaning processes: workplaces should be cleaned more frequently, paying close attention to\u0026nbspdoor handles and keyboards.“We have installed Perspex screens at till points, bought hand sanitiser stations for the entrances to our stores and placed tape and signage throughout so we can clearly indicate the social distancing rules within our stores,” he says.The bookshops have reopened with less members of staff and they have limited their opening hours from their pre-lockdown seven days to just five. Rossiter has also been consulting staff and getting their input on the UK Government’s coronavirus advice.“Our trade body, the Booksellers Association, has been brilliant at reading and interpreting this advice to make it bookshop-specific and releasing it in digestible and accessible weekly bulletins, he says.“Booksellers love serving customers, and we’ve been serving our local community for a decade, so seeing those regulars again and having that relationship start to return to normal will be fantastic.Surinder Josan, owner of All Seasons DIY, a family-run shop, explains how he has used strict safe workplace measures to keep his shop doors open and his businesses afloat.“All Seasons DIY is a family-run shop which was established over 40 years ago, run by myself, my wife, and my mother. My son and daughter work in the shop around their university studies as well,” Josan, below, says.The family decided to shut the shop when school closures were announced. But after just a week they decided to reopen the business in order to serve the local community, who relied on the store for essential food and other items.“In order to reopen, we had to reassess how we both serve and interact with our customers,” Josan explains. “We adopted several new measures to comply with social distancing to keep both ourselves and our customers safe.”These new measures they adopted included safe distance markers outside the shop, to limit the number of people in store at any one time, installing screens at the checkout areas, encouraging contactless payments, lowering the minimum card spend to £1, and offering hand wipes to customers.“The number of customers who have come in and complimented us for it is unbelievable. They say when they come here they feel really safe,” Josan adds.Blend Coffee Co is an independent coffee shop based in Portslade, East Sussex, near Brighton. The two directors behind the business, Oli Crawley and Tom Jennion, have introduced a range of measures so they could confidently reopen for staff and customers.“Our primary concern is to keep people safe, so to make sure our coffee shop was ready to be reopened we implemented a number of safer working measures,” says Crawley.These new measures included a deep clean of the shop prior to reopening, implementation of a new ordering layout and adopting a new policy which stipulates that no customers are allowed inside the store.Working alongside Crawley and Jennion are a further three members of staff.“Only the directors returned to work to alleviate any pressure on our barista team feeling they need to work,” says Crawley. “This also allows an operational analysis of all our new protocols to ensure they are efficient and safe.”The checkout system has now been moved to the front of the shop, Blend now only accepts card payments and there is a new waiting area outside the shop.This plan was developed after we undertook a risk assessment and analysis of the premises to ensure that customer-staff interaction could be maintained and sustained in a safe manner. We ran a test prior to reopening to ensure that our new measures would work and allow us and our customers to stay safe,” adds Crawley.For further information from the UK Government on how employers, employees and the self-employed can return to work safely, click hereThis is Government advice for EnglandWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Unfortunately, not long after her return, jobs began to get cancelled because of the intensifying Covid-19 crisis.She started looking for something else right away – and is currently living and working on New Moor Farm in Southminster, Essex, working with asparagus, having swapped fashion for food.Though a far cry from a usual career, Philip is enjoying her new setting. “Right now, I live on site on the farm, in one of the caravans in the orchard. It’s nice,” she explains. “The community is amazing. There are so many different characters on the farm. Everyone is really friendly and we’re all here for the same reasons: to help and to work.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHer day-to-day routine varies. “Most days I’m up at five, start working at six on the farm, in the packhouse,” she says. “Generally, I’m doing a little bit of everything, so I’m helping on the line, bundling, helping customers, grading – just helping out wherever I can.”Philip is among Brits across the country working on farms in order to help the industry continue despite the many obstacles presented by the Covid-19 pandemic.The temporary closure of much of the food and hospitality industry has left huge quantities of fresh produce at risk of going to waste. The pubs and restaurants that would usually purchase large amounts of vegetables remain shut and travel restrictions have prevented pickers from overseas working on the farms.Join the Pick For BritainThat’s why the Government is urging fit and healthy people looking for work across the country to get involved. The Pick For Britain initiative is helping to bring workers and employers together to ensure the farming industry can continue.From furloughed employees whose contracts allow them to work during this time, to university students on their summer breaks, it’s a great opportunity to earn money and meet new people – while helping Britain’s food industry during these unprecedented times.The growing season is only just getting started, so from now until September, bringing in the harvest requires a major effort. Visit pickforbritain.org.uk to find out moreEat seasonal and local vegBut that’s not the only way to support the industry right now. Simply eating more in-season local produce will help to prevent wastage.A wide range of vegetables are currently being harvested in the UK. These include asparagus, cucumbers, mushrooms, courgettes, spinach, summer squash, radishes, beetroot and tomatoes – and buying and cooking with this seasonal veg is a great way to contribute to the farming industry.​In need of some recipe inspo?

In fact, I chaired a meeting this morning of our local action committee, which is the formal process through which we make these decisions, working with local leaders, for instance, in Kirklees.“And the local director of public health and the council are heavily involved in the response.”But it raised immediate questions about why Kirklees Council itself had apparently sought to keep the outbreak secret.All libraries, museums and galleries in Leeds could closeIn a statement, Rachel Spencer-Henshall, the area\u0027s director of public health, said: “We were made aware of a number of positive cases of Covid-19 at a workplace in Kirklees.“We have been providing support and advice to both the management and employees in order to minimise any further transmission.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

All the famous faces, including a picture of Sir Peter, are “fans” of the Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group.Each fragment will be signed by the artist and auctioned on Bidsquare, with bids starting at £325. The auction will be live until midnight on 26 June.The idea originated when London Advertising approached Sir Peter about the project as it wanted to use the mural to raise money for organisations helping people during the pandemic.Sir Peter, who also designed artwork for Paul Weller, Ian Dury and The Who, said: “I’m very happy that the Mandarin Oriental mural can be used a second time to raise money for such a wonderful purpose.

But organisers stepped up after the lockdown began and started providing 5,000 meals a week to families in Poplar struggling to afford or access food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesDizzee volunteered as part of his work with Kitchen Social – the Mayor’s Fund for London programme providing food for children across the capital during the school holidays. “I was given an amazing opportunity to visit and help out Kitchen Social at Bygrove Primary School in Poplar, who are providing free food, books and school equipment to kids in the local area where I grew up,” he said.“Thank you to all the amazing people I met and thanks to the Mayor’s Fund for London for connecting the dots.”How to support our campaignBygrove Primary School is also receiving vital supplies from The Independent’s Help the Hungry campaign appeal partner The Felix Project.The food surplus charity, which delivers to hundreds of food banks and community projects across London, began helping the school at the start of the crisis by dropping off one or two trays of fresh produce and staple items each week.The charity has since increased the supply from one or two trays of food each week to 40 trays to help organisers cope with the huge demand.Mark Causton, manager of the school’s initiative, said: “The Felix Project have been an immense help – I can’t praise them enough. We know we’ll need to carry on this work right through the summer, so we rely on all the fresh food they’re supplying.”Mr Causton added: “We’ve seen a lot of parents furloughed or losing work over the past couple of months. In the case of some families struggling to afford to buy shopping, this is one of their only sources of getting food for their children.“It was really great to have Dizzee Rascal here helping out. He got stuck in, and got on so well with all the volunteers and all the families. It was just nice to see a smile on a lot of people’s faces.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

Figures from the Independent Food Aid Network (IFAN) show a 175 per cent rise, with both charities reporting this their “busiest period ever”. Furthermore, a survey by the giving platform Neighbourly of 900 charities and community groups providing food to the vulnerable found that 70 per cent expect the situation to get even worse in the next six to 12 months.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Independent proprietor Evgeny Lebedev paid special tribute to the almost 6,000 ordinary iniduals who have dug deep to contribute to our appeal. He said: “Time and time again Londoners have shown that they are capable of immense generosity and community spirit in this period of crisis.“To all those that donated, bought and bid — I salute you.”Morgan Stanley said the bank and its employees in London had made the donation as part of their global Covid-19 response.How to support our campaignClare Woodman, head of Morgan Stanley EMEA, said: “The Felix Project plays a vital role in distributing food to people in need, especially those severely impacted by the pandemic. I am proud our employees in London are supporting them as part of our Covid-19 Hunger Relief Campaign.”Another substantial donor was Partners Capital investment group, which donated £95,287.John Collis, head of Partners Capital, Europe, said they “selected The Felix Project as one of our charities to support during this difficult period as it is one of the most impactful charities in London today”.Heads down for quiz nightThe original Top Gear trio — Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May — will tonight host a special Zoom quiz in aid of our appeal partner, The Felix Project. Participants in the Quintessentially Foundation’s “World’s Greatest Quiz Night” will face five rounds of questions devised by Nicholas Shearing, questions producer for top British TV quiz shows Pointless, Debatable and Impossible. May, who has driven Felix vans delivering food to vulnerable Londoners throughout lockdown, said: “At least in this stay-at-home pub quiz version, it will be easy to cheat.” 7.30-9pm. Tickets £10: thefelixproject.orggreatestquizOur appeal was also boosted by the silent auction, in partnership with Quintessentially Foundation, which closed this week with 135 bids placed for 36 lots and raising almost £40,000.The most highly prized lots were two tickets to a Liverpool FC game, four tickets to the Euro 2021 semi-finals, a video-chat with Spurs coach Jose Mourinho, a private guitar lesson with singer-songwriter Ellie Goulding and a helicopter lesson.The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

After paying rent and all her bills from the universal credit she receives at the beginning of the month, she now finds she has just £4.30 left over for food and nappies for the rest of the month.How to support our campaignSo she is almost entirely dependent on school vouchers available for her oldest two children (£15 per child per week) to buy absolute essentials, and one weekly food package dropped off by the Sufra food bank.“I don’t mind going hungry sometimes, so long as my kids have food,” said Ms Sarri-Gonzalez. “Sometimes I might have just one main meal for myself in a day. There was one point during lockdown I didn’t manage to eat anything for myself for two days, almost three days. But I always set the table for the children – I keep things as normal as possible for them.”“It’s so difficult at the moment. So stressful. I’m hoping when the kids go back to school later in the year I can go back to work and make things easier somehow.”The Independent’s Help the Hungry campaign appeal partner The Felix Project has quadrupled the volume of surplus food it gets out to people in need since the crisis began.The work remains as urgent than ever. The most recent YouGov poll for the Food Foundation charity shows over 1.5 million people in households with children have been unable to access food for economic reasons during the lockdown.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe latest figures from The Trussell Trust show April was the busiest month ever for the network of food banks, with an 89 per cent increase in emergency parcels compared with the same month in 2019.And the number of parcels provided for children has more than doubled, while almost twice as many families with children are receiving them (a 95 per cent rise).Colman visits The Felix ProjectDr Rachel Loopstra, lecturer in nutrition at King’s College London, said: “It’s clear from the data, as well as from trends in foodbank use, that families with children are really struggling right now. Watching parents struggle to put food on the table and go without food themselves is devastating.”Rebecca Archer and her partner – who have three girls aged eight, six and three at home in London’s High Barnet – have found it difficult to afford enough food during lockdown. “The shopping I do is costing a lot more with them at home all the time,” she said.Once the bills are paid and the main weekly shop is done on a Monday, the couple finds they have about £50 left to get through the week – about half the amount they usually had before the pandemic hit.The family has recently taken advantage of two £15-a-week school vouchers they get for their two oldest girls, and receive some cooked meals from their neighbour Katie-Louise Barber – a volunteer delivering food using The Felix Project’s supplies.“It’s been a real strain. Thinking and worrying about money all the time isn’t easy,” said Ms Archer. “I never thought I’d be worrying about having enough for the children to eat. There was one point we just didn’t have enough for the pre-paid gas meter, so we had to go without that for more than a week.”The Trussell Trust, which runs the country’s biggest network of food banks, has warned food charities cannot cope “indefinitely” with the huge spike in demand for help caused by the pandemic.A coalition of anti-poverty charities had written to the chancellor asking for an emergency income support scheme that would increase child benefits and end the five-week wait for initial universal credit payments.Anthony Cotterill, leader of the Salvation Army in the UK, warned: “It’s years since we have seen poverty to be such a real and present danger for so many people. We are approaching a poverty tipping point.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis. Find out how you can help here.

Viruferrin has been scientifically proven to block 98 per cent of similar viruses to Covid-19, including influenza and Sars.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe snood-like coverings can be worn for up to 50 hours before they need washing, and their effectiveness only drops to 96 per cent after over 200 hours of wear.The face coverings are cut and sewn together by Cookson \u0026amp Clegg in Blackburn, which is run by Patrick Grant, star of the Great British Sewing Bee. He is also behind a campaign to get Britons making their own coverings, The Great Community Sew.How to support our campaignThe coverings, which retail at £20, are different to medical grade PPE used by NHS workers. However, due to the protein coverings they are more effective than standard face masks at protecting wearers from viruses.There was a buzz at the Royal Park Felix Project depot when boxes of Virustatic Shield coverings arrived.David Clark, who has been volunteering for three years, said: “I think it is important to wear these face coverings when you’re delivering to members of the public who potentially come into contact with vulnerable people.”Mr Clark dropped off some coverings to Ian Breen, centre manager at Acton Homeless Concern, which serves hot meals five days a week to those in temporary accommodation or on the streets. Mr Breen said: “It is fantastic to have a delivery of some masks for free. It is important to protect those working here and the people who use our centre.”Gretchen Fisher, from Ealing, who has been volunteering for four years, added: “I wear them whenever I go out as you have to protect others.” Mantas Keblis, the depot manager, said that having “extra precautions” would help food reach more people in London. “Everyone really likes them.

He added that it was time for legislative action and not another review.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe UK already has one of the most comprehensive centralised databases related to race and ethnicity in the form of its “Ethnicity facts and figures” service. It is designed to provide information about “the different experiences of people from a variety of ethnic backgrounds” and reveals some startling disparities between white people and Bame people living in the UK.Below are 11 charts that illustrate these different experiences.Stop-and-search powers have been heavily scrutinised in recent years and were the subject of a review by the Equality and Human Rights Commission in 2010 that found that black people were up to six-times more likely to be stopped by police than white people.Stop-and-search rates between 2018 and 2019 show that black people are now nearly 10-times more likely to be stopped and searched by police than white people. This has contributed to far higher arrest rates for black people than for white people.Not a single police force in England or Wales registered an arrest rate of less than 20 for every 1,000 black people.By contrast, not a single police force in England and Wales registered an arrest rate of more than 20 for every 1,000 white people.Disproportionate policing practices were also highlighted in a recent investigation into coronavirus lockdown enforcement across England and Wales.Freedom of Information (FOI) requests by advocacy group Liberty found that police forces were seven times more likely to fine Bame people during lockdown.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Around 63 per cent of households in the UK live in homes that they own, according to figures from the English Housing Survey.When these households are broken down into ethnicity, however, a stark difference emerges.White British people have higher than average home ownership rates ⁠— nearly double that of black Caribbean people and more than treble that of black African people. These minorities are instead vastly over represented when it comes to private renting and social housing.Only Indian households, which make up just 2.5 per cent of the population of England and Wales according to the 2011 Census, have higher home ownership rates the white British households.The lack of home ownership among minority communities in the UK may contribute to a reduced feeling of belonging compared to white people.Results from the most recent Community Life Survey found that black people are increasingly less likely to feel as though they belong to Britain compared to white or Asian people.A similar story of inequality can be seen when breaking down education statistics by ethnicity. It emerges as early as primary education, where white British children are 10 per cent more likely to achieve the expected standard in reading, writing and maths.By the time the two groups reach A-levels, white British students are more than three times as likely to achieve high grades than black Caribbean students, according to figures from the Department for Education.Worse education transfers to worse employment rates for minorities, with black people seeing at least double the unemployment levels as white people between 2004 and 2018.The UK’s Annual Population Survey revealed that black people in employment are also paid less on average than white people.Average hourly pay for black people hovered between £9.91 and £10.80 between 2013 and 2018, while white people saw wages consistently rise from £10.58 to £11.87. Only people from Indian backgrounds received better pay than white people.Systemic racism in the UK even manifests itself in the proportion of deaths from the coronavirus pandemic.Data reveals that people from Bame backgrounds are up to twice as likely to die from Covid-19 than people of whit British ethnicity.The risk of death for people of Bangladeshi ethnicity is twice as high as white British, while other Asian, black and Caribbean ethnicities are between 10 per cent and 50 per cent more likely to die, according to a report from Public Health England.Health experts say there is no evidence to suggest that people from Bame backgrounds are genetically predisposed to be more vulnerable to the virus than white people. The figures are therefore a result of existing social and racial inequalities.In his attack on the government’s plans for a racial equality commission, Lammy said the time for holding discussions and launching reviews was over.Nine charts that show extent of racial inequality in US“It feels that yet again in the UK we want figures, data, but we don’t want action,” he said.“Black people aren’t playing victim, as Boris indicated, they are protesting precisely because the time for review is over, and the time for action is now ... Get on with the action, legislate, move. You’re in government ⁠— do something.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It has four core beliefs: family, integrity, teamwork and success – all integral pillars of its Reconnection to Recovery and Resilience programme.Put together by Sharon Gray OBE and the federation’s head teachers, it’s designed to welcome pupils back to class after lockdown. “Everybody in the Embark community has done their bit,” says Gray, a headteacher for 20 years, mostly in special schools supporting youngsters experiencing social, emotional and mental health difficulties and schools going through challenges.“It’s been all hands on deck,” executive headteacher and Trust leader of Embark’s schools Matthew Crawford adds. “Even two weeks into lockdown we were thinking about our children returning to school, whatever date that may be.”Safety at school1. Anyone who is unwell or been in contact with somebody showing coronavirus symptoms should stay away from schools, colleges and childcare settings2. Hands should be cleaned more often than usual with soap and running water for at least 20 seconds and dried thoroughly. Alternatively, hand sanitiser or alcohol hand rub can be used3. Promote the ‘catch it, bin it, kill it’ approach to coughing and sneezing4. Clean frequently touched surfaces regularly using standard products, such as detergent and bleach5. Help to minimise contact and mixing by altering classroom layout and timetablesWith regards to physical changes that parents and pupils can expect to see in corridors and classrooms, Embark is working with Government guidance and undertaking a thorough, bespoke risk assessment for each of its schools. “It can’t be a one-size-fits all approach,” Crawford stresses.According to Anna Upton – head of the 240-pupil Chaucer Junior School in Ilkeston, Derbyshire – questionnaires were sent out to reconnect with parents, through which they could express concerns and suggest ideas about the return to classrooms.According to Upton, staggered breaks and how drop-offs will work were important issues that were flagged in questionnaires. “But the risk assessment the Trust has put in has allowed us to make a comprehensive plan and we can communicate that to the parents,” she explains.“What the Trust have done with the programme is to implement nine stages which support our schools to open as safely as possible, supporting the staff parents and the children. The risk assessment means that I, as a headteacher, can do what’s right for my school.”Chair of trustees Sarah Armitage emphasises the importance of teamwork based around a guiding principle: families first. We look after families, so we reach out we talk.” she says.“Then there’s teamwork. Let’s harness the power of the team so it’s not the headteacher sitting by themselves with all these things to think about – that load is shared.”Armitage’s back-to-school outlook is optimistic too: “We have created something with this programme that we hope will be massively beneficial. Our role as leaders is to keep that going, carry on putting emotional needs at the heart of everything we do, because then children are able to learn and benefit – and move through this crisis.”Information in this article applies to schools in England only.

In Vietnam, rats are caught in rice fields – some traders breed them in farms with other live animals.For years scientists have warned that the wildlife trade – including wet markets that sell live animals – can harbour infectious diseases such as coronaviruses.The origins of the current Covid-19 pandemic remain contested. However, experts suspect that the disease started in bats and was transferred to another animal before being passed on to humans.The study, published in the bioRxiv journal ahead of peer-review, found six known coronaviruses in samples taken from three southern provinces in Vietnam between 2013 and 2014.New York rats feel the pressure of city livingPositives increased significantly along the supply chain.

And it couldnt come at a greater time of need: with our nation on the brink of the worst ever holiday hunger.The Covid pandemic has had a devastating financial impact on families up and down the country, with millions now struggling to keep a roof over their heads.Parents are, understandably, racked with anxiety over job losses, loved ones health and school closures, which have seen classrooms lie empty for  weeks.And this week, with the summer holidays looming, they faced another worry: how would they feed their children without free school meal vouchers Its a fear Rashford has bravely alleviated.The Man Utd star made an impassioned plea to the Government to prioritise Englands most vulnerable kids by extending the vouchers scheme over the six-week holidays.Under the programme, the families of around . million children eligible for free school meals are given £ a week in vouchers to spend in supermarkets to keep their kids fed.This is not about politics this is about humanity, Rashford wrote in an open letter. Political affiliations aside, can we not all agree that no child should be going to bed hungry The footballer was speaking from real experience: growing up in a low-income household in Manchester, his own family relied on free school meals and breakfast clubs.Today, a similar hand-to-mouth existence is being lived by millions of children across the country. And, in recent months, its been compounded by the coronavirus outbreak.Despite the Governments excellent furlough scheme, , Brits have lost their jobs during lockdown, with unemployment now set to hit the three million mark.As Rashford rightly observes, many families are living on a knes edge, gripped with fear over how they will pay their bills, cover their rent or even put food on the table.This is proven by new data from The Food Foundation, showing that food insecurity in households with children has nearly DOUBLED since the pandemic began.The research also reveals more than , youngsters have been forced to skip meals during lockdown because their family couldn’t access sufficient food.As Chair of the Commons Education Committee, I was delighted when, earlier this year, the Government extended its free school meals scheme for the Easter and May half-term holidays.Yet, like many, I believed its decision to halt the programme for the summer break was wrong.In my view, this was for three key reasons:Firstly, the vouchers have been a leline for many poverty-stricken families during the Covid lockdown. With further worrying and uncertain weeks ahead, these families need consistency.Secondly, and closely linked, is that millions of parents are struggling financially at the moment - something that may be exacerbated in August, when furlough contributions change.Feeding their kids over the summer will push their already stretched budgets to breaking point. Yet these youngsters desperately need, and deserve, nutritional meals.Thirdly, around three million children are at risk of holiday hunger every year .Extending the scheme was simply the right thing to do.It was also relatively easy: yes, its coming out of a £ million Covid Summer Food Fund, but unlike other schemes, it isnt bureaucratic and its understood by parents across England.It also goes to those who need it the most.Studies have shown that food poverty doesnt just impact on childrens health: malnourished kids are less likely to perform as well in the classroom as their better-off peers.This can shape the course of their adult le.England is already facing an educational Ice Ageschools cant open in September - by which point, children will have been out of education for six months.Despite parents home-schooling efforts,  per cent of teachers in the countrys most deprived areas have suggested their students are learning for less than one hour a day.And some , youngsters don’t have access to a computer or tablet at all.Its why Ive called for Alan Turing catch-up summer camps to be set up in school buildings, village halls and marquees - anywhere that can be used to educate our kids.Its also why, despite being a Tory MP, I publicly announced I would vote with Labour today and call on the Government to extend free school meals over the summer.To use a football analogy, it felt strange going to play for the opposite side. But like Rashford, I knew that impoverished families across the UK deserved more.Fortunately, Boris has seen sense, too.Amid this crisis, we need a bold vision from the PM about our childrens education: what are we going to do to get them learning again  How will we get them back to schools We need an exciting, confident agenda, because the next generation depends on it. With todays move, Boris has shown these families that, yes, we do mean business.As for Rashford, he has done as much -not more - for disadvantaged families than any politician. Hes brought a vital issue onto the national stage in a dignied way.Unlike virtue-signalling celebrities who fly on a plane from Los Angeles then go on about saving the environment, he has practised what he preaches.And in doing so, hes shown himself to be a nation icon on and off the pitch.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Well, the majority anyway.Be it scientist “Professor Lockdown” flouting his own advice, or Boris’s svengali Dominic Cummings bending the rules he helped make, the rot set in a couple of weeks ago and has now caused an undeniable fissure between the state and its initially compliant citizens.Yet, while thousands are blatantly breaking social distancing rules at parks, protests and shopping areas, many of them are still being furloughed — at vast taxpayer expense — to “stay home” from work.Whereas common sense dictates that being in an office that’s been health and safety-ed to the nth degree is a far more protected environment than any of the above.And what about schools  The majority of learning for GCSEs and A levels takes place in years  and  respectively, yet government plans for the \" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"reopening of secondary schools remain “unclear”, with some reports saying they might not evenin September.Meaning that — on top of GCSEs and A levels being cancelled this year — hundreds of thousands of pupils will be in no position to take them next year either.If teenagers can gather in large, cheek-by-jowl groups at their local park, then surely ing to school isn’t beyond the pale  It might even be safer.As for the hospitality industry, well, not only is the two-metre rule killing it but pubs, in particular, face the galling reality of remaining closed while their beer gardens are used by hordes of people who’ve bought booze at the local supermarket.Enough already. Time, surely, for the Government to open its eyes to what’s happening around the country and exercise some common sense.Of course those who are vulnerable should continue to take as many protective measures as they wish, including remaining furloughed or off schoolnecessary.But the majority should nowto work or schooland start to get Britain back on its feet, both economically and psychologically.SCIENTISTS say that intelligent le could exist on as many as  planets in our galaxy.But they reckon aliens won’t visit Earth because of the distance.The two-week quarantine rules won’t help either.HOLLYWOOD actress Sharon Stone has revealed she was struck by lightening while doing the ironing.What a terrible shock.No, not the estimated billion volts that propelled Sharon across the kitchen, silly.The fact that a movie star was doing her own housework.TATLER magazine’s \" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"controversial article on The Duchess of Cambridge proved that snobbery is still alive and kicking in certain sections of the British “upper” classes.Dredging up the age-old “doors to manual” jibe at Kate’s mother Carole, a former member of cabin crew, it also resurrected ancient, alleged whisperings among chinless wonders of her being “NQOCD” – not quite our class, darling.This week, Rosalind Mann died, after a -year career taking photos of posh “girls in pearls” for Country Le magazine.When asked the criteria for posing, she replied: “We never featured anyone whose house had a number.”There’s snobbery in the US too, but it’s largely centred around money, rather than class.In the compellingly vacuous Netflix series Selling Sunset, about a high-end estate agency in Hollywood, the buzz phrase is: “Millionaires have views, billionaires have compounds.”Sadly, I have neither.IN the next James Bond movie, No Time To Die, it’s reported that the legendary spy has a young daughter with Lea Seydoux’s character.Could this see those famous blue trunks being replaced by a papoose It’s tricky waters for Bond fans, with  per cent telling a recent poll that they think it’s a mistake to make the famous philanderer a family man.I’ll reserve judgment until the film is released, but suffice to say, tackling villains such as Le Chfre, Blofeld and Raoul Silva is child’s play compared to dealing with a toddler in meltdown.A PUNTER has placed a bet on Newsnight presenter Emily Maitlis becoming PM by the end of .A spokesman for bookmaker Coral said: “The bet took us by surprise but someone’s convinced Maitlis could be the perfect match for No!”Presumably they’re not taking bets on which party she’d stand for as that would be too obvious.RICKY Gervais says that wherever he is in the world, he always frequents Italian restaurants because: “I know it’s going to be good and the same.”We have a similar issue at Moore Towers where – whether we’re at a Greek, French, Chinese, Italian or Japanese restaurant – the Bloke will spend aeons studying the ious culinary delights on offer before ordering “steak and chips” pretty much every time.THE stylist and “best friend” to Meghan Markle, Jessica Mulroney, is embroiled in a race row after appearing to threaten the livelihood of black lestyle blogger Sasha Exeter.Jessica, who has apologised, has now been dropped from regular TV slots and, while the pair have reportedly spoken in private, the Duchess of Sussex has yet to support her friend publicly.Something tells me that, aside from saying: “I need to do better” regarding race and injustice in society, Jessica is about to learn another valuable lesson.Hard times will always reveal true friends.CLOTHING website Missguided has been heavily criticised by shoppers after using slim models to market its plus-range of clothes in sizes  to .One said: “This screams, ‘we want to profit from plus-sized iniduals without representing or supporting them in any way’.” Very true.Equally, those ads for accessible baths showers targeted at the elderly but featuring a woman in her forties with the agility of a mountain goat.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But given this country is facing its worst recession in decades, now is hardly the moment to be sinking taxpayer cash into overseas vanity projects with no possible benefit for Brits. If Boris is determined to stick to David Cameron’s pledge to splash . per cent of GDP on foreign aid, then let’s thank our lucky stars it will now be spent wisely.THREE cheers for Marcus Rashford, a magnicent role model who yesterday won his campaign to make sure Britain’s poorest kids get one square meal a day over the summer. We know it will have been tough for the PM to swallow his pride and U-turn. But it was the right thing to do:  parents struggling to feed their children need all the help they can get right now. And £million — the cost of extending free school meal vouchers during the holidays — is a drop in the ocean when you consider the overall cost of lockdown.We like Rashford’s style, too. How refreshing to see a celebrity using his fame to articulate a powerful argument with such authenticity. NEW unemployment figures make for grim reading. The number of people claiming  jobless benefits more than doubled to hit .million in May — the  highest level since . And because the furlough scheme is masking the true extent of the crisis, we fear the worst is yet to come. Scientists are trained to think about public health  in the narrowest sense. So their instincts tell them to keep Britain in lockdown for as long as possible. But elected politicians know that  poverty and  mass unemployment kill just as surely as the virus. It’s time they showed some leadership and started easing restrictions in earnest. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Government’s decision not to pay for the vouchers was mean-spirited and cheap.But you do wonder about a government which decides upon a policy — and then changes it as soon as a top footballer opens his mouth.Next week, Michael Gove decides to extend trade negotiations with the EU after an intervention by Harry Kane. And lockdown is lted completely when Kyle Walker says he wants to go to another house party.Still, Rashford was right and deserves credit. And he’s right, too, that the Government could go further in helping those of us who live in poverty. The pandemic has thrown the Government off course.It was bound to. But Boris and Co must remember why they were elected last December. They got a huge mandate from our country’s very poorest regions. The areas that usually support the Labour Party.That was partly because of Brexit, of course. And partly because the then Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn , was about as effective as a recently gassed badger.But it was also because Boris promised those former Labour heartlands what they wanted to hear.A closing of the ide between rich and poor, and between London and the rest of the country.Jobs, investment in new industries and transport infrastructure.He might think we’ve all forgotten. But we haven’t. The latest poll shows Labour only five points behind the Conservatives.The honeymoon is over.Boris could begin by increasing the minimum wage for people aged  and over. It is low wages, far more than unemployment, which is keeping people mired in poverty.It wouldn’t cost the Government very much at all. It would also provide a much-needed boost to the economy.An increase in free childcare from  hours per week to  hours would also enable those struggling to make ends meet to get out of the house and work for longer.Shortly after last December’s election, Boris turned up in the North East to give his thanks.He once again promised that the region would be rejuvenated.There’s been good news on some fronts — the Nissan plant at Sunderland, for example, won out over its rival in Barcelona. It will stay open, despite the loss of  jobs.But more needs to be done to attract industry to the North and the Midlands.So far as I can see, the Government has done nothing. OK, it’s had a few problems on its hands.But when this pandemic has passed, the Government will need to intervene to help our economy — the private sector alone cannot do it.And the place to start is away from London — in the places where the new breed of Tory voter lives.Marcus Rashford’s intervention was timely and needed. This Government needs to know the poor are watching and waiting. Waiting for action, waiting for the promises of last year to be delivered.THERE is a stupidity about the woke crowd, trying to ban everything, which defies belief.An old episode of Fawlty Towers was pulled. Because it had some disturbing and potentially offensive racial material in it.But as the star of it, John Cleese, tried patiently to explain – it was SATIRE.The character of Basil Fawlty was the subject of the humour. He was mocked for his idiocies. That’s why we laughed.The episode has now been reinstated – but the moron caravan has already moved on. Now they’ve got it in for Mahatma Gandhi. Racist! The bloke who fought for India’s liberation from British colonialism.Was he a racist  Yes, without much doubt. He took a pretty jaundiced view towards Africans. But the good he did easily outweighs the bad.And believe me, there isn’t a single person born before  who didn’t possess views which today’s society would consider offensive. Regarding race, or gender, or homosexuality. Not one.Why can these people not understand that the past was dferent  And that we judge its heroes in a dferent light There was a really nasty battle between the two sides, with many dead – the first time since .China continues to bully its neighbours and oppress its own people.In this battle, I know whose side I’m on.THE Government has not done much right recently.But at least Boris and Co are binning the Department for International Development.It is to be stripped of its status and merged with the Foreign Office.With any luck, this will mean we will not be giving away any more hard-earned taxpayers’ money to countries like India, which has its own space programme so is clearly not short of a bob or two.Or China – a nasty, totalitarian state and the second richest country in the world.In the last round of spending, we actually bunged money into a programme to help Chinese people improve their diets.Nope, not kidding.I wonderit mentioned anything about it maybe not being a great idea to eat bats Various studies have suggested these donations are worthless and often counter-productive.I think, right now, we need to spend money at home, no SCIENTISTS from Japan have predicted that within  years we will be able to understand what animals are thinking. We will be communicating with them.Uh-oh. Not sure that’s good. Imagine a chat with a wasp . . .“Hi, Mr Wasp. What you doing ”“I’m crawling up your window. What’s it to you  And it’s Ms Wasp, as it happens. I’ve transitioned. So don’t misgender me. Now, p*** off before I sting you on the neck.”Worse with cats. “LOVE you  WTF, I’ve never even liked you. You’re mugs, humans. Just put the food out and give me a warm place to sleep and I’ll purr for a bit to keep you happy. Now, excuse me. I’m going to sleep on the roof of the shed for six hours.”But I might start watching it now as the cast all seem to hate each other.The soap has been torn apart by rows over the Black Lives Matter debate.Lysette Anthony has taken loads of flack and her co-star Rachel Adedeji has described her as “actual trash”.Hmm . . . somehow I suspect the show will not be anywhere near as interesting as the row.NOT everything about lockdown has been bad. Far from it.My we hasn’t been to TK Maxx for three months, for a start. There’s a mercy.And we’re not using cash. There’s little indication we will need to use cash ever again.Those people who aren’t on the breadline have saved money.And then there’s offices. Will we really go back to that awful daily commute, when the vast majority of jobs can, these days, be done at home  Just think how many homes we could createwe converted all those empty offices into flats.Offices were created because we needed a place to store paper files. Don’t really need that now, do we The Government should encourage firms to move to home-working, when – the stats suggest – employees are a lot more productive.IN France – a country almost as badly hit by Covid- as the UK – the schools will be reopening on Monday. By law, no arguments. Full curriculum.Over here, meanwhile, there are suggestions that some schools will not be opening until JANUARY and will not open properly for a year. Incredible.The Government needs to get a grip of this right now, as I argued last week.Call the bluff of the horrible trade unions and get our kids back to school.

It’s just easier than trying to do the school work.“It’s a way of escaping from everything.“I’m worried the teachers will be disappointed in me because I haven’t done enough work.“I’m worried I’ll fall behind and have to resit the year when all my friends go on.”And he is not alone. A study by University College London revealed that two million children have done barely any schoolwork at home.Since March, around  per cent of pupils have done none, or less than an hour, a day. And just  per cent put in more than four hours a day.Finn’s mum Kerrie, , a former secondary school teacher, admits she only ever sees her son at meal times.The single mum, who also has daughters Imogen, , and six-year-old Elodie, has found it hard to juggle home-schooling with working full-time as a social worker.She says: “When lockdown started I thought I’d be able to manage, especially because I used to be a teacher.“I was really motivated and ordered lots of stuff on Amazon to help. I think because the kids could see I was motivated it rubbed off on them.“But as time has gone on it’s become more dficult and challenging. I can’t give  per cent to my job and  per cent to teaching my kids. It’s just not possible.”Now Finn usually gets up around .am, has breakfast then switches on his games console — and stays up until midnight.Kerrie says: “I tried to get Finn to do schoolwork. With not enough computers for me and the kids to work, I even set written work for him.“But I couldn’t make him do it, no matter how much I encouraged him.” As we report today, more than , child health experts have signed an open letter to Boris Johnson demanding the Government publishes a clear plan to get all youngsters back to school as soon as possible or “risk scarring the le chances of a generation of young people”.The letter, organised by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, warns children are “suffering enormously” from a lack of access to exercise, vaccinations and mental health support.m have done under an hour’s work a day, experts warn PM it will ‘scar a generation’This is par­ti­cu­larly concern­ing for Clare Cashion, , when it comes to -year-old daughter Libby.Clare, a civil servant from Worcester, who is also mum to Ollie, , Lochlan, four, and two-year-old Cullann, says: “Libby has gone from being a  hardworking student to a changed character, so I do worry about her wellbeing.”Libby now stays awake until am and usually gets up at about lunchtime. Instead of doing schoolwork, she spends most of her time talking to friends on social media.She says: “At first we didn’t know what we were supposed to be doing, and because there wasn’t proper work or anyone to check your work and because you can’t just ask questions, I didn’t want to do it.“When I did do it, I didn’t get any feedback, and then my friends would tell me they hadn’t bothered, so I just thought, ‘What’s the point ’.“I’m a huge worrier and I am concerned about falling behind, but I’d rather stay up and talk to friends on my phone. That’s when everyone is online.“Mum tries to make me do more schoolwork but it doesn’t work. There just doesn’t seem much point at the moment. “I’d just like to go back to school.”In a report last month, government advisory body Sage warned lockdown had caused a “shock” to kids that will last the rest of their lives and affect work opportunities.The report also confirmed the risk of children catching coronavirus was “much lower” than adults.Yesterday, MPs on the Education Select Committee accused teaching unions of running a “disgraceful political campaign” to keep classrooms closed by “cherry picking” evidence to make parents fear schools are “death traps”.Chairman Robert Halfon asked: “Can you explain why parents and children can have access to Primark over the coming weeks and months but not to schools ”For Libby and Clare, it will be a big relief when schools can reopen. Clare says: “School has now started online lessons, so one week they’ll be live, and  Libby has taken part in some, but the following week it’s just emails and sometimes they have to cancel.“I think Libby struggles with not knowing exactly what’s expected.”Finn is just as desperate to get back in the classroom.He said: “I really want to go back to school because it’s a lot easier to learn in a classroom with a teacher explaining the work, and I miss my independence.“I’ve found it really dficult being at home this long.”To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

His panicky confusion when put on the spot by the PM was telling.Labour’s Twitter addicts love the social media term “gaslighting”, where someone deliberately confuses an opponent so that they question their own sanity. Starmer’s MPs are trying to do the same thing to the entire nation.They, along with Labour councils and unions, have been the chief obstructions to restarting schools, having whipped up fear among teachers and parents in defiance of the scientic advice. One day scaremongering, the next denouncing the Tories for betraying kids.The reality is that Boris should now bin the -pupil class size limit and the crazy two-metre distancing edict. There is minimal evidence to support either.Then he must order schools to reopen.The shutdown is wrecking children’s education every day it grinds on.IT is vital for our economy and sanity that we can take a holiday from early July.So we urge the PM: Thrash out a deal with President Macron today, allowing free travel with France with no quarantine. Rapidly make similar “air bridge” deals with Spain, Portugal and Greece.Better still, replace the crippling, job-destroying absurdity of quarantine — its rules are too slack to work, anyway — with temperature checks at airports.Then get our hotels and B’n’Bs open for a tsunami of “staycations”.Do it now, before summer is gone and a vast number of tourism jobs with it.IT was fantastic to have the Prem back last night.

The letter said: The Northern Ireland Executive has agreed that the current social distancing guidance of m must continue to be followed between all adults within the education sector, but that a distance of m is safe and appropriate between children and young people.Using protective bubbles has been supported by the Department of Health and PHA, and flexing their use to m will allow full classes to attend.The m guidance between children is to be followed as far as possible within the confines of the physical capacity of each classroom and the m rule for staff adhered to fully.To facilitate these arrangements, schools will be opening in week commencing  August for preparation purposes, he said.Health Secretary Matt Hancock said this evening the Department for Education was looking at a relaxation for the rule in England.

The groupaposs no-holds-barred report sets out the political, organisational and digital failures which helped catapult Labour to its worst result since , and while attempting to chart a path back to power, it grimly said the party has a mountain to climb to win the next election. The report said under Mr Corbyn, Labour had been unprepared for an election, went in with no clear message, and ultimately with a complex manesto, marked by a plethora of policy announcements seen as impossible to deliver.  There is a broad consensus across the Party - mirrored in the results from the survey of Labour members - that a combination of concerns about the leadership, Labouraposs position on Brexit and Labouraposs manesto not being seen as deliverable damaged Labouraposs chances in the election, the report said.The Commission concludes that the weaknesses going into this election were interlinked, and inisible. They catalysed long term trends between Labour and its voter coalition.While saying the end of Brexit as a campaigning topic and a change of leader - from Mr Corbyn to Sir Keir Starmer - would not be enough to engineer ato power at the next election, the report does point a finger at Mr Corbyn and issues under his leadership, including anti-Semitism.Concerns about Labouraposs leadership were a signicant factor in the election loss in , the report said.aposStop Jeremy Corbyn apos was a major driver of the Conservativesapos success across all their key groups including previous non-voters, and among all the swing voters Labour lost to the Tories. The very low poll ratings on leadership going into the  election cannot easily be disentangled from the handling of issues like Brexit, party disunity and anti-Semitism. The group said ious parts of the Labour organisation must accept their part in isions which impacted on the partyaposs ability to present a united front to the public. Our Party has spent substantial periods of the last five years in conflict with itself resulting in signicant strategic and operational dys, resulting in a toxic culture and limiting our ability to work effectively, the report said. Labour Together said the party had also suffered from both inadequate revision and a shortage of planning ahead.The absence of an objective open review of the  general election loss was a key strategic error for Labour, the report said.It added: Labour went into the  election without a clear strategy of which voters we needed to persuade or how. Labour was unprepared for an election, with no clear message compared with our aposFor the many, not the fewapos campaign in .  The report added Labouraposs numerous policy announcements had created doubts about their deliverability, while a deficient media strategy meant policies didnapost have time to land and left candidates poorly briefed.Labour was heavily outperformed by the Tories on the digital and social media front, with research for the review showing the Conservatives invested heavily in digital and had far more success with organic shares of their messaging, while making much better use of Facebook groups and other online forums."},{"url":null,"title":"question time minister suggests government","story":"NewsQuestion Time: Minister suggests Government has not tested new coronavirus tracing appMinister James Cleverly suggested the Government only ever field-tested the in-house NHSX app in the Isle of Wight before ditching it for the Apple-Google version -

Health Secretary Matt Hancock said earlier this week the Tories had backed both horses since May and had been able to test both before scrapping the NHSX one. However, speaking on Thursdayaposs Question Time, former Conservative Party chairman James Cleverly said only the in-house app was ever tested on the Isle of the Wight. The Minister for Middle East and North Africa said: I was in business before I came into politics andyou are going to test a couple of options, see which one progresses best, see which one works and then invest your time and effort in the better performing one of those options. For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE. Thataposs not a U-turn. Thataposs why [the NHSX app] was tested on the Isle of Wight. Thataposs why we learn from the experience. Host Fiona Bruce then asked Mr Cleverly: You have been trialling the other option on the Isle of Wight as well  To which the minister admitted: Well, as a...no, but the point... before the broadcaster said: Oh, you havenapost  Hang on, I just want to be clear because now I really donapost understand.  If Matt Hancock said you were backing both options and you were trialling the NHSX app, presumably you were trialling the other one as well  Otherwise, thataposs what backing both options is. Isnapost it  Mr Cleverly said: No. The test of our in-house app was done on the Isle of Wight, we were keeping our options open for the use of either. Ms Bruce asked: So you havenapost trialled the other one  The minister continued: The other system is being used more widely so doing a discreet UK-only trial for that one - my understanding and Iaposm willing to be corrected on this...  So, we havenapost trialled it, but we have relied on other countries  said Ms Bruce. Mr Cleverly said: Because itaposs being used where - so itaposs not necessary for us to trial both. The reason we were trialling was to make sure we chose the best option because each option had their advantages and disadvantages. It was not clear cut at the start of this process that this would be the better option.Earlier this week, Mr Hancock defended the Governmentaposs decision to abandon developing the NHSX app, insisting that joining forces with Apple and Google will offer a new, improved design.But he said some of its features will be incorporated into a new design. He told the daily Downing Street briefing, developers had been working on both the NHSX app and the design offered by Apple and Google since May, but the NHSX app had hit a technical barrier during testing on the Isle of Wight. However, he appeared to imply both had been field-tested by the Government before the decision was made. We backed both horses. We took the decision in May to start building the Google-Apple version as well and then because weaposd built both we could then test both, he said. And actually the best way to get new technology going is to test dferent approaches and this often happens as a standard approach in the commercial world, for instance. And far better to go with both versions and weaposve now got problems with both versions.

Nick Gibb declined to say children would definitelyin full in September - saying only it was the governmentaposs intention. It raises the prospect of a possible fresh setback to school opening dates after unions warned the September date was impossible. Boris Johnson has repeatedly insisted he wants all children in England toto school from September.But teaching unions say the maths doesn’t work under current distancing rules - which force schools to split pupils into -strong aposbubblesapos, doubling the number of classes. The National Education Union has called on the government to use public buildings for extra classroom space and use blended learning, with a mixture between home and classroom. Mr Gibb was challenged today over whether the September date could become another U-turn. He told Sky News: Well our clear intention is schools will reopen for all pupils in September. We’re led of course by the science and the medical advice. He added: We are taking every step in a cautious way, we’re working with the school sector, we’re taking advice.  And we give schools plenty of notice and time to plan for that reopening in September. Of course we’re working on other contingency plans, but the clear intention is we will have all children back in school in September. A third of Englandaposs primary schools are still not fully open to years R,  and  despite being asked to do so since June . And plans to reopen primary school years , ,  and  by July were dropped when government officials accepted there wasnapost enough space. The growing crisis in education in England has seen millions of kids unable to attend classes since the unprecedented Covid- lockdown ordered in March.Parents have been battling to homeschool youngsters amid fears some will fall behind their peers. A report by University College Londonaposs Institute of Education found two million children have done less than an hour a day of schoolwork during the lockdown. Today the government announced a £billion catch-up package to stop kids being left behind. Some £million will be shared across state primaries and secondary schools over the next academic year. And a £million National Tutoring Programme will boost access to tuition for the poorest kids. But the cash includes nothing for nurseries or further education colleges. And is not clear about how much support will be given over the summer holidays because it is up to heads how to spend the cash. Mr Gibb admitted the funding made available for schools will only start to be distributed from September. Speaking on BBC Breakfast, he said: The money will start to be paid in the academic year starting in September. Schools will know itaposs coming and they will be able to budget on that basisthey want to do things before September.

Elizabeth Manuel, , was forced to shut herself off from the world when the government announced vulnerable people and the over s should not leave home for  weeks. She lost her sight after suffering a near fatal brain hemorrhage and stroke at the age of . But as millions of people raced to the supermarket and selfishly stripped shelves of essentials - Elizabeth became one of the unfortunate needy Brits left without basic supplies.As she shielded at her Portsmouth home soon after the country entered lockdown - she was then struck down with coronavirus.Describing her terrying ordeal, Elizabeth said the virus choked her of breath as she desperately tried to call  for an ambulance.Follow all coronavirus updates on our live blog hereShe said: I was one of the first people in early March told to self-isolate - from that point on I had no contact with anyone as I live completely on my own. I then went from the vulnerable to the extremely vulnerable category. And to add to the excitement, I ended up being diagnosed with coronavirus. I started off with a headache and then had a persistent cough that went into bad breathing dficulties. After  hours I knew I needed some urgent help and I had to call  because I simply could not breath. But I couldnapost even ask for an ambulance - I had no breath to speak and I had to press buttons to identy where I was. I then went to open the door for paramedics as I thought I could lose consciousness before they arrived. Elizabeth was admitted to hospital for three nights as she recovered from the worst part of her illness.  But after being confirmed well enough to go home, she ed to her empty house - struggling to get out of bed for three weeks while panicking about where her food was going to come from. Elizabeth, who despite her own blindness and lockdown struggles, signed up as an NHS volunteer in the hope of helping from home, also spoke about her struggles with supermarkets shops and deliveries. As supplies in her cupboards and fridge dwindled, Elizabeth panicked about how she would feed herself without any help. Despite writing to supermarkets, her local MP and local crisis groups, Elizabeth said she was made to feel worthless when nobody offered immediate help. She said: I knew I really needed food so tried internet shopping but there were no slots. Every day I would go online and there would be no slots, I was getting very axious. I wrote to the supermarkets because at that point there was nothing in terms of a priority slot. Then under government rules I went from being vulnerable to extremely vulnerable.  I was contacting people telling them I had about a weekaposs worth of food in my freezer and that was it. It made me feel worthless and one of the worst things about lockdown is I have felt more disabled now than i ever have since having my stroke. Elizabeth also said her anxiety about ing to the outside world after lockdown ends is also much higher. Describing the complexities of navigating outside under normal circumstances, Elizabeth said she is now even more anxious at the thought of having to social distance. She said: My independence has changed in terms of my anxiety levels are high. My blindness means over half the world doesnapost exist to me and going out as a blind person is more scary anyway.

Pet owners in the UK are being urged to get their much loved furry ones tested amid fears they can contract the virus, incubate it and pass it on to humans.This puts the country at risk of a fresh outbreak evencoronavirus has been wiped out in humans, itaposs claimed.There have been conflicting reports since the pandemic began about whether pets pose any coronavirus risk or not. Now researchers from University College London want a mass surveillance programme of all animals that live close to humans. Professor Joanne Santini wants more research into which animals are susceptible to Covid- and increased testing.  She wrote in the The Lancet Microbe medical journal: There is increasing evidence that some animals can catch SARS-CoV- from people, and might subsequently transmit it to other people - but we donapost know just how much of a risk this is, as itaposs an area of study that has not yet been prioritised.We need to develop surveillance strategies to ensure we donapost get taken by surprise by a large outbreak in animals, which could pose a threat not just to animal health but to human health as well. Virus transmission in animal populations could become irreversibleleft unchecked, and may threaten the success of existing public health measurespeople continue to catch the virus from an infected population of animals. Colleague Professor Sarah Edwards added: “There’s an urgent need for widespread surveillance, by testing samples, preferably non-invasively, from large numbers of animals, particularly pets, livestock and wildle that are in close proximity to human populations.”  More laboratory experiments on small numbers of animals are unlikely to give us the evidence needed to be confident that certain species are entirely safe, making major surveillance work the only real option here. Previous studies have hinted that Covid- could be transmitted to animals because the protein it depends upon is found in many species. Domestic and feral cats, dogs, hamsters, monkeys and ferrets have so far been shown to be able to be infected with the virus. Researchers say farmed wildle such as pigs, minks, bats and rodents, could act as reservoir species for the virus.  It can be hard to identysome animals are carrying the virus because while some will show symptoms others will be asymptomatic. If an animal tests positive for coronavirus they will need to be quarantined or culled. In Holland , farmed minks were killed after they became infected with the virus and passed it on to two humans. Experts believe that, once originally infected by humans, the outbreak spread to dferent farms through feral cats.  Tests discovered a signicant minority of cats had been infected with the virus. The US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention acknowledges that cats, dogs “and a few other” animals can be infected. The organisation has updated its advice telling people not to let their pets interact with other animals or people outside the house. In New York Nadia, a four-year-old Malaysian tiger, contracted coronavirus at Bronx Zoo reportedly from a keeper.

As a GP in Kirklees it would be nice to be aware of this from a formal source instead of hearing it on the news!

And she wasnapost the only one outraged by this, with one saying it was shameful for Matt Hancock to have shared the news in this way. He almost seemed proud that he could share this information! Shameful, they said. Another commenter said: This has caused panic now I am worried. Meanwhile, Kirklees Councilaposs director of public health, Rachel Spencer-Henshall, told YorkshireLive that a number of positive cases had been identied at a Kirklees workplace.She said that the council have been offering support and guidance to management and other employees in order to minimise further transmission of the virus.

The home in County Tyrone, Northern Ireland, looks ordinary from the outside, but inside it is packed with newspapers dating back to , stopped clocks, a half-smoked pipe, and the owneraposs shoes left by the bed years after the property was vacated. Photographer Rebecca was invited in to see the decaying cottage after its owner died and she was left in awe of the haunting scenes within the perfectly preserved home. The cottage was lived in until  by the last of three brothers, who kept all of their family history, alongside tins of food from the early th century left unopened on the kitchen shelves.A man only identied as Dessie was the last to live there, leading aposa solitary le among the relics of the pastapos before moving into a home in  and passing away two years later. Rebecca, who owns the Abandoned NI website sharing photos of the derelict houses she explores, was allowed in by the owner to get a record of the incredible space before it was knocked down to make way for a new build. She said she was left gobsmacked by what she found, with old books, magazines, papers and photographs littered around the farm workeraposs cottage and left untouched. A clock on the mantel piece is stuck showing ., a pair of glasses are left ready to pick up and a rusted OXO tin has been left open, with two pocket watches stored inside. Hundreds of handwritten letters fill the drawers, and three kettles are sat on the stove, next to a cup which appears to have been placed there just before it was abandoned. Old books and newspapers including the Mid Ulster Mail from  were left sitting in the living room which had been shut off for more than  years, alongside one newspaper which reported the aftermath of the sinking of the Titanic in . Upstairs there remained rotting bedclothes, a bed pan on the floor and a flat cap left hanging on the end of a bedframe. Rebecca said she initially wasnapost surethe interior would be very interesting, but she has now created an exhibition based on the lives of Dessie and his family.  She said: I have to admit I saw the outside and wasnapost sureit was worth it. As soon as I opened the door I was blown away. I went into what I thought was a wee cottage and itaposs basically a social history museum. The cottage first appeared on maps in  and Rebecca began researching the family to help piece together the puzzle in all of the photographs. After talking to people to find out more about Dessie, she said: Among many things he was a fabulous cook, many friends still talk about his famous soda bread which he cooked over the original stove. He was a hearty farmer, milking cows to produce milk and butter.It was reportedyou stayed for dinner in the house and you finished up, you were given another dinner for seconds.No one left with an empty stomach. One of the mysteries Rebecca was able to solve was personal items belonging to an Edwin McQueen, who she was able to discover was married to Dessieaposs mum.

The Irish Sea island became the first place in the British Isles to end social distancing on Monday, so punters could enjoy their first pulled pint since lockdown began.With a population of about ,, the tourist haven is keeping borders closed for now. But yesterday the self-governing British crown dependency saw big steps in theto normality. Pals Ian Richardson, , Jordan Alexander, , and Liam Reynolds, , met for a drink at The Front Porch pub in Douglas. They felt closing the borders was the key, Jordan adding: “As long as people keep sticking to good hygiene.” Rikki Dunnage, who co-owns the bar with Edd Cox, said: “Everyone has been waiting three months for the taste of a proper pint!” Bushy’s brewery has delivered ales in milk cartons during lockdown. Boss Martin Brunnschweiler said: “It has kept our heads above water. Hopefully we’ll be keeping that side of things now the pubs are back.”  In the centre of capital Douglas, the occasional facemask can be seen but things are picking up. Grace Robinson, nine, was shopping with her dad Jay, , and brother Ollie, five, as she looked forward to going back to school next week. “I’ve missed my friends and the teachers,” she said.

German prosecutor Hans Christian Wolters said the first letter was to forewarn the family about the German authorities publicly announcing on June  that this is a murder inquiry and that Madeleine is dead. Mr Wolters added they wrote to the family at a later date too, with The Sun suggesting this letter was posted last week. The prosecutor has told Italian daily la Repubblica that while he didnapost write either letter, the Federal Police in conjunction with ourselves and the British got in touch with the family.  But the British couple said on Wednesday they had not received any letter from Germany stating their daughter is dead. It comes after criticism of the way Gerry and Kate McCann have been treated by that countryaposs auth­orities investigating convicted rapist Christian Brueckner, . Brueckner, jailed in the German city of Kiel, is the prime suspect in the disappearance of Madeleine from Praia da Luz in Portugal in  when she was three.  In a statement released earlier this week, Kate and Gerry said: The widely reported news that we have a received a letter from the German authorities that states there is evidence or proof that Madeleine is dead is FALSE. It comes as reports suggest police in Germany and Portugal have reportedly clashed over sharing DNA evidence that could lead to a breakthrough. German investigators want to retest a mystery saliva sample found in the holiday apartment the British toddler vanished from. The Portuguese police are reportedly unwilling to budge, with a source close to the Policia Judiciaria labelling re-testing a total waste of time. The evidence was found on the youngster’s bed inside apartment A at the Ocean Club by forensic teams after she went missing in .

The -year-old posted a photo of herself covered in colourful squares and what looks like cream cake in a celebratory post early this morning. The youngest ever Nobel Prize laureate also shared a snap of her and her family posing with balloons and a large cake which reads: Happy graduation Malala. She wrote: Hard to express my joy and gratitude right now as I completed my Philosophy, Politics and Economics degree at Oxford.I don’t know what’s ahead. For now, it will be Netflix, reading and sleep.Like many students this year Malala has graduated in unusual circumstances. Universities across the country have closed to students and non-essential staff, meaning exams could not go ahead as usual. The typically raucous celebrations expected after an intense exam season have also not been able to go ahead, with graduates like Malala having to toast their successes at home instead.

But in brighter news, the only thing we will be soaking up next week is glorious sunshine as we get back to sizzling in another mini-heatwave. Forecasters expect dazzling skies on Monday and Tuesday with the mercury hitting C in London and C in the South East by Wednesday.The Met Office ’s Becky Mitchell said: “On Monday we’ll see highs of C in the South East and low s in central England and Wales. On Tuesday it will start to get hotter, we see temperatures reach the high s. It will feel warmer in all parts of the UK.” But there is a grim patch to weather first and some face major clean-ups before breaking out the barbies again.Hundreds of homes were flooded yesterday – some for a third time this year. Emergency services pumped water out of houses in Pentre, Wales, a village flooded twice when Storm Dennis hit in February. Yellow thunderstorm warnings were in place for London, southern England and parts of south Wales.Ryan Shelton posted footage of a submerged street in Ilkeston, Derbys, and said the flooding was “worse than ever”. The -year-old said it was “quite scary” how  minutes of rain left .m of floodwater. Floodgates protected the front of his home but water got in the back via sewage pipes – leaving a “dreadful” scene. Residents had just six sandbags to protect  houses and were forced to unblock drains themselves. And the weather was so unseasonal residents on Cavell Close in Walsall, West Mids, were baffled to wake to what looked like a covering of snow after a hailstorm created a wintry scene in C.  Jerry Lovell, , said it was like a “Christmas card”, adding: “It was like January.

At the heart of this would be a mobile app Health Secretary Matt Hancock said would allow the tracking of Covid- on a mass scale. The latest figures show the programme has failed to reach more than a quarter of people who tested positive and the app has been ditched after it was found not to work. Other countries moved quickly to work with Apple and Google to develop a tracing app. The UK, contrary to what the Health Secretary said yesterday, decided it knew better. Once again, the Government has been found wanting. Time and again since the outbreak, ministers have made boastful promises but then failed to deliver on them. This incompetence has not just wasted public money – it has cost lives. We are beating the world only when it comes to the multiple failures by this Tory administration and the mounting number of fatalities. Best of British Dame Vera Lynn was the voice that gave our nation hope amid the horror of war. It was a testament to her enduring appeal that her classic hit We’ll Meet Again became the anthem not just of the Second World War but the coronavirus crisis  years on.  Throughout her  years, she epitomised the best of British spirit, whether mucking in with troops in Burma or doing her charity work. It is poignant she died on the th anniversary of Churchill’s “finest hour” speech. While the former Prime Minister rallied the nation at its darkest moment, she lted its spirits.

The booze soaked animal, known as Kalua, set off on his trail of destruction when his owner died. The oculist had fed the pet hard liquor at home in Marzapur in the Indian region Uttar Pradesh. Upon his death the alcohol supply the monkey was reliant on ran dry, prompting him to take to the streets in a blind fury. The animal indiscriminately attacked humans as he passed them, making a particular bee-line for young girls. Numerous children were left needing plastic surgery after Kalua ripped at their faces with his fangs.  According to Patrika one of his victims died.Zoo doctor Mohd Nasir told the publication how the monkey had been captured by keepers who injected him with sedatives. He was placed in isolation following the biting spree. Mr Nasir said: There has been no change in his behaviour and he remains as aggressive as he was. It has been three years since he was brought here, but now it has been decided that he will remain in captivity all his le.

Most restrictions will be relaxed from Friday, unless stated otherwise.Seeing families and friends Shopping, eating and drinking out Working or running a businessSport, culture and leisure Getting around Health and social careGatherings and occasionsThe next review date is on July  and there will also be an update on remaining phase two actions, including reopening outdoor areas at pubs and restaurants, on July .To progress from phase two to phase three, the World Health Organisation#s six criteria must continue to be met, as was the case for moving into phase two.In addition, the R-number would need to be consistently below one and there must be a further sustained decline in infectious cases.Hotels, pubs, restaurants and visitor attractions are preparing to open their doors again from next month, after Rural Economy and Tourism Secretary Fergus Ewing set a target of July  for the lting of restrictions.The Tele is Dundee Born and Read, and is committed to providing news to our communities.Right now that’s more important than ever, which is why our key content is free.You can chose to support us and access premium content by subscribing to the Eveningfrom just £. a month. blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

Players pick up on that.“Having Gordon Strachan and Jimmy Nicholl’s experience is fantastic as well.“We might have our playing experience but they have  years more experience in the game than any of us. That’s invaluable.”Irvine and Mackay work closely together at Dundee – but it’s not the first time they have worked together.Dee first team coach, Mackay, was brought to St Johnstone by Derek McInnes while Irvine was the Perth side’s first choice right back.In the end, Mackay went on to be come a club legend at McDiarmid, while Irvine moved on to Dundee.But there are no hard feelings from Irvine, who has loved every minute of his time at Dens Park.He said: “Dave Mackay came in from Livingston in [St Johnstone’s] first season in the SPL to add competition for places. I was unfortunate because I’d chosen to have surgery to tidy up an ankle problem that had niggled me.“The plan was that would tie in with the close season and I could start pre-season.“But it hindered me and I was behind with my fitness and struggled a bit to get back to form.“Dave, obviously, came in and did well and I think him being able to play in a few positions helped him, too.“I recognised at that time, being in my mid-s I wanted to be playing every week and I wouldn’t get that at St Johnstone.“I’ve nothing against Del, that’s the decisions that have to be made to win games – when Dave came in, the manager couldn’t guarantee me games and I heard there was interest from Dundee.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

The football was great.

Now, those plans go back on hold as they await further news from the Scottish Government.Paul Clarkson, operations director at PB Devco, owns Soul on Union Street and was preparing to welcome customers back with outdoor set up near the venue.He said the fact that beer gardens will not welcome punters back for at least a fortnight is “demoralising” and “disappointing.”Paul said: “We were ready to rock and roll.  We’ve been busy behind the scenes going through all of our new procedures.“It is very disappointing and the worst part of it is we still don’t know when we be reopened because it is getting reviewed.“It is demoralising as investments have been made because we thought we would reopen this weekend.“There was a wave of optimism but that has gone because people have been told it won’t happen.“We are going to have to close for two weeks now.  We need to be organised and at the moment we are complete limbo.” vw, px\"  Gordon Nicoll, who owns the Dutch Mill Hotel in Aberdeen’s west end, said they had preparing for the reintroduction of beers gardens with a marquee already set up.He said he will have to be “patient” to find out when they can welcome people back for a pint in the sunshine.Gordon said: “I didn’t think we would get to open this weekend.  I had a gut feeling the government would give us a few more days to get ready.“We have the marquee set up in the front and we’ll just have to leave it up for another couple of weeks.“We’ll just have to be patient.”Meanwhile, Stephen Cruickshank, owner of The New Greentrees in Dyce, said he has been left #deflated# by the decision but admitted they just had to follow the rules.He said: #It is disappointing and we feel a bit deflated about the announcement. We wanted to be safe and I think we put enough plans in place for it to be safe.#We did a lot of work to the building to get ready for reopening and obviously there are a lot of costs involved in that.#But we have to follow the Scottish Government advice and there#s not a lot we can do unfortunately.#A spokeswoman for McGinty#s Group, who own the Ferryhill House Hotel, The Stag and The Silver Darling, is hoping for fresh guidance in the coming weeks.She said: #It goes without saying that we are disappointed with the announcement. We were hopeful of reopening soon but we were also realistic that change may not happen immediately.#Whilst we understand that precautions are made for the right reasons, clarity is key for our industry and it is imperative that we get dates and guidance to be ready to open as soon as we can.#Steve MacDonald, owner of The Square in Kintore, and his team have spent the last week and a half preparing to open their doors this weekend.He said: #I#m really disappointed. Hopefully we#ll hear something in two weeks. We#ve done four months# what#s another two weeks #There#s nothing come out from the government to tell us anything, other than keep your doors closed. It#s so, so disappointing. The next thing is, will we even be able to afford to reopen  There#s staff, produce, insurances that we have to think of, too.#We#ve turned the beer garden around within a week and a half. The plan was to be ready to hopefully have customers again from tomorrow. We#d have been good to go from then. All we need now is stock. When the first minister does give us the green light, we#ll be good to open immediately.#Posted by The Square onTuesday,  June The Seafield Arms in Cullen, Moray, had also hoped to open this weekend. To prepare, tables have been move outside into gazebos with plastic barriers separating them, one-way systems have been introduced, and it will only operate with pre-bookings which will be in line with track and trace guidelines.The Seafield Arms in Cullen has installed protective screens between tables for diners. Manager Donald Thain, said: #We#re actually already prepared for Phase  as we#ve managed to achieve the two-metre distancing for inside too, when we reach that.#All of our staff be it customer-facing or behind the scenes have face masks. Our biggest hurdle I think will be getting staff used to the systems. We#ve all been at the supermarket since lockdown so we all know what to do there as we#ve been doing it a while.#We#ve got six tables in the patio area and  up in the courtyard area which is a wee bit more exposed. This is allowing us to bring some staff back from furlough and generate a wee bit of business. Everyone must pre-book. We won#t be taking any walk-ins and we won#t let anyone who doesn#t have a booking in as we don#t want anyone entering the premisesthey don#t have to. I don#t know how customers will feel with the policies we have in place, but it#s for everyone#s safety.#Colin Wilkinson, managing director of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association said: “The First Minister’s announcement is a bitter blow for Scotland’s hospitality sector, which expected to be able to now kick-start the rebuilding of the industry.“With the decision now delayed until July , operators face another anxious period for the survival of their businesses. This may also have a knock-on effect for the reopening of indoor areas, originally planned – all being well – for July .“This delay, hypothetically only two weeks before full reopening, may be possible with social distancing measures and again brings into question whether these first steps, for those who have an outdoor area or the potential to have one, will actually help businesses to start recovering from this pandemic.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

Mindfulness concentrates your mind on the ‘here and now’ and is a proven way of dealing with mild depression or anxiety.Focus on what the plants feel like – not just their fragrance when touched – from leathery and lacey to soft and smooth. You can also mix plants that are great to touch with tactile hard landscaping elements such as a water feature, smooth polished round pebbles or the glazed ceramics.Some top touching plants and features to considerLeaves # try Stachys byzantina, commonly known as Lamb#s Ear. Its soft, downy, furry silver-grey leaves are a favourite among gardeners who tend to use it for ground cover in rich soil. As a contrast there is Acuba japonicawhich has smooth, glossy leathery leaves.Flowers # who can resist touching a bottlebrush Callistemon cintrinus – bundles of tiny delicate stamen flowers form a brush that’s soft to touch – or the soft paper-thin petals of a poppy Papaver orientale.Grasses # run your hand over the arching, thread-like leaves of feathery Stipa tenuissima also known as Mexican feather grass or the more robust drought proof ornamental Festuca glauca with thread-like blue foliage that forms dense mounds.Bark – tree bark can also provide a tactile experience especially when it’s the stunning flowering cherry Prunus serrulate with mahogany coloured bark that peels away in bands round the trunk.Landscaping – you can easily y the textures in your garden by choosing dferent hard landscaping options. If you have smooth pebbles surrounding a water feature that you can run your hand over and through, you could place lichen-covered rocks in another area of the garden.Our general well-being is intrinsically linked to the natural world which is why Thrive – the gardening for health charity – has developed the Thrive Gardening Club.For fortnightly tips on getting the most out of your garden, whatever your age or ability, and information on how gardening can keep you healthy and feeling good visit www.thrive.org.uk get-involved keep-in-touch subscribe-to-gardening-clubThrive is the UK’s leading provider of social and therapeutic horticulture programmes using gardening to bring about positive changes in the lives of people living with disabilities, ill health or mental health issues, or who are isolated, disadvantaged or vulnerable."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor may 22 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,Mental Health Awareness Week, now in its th year, runs from May  to May .This year, the theme for the week is kindness and across the country, people will be celebrating kindness in digital and creative ways within social distancing restrictions.The last couple of months, with all the uncertainty of the virus and the impact of lockdown, have been an extremely stressful and worrying time for many people across the Highlands and Islands. People who may have previously felt isolated in remote and rural communities may be feeling this even more acutely at this time, so it’s important they know support is available.Across the region, many people have also sadly faced the pain of losing loved ones to the virus or have fallen ill themselves, while others have seen their livelihoods put at risk or incomes reduced. All of this has put additional strain on people’s mental well-being.This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is putting the focus on kindness as a means of helping people through the pandemic and building a better society as we emerge from it. We see many acts of kindness in the Highlands and Islands all the time, but this week is an opportunity for people to reflect on their interactions with others and how they can try and be a little kinder during this unprecedented time.David Stewart, MSP for Highlands and Islands region.Sir,During Mental Health Awareness Week, sight loss charity RNIB Scotland is highlighting the emotional reassurance and practical help it is offering during the coronavirus lockdown.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as their families, friends and carers.Losing some or even all your sight can be devastating news to take in, but our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.RNIB is concerned the lockdown might be affecting people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older, particularly hard. The uncertainty over access to basic shopping and medication, to information in accessible formats, the social isolation and barriers to being guided because of social distancing can all add and compound to the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.As well as our Need to Talk service, the RNIB helpline on    is available for anyone with sight loss and we continue to organise social activities over the phone and social media.We want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.James Adams, RNIB Scotland director, Edinburgh.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiativehas launched Alien Detectives – a fun and educational online resource to help the young and not so young  learn more about alien # or non-native – invasive species.Originally designed as a school education pack, the huge array of activities now includes a wide range of fun games and activities that anyone can enjoy at home, in the garden or on local walks during lockdown.Alien Detectives includes crafts, quizzes, worksheets, presentations and puzzles all themed around invasive species and the river environment. Although primarily aimed at young people, anyone with an interest in the environment or invasive species can enjoy them too.Our project team has been busy while homeworking during lockdown to produce these fantastic resources. We hope becoming Alien Detectives will bring many hours of enjoyment to iniduals and families during lockdown, especially at a time when most young people are not in a regular school environment and might be looking for a new challenge or activities to continue their learning.Invasive non-native species might be a new topic to many but it is a really important one. Invasive species can have a major impact on our environment and native wildle and are responsible for signicant bioersity loss in Scotland and across the world.

We stayed with Margaret and Iain McDonald at their home named Meadowview in Tarbert which was located near the school.We all enjoyed the area so much that we continued to visit every year for the next consecutive eight years.Margaret invited me to go out on the herring boats once or twice. One was named Village Maid and the other Village Belle and, needless to say, we often had kippers for breakfast, which were very nice. I remember there was a boat called the Southern Cross tied up to Cock Island # can anyone tell me any history of it and when it disappeared There also used to be a smokehouse for kippers along from Tarbert to Ardrishaig.Another fond memory I have is watching the logging trucks unloading on the quay and watching them get loaded on to large boats and I think then being shipped round to Sweden or Finland. Is that correct or not as I thought there was a paper mill at Fort William As mentioned earlier, I joined North West Ambulance Service in the s and Margaret used to send me the Argyllshire Advertiser and in one of them was an advert for recruitment to the Scottish Ambulance Service.I duly got an application form from Paisley and was all but sending the form in when I realised it would be very unfair to move so far away from our young children#s grandparents and for them to be unable to see them growing up. At the time your local pharmacist was retiring and my we Sue was a qualied pharmacist, but our children were both under school age so relied on her parents for child care. Ironically, I believe the job was filled with a Blackpool pharmacist whom I had met ocassionally.My love for Scotland continued, and we had our honeymoon travelling around Scotland and calling in at Tarbert for several days on the trip round.Our last trip up there was  in June as a treat from our daughter who accompanied us on this trip. The weather was glorious, and one day we caught the bus to Skipness and walked part of the Kintyre Way back.Another day we took the MacBrayne Ferry to Islay, which was again a glorious day out, also visited Crinan, Lochgilphead and Inveraray, followed by a couple of days fishing off the pier in Tarbert. We travelled back via Portavadie and Dunoon, and have in the past used the ferry to Arran, then Brodick, Ardrossan and home.Thank you for taking the time to read this.

But the COVID- lockdown interrupted proceedings.This season’s Scottish Cup was a bit of a disappointment with Star exiting the competition in the second round after losing out to a vastly improved Dumbarton United side -. On the plus side, the first round saw Star take on Paisley League team Pollok FC and an excellent performance saw Star run out convincing winners -, one of only four defeats suffered by Pollok in all competitions.In the West Region Cup, Star progressed to the quarter-final again. A first round bye, a convincing - win against Cambuslang FA then a walkover saw the Lochgilphead youths face Paisley League A Division team Erskine.In a hard-fought encounter, Star matched Erskine for most of the game but with only  players available they couldn’t get the breakthrough they needed and eventually lost -.Star started their league campaign in September with a competitive match against new team Thorn, who transferred from Paisley A Division. Star lost -.Two strong performances in October saw Star record  a terric - win over Shettleston, last season’s league runners up, and a - win against St Patrick’s Sports Academy # an entertaining but nerve-wracking game.A mid-season stutter in November saw the Lochgilphead boys lose out to Cathcart -, then Clydebank -, both newcomers.The losing run continued into early December as Star faced last season’s champions Drumchapel Amateurs ending up down - at half-time before recovering their form with a committed second half display to pull it back to -. Unfortunately they lost out to a fourth Drumchapel goal as they chased the winner themselves.This set Star back on track as they finished the year with a hugely convincing performance, demolishing Cathcart -.January and February proved a real battle with the weather with wind, rain and freezing temperatures # often all three # only allowing four games to take place. Star secured fine victories over Busby, -, and Glasgow Red Star, -, and fought back to grind out creditable draws with Shettleston, -, and Place Park, another new team, -.Star played one league game in March before lockdown and again it was another entertaining game with a rollercoaster feel to it. Facing up to Drumchapel Amateurs, both teams played out another terric match which had everything.Coming back from a goal down and with only  men, Star played cracking football to race into a - lead but it took its toll as Drumchapel stuck to their task to draw level before adding a couple more goals to secure a win in the final five minutes.This was another fine season for Red Star s, competing well in a strong league, with only  signed players.Though the season was cut short, the boys played  games winning , drawing two and losing seven. They scored  goals and conceded  goals. There were some cracking games and the boys were looking forward to the knock-out stages of the league cup.Inconsistency probably cost Star a few more wins, but that’s what youth football development is all about and there is potential for the boys to develop.Well done from coaches and parents to the  boys who played this season – Craig Aitken, Zak Barclay, Gregor Brown, Keiran Caskie, Lewis Curran, Ruaridh Green, Woody Hoad, Alexander McLean, Conner McMurchy, Leon Murphy, Innes Paterson, Jamie Stewart and Tom West.Thanks for great support goes to sponsors Ardrishaig Community Trust, main strip, SC Crawford Building Contractors Limited, change strip and zip tops, Jewsons, tracksuits, and Mid Argyll Youth Development Services and the parents, supporters, referees and opposition teams that have made the season so enjoyable."},{"url":null,"title":"sheena shows the way as tarbert tees off","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGolf started again at Glenralloch as lockdown measures were eased slightly across Scotland.The first members were on the tee at am on Friday May  for the re-opening, followed by a steady stream as the day went on.

similar rules regarding face masks and public transport have not been implemented across Scotland, Walesand Northern Ireland.But which types of face coverings are acceptable, and how do you wear them properly How do I wear a face mask properly The UK Government has advised that scarves, or homemade cotton coverings, that cover the nose and mouth are fine to wear- so, too, arebought masks that are not the same as those used by the health service.Surgical masks should be kept for use by health professionals.Officials have said that people can make a face covering at home, but added it is key to ensure it covers your nose and mouth.Government guidancestates that a cloth face covering should cover your mouth and nose while allowing you to breathe comfortably. This can be as simple as a scarf or bandana that ties behind the head.Before putting it on, you should wash your hands or use hand sanitiser and do the same after removing it.Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth at all times and store any used face coverings in a plastic bag until you have an opportunity to wash them.Do not touch the front of the face covering, or the part of the face covering that has been in contact with your mouth and nose.Once removed, make sure you clean any surfaces the face covering has touched and wash the covering regularly. The covering can be washed with other laundry, using your normal detergent.When wearing a face covering, take care to tuck away any loose ends.How do I stop my glasses from steaming up If you wear glasses, wearing a face mask at the same time can cause the lenses to steam up, making it dficult to see properly.But the common problem has an easy solution, thanks to advice from doctors in the medical journal Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England.To prevent the issue, doctors advise washing your glasses with soapy water before putting the mask on, and rinsing them under warm water.Then, gently dry off the lenses with a clean towel or cloth before putting them back on.Washing the lenses with soapy water leaves behind a ldquothin surfactant film that reduces misting on the lenses, meaning they now shouldnrsquot steam up when a face mask is worn.Should face coverings be worn where The current government advice states that face coverings should be worn in enclosed spaces, which includes some shops and public transport.At the moment, people are not being told to wear them outdoors, while exercising, or in schools or offices.Several airlines, including easyJet and Ryanair, have introduced a requirement for passengers to wear face masks on board.However, the government believes that face masks should be reserved for people who need them to protect against risks in their workplace, such as health and care workers."},{"url":null,"title":"borders-priest-moving-rome-new-job","story":"A BORDERS priest has accepted a high-ranking job in Rome.Nick Welsh, , has been based in Galashiels for the past two years.But he will soon be flying out to Italy after being picked for the role of vice-rector at the Scots College, where aspiring Scottish priests receive their training.Father Nick, originally from Stirling, told the Border he had ldquomixed emotions when he heard the news.He said: ldquoIrsquom quite excited, but Irsquoll have a bit of a heavy heart when I leave ndash I was just getting used to the Borders.Since , Father Nick has been administrator of the Parish of Our Lady  St Andrew, which has churches in Galashiels, Melrose and Selkirk.He said: ldquoI was really warmly welcomed here.

But even without their isive presence the cityrsquos historic square is a let-down, visually, socially and culturally, a frustrating waste of urban space that could and should be far better utilised.Where other European squares create buzz and atmosphere with year-round arts, culture, food and shopping attracting locals and visitors, George Square is dreary and uninspiring: a few trees, some benches and a clutch of dull, predictable th-century statues ndash ldquogreat men and Queen Victoria ndash that few feel any kinship with. The only part of the square that has any real purpose and meaning is the Cenotaph.The idea that George Square is in serious need of a makeover is nothing new, of course, and there have been ious  dawns and broken promises over the years, not least the outrageous fiasco of  ndash remember that  ndash which wasted huge amounts of public money and goodwill alike. But the two defining events of  - coronavirus and the Black Lives Matter protests -offer Glasgow the best opportunity in a generation to finally get this right and transform George Square into the vibrant civic centre Glaswegians deserve.Letrsquos start with the pandemic, which will continue to damage the economic and social pull of town and city centres. As lockdown restrictions are gradually lted we will grasp a new reality ndash fewer shops, restaurants, bars and cultural attractions than before, with those that do re-open unable to work at full capacity for now. Answers to the sort of questions around attracting people to city centres that were already stumping businesses, planners and local authorities even before coronavirus hit have become all the more pressing.Thatrsquos where a proper revamp of George Square comes in, a key step forward in boosting Glasgowrsquos economy and cultural capital in the wake of the pandemic. What should the square contain  That would be for citizens to decide, but herersquos a few quick ideas that presume an eventual end to social distancing: an ampitheatre for live music, theatre and comedy, proper seating, pop-up pods for community groups, a food and craft market, arts and exhibition space, murals, a garden and childrenrsquos play area.As for the fate of the statues, again, it would be for the people to decide whether they still have a place in this new urban realm. Not that we would want to forget our past, of course. But surely we can find new and more creative ways to confront, commemorate and celebrate it, taking in voices that were previously ignored ndash women, ethnic minorities, working class people, gay people, the disabled ndash reflecting the ersity of our city as it is now.Rather than an expensive international competition for designs ndash letrsquos learn from  ndash a three-month public consultation could be held, and a  of local architects, planners, artists, businesspeople and community groups convened to create perhaps three dferent plans, which would then be voted on by the people of Glasgow. Granted, such an ambitious revamp wouldnrsquot be easy to fund in the dficult years ahead, but with a crucial economic and culturalat stake, it should be prioritised. Surely a mixture of public, private and philanthropic funding could be sourced Glasgow City Council has already started the conversation that could make all this happen, by bringing forward the pedestrianisation of George Square and suspending a third of city centre parking bays to make room for walkers and cyclists.I would urge council leader Susan Aitken and her team to think bigger. A commitment to redesign George Square would offer an exciting, positive and inclusive focus for Glaswegians in the tough months ahead. The end result could be what Glasgow has been crying out for for a generation: a proud and modern civic centrepiece that is worthy of our great city, a place that excites, entertains, and educates, that makes us feel part of something bigger.

But in Scotland, thanks to Covid it could be within sight. Schoolrsquos out, not just for summer but for the foreseeable future.At least that was the educational prognosis from the Deputy First Minister, John Swinney, at the weekend. He announced a new ldquoblended learning, which sounds like something to do with tea, but is a euphemism for Scottish children spending most of the school week at home.:Opinion: Brian Beacom: Why I am edging slowly towards the pro-independence point of viewParents in Edinburgh were told that, when schools go back on August , theyrsquoll be lucky to see their children getting face-to-face teaching for a third of the time. Many Scottish pupils might only get one day a week. This is not so much blended as half-baked.Mr Swinney also endorsed the view of Larry Flanagan, general-secretary of the teachers union the EIS, that next yearrsquos exam diet should be cancelled, like this yearrsquos. Few in the education establishment much like competitive exams at the best of time, so it might seem unsurprising that they have been dropped ndash for the first time since .Parents, who donrsquot seem to have been consulted by Mr Swinneyrsquos misnamed Education Recovery Group, are furious. They see this as an abdication of responsibility by bureaucrats who care nothing about educational attainment and are putting the interests of their own client groups above the welfare of children.Parents in Edinburgh formed an instant pressure group,  , to demand proper, face-to-face education at least  per cent of the week. Sarah Chisnall says they also want serious benchmarked online learning for the other part of the ldquoblended learning experience, with a regular amount of teacher face time.Three months into school lockdown, it is surely a scandal that nothing of the like has been done. Home schooling is practically non-existent in many areas, according to parents, with some children having no contact with anything remotely resembling an actual teacher on line. Google, FIFA  and Instagram are poor substitutes.A UK-wide study from University College London confirmed yesterday that two million children across Britain have done little or no schoolwork at home during the lockdown. Four million have not had regular contact with a teacher and six million have not ed their most recent assignment.Nicola Sturgeon, who recognises a political disaster when she sees one, leaped in to try to undo the damage done by her deputy. ldquoIt is absolutely not the case that we are planning on blended learning to last a year or anything like it, she said on Monday, giving no guarantees that it wonrsquot.The First Minister promised that face-to face-teaching will happen ldquoas soon as possible. Exams will go ahead ndash well maybe ndash and she hinted that the two-metre rule in social distancing might be relaxed in schools.ldquoDelusional. said the SNPrsquos sometime coalition partners, the Scottish Greens, which has a lot of teachers amongst its membership. Like Larry Flanagan of the EIS they think next yearrsquos exams should be cancelled because there is no safe way of preparing children for them.Tell that to the parents. We know that the risk to children is vanishingly small. To prevent pupils spreading the disease to teachers and parents, schools could use masks, hand sanitisers, ldquobubble cohorts, and perspex screens.It is not aschildren arenrsquot associating already out of school.

So why is this bureaucratic red line being applied in schools Why is the education of their children not a priority, they say  With classes and schools only able to handle a third of children, the obvious answer is to increase the number of classrooms and the number of teachers.Break out of the school precincts and start deploying unused venues like cinemas and churches, even marquees. Bring in supply teachers and retired teachers to bump up the numbers.It would of course mean more than the pound million or so in additional funding the Government is currently offering the local authorities. But the Scottish education and skills budget is more than pound. billion. Surely some of that could be reallocated, as was the case in the NHS when they set up ldquopop-up hospitals like the Louisa Jordan.At any rate, Nicola Sturgeon now has a major fight on her hands. The EIS says, correctly, that the two-metre rule is still what the Governmentrsquos scientic advisers say is necessary to prevent a second wave of Covid-. They are not going to sht on that, eventhe World Health Organisation has been talking about reducing it to one metre.There are two million parents out there and only , teachers. Ms Sturgeon can do her political arithmetic. She is going to have to spray some serious cash to get the schools back on any kind of ing basis.Scottish teachers got a  per cent pay hike from the Government last year. I suspect Mr Swinney is going to have to loosen the purse strings again to prevent the deschooling of a generation of Scottish children.The late Ivan Illich, whose thinking influenced the Curriculum for Excellence, envisaged children teaching themselves, using technology, even though he was writing before the internet existed.

Equally comforting is the companionship and consolation of a like-minded community.Brought up as I was in a devout Church of Scotland family, I saw the importance for older members of the routine, ritual and contact weekly services offered. Remembering some of our church-going friends, people of inspiring kindness and integrity, it is deeply upsetting to think that it is iniduals like them, to whom the church owes its very existence, who are being sidelined and devalued.

New Zealand has achieved much the same with Covid: it had had no new cases at all for  days, until two UK visitors tested positive this week.The lower the prevalence of the virus within the population, the easier it is to pinpoint and contain new clusters, prevent a second wave and allow a fullerto normalityalbeit at a later date.Whatever our progress, Scotland recorded  new cases between May  and June , so eradication is still elusive.: Why the science has no clear-cut answers to Scotlands two-metre dilemmaIn this context, the decision not to re-open beer gardens is all about a better result later: for example, reducing virus prevalence enough that physical distancing can be halved to one metre in time for the hospitality traderesuming on July .Ms Sturgeon said there is emerging evidence that pubs, restaurants and gyms are \"hotspots for transmission\". Japanese research found that the risk of infection is around  times higher indoors than outdoors.So why is it safe to open outdoor food markets but not beer gardens  One theory is that people in beer gardens spend a prolonged period in same company, increasing the risk of transmissionsomeone in the group is infected but not yet showing symptoms.They are also more likely to talk loudly, shout, or even singwhich is also linked to transmission.

However, tidal and wave action continued to drive erosion under the tree roots and actually encouraged erosion.ldquoThese days, the awareness and understanding of the cycles that sand dunes go through ndash and their value as habitats in their own right ndash is much more prevalent so we are looking at how best we can restore sand dunes to their natural state.Sand dunes help to protect the coastline and are likely to be an increasingly important defence against sea level rise as a result of the Climate Emergency.Natural and healthy dune systems change their formation in response to wave, wind and tidal action, with some sand removed only to then be replaced at a later stage with deposits of new sand.This self-sustaining process can play out in the course of one storm but more often occurs over many years and,viewed at a particular moment in the cycle, could give the impression that the dunes are disappearing.Tree planting in previous generations attempted to stop this apparent erosion and fix the dunes in place ndash but it also interrupted the natural process of replenishment, as well as the colonisation of dune vegetation.Ms Dolby said: ldquoPrevious restoration attempts over the last  years have failed to properly restore open dunes because they did not deal with a surface layer on the dunes that had been enriched by fallen leaves or needles, conditions which favour woodland plants and that effectively prevented more sensitive dune plants from surviving.ldquoThe method wersquore trialling now involves removing the trees and scrub and scraping and burying the plant litter layer to leave a bare sand surface, which will hopefully support the rare vegetation special to these dunes.The trial site, at Morrich More, will be closely monitored over the next five years to assess the effectiveness of the restoration process.Scotlandrsquos more than , hectares of sand dune systems are considered among some of the countryrsquos most valuable habitats, thought to support more than  rare species.Risks to the dunes include coner plantations which have already claimed around , hectares and sea buckthorn which has colonised signicant areas of sand dune in parts of south-east Scotland.

Employers should support their workers in using face coverings safely and provide advice,requested, on applying and removing the covering.On ferry services face coverings must also be worn by passengers and staff unless the ferry, or part of the ferry which is open to members of the public, is entirely outdoors or physical distancing of two metres can be maintained.Transport Secretary Michael Matheson stressed the importance of the new rules and that by wearing a face covering everyone is engaged in a collective responsibility to reduce the risk of transmission.He said: “Our message remains clear that public transport should be for key workers and those who need it most and can’t walk or cycle to work.#Capacity is reduced to enable physical distancing and operators are not yet running full services. However, as we work towards recovery and more peopleto work and further local leisure opportunities begin to open up it is vital that measures are put in place to protect everyone’s health.“Transport operators continue to play a key role in supporting essential travel and in ensuring passenger confidence in public transport while maintaining physical distancing. The use of face coverings forms a fundamental part of gaining that public trust.“We are asking people to take personal responsibility to do the right thing. Wearing a face covering while on public transport means you are playing your part in the collective effort to prevent the spread of coronavirus and reducing the risk to your fellow citizens. These measures complement physical distancing and good hand hygiene, they do not replace them.”Advice on face coverings, including how to make one and instructions for using one, will be available on the Transport Scotland website.

Director Ronnie Robertson said lockdown hit his company’s order book, but the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has been vital to help them hang on to their valued staff.Ronnie said: “Before this, we had quite a good order book, with three to four months of work planned, so we were pretty worried where it was going to take us.” At first, he was worried how he would keep Q-Mass’  staff on the payroll, but then the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme was announced.It offers UK Government support to pay  per cent of staff’s wages up to £, a month, and the scheme has now been extended until the end of October.Q-Mass manufactures bespoke parts for the oil, gas and defence industry so staff training is important. Ronnie said: “Our staff are very highly skilled. We’ve gathered a bunch of people here and trained them up and taken on apprentices. We do a lot of training, we’ve got good people, we train them a lot and we want to hang on to them.”He found applying for the furlough scheme quick and straightforward. He said: “It was surprisingly easy and we were surprised that the money came through relatively quickly.”Now staff at the firm who’ve been furloughed are gradually ing to work, with strict safety measures in place. Ronnie said: “We’ve put a day sht back on and we’ve still got a few office people working at home, with quite a few still on furlough.And because of the size of the building, maintaining a two-metre distance hasn’t been a problem for ing staff.“The workshop’s a big, wide open space and we have to keep cleaning things like photocopiers and touch screens, but it’s been quite straightforward.”Now Ronnie’s looking forward to a brighter future. He said: “I feel like we’re on the side of the valley and we’re looking across to the other side and it looks absolutely fantastic. Getting through the next few months is crucial for us. We have a really good bunch of people and we want to hang on to them. The furlough scheme has helped us to do that.” vw, px\"  Planning, forward thinking and invaluable help from the UK Government has enabled a Northern Ireland firm to ersy and remain solvent.

This should be contained in a single green bin or box.

The two metre social distancing rule will affect passenger capacity for our ferries – and we also continue to experience issues around the availability of staff and the effect that has on opportunities around timetabling.“I would assure our isles residents that we continue to bring these issues and challenges to the attention of the Scottish Government and will do all we can to maximise sailingsnecessary, taking on board the views of our isles residents throughout.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It looks increasingly likely that any exit from lockdown and safe re-opening of tourism and hospitality businesses could be during the low season.#Without financial support to tide them over, that could be the nail in the coffin for many businesses.“In Shetland, like where in Scotland, earnings from tourism during the spring and summer months sustains people through the winter and it is a real worry that coronavirus hit just when the visitor season was starting.#It is clear that a -month plan, at least, is needed to ensure that viable businesses can survive to provide a living for their owners and be ready to safely welcome visitors again when the time is right.”Speaking via video link earlier this week, Mr Carmichael welcomed the Chancellor of the Exchequer#s announced extension to the furlough scheme to protect jobs – but added more was needed to help tourism.“Here in the Northern Isles we particularly see that in the visitor economy, which is crucial to us,# he added.#The assistance for bed and breakfast operators, or operators of self-catering accommodation, leaves too many people without the assistance they need.“A support scheme that finishes at the end of August, or September or whenever it will be, simply will not be adequate in parts of the country such as ours.#Those parts of the country that have seasonal tourism require a -month programme, or  the tourism industry that will be left to be resurrected at the end of this process will be that much weaker, and the rebuilding and recovery that much more dficult.” on Wednesday also heard from struggling tourism businesses.One BB owner said she had been unable to apply for support funds as they required applicants to have paid businesses rates, whereas she paid domestic council tax.Living Lerwick has also raised the plight of small tourism operators.Project manager Emma Miller said that as some did not have a business banking account they had been unable to apply for the Creative or Tourism and Hospitality Enterprises Fund, which opened in Scotland to support the industry. raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"more vessels but aprils gross tonnage is well down on last year ","story":"Lerwick Harbour saw a big reduction in shipping tonnage during April compared with the same month last year – although the number of arrivals was actually up slightly.A total of  vessels called, compared with  in April , but the overall tonnage dropped from , to ,grt.The deficit was partly due to no cruise ships callinglast year, although ferries, live fish carriers and oil traffic were all also down considerably.The April arrivals this year included  fishing boats,  workboats tenders,  ro ro ferries,  live fish carriers, eight oil boats, eight tugs, five tankers, five ferries and three pilot boats.The fishing vessels comprised  Shetland,  British, three Danish, two French and one Norwegian boat.For the first four months of the year the overall number of arrivals at Lerwick holds up reasonably well with  – , as compared to , in .

Eva now hopes to host another bake sale later in the summer, she said.

Scottish Government’s Tourism Secretary, Fergus Ewing, set a provisional date of th July for tourism businesses to resume operations.Mr Ewing said the date would be “dependent on public health advice and progression to phase three of the Scottish Government lock-down route-map”.Mr Whiteford said he believed anxieties would be easedthe Scottish Government now dropped its ‘stay at home’ message.He added: “The ‘stay home and save lives’ message has been very effective, but for many people, especially those living in more remote and rural communities, there is a fear that changing this behaviour may pose a risk to public health and wellbeing.“Our famous ‘Highland Welcome’ is at risk of becoming tarnished, affecting tourism long term.“We now need the Scottish Government to implement a national and local campaign to allay anxiety amongst local Highland communities and deliver a positive, uplting message as we take safe, measured steps to emerge from lockdown.“We need to look at what other countries have done with social distancing by reducing it from two metres to one metre.“It’s the only way that many tourism and hospitality businesses will be viable.”Since it was launched in , the rebranding of the coastal road network as the NC has been credited with bosting businesses in the region by as much as  per cent year on year.However, along with the rapid growth came concerns over road and infrastructure problems along the route.The initiative has also faced accusations of turning the route into a race track, from which many small businesses see little benefit from visitors who tend to pass through, rather than stop.

Likewise, we will stand at least two metres from customers’ doors at all times.“We are continually reviewing how we undertake our meter reading activities in light of COVID- and we are looking forward to being able to resume our normal way of working with customers at some stage, but we will only make that decision when it’s safe to do so.” NIE Networks is reminding customers that you only need to submit your reading to either NIE Networks or your supplier – there is no need to do it twice. Customers unable to submit a meter reading will receive an estimated bill from their supplier based on their usage history.If a member of the NIE Networks team arrives at the door, they will always show identication.

Victor Leonard, chairman of the international youth football competition at which Rashford was twice a winner with Manchester United, has always been impressed with the manner in which the young England international striker has handled himself. As Rashford vowed to continue helping those in need after successfully forcing the government to reverse its decision not to provide free school meal vouchers during the summer, Mr. Leonard described the footballer as an inspiration to everyone. He added: “We first came across Marcus in the Manchester United squads that came across to Northern Ireland to compete in our tournaments. “He was a smash hit as United went on to win the Premier section in  and  but you could not help but admire the way, even at a young age, Marcus conducted himself. “We have been across to United many times and it was always very clear how highly regarded he was as a player and a person.” Rashford came off the bench in United’s  final victory over County Tyrone at Ballymena Showgrounds and started when the Red Devils triumphed  months later against defending champions Vendee from France. Victor added: “I think he is an inspiration to everyone.

Furthermore, the issue of freedom of expression was explored in depth in the consultation paper.We apologise unreservedly to Judge Marrinan for any inference taken from our article that he had not acted with the utmost integrity, professionalism and competence in leading a highly sensitive but critically important review process.Belfast Most ReadNorthern Ireland#s most popular property listings as market reopens after lockdownCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Hairdressers to reopen, shielding to be paused and social distancing at schools reduced to mCoronavirus: MLA Bradshaw says reason for small cluster outbreak in NI #should be made public#Derry man Conor McColgan killed alongside girlfriend in horror crashPrimark shoppers join early morning queues for Belfast store reopening after coronavirus lockdown,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We had flexibility built into that plan and we have headroom to continue to look forward, she said.We#ve also said that this is going to be gradual, and it#s not easy.It#s far from simple, but we#re guided by the science.Everything we do is looking to the future - it#s about supporting families.Mrs O#Neill said she hoped the latest measures would help families and businesses plan for the future.On financial support for the childcare sector, she said work was continuing with the Executive, with further discussions to be held next week.It#s very clear we need to find a way to support childcare providers, parents and the workforce, she said.There clearly have been issues with the first pot of funding that was put out for childcare providers, so there needs to be lessons learned there and have a scheme that actually gets the money to the providers.SDLP leader Colum Eastwood MP welcomed the latest measures, but asked on Twitter: How is it possible that you can go to Mass, get a haircut and have a pint but not visit your family  Rather than jumping from headline to headline, we should be providing detailed, strategic guidance.Speaking to the Belfastlater, he added: I think the Executive have done this in a very ad hoc way, where they seem to be responding to lobbying from dferent groups - understandable lobbying - but when you do things that way you end up in a scenario where you just react to the last person you spoke to, rather than have a plan that people can understand.To have pubs, churches and hairdressers open, and we support that, but you still can#t go and see your granny is just crazy.We#re left in the bizarre situation, for example, where families can plan to meet up in retail outlets or pubs, but have no indication of when they might see each other in their own homes.And we have entire sectors that have no idea when they can safelyto business or what guidelines may be in place to support them.This ad hoc approach does not serve the needs of workers or businesses. What is needed is a strategic plan with indicative timelines.Belfast Most ReadNorthern Ireland#s most popular property listings as market reopens after lockdownCoronavirus: MLA Bradshaw says reason for small cluster outbreak in NI #should be made public#Coronavirus Northern Ireland: Hairdressers to reopen, shielding to be paused and social distancing at schools reduced to mDerry man Conor McColgan killed alongside girlfriend in horror crashPrimark shoppers join early morning queues for Belfast store reopening after coronavirus lockdown,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Mark Hamiliton, who is a member of Ash, and his dad, Neil, started the project a year ago and since then the customised bangles have been snapped up by fans. The father and son team have now raised £, for the charity, which has had to suspend many of its services for local cancer patients and their families, and has furloughed most staff due to the coronavirus pandemic.The charity has also had to postpone its fundraising events, so donations are even more vital during the current crisis. The latest batch of bracelets are from guitar and bass strings played during Ash#s recent European tour, which was cancelled half-way through. Over the last year, Mark#s dad has made hundreds of bangles as souvenirs from a host of the band#s concerts played all over the world. Mark, who said he hopes to be back on tour once the pandemic is over, said: Thanks so much to all the Ash and Snow Patrol fans who have supported our #RockBangle project for Cancer Focus NI. So far we have raised around £, and hope to sell more bracelets once our tour recommences, whenever that may be. Big gratitude also to dad, who#s worked so hard on making these bangles in his wee shed, and Happy Father#s Day to him from my lockdown home in Northumberland.Mark donated the proceeds of the bracelets to Cancer Focus NI because of his mum, Miriam, who has now thankfully survived cancer three times. Miriam has received great support from Cancer Focus NI over the years. She is also one of the founder members of the charity#s support group in Downpatrick, helping other women who#ve been diagnosed with cancer. Mark, who sells the bangles on his social media channels, explained that making the bracelets is a team effort. I weave and cut the strings to size and my dad solders the joints together, making what was an ugly joint into something that resembles a metal pearl, he explained. They look nice, but raw and rustic. I want them to retain a bit of that rock #n# roll aesthetic. Rosie Forsythe, from Cancer Focus NI, said: We can#t thank Mark and his dad enough for all their hard work and generosity. Cancer Focus NI relies on donations for over % of our income.

Ms Smith - who granted Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams a controversial visa in  to visit the US amid serious opposition - died at her home in Manhattan, her daughter Kym told the New York Times. Last night, Mr Adams said her appointment as Irish ambassador had been pivotal to the development of the peace process.She was a wonderful, compassionate, formidable woman who played a key role in persuading her brother Senator Ted Kennedy to support a visa for me in , he said.Though she never ran for office, she campaigned for her brothers, travelling the country for then-Senator John F Kennedy as he sought the presidency in . In , she stepped in for a travelling Jacqueline Kennedy and co-hosted a state dinner for Ireland#s president. The same year, she accompanied her brother, the first Irish Catholic president, on his famous visit to Ireland. Their great-grandfather, Patrick Kennedy, was from Dunganstown in Co Wexford. Three decades later, she was appointed ambassador to Ireland by President Bill Clinton, who called her as Irish as an American can be. During her confirmation hearing, she recalled the trip with her brother, describing it as one of the most moving experiences of my own le. As ambassador, she helped persuade Mr Clinton to grant a visa to Mr Adams in defiance of the British Government, which branded him as a terrorist. She later called criticism of her actions unfortunate and said she thought history would credit the Clinton administration with helping the peace process in Northern Ireland. The then-Taoiseach Bertie Ahern said in  that it is not an understatement to say that didn#t happen at the time, perhaps other events may not have fallen into place. In , though, Ms Smith had been reprimanded by Secretary of State Warren Christopher for punishing two of her officers who objected to the visa for Mr Adams. In December , Ms Smith again risked controversy by taking communion in a Protestant cathedral in Dublin, going against the bishops of her Catholic church. Her decision was a strong personal gesture of support for Irish President Mary McAleese, a fellow Catholic who had been criticised by Irish bishops for joining in the Protestant communion service. Religion, after all, is about bringing people together, Ms Smith told The . We all have our own way of going to God. When she stepped down as ambassador in , she received Irish citizenship for distinguished service to the nation. In , along with her brother Ted Kennedy, she was awarded the prestigious Tipperary Peace Prize for her contribution to the Northern Ireland Peace Process.Irish President Michael D Higgins said the death will have been received with great sadness by many, both in the United States and in Ireland.As United States Ambassador to Ireland in the s Ambassador Kennedy Smith played a pivotal role in the initiatives that led to the Good Friday Agreement which helped bring the violence in Northern Ireland to an end, he said.She will be forever remembered as the diplomat who had a sense of Irish history and of what had influenced the Irish in the United States. An activist diplomat, she was not afraid to break with convention or explore the limits of her mandate. She brought passion and clear values to her role, providing many of the elements that promoted peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said: She proved an extraordinary diplomat during the crucial years leading up to the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, building lasting relationships with all sides and becoming an instrumental figure in the Northern Ireland Peace Process.Her courageous and determined diplomacy helped to bring peace to our island, built bridges, opened doors to all communities, and to all those striving for peace when peace was not a certainty, Mr Varadkar added.Ms Smith was the eighth of nine children born to Joseph P and Rose Kennedy, and she tragically outlived several of them by decades.

Publicans in Derry who took a ‘massive’ financial hit by closing ahead of St Patrick’s Day in the interest of public safety have encouraged the public to ‘support their local’ once they reopen. Northern Irelands hotels, bars, restaurants and cafes can reopen from July . William McGuinness and his business partner Phil Nolan own Paedar O’Donnells, The Gweedore and Fty Seven nightclub on Waterloo Street. Before the government issued any formal directive for businesses to shut, Paedar’s led the way by announcing that it was closing its doors on March . googletag.cmd.push It came two days before the busiest date on the calendar for Irish bars, St Patrick’s Day. “It was a matter of conscience for us,” Mr McGuinness said, “the general feeling at the time was that the NHS was going to be under pressure and we thought St Patrick’s Day would have been a petri dish for infection and we didn’t want to be responsible for that.” Boris Johnson’s order for all non-essential businesses would come over a week later on March . Derry City and Strabane has the second lowest COVID- death rate of every council area in the country and just  positive Coronavirus cases to date – also the second lowest in the country. googletag.cmd.push Chair of the British Medical Association in NI, Derry doctor Tom Black, has credited the part played by local businesses who took their cues from the Republic of Ireland. Mr McGuinness said they’re happy they made that decision even though the business took a ‘massive hit’ because of it. “St Patrick’s Day is our busiest day of the year and we were thinking about retirement soon but this thing has thrown it all up in the air. “We knew that, but we were just concerned about the health of Derry people.” Paedar’s missed out on grants because it didn’t meet the criteria but employees were furloughed. The rebuild will be a slow process, Mr McGuinness said, as the pandemic took its toll. DIFFICULT From July  pubs and bars will be allowed to trade but must serve food and operate on a table service basis. Pubs that do not serve food will be allowed to sell alcohol outdoors, such as beer gardens, also restricted to table service. Mr McGuinness said that will make it ‘very dficult’ for small bars like Paedar’s with limited outdoor space. Permission to use that space is absolutely essential in his view. He added: “I would object to the fact that restaurant bars are allowed to open but bars aren’t allowed to serve inside. “I think the risk is higher in a restaurant bar with adults and children being served food and drink whereas we’re just serving alcohol to adults. “With food there are all sorts of utensils but we just have glasses and disposable plastic. “I don’t see the sense in holding us up because we don’t do food.” The ‘rush’ is now on to ready the bar for customers and bar owners like Mr McGuinness are looking to the government and local authorities for guidance. Paedar O’Donnell’s has been cleared of tables and chairs to allow for the walls to be freshly painted and floors nished ahead of the grand reopening.  Mr McGuinness hopes that the government advice is relaxed to allow bars to serve indoors. They’re awaiting further guidance before spending any money on Perspex screens or other safety measures. He concluded: “We’d encourage people to come back but it’s going to be very limited space. “We don’t have the tourists, we were a very busy bar at weekends, and we’re not going to get those numbers in – nowhere is – because Derry people like to go out on a Friday and Saturday and nowhere will be able to cater for them because of social distancing. “There’s no money to be made in the next few months that’s the reality. “But hopefully over timeit is under control and there’s no resurgence maybe we can get back to some normality.” INFORMATION The owner of numerous bar-restaurants in the city including the Bentley, The Magnet and Molly Malones, Tony O’Connor, is also seeking clarity. “I’m surmising that they’re working on it at Stormont but we need more information about social distancing and so on,” he said. With all of his restaurants serving food he’s assured by the fact that customers can sit indoors but is unsure as to whether dining customers can stay longer to socialise. Mr O Connor said: “Every one of our premises will be opening on July  because of the food situation. Out of our six bars, five of them have outdoor areas.” This week he held a meeting with management and they’re ‘all positive and raring to go’. Like many businesses, the pandemic has been a ‘nightmare’ for Mr O’Connor but he realises that everybody is on the same boat. The Irish government ‘deserves a massive pat on the back’ for closing bars before St Patrick’s Day, he said, because ‘you would have had thousands and thousands across Ireland’ spreading the virus. “A lot of bars lost out on revenue there, no money was coming in and none getting paid out, so you just start over again,” he added. AMAZING  Bars have been actively discouraged from staging live music events or screening football matches to minimise the urge for customers to ‘dance’ or ‘hug each other’ after a goal is scored. It’s Mr O’Connor’s aspiration that the bar will be allowed to have a singer-songwriter, two-piece band performing or DJ providing entertainment. The local businessman said they will have hand sanitisers at each entrance, on every floor, at every table and also behind the bars and in kitchen areas for staff. “I’d rather not open as to have big screens in front of the bar because I think it takes the atmosphere away. “We have enough space so we can take tables away to create distance,” he stated. They’re also considering an App on which people can order food and drinks but are awaiting further guidance. And extra staff will be on hand to carry out an increased cleaning schedule. Looking to the future, Mr O’Connor would like to see visitors to the city from other parts of the island. He said: “I think Derry will get a good turnout because we handled the pandemic well as a city, there was a low number of Coronavirus cases. “I can’t wait to get my teeth back into it, we’ve been doing nothing the past few months, and the not knowing is the worst thing. “We’ve been doing takeaways but getting fully open is going to be amazing. “We’d invite people to get back out and support your local. “Self-awareness is key, Derry has played a blinder, it should be recognised and people here don’t have to be told to social distance, they’re fully aware.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Looking to the future, Mr O’Connor would like to see visitors to the city from other parts of the island. He said: “I think Derry will get a good turnout because we handled the pandemic well as a city, there was a low number of Coronavirus cases. “I can’t wait to get my teeth back into it, we’ve been doing nothing the past few months, and the not knowing is the worst thing. “We’ve been doing takeaways but getting fully open is going to be amazing. “We’d invite people to get back out and support your local. “Self-awareness is key, Derry has played a blinder, it should be recognised and people here don’t have to be told to social distance, they’re fully aware.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It comes after First Minister Arlene Foster told a Stormont sitting on Tuesday that she ‘does not intend to make any announcement about the date of first intake until all the necessary preparation work has been completed’. Speaking to the Derry News yesterday, Sinn Feacutein MLA Karen Mullan reiterated the point that students will enrol next year. Karen Mullan said the announcement by Michelle O’Neill on May  was made ‘on behalf of the Executive’ which involves the five main parties. googletag.cmd.push That was needed to allow Ulster University to move on to the next stage of the General Medical Councilaccreditation process. She added: “I know people may feel frustratedthere is no commitment in terms of dates and movement but there are no concerns at this stage on our part that the work isn’t being done. “That’s not to say it hasn’t been dficult but there are no concerns from the university either, they have everything they need to progress through the GMC stage. “And even when we get to the next point on this journey when we will have applications out there is so much work, it is a long-term project. googletag.cmd.push “The initial intake is for  students but that will increase over five years and we need a financial commitment to resource that for every year and work on the wider expansion of Magee.” A General Medical Council spokesperson confirmed that the next date to comply with is the Graduate Medical School Admissions Testapplication process in July. A GMC spokesperson said: “There are stages that must be completed, required for all new medical school applications, before students can be recruited. “We will decide on the readiness of the University of Ulster to accept students in September , by the end of this July.” Since the May  announcement, key players in delivering the project including the Economy Minister Dianne Dodds and Arlene Foster have spoke of ‘signicant work’ and risk assessments that must be carried out before they can commit themselves to a date. Karen Mullan said that it is ‘dficult’ when there are ‘dissenting voices’ and it ‘does create that sense of fear that is out there’. She recognised that work still has to be done to get it over the line and ‘you can’t mitigate against something that is out of everybody’s control’. Asked is Sinn Feacutein is facing resistance from within the Executive Karen Mullan was clear that all parties signed up to the commitment laid out in the New Decade, New Approach document towards Magee. But she acknowledged that Magee is not a priority for other MLAs who are focused on their own constituencies. ‘TRANSPARENCY’ SDLP Leader, Colum Eastwood MP has expressed concern that the First Minister was unable to give SDLP MLA, Mark H Durkan, a cast iron guarantee that the Magee Medical School would be ready to open in September . The Foyle MP said: “The SDLP have been campaigning for Magee expansion for many years and we secured a ringfenced funding commitment as part of New Decade, New Approach. We also worked hard to secure a commitment to supporting Magee expansion in the draft Programme for Government in the south. “The money was made available and in the months that followed, we urged the DUP and Sinn Fein to make the necessary decisions and get this project delivered. “Not only did we find ourselves rebuked as negative when asking practical questions, we were told that it was a done deal. “Clearly, it is not as the First Minister was unable to provide these basic assurances today in the Assembly Chamber, when questioned by my colleague Mark H Durkan MLA. “We will continue to fight for the Medical School and a fully expanded Magee campus. We hope that it will still open next year, but this latest statement from the First Minister makes it more dficult. “At very least, the people of Derry deserve transparency and honesty from those holding the most senior positions in the Executive. SDLP Economy Spokesperson, Sinead McLaughlin MLA added: “This is a very disappointing lack of clarity and to be blunt, Im angry about it. We were promised the Magee Medical School was coming next year and now we are not sure. “We have to invest in training more doctors to reduce locum costs and to strengthen our health service. Covid- demonstrated the need, but it looks likely that Derry and the North West will be let down by the DUP and Sinn Fein, once again.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

From  July, subject to the rate of community transmission continuing to be low, people will no longer need to shield and should instead follow the same guidance and precautions as those considered to be generally vulnerable. That involves taking particular care when out and about - and strictly maintaining social distancing. Letters will be issued in the coming days to all those covered by shielding informing them of the planned change. Mr Swann stated:“I have been clear that shielding would not last one minute longer than it needed to. We have now reached the point where,the current trends continue, there will be no need for anyone to shield after  July. googletag.cmd.push “I have listened to many of you and to the challenges you have faced during this period. I am in no doubt as to the dficulties shielding has presented for a great many people. “It is unrealistic to think these dficulties will just vanish because the need to shield has ended. That is why the letters we issue will provide details of the support which will continue to be available up to and after  July. “While my announcement today will be welcome news for many who are shielding, some will view the prospect of an end to shielding with great anxiety. I want to assure them that they should decide what to do at their own pace. Everyone will approach this situation dferently. googletag.cmd.push “As is so often the case at present, this will be about weighing up the options and making informed choices. Going outside can bring some degree of potential risk but this can be mitigated and minimised by strict social distancing. Staying indoors indefinitely is not good for anyone’s mental or physical health. “Finally, I would ask everyone to be considerate as people end their periods of shielding. We should all continue to social distance, but in the coming weeks I want you to be particularly understanding of the fact you might be encountering someone who has had to stay at home for many weeks. Please be aware of this, show respect and kindness to all and keep your distance.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

These exclusive photographs show the special screens which have been erected at Tinneys Bar in Derry. All other pubs are expected to install similar screens between staff and customers as the hospitality sector reopens following the coronavirus lockdown.  A local blinds shop has been assisting Derry bars and businesses as they prepare to reopen safely. Ace Blinds have been operating in the Derry area, serving the community for over five years and employing local people. As businesses adjust to the so-called new normal after lockdown, they have to enforce social distancing and come up with innovative ways to protect their customers. googletag.cmd.push Therefore, Ace Blinds has fitted ‘COVID- roller shields’ in local bars and the orders have been mounting from other businesses in the city. “It has gone a bit crazy at the minute and we have already taken  orders for bars,” says John Kelly of Ace Blinds. It is new territory for Ace Blinds in terms of the material they are using. “The plastic material suits bars great as they can be moved up and down very easily, not like perspex, and they are a lot easier on the eye for customers, so more friendly. They can be attached to suspension ceilings with a special clip so no drillingneeds be. googletag.cmd.push “The material is easily cleaned, you just hold the bottom bar and wipe clean and it can be secured to bars or the groundneeded.” The company has fitted the bathroom at EI Engineering to separate sinks which provides an extra layer of protection for workers. Other businesses in the town have come to them with dferent proposals which they’re working through together. This week, the Economy Minister Dianne Dodds announced that all non-essential goods retailers in Northern Ireland can re-open from tomorrow. Pubs and restaurants are expected to follow suit in July. Confirming the ‘major step forward’, the Minister said: “The pandemic has had a devastating impact on the local economy. The recovery has already begun and it is time now for the pace to accelerate. The re-opening of all goods retail outlets will be a huge part of this. “The safety of staff and customers is of course paramount. All retailers must be able to implement measures that minimise the risk to their staff and to the people who visit their stores. “We will be co-existing with this virus for some time to come so it is vital that we continue to adhere to guidance to work and live safely.” The Minister added: “The re-opening of our local shopping sector is a signicant step forward in the Executive’s pathway to recovery. I and my Executive colleagues remain committed to moving forward in the recovery while at all times keeping the health, wellbeing and safety of people at the centre and being transparent in our approach.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The residents of Clady and surrounding area are very appreciative of these improvements, completed to a high standard that improves safety for motorists, walkers and cyclists alike.” Work has also been completed in the nearby area of Glenone, with safety chevrons restored on the Portglenone to Bellaghy Road. googletag.cmd.push Carntogher councillor Martin Kearney welcomed the development but condemned vandalism to road signage in the area. “A number of traffic accidents here in recent times have caused considerable concern to local road users,” he said. “Previous markers had been demolished as well with vehicles often ending up in the nearby fields. I am pleased to report the Department of Infrastructure has replaced these chevrons. “However, it is disappointing to note that when the local community were abiding by the advice to lockdown others were vandalising the nearby Ballynease Rd bilingual sign which has been there for over  years. Thankfully the Council have replaced that also.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The proposal would involve demolishing a number of landmark buildings on Duke Street and the construction of  apartments in their place. Duke Street is one of the busiest thoroughfares in to the city and is used by thousands of vehicles each day. While there are a number of shops on the street, there are also several derelict buildings, including those earmarked for demolition as part of the apartment plans. The company behind the plans, Hillvalley Properties, have said that the new apartments would help regenerate the area. googletag.cmd.push It is understood that the apartments would be used for social housing. The access to the complex would be via Spencer Road. There are no plans for the car parking within the complex, as the developers say that the apartments are in a central position. Within the complex, there are also plans to construct a garden and soft play area. A statement submitted to Derry City and Strabane District Council on behalf of the applicant said: Most of the buildings included in the application have lain vacant for many years and their replacement will only improve the visual outlook of this street.” googletag.cmd.push An application for the Duke Street apartments has recently been submitted to the councils planning department. Last year, the council approved plans for the erection of a separate seven-story residential building that will house  new apartments at a nearby vacant site at the corner of Duke Street and Fountain Hill. The  units will include  one-bedroom and  two -bedroom apartments. The development also includes associated site works and the development of an amenity space.

The announcement was made today by the Northern Ireland Executive. Churches in the Republic will be reopening around the same time. “It is particularly helpful that parishes in cross-border communities will be able to plan together for a safeto Mass around the same time, said Archbishop Martin. I have been heartened by the amount of preparation which is already ongoing in our parishes to ensure that our sacred spaces will be as safe as possible when we begin to gather again together in prayer. googletag.cmd.push I expect that we will be beginning in a cautious way at first, and there will be a need for ongoing patience and careful monitoring of the situation. “In recent days, having spoken to priests across the dioceses of Armagh and Dromore, it is clear to me that there is a strong desire from our people, religious and priests to be able to celebrate the Eucharist and have access to the other sacraments, especially baptism, marriage and reconciliation. Archbishop Martin commended parishes for reaching out to parishioners in very dficult circumstances during the lockdown which included the broadcasting of Mass and other prayer opportunities by webcam. googletag.cmd.push Since March, we have also been alert to God’s presence in the lonely and the suffering. Sadly the pandemic has brought great hardship to many families whose loved ones have died because of the virus. In a lot of cases it was not possible for family members to be by their side, or to be present at their funeral. God knows our grief and how much we need strength, courage, consolation and comfort at this time”.

Staff in Marks and Spencers and Boots, which have remained open throughout the pandemic, were glad to see a bit more hustle and bustle in the centre And with sales on in Debenhams, Dunnes and Marks and Spencer, many shoppers remarked on how happy they were to be out spendingagain. googletag.cmd.push But while the shops are open, cafes and coffee shops in the shopping centres remain closed for now. Mary McLaughlin, who hasnt been shopping in the city centrein over three months, said shewas glad to be back. This is my first day back up the town and Im all hyper with it, she said. I havent been up thetown since way beforeSt Patricks Day Its been awful not being able toget up the town, butas long as we are all healthy thats the main thing. Its just great to get out again. Ive been looking forward to it. Self-confessed shopaholic Geraldine Deery has been yearning for the social side of shopping. googletag.cmd.push Im ashopaholic and its been drivingme crazy, she said. I missed going up the town and meeting people and having a chat. And I really miss going in for a cup of coffee with my sister. Ive gone abit crazy buying things, Im making up for losttime of the weeks I missed. The management at Foyleside, The Richmond Centre and Debenhams have clearly put a lot of timeand effortinto establishingand marking out one-way systems and there are plenty of signs in place reminding people to keep to the two metre social distance rule. You do be a bit nervous because youre looking at the floor, trying to make sure you are going the right way, said Mrs McLaughlin. Everything is well spaced out and the floors are all marked out. Although Im glad I came out early because its quiet at the minute. Derrys small independent retailers are also slowly getting back to business after getting the go ahead this week, David Thomas, whose jewellery shop and workshop Thomas Goldsmith has operated from Pump Street for over  years, has been surprised that some of his fellow small traders havent reopned yet.  Ive just been for a walk round and Ive noticed that a large number of small independents arent openat the minute. This is the second dayinto it and they are taking their time to get back to work. Maybe thats their own choice. It surprisedme because to rebuild businessagain is important. For a lot of them who have furloughed staff and who are self employed as it were and are receiving payments they are thinking I wont risk it because theres a safety net there. But obviously that safety net is going to start disappearing. Business has been quite slow this week, but MrThomas is hopeful that shoppers will be back. We arecompleting the work we werent able to complete in March after the guillotine came down and we werent able to finish. And then we were hit by problems in the supply chain but that has started to ease up. In the last two weeks it has relaxed and things are filtering thoughnow. Were now able to complete things we should have done in March so weve stillgot that momentum from then, but in terms of work coming through its going to be a bit slow. There are a lot of people are being made redundant or who havent been able to claim grants and things like that. But on the other hand there are people who were furloughed and had to stay at home and werent able to spend money and they should have a fairly healthy bank account and they are desperate to get out and buy stuff. Mr Thomas has made changes to the way the shop operates in order to comply with the new regulations. Only one customer is admitted at a time, staff are usingfacemasks and hand sanitiser, and jewellery that has been tried on is being cleaned before it goes back on th shelf. People are understanding and respectful, remarked Mr Thomas. He feels that lockdown has given people time to reflect on their work le balance and lestyle. People are saying it will never be the same, he said. We were all chasing our tails a bit, workingvery hard. Does it have to be like that  Can we take things a bit easier  Do we have to be rushing off to Portugal on cheap flights  It has been strangeto sit at home in the garden and look up and see the skies totally clear. Many of Derrys charity shops have also reopened their doors, with Oxfam, Kinship Care, the Red Cross and Cancer Focus back in businessearlier this week. However, the three month closure has meant some stores are struggling with low stock levels. Deborah Tracey is the manager at Cancer Focus on Shipquay Street, which opened in May .  The shop reopened last Friday after a week of cleaning and preparation and have been busy ever since. Inside there is hand sanitiser at thedoor and a one-waysystem in place. Most people have been using the hand sanitiser before they come in, said Ms Tracey. We have been busy with people bringing stuff in and buying stuff too. People seem to feel confident coming out to shop now and theyare glad toget back to a bit of normality. Cancer Focus has amanager and deputy manager but all the other staff are volunteers. Some of our volunteers have been worried about coming back because they are older and more at risk, said MsTracy. So weare lookingfor newvolunteers now. We provide everyonewith shields, masks and gloves for their safety. Cancer Focus has also launched an appeal for donations. Any donations to the shop must be quarantined for  hours when we receive them, said Ms Tracy. We are looking for donations of clothes, bric-a-brac, shoes, bags and books. If you would like to make a donation to Cancer Focus or to enquire about becoming a volunteer telephone .

He spoke to Michael McMullan about his love for football, his career and answering Irelands call. *** It has always been football for Ruaidhri Higgins. Always. He has never known anything dferent. Even in Primary Four, Leo McCloskey saw enough to call him into the Termoncanice PS team. The following year, they lost a Northern Ireland final, before going one better  months later. It was the beginning for the man Stephen Kenny has put his trust into lead the scouting and analysis of the Republic of Ireland soccer team. googletag.cmd.push Higgins obsession for the game smashed through the roof when he began to play with the local Newtowne underage teams from the age of seven. “I wasnt one of those kids that was into cartoons, super heroes and Disney films, I was just obsessed by playing football from no age,” Ruaidhri begins. “I cant ever remember not playing it and it has been my le.” It began to get more serious when Kenny Shiels, who was taking his son Dean to play for Lisburn Youths at the time, asked Ruaidhris fatherhis son would join them. It was a prominent shop window for scouts, but the regular . kick-offs demanded a six oclock rise and trek up the M. googletag.cmd.push “It was a massive commitment,” Ruaidhri said, of his parents Danny and Marys time. For two years, it was Newtowne in the summer and Lisburn in the winter and all the travelling it entailed. They backed him  percent. Ruaidhri and Paddy are their youngest sons, with a  year gap to Michael and Kevin. “It is two dferent generations, but we are unbelievably close, the four of us,” Ruaidhri stresses. “I have been in every corner of Europe with football and they have always followed, they have been massive supporters in my career. “Without that upbringing and without that support, then I probably wouldnt be in the position I am in and wouldnt have had a career in this country like I had. I am very grateful and I dont take it for granted.” Ruaidhri played Gaelic football in his youth and as a pupil of St Marys Limavady lost an Ulster final replay to Coalisland. Growing up, he rarely missed a game when Derry were challenging for Sam Maguire. Even then, at the age of eight, Ruaidhri was deeper in thought than most. “The semi-final was probably the final, I remember when Johnny McGurk hit the winning score with his left foot,” Ruaidhri recalls of the  triumph, with the detail he will be using to suss out Irelands opponents. “It was a massive passion at that time but football shaded it. My brothers, my Da and my uncles first love would be GAA.” His first soccer football game was a trip to Parkhead to see Celtic come from - down to beat Dundee United in the Scottish Cup. He has been to Old Trafford, but doesnt have a favourite team. “I wouldnt say I am a fan of anyone. I am a football fan and I would look out for Celtic orUniteds score but it wouldnt ruin my weekendthey didnt win.” As the years passed, Ruaidhris prowess in the ious underage leagues attracted the attention of soccer scouts and was forward and back with too many clubs before opting for Coventry City. *** There were offers from more prominent clubs on the table, but Coventry attracted him. A chance for first team football, a long-term contract and hospitality all influenced his decision. “I was made feel unbelievably welcome, even at that age, by Gordon Strachan, the first team manager,” Ruaidhri states. “Richard Money, the Academy Director, and George Mackiemade my family feel unbelievably welcome every time we went over and made a big fuss.” Ruaidhri has no regrets about the move and completed his last two years of school in Coventry. At the time, a growth spurt led to knee problems and he spent the first two months in plaster and he didnt kick a ball for close to six months. “It was the right decision,” Ruaidhri points out of the club insisting he join earlier than anticipated. “I was playing through the pain barrier at home and they werent happy about it. Until they fixed it, I went  months in and out of playing because of the pain I was in. They had invested in me and were well within their rights. “It toughened me up. I moved away from home at  and had to become a man before a normal teenager, that stood me in good stead. Looking back, in terms of becoming more streetwise, it gave me a sound footing.” While he was happy with his progress in his first two years, he felt there was a genuine point he caught the eye of first-team manager Gary McAllister, who liked how Ruairi played in possession and he bagged two goals on his reserve debut. “I played really well and got peoples attention around the club,” Higgins felt. It was a quick evolution in how the game changed and relegation from the Championship sent out a warning message. “It was all about second balls and getting up and down the pitch. That didnt suit my style. Once athleticism started to take over from creative players, I kinda knew I might not have a career at that level,” he added. For four and half years, Coventry had high hopes for the Limavady man, but it faded away. When his contract ended, he wasnt too keen on going down the leagues. “It is a body blow to players when they get released from clubs in England. It is your dream, it is your passion, you feel you have failed.” Just when he needed a saviour, Stephen Kenny made the first of five important phone calls to Ruaidhri Higgins. *** With his teenage years coming to an end and his Coventry career over, an   number lit up on Ruaidhri Higgins phone. Kenny had just taken up the mantle as Derry City manager in August  and was putting together a squad. “I had never spoken to him before,” Ruaidhri reveals. “There was a definite rebuilding process when I came home, I wasnt the same person for six to  months. I lost my confidence and felt I had let people down,” he said, while stressing nothing was further from the truth. “Stephen was the perfect manager for me at that time. Living at home with my parents helped massively.” Slowly but surely he got his mojo back. “I owe Stephen a lot. In my first six months I played a lot in the reserve team just to get playing football again. I was performing better and better and running games in the reserves and it gave me the confidence that I could get my career back on track.” Kennys management skills continued, when he waited for the opportune moment to bed him back into the senior squad. It wasnt a rush, but rather some games to ease him into a regular spot. The Candystripes, with Higgins as a regular, won four League Cups in a row from  to . In , they won the FAI Cup with a - extra-time thriller, Kennys last game before taking over at Scottish side Dunfermline. After losing the  title to Cork City on the last day of the season, they missed the  treble after Shelbourne won the league on score dference. “Stephen brought great success and, particularly in  and , the Brandywell was packed and there was a great buzz”, Higgins states. “We had a really good run in Europe in  and that probably cost us the treble because of the backlog of games.” Derry beat IFK Gothenburg and Gretna before going out against Paris Saint-Germain - on aggregate, after holding the French side scoreless at the Brandywell in the first leg. Higgins played in both legs against Gothenburg and rates it has his European highlight. “They had three or four Swedish internationals that played in the  World Cup. We were something like - to win in Gothenburg,” he remembers. Kenny broke down their opponents in advance of the game, showing video clips of unknown teams and how they got results against Gothenburg. “I remember after that meeting, we walked out of it and we were thinking we have a helluva chance here. “We went out and deserved to win the game. It wasnt a smash and grab, it was an unbelievable performance. The home game we deserved to win that, we won - on aggregate and it was a massive achievement for the club.” Derry lost the FAI Cup final in  and were relegated to the First Division the following season, due to financial irregularities. “We went four or five months without pay. I had just bought a house, I had a mortgage and I had bills to pay,” Higgins points out. Pat Fenlon brought him to Bohemians. During the stint Bohs won the Setanta Cup, but Higgins was cup tied and missed out and again Higgins missed on a league medal on score dference to champions Shamrock Rovers. “I probably didnt do myself justice there. I had a decent period in mid-season, I lost my form and when Derry got promoted I went back there.” Back at the Brandywell, Higgins won a fth League Cup and in the FAI Cup decider, his flick on setup Rory Patterson for the extra-time winner. “We qualied for Europe through the league and were actually in the title race until four or five games in the season.” The  season, was one of Higgins best in a Derry shirt, but when Roddy Collins came in as manager, he wasnt in the plans. “I had a good season and had a new options and it was Stephenwho brought me to Dundalk and we won the League Cup, that was my sixth. It gave us the confidence to push on and win the league,” Higgins recalls. “We were trailing Cork going into the final game of the season. We played them at home and we beat them -, that was an amazing night. I was involved in four titles that went to the last game of the season, I lost three and won that one. “There has been a lot of ups and downs but thankfully there are a lot of good memories to look back on. You get lower with the downs than higher with the ups “Throughout my playing career in the League of Ireland, I averaged a trophy a season, so I had a successful enough playing career.” After a spell at Coleraine, where he also managed the U Academy squad, he began to focus more on coaching. He remembers Willie McKeown, then Coventrys Ireland scout telling him youve a great eye for the game and encouraging him to push on and get his coaching badges. “I had no interest at that time obviously. You have this dream of becoming a star footballer, but I genuinely always had an interest in the tactical side of the game,” said Higgins. Stephen Kenny also thought he had a good eye for the game and asked him to join Dundalks coaching staff. In the first season, they lost out to Cork City in the league. “I stayed in the role as analyst, we won thedouble and Stephen left to take theUs, Vinnywas promote to manager and I was promoted to assistant manager. So, I won the league with Dundalk in three dferent roles.” *** When Kenny was promoted to the Ireland manager post, he once again punched Higgins number into his phone. It was a brilliant call to get,not altogether a shock. “We have that relationship. He values me. It was a shock in a sense that it was the international stage, a dferent level. “It is a huge honour and a privilege to be asked. I had made my mind up very quickly because it is impossible to turn that opportunity down when it comes.” He acknowledges Dundalk, who he states were amazing in giving him the . Going to another League of Ireland Cup would have took some serious thinking. “When you are going to the international stage, it is incredibility tough to even consider turning that down,” Ruaidhri highlights. Now the work starts again in earnest. When I first call, he is scouring footage of European play-off opponents Bulgaria. His weeks are taken up with meetings, both online and face to face where circumstances allow it. “ One thing you can be sure, Stephen will have plenty for you to do and he leaves nothing to chance,” Ruaidhri stresses. “We have two games in early September, thats the main focus for myself, Stephen and the staff under him.” When le gets back to normal and gamesto the fixture calendar, Ruaidhri will be clocking up the air miles. “I will be going to watch our own players in England and reporting back, as well as studying the opposition,” he adds. Nothing beats being there and seeing a game in the flesh. The TV camera will only ever follow the ball. “If you have a birds eye view from the stand, you can see everything that is going on. When the ball is at this end of the pitch, what is the teams shape like back here. “When you are watching an inidual player, you literally focus on the player. It is dferentyou are watching a team. You are analysing the whole structure of the team. It is two completely dferent things,” Higgins continues. From playing on Termoncanices school team, to now, he is now an important cog in international football and takes Stephens approach as a massive compliment. “There are a lot of bigger names than me, who he couldve went after and have loved the position. He has huge trust in me and sees the value I can bring and I take it as a massive compliment and for me, it is a huge confidence booster.” He has never been at a major tournament as a fan. Watching from a pub as Damien Duff tore Spain apart in the  World Cup clash in Suwon is a memory, a game Ireland lost on penalties. “Damien was probably the best winger in the world and thats not exaggerating,” Higgins says of the man who, along with Alan Kelly and Keith Andrews, is now in the management setup with him. Now, qualying for a major tournament would be a dream, but as part of the management is also an objective Higgins has an input to. “We have an opportunity within the next two years of getting to the Euros and getting to a World Cup. “You dream of it when you were a small boy. We will be doing everything we can, it wont be from the want of trying. We have a really good group of players to go and try to achieve something special.” Football has always been Ruaidhri Higgins le. His skill set has opened the latest door of opportunity.

He spoke to Michael McMullan about his love for football, his career and answering Irelands call. *** It has always been football for Ruaidhri Higgins. Always. He has never known anything dferent. Even in Primary Four, Leo McCloskey saw enough to call him into the Termoncanice PS team. The following year, they lost a Northern Ireland final, before going one better  months later. It was the beginning for the man Stephen Kenny has put his trust into lead the scouting and analysis of the Republic of Ireland soccer team. googletag.cmd.push Higgins obsession for the game smashed through the roof when he began to play with the local Newtowne underage teams from the age of seven. “I wasnt one of those kids that was into cartoons, super heroes and Disney films, I was just obsessed by playing football from no age,” Ruaidhri begins. “I cant ever remember not playing it and it has been my le.” It began to get more serious when Kenny Shiels, who was taking his son Dean to play for Lisburn Youths at the time, asked Ruaidhris fatherhis son would join them. It was a prominent shop window for scouts, but the regular . kick-offs demanded a six oclock rise and trek up the M. googletag.cmd.push “It was a massive commitment,” Ruaidhri said, of his parents Danny and Marys time. For two years, it was Newtowne in the summer and Lisburn in the winter and all the travelling it entailed. They backed him  percent. Ruaidhri and Paddy are their youngest sons, with a  year gap to Michael and Kevin. “It is two dferent generations, but we are unbelievably close, the four of us,” Ruaidhri stresses. “I have been in every corner of Europe with football and they have always followed, they have been massive supporters in my career. “Without that upbringing and without that support, then I probably wouldnt be in the position I am in and wouldnt have had a career in this country like I had. I am very grateful and I dont take it for granted.” Ruaidhri played Gaelic football in his youth and as a pupil of St Marys Limavady lost an Ulster final replay to Coalisland. Growing up, he rarely missed a game when Derry were challenging for Sam Maguire. Even then, at the age of eight, Ruaidhri was deeper in thought than most. “The semi-final was probably the final, I remember when Johnny McGurk hit the winning score with his left foot,” Ruaidhri recalls of the  triumph, with the detail he will be using to suss out Irelands opponents. “It was a massive passion at that time but football shaded it. My brothers, my Da and my uncles first love would be GAA.” His first soccer football game was a trip to Parkhead to see Celtic come from - down to beat Dundee United in the Scottish Cup. He has been to Old Trafford, but doesnt have a favourite team. “I wouldnt say I am a fan of anyone. I am a football fan and I would look out for Celtic orUniteds score but it wouldnt ruin my weekendthey didnt win.” As the years passed, Ruaidhris prowess in the ious underage leagues attracted the attention of soccer scouts and was forward and back with too many clubs before opting for Coventry City. *** There were offers from more prominent clubs on the table, but Coventry attracted him. A chance for first team football, a long-term contract and hospitality all influenced his decision. “I was made feel unbelievably welcome, even at that age, by Gordon Strachan, the first team manager,” Ruaidhri states. “Richard Money, the Academy Director, and George Mackiemade my family feel unbelievably welcome every time we went over and made a big fuss.” Ruaidhri has no regrets about the move and completed his last two years of school in Coventry. At the time, a growth spurt led to knee problems and he spent the first two months in plaster and he didnt kick a ball for close to six months. “It was the right decision,” Ruaidhri points out of the club insisting he join earlier than anticipated. “I was playing through the pain barrier at home and they werent happy about it. Until they fixed it, I went  months in and out of playing because of the pain I was in. They had invested in me and were well within their rights. “It toughened me up. I moved away from home at  and had to become a man before a normal teenager, that stood me in good stead. Looking back, in terms of becoming more streetwise, it gave me a sound footing.” While he was happy with his progress in his first two years, he felt there was a genuine point he caught the eye of first-team manager Gary McAllister, who liked how Ruairi played in possession and he bagged two goals on his reserve debut. “I played really well and got peoples attention around the club,” Higgins felt. It was a quick evolution in how the game changed and relegation from the Championship sent out a warning message. “It was all about second balls and getting up and down the pitch. That didnt suit my style. Once athleticism started to take over from creative players, I kinda knew I might not have a career at that level,” he added. For four and half years, Coventry had high hopes for the Limavady man, but it faded away. When his contract ended, he wasnt too keen on going down the leagues. “It is a body blow to players when they get released from clubs in England. It is your dream, it is your passion, you feel you have failed.” Just when he needed a saviour, Stephen Kenny made the first of five important phone calls to Ruaidhri Higgins. *** With his teenage years coming to an end and his Coventry career over, an   number lit up on Ruaidhri Higgins phone. Kenny had just taken up the mantle as Derry City manager in August  and was putting together a squad. “I had never spoken to him before,” Ruaidhri reveals. “There was a definite rebuilding process when I came home, I wasnt the same person for six to  months. I lost my confidence and felt I had let people down,” he said, while stressing nothing was further from the truth. “Stephen was the perfect manager for me at that time. Living at home with my parents helped massively.” Slowly but surely he got his mojo back. “I owe Stephen a lot. In my first six months I played a lot in the reserve team just to get playing football again. I was performing better and better and running games in the reserves and it gave me the confidence that I could get my career back on track.” Kennys management skills continued, when he waited for the opportune moment to bed him back into the senior squad. It wasnt a rush, but rather some games to ease him into a regular spot. The Candystripes, with Higgins as a regular, won four League Cups in a row from  to . In , they won the FAI Cup with a - extra-time thriller, Kennys last game before taking over at Scottish side Dunfermline. After losing the  title to Cork City on the last day of the season, they missed the  treble after Shelbourne won the league on score dference. “Stephen brought great success and, particularly in  and , the Brandywell was packed and there was a great buzz”, Higgins states. “We had a really good run in Europe in  and that probably cost us the treble because of the backlog of games.” Derry beat IFK Gothenburg and Gretna before going out against Paris Saint-Germain - on aggregate, after holding the French side scoreless at the Brandywell in the first leg.

His book has been described in The Independent as ldquoone of the finest pieces of modern nature writing in recent years. In this extract the autistic teenager shares his joy of the natural world on a day out to Murlough with his sister and brother.OUR garden is thrumming with birds today: coal, blue and great tits, blackbird, thrush, magpie, jackdaw, rook, all of them revelling on the grass, pecking at the feeders.I could happily watch them all day but rain is coming from the east, so we decide to go west to the coast at Murlough to stay in the sunshine. I usually despise being in the sun. I find its light too bright, its heat too hot, and it can make me feel astherersquos nowhere to hide. But with this rain coming, I feel like being on the dunes at Murlough, pressed by warmth and sea breezes.The ancient dune system here is six thousand years old, fragile and spectacular. The unusually high dunes were formed in the late th and th centuries by massive storms, and were used by people in the Middle Ages as rabbit warrens to provide them with meat and pelts.Grazing rabbits encouraged the grassy heathland here, but when myxomatosis first broke out in the s, as it did in other parts of Ireland and Britain, the population was almost wiped out. With fewer rabbits, sea buckthorn and sycamore could grow, turning heath to scrubland. Now the National Trust have intervened at Murlough, managing the landscape so it reverts back to heath mdash and judging from the copious pings, it looks like the rabbits are thriving again, too.The day is sparkling, the wind is shaking and shaping the clouds. Lorcan and Blaacutethnaid want to swim, so I stroll along the beach with my binoculars. Shapes out at sea stop me: a trinity of torpedoing gannets. They swoop, wheel and suddenly drop, spiralling until the last second when they transform into arrows before hitting the water.Swallows are overhead ndash I can see their small bodies so clearly, weightless and constantly moving. I feel myself rising with them.My dark, knotted thoughts seem to be staying away at the moment. I feel as free as the gannets and swallows. If they can live their lives, shouldnrsquot I do the same  Can I breathe and live and also fight  The natural world mdash which includes us mdash is facing such enormous challenges that itrsquos easy to become overwhelmed and depressed. But we must fix them, andIrsquom no longer here, alive, I canrsquot be part of the solution.What is it thatrsquos holding me back  Anxiety  Depression  Autism  These are the shackles. Surely, I can break free. Or at least I can accept these things as part of me. I have no answers, but the lightness of these thoughts and these days weave my body and mind with everything around me. The only thing that I am really bound to is nature ndash as we all are.Lorcan and Blaacutethnaid are running towards me, and I run to them, and then we run together, exultant. We slow down in unison, all feeling the same pull of the large peculiar shells dotted around the beach. We each pick one up and hold them outstretched, delicate porcelain in our hands.They look like pale planets, pockmarked with symmetrical lines. I rattle mine, listening to the whisper of sand and the past. These are sea potatoes mdash a type of sand-burrowing sea urchin mdash with pocks that once held spines and a bleached calcium carbonate shell that could so easily shatter on land or at sea. Each one is a miracle. So many miracles washed up at once.We start to collect them and Lorcan decides to name three of the best specimens Sandy, Sam and Sandra. He holds a conversation with them, three sea potatoes, which makes us laugh so hard that tears well up and almost flow, and wersquore still laughing as a warm rain starts to fall on us.Under dark skies, I feel completely unburdened of any doubts in my own abilities to help our planet. Instead, I feel energised and ready. Sopping wet and cold and with chattering teeth, still giggling madly, I feel hope pouring in the rain. Being myself is enough.Diary of a Young Naturalist by Dara McAnulty is published by Little Tollerand can be bought online, or at No Alibis bookshop in Belfast..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"A lifetime of capturing Ireland’s scenic beauty  ","story":"AMATEUR photographer Chris Laverty spent a letime capturing Irelandrsquos scenic beauty.The former Queenrsquos University computer centre manager travelled extensively, always with his camera, and always with an eye for the magic of the countryside around him.

As we work to do so, our absolute priority will be to keep our patients, service users and staff safe. the statement adds.The health trustrsquos insistence that emergency services will be restored at the Downe comes ahead of a meeting with a Sinn Fein delegation to discuss the issue.Spearheaded by South Down MP, Chris Hazzard, the delegation will be seeking assurances that all services will be restored to their previous level.Ahead of the meeting, Mr Hazzard said that due to the pandemic, the local community was left without access to vital services at the Downe due to the health systemrsquos response to coronavirus which ldquorequired what amounted to extraordinary measures for an extraordinary time.The MP said the Downe was left ldquounrecognisable as emergency and outpatient services, amongst others, closed from the end of March.ldquoWhere required, all available staff and equipment from these units was also requisitioned for use in other parts of the South Eastern Trust area, he continued.ldquoIn agreeing to the radical reconfiguration of the Downe, the community made a big sacrice in order to accommodate the unprecedented demands made by both health trusts in the fight against Covid-.Insisting that it was the right thing to do at the right time, Mr Hazzard said there is now an onus on trust management to respond in kind to the community.He said the recently published recovery plans have delayed the restoration of vital services to the community, causing signicant concern amongst many who fear that ldquotemporary closure might inevitably mean permanent removal.Mr Hazzard said the Sinn Fein delegation will be calling for the full restoration of services at the Downe and will also be meeting with the chief executive of the Southern Trust to call for services removed from Newryrsquos Daisy Hill hospital to be reinstated.Rowallane DUP councillors are also demanding the full restoration of services at the Downe Hospital, highlighting the importance of reopening the emergency department as soon as possible.Cllr Billy Walker said it was ironic that within hours of confirmation that the Downpatrick ED would not reopen at this stage, the South Eastern Trust revealed via social media that the Ulster Hospitalrsquos emergency department was extremely busy.ldquoThis is nothing new, he declared. ldquoThere is a clear need for the Downersquos emergency department to reopen now. Having this facility available can help ease the pressure on other EDs and we cannot understand why there is not increased investment in Downpatrick.ldquoWe all understood the temporary closure of services at the Downe to allow health chiefs to respond to the global pandemic, but the time for those services to be reinstated is now.

However, bearing in mind the scheme is all but shovel ready, this should be a simple case of signing the commencement orders with construction starting as soon as possible.Mr Hazzard said the roads minister has a capital budget of more than poundm to be spent this year, suggesting that very few projects are as advanced as the Ballynahinch bypass.ldquoThere is no logical reason why this long overdue project canrsquot get the green light for construction as a matter of priority, he said.The MP added: ldquoIn light of the severe economic impact of Covid- and the ongoing Brexit uncertainty, the commencement of this scheme would be a welcome step towards improving both our local economy and the wellbeing of our community..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Darragh Cross residents bring cheer to local residential home  ","story":"RESIDENTS from Oakland Court in Darragh Cross made the most of the lockdown by having socially distanced nights of entertainment while helping the residents of a nearby residential home.From hosting fun events such as bingo and discos, they raised pound for Willowview Residential Home in Saintfield.Oakland Court residents would like to thank Darragh Crossrsquo Vivo shop for its donation of prize hampers and everyone who donated prizes and gts.In turn, all residents and staff of Willowview Residential Home would like to say pay their gratitude to to all the residents of Oakland Court and Darragh Cross Vivo for their kindness and thoughtfulness..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"DNA testing on dog dirt  ","story":"SENIOR Newry, Mourne and Down Council officers say they will need time to research the issue of using DNA testing on dog dirt in a bid to trace animals which are allowed to use public areas as open air toilets.Members of the local authorityrsquos Neighbourhood Services Committee will discuss the issue at their virtual meeting later today.A motion on the issue tabled by Rowallane councillor Patrick Brown at the March meeting of the full council was referred to the local authority committee for discussion.Dog dirt poses a major health risk, especially to children, who could potentially lose their sight as a result of coming into contact with it.Cllr Brown said there was a need to consider innovative ways of tackling the issue which has been raised on a regular basis by elected representatives across the local authorityrsquos seven DEAs.He is keen for the local authority to investigate the viability of using DNA testing in a bid to identy offenders and aid enforcement officers to dish out fines.Cllr Brown is also eager for council officials to draw upon best practice from other councils who have introduced such a scheme in a bid to crack down on the dog fouling issue.In addition, he wants the local authority to roll out what he has described as an ldquoenhanced public awareness campaign focusing on the dangers of dog fouling.Ahead of tonightrsquos council meeting, officers are recommending that Cllr Brownrsquos motion is agreed to allow them time to research similar schemes which have been introduced where.In addition, officers say that they will need to understand the time and resources required to implement such a scheme locally beforereporting back to the council committee.Politicians, who have previously asked for more enforcement staff to be deployed across the district to deal with the dog fouling problem, say the highly contentious issue is one of the single most complained about problems in the area.They say that despite valiant efforts over recent years by council officials and others, the issue has not been adequately addressed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Drive in assembly at Crossgar primary school  ","story":"CEDAR Integrated Primary School in Crossgar has said farewell to its P pupils.Staff held a drive-in leavers ceremony for the outgoing P class last Friday.Parents and carers were invited to park in the playground and watch the  pupils receive folders of their work from their time at Cedar.They also received a survival kit for lsquobig schoolrsquo, as well as trophies for sports, arts and ICT,.

However, all facilities will close at pm.Within the next two weeks, additional council toilet facilities will reopen at three locations in Newcastle mdash Castle Park, Central Promenade and South Promenade, with council-owned toilets at Spelga Dam also set to reopen.The council says it is reopening toilet blocks between am and pm as part of a ldquophased approach balancing service provision, resources and the health and safety of the public and local authority staff.The organisation says that reopening public toilets will increase the districtrsquos tourist offering, confirming that work is underway to open additional toilet blocks on a phased basis with the hope to have as many as possible open at the height of the summer.But a warning has been issued that the reopening plan depends upon available resources to ensure that all facilities are serviced to the standard required.ldquoIt is vital to provide facilities that are maintained to a level that mitigates the risk of cross-contamination and possible transfer of Covid- among members of the public, said a council spokesman.Council officials say the measures taken to reopen public conveniences include increased frequency of cleansing and inspection, social distancing and hand washing signage and hand sanitisers provided outside each facility.In addition, the local authority says that its plan to reopen all public conveniences across the district will be continually reviewed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Removal of statue is ‘ridiculous’  ","story":"CALLS for the removal of a statue in west London in honour of one of Killyleaghrsquos most famous sons have been branded ldquoridiculous by a local politician.The statue of Sir Hans Sloane is included on a list of monuments that should be removed over his perceived links to slavery.Activists from the Black Lives Matter movement want the statue in honour of Sir Hans removed, while a campaign has been launched to replace it with a tribute to former Cha footballers Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink and Eidur Gudjohnsen.It is Sloanersquos marriage to Elizabeth Rose mdash the daughter of a wealthy slave planter in Jamaica ndash bringing him a one-third share of the net profits from her fatherrsquos vast plantations, which has put him on the list of Black Lives Matters campaigners.In addition, campaigners want to rename streets named after Sir Hans in the highly fashionable Knightsbridge area such as Sloan Square because he derived part of his wealth from his slave owner father-in-law who owned plantations in Jamaica.The collections of Sir Hans Sloane helped found the first museum in the world - the British Museum - and he was personal physician to three dferent English monarchs. He was also famous for discovering milk chocolate.Born in Killyleagh on April , , Sir Hans died in Cha in , aged  and described as the worldrsquos greatest collector who, from his earliest years, catalogued and carefully encased every artefact that he found.Over the years he accumulated nearly , items many of which today are on display in the British Museum.Close to the picturesque harbour in Killyleagh stands a copy of the London statue in honour of Sir Hans with a local councillor branding the campaign to take down the statues in the capital as ldquoridiculousCllr Billy Walker insists that the pioneering physician was not a slave trader and that the clamour for many statues to be taken down was becoming ldquosilly, urging the Government to show some backbone on the matter.He said Sir Hans was ldquorevered in his home town where people were proud to have a copy of the statue to a man who did so much for the world.Cllr Walker continued: ldquoSir Hans gave us the concept of free museums, found a cure for smallpox and pioneered science and medicine to do away with magic for treating illness.ldquoHe also promoted the use of quinine against malaria, discovered milk chocolate and was the first man to lead both Royal Colleges. Sir Hans also treated the poor for free and was no slave trader.Cllr Walker said Sir Hans left Killyleagh for London when he was  where he studied chemistry, before deciding on a career in medicine, qualying in France and ing to London.He was subsequently appointed as the personal physician to the governor of Jamaica and it was there that he discovered drinking chocolate.When he ed to England, Sir Hans was able to market his find and Cadburyrsquos promoted this drink for many years.Cllr Walker said that Sir Hans, who has a centre named after him in his home town, encouraged inoculation against ious diseases and for  years was President of the Royal College of Surgeons and a Fellow and hard working secretary of the Royal Society for many years.ldquoWe in Killyleagh are rightly very proud of Sir Hans and his links with our town, he continued.The councillor added: ldquoI hope that his statue in London will remain in place as he was a man of great distinction which is evidenced by the fact that there is now a centre dedicated to him in his home town. Killyleagh is fiercely proud of Sir Hans and his achievements..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Restoration of emergency services at Downe must be top priority  ","story":"THERE is substantial disquiet within our community concerning the future of the emergency department at Downe Hospital.The time is now long overdue for the South Eastern Trust to confirm that its intention is to restore our emergency department service to its pre-Covid- level and to provide a firm indication of the date on which it believes that that will happen.Clearly, that date cannot be far into the future.Downe Hospital has played a crucial role in the emergency response to the Covid- pandemic. In addition to the services directly provided at our local hospital mdash the peoplersquos hospital mdash Downe staff were redeployed to other healthcare facilities andcontributed enormously to the NHS effort.When the emergency planning was taking effect, it was the clear understanding of many local political and community representatives, that the emergency department service would be restored immediately upon the conclusion of the pandemic.Whilst there is clearly a signicant possibility of a so-called second surge in infections mdash and we are all aware as to just how serious such a second surge could be mdash at the same time there is increased normalisation of health provision across the North.The restoration of the urgent care service previously provided at the Downe must be a top priority as part of this normalisation. It should have been included in the June action plan, published by the health trust last week.Just last week, as attendances were increasing at the remaining emergency departments, including at the Ulster Hospital, it was apparent that existing facilities are and will be unable to cope with demand.During the Covid emergency planning, decisions were taken to temporarily close the emergency departments at the Downe, Daisy Hill and the Mater hospitals.Just last week, trade union representatives received categorical assurances from the Southern Trust about the re-opening of about Daisy Hill Hospital. Similar assurances are now required about the Downe.There is also a signicant impetus gathering now for the implementation of restructuring of healthcare services generally, and of urgent care in particular, across Northern Ireland.Decisions about the future of healthcare, particularly urgent care, afford an excellent opportunity to redress health inequalities that have arisen and been perpetuated by the historic under investment in the health service by successive governments and by the pursuit of centralisation policies.Many people believe that those centralisation policies played a crucial role in leaving us facing into a pandemic with insufficient hospital beds, insufficient intensive care beds, insufficient ambulance cover, insufficient ventilators and insufficient healthcare workers.Any change to emergency and urgent care provision is only permissible where it happens with the consent of the people.In the final analysis, decisions about the allocation of healthcare resources are political decisions taken by politicians, elected by the people and not by bureaucrats. Tiers and levels of bureaucracy make no dference to where ultimate responsibility lies.I have a great deal of sympathy for the recently appointed health minister, Robin Swann, who within a few weeks of his appointment, found himself facing the biggest public health emergency in the history of the National Health Service.I would respectfully suggest that Mr Swann should insist upon the criteria for change stated by Michelle OrsquoNeill when she was Health Minister.The now Deputy First Minister stated in November  that local people should be at the centre of decision-making processes in designing and delivering services. The , people who marched through Downpatrick in support of the Downe Hospitalin the Love the Downe Rally on February , , would certainly agree with that.As far back as , Dr Michael McBride, speaking at the sod cutting ceremony for the new Downe Hospital, said that ldquothe emphasis would be on making the health system respond to the patient rather than the patient to the system. I concur with that.In the Down Recorder of November , , after the publication of the Bengoa Report, Michelle OrsquoNeill was quoted as saying: ldquoWe will deliver care and support in the most appropriate settings, ideally in peoplersquos homes and communities.Again, I would concur with that.If there is to be a change in urgent care provision across Northern Ireland, no one can expect to be immune from that change. At the same time, change would only be possible or acceptableit is to create a better service for all of the people and a fair and equitable distribution of services.Many people in this area believe that we have had a very raw deal for over  years from the health service and some politicians.It sometimes seems to be forgotten that the National Health Service is free at the point of use, but it is certainly not without cost. It is the people who pay for it.Rural communities have particular characteristics and needs that must be addressed, in terms of at the most basic, accessibility to services. Like everyone , they have rights.Access to healthcare is a right, not a privilege.If it is to be the case that urgent care is being restructured, citizens in rural areas which, for this purpose, includes virtually anyone outside the Greater Belfast area, cannot be expected to forego services so that Belfast can continue to enjoy a proleration of emergency services, with not one but two Type  emergency departments on the scale of that at the Ulster Hospital, on its overdeveloped and cramped site, the Royal Victoria Hospital and the Mater, with the Type  unit at the Lagan Valley hospital, just seven miles from Belfast, a similar distance to that travelled by the people of Ardglass to the Downe hospital.Of course, Type  emergency departments are also to be found at Antrim and Craigavon, neither of which are far from Belfast and are linked by the best possible road infrastructure.Logically, it would seem, that the existence of two Type  units in Belfast is not sustainable, given the apparent massive pressure on services.We were told by the Department of Health at the time of the January  public meeting in Downpatrick Cricket Club that the purpose of that meeting was to enable local people to ldquofundamentally shape, inform and influence the criteria to be used to deliver services in the future.We hope that is still the case and await meaningful engagement with the community before change is implemented.The then deputy permanent secretary was quoted as having said that the then Minister would want to see ldquoongoing engagement in redesigning services. I am sure that the current Health Minister has the same views.The challenge for the Health Minister in the future must surely be to develop a fair and equitable distribution of services that would end discrimination against rural communities and ensure that all services, including ambulance services, are readily accessible to all of the people.It is worth remembering as well, that there was actually a .%in the attendances at emergency departments in Northern Ireland between December  and December . In the same period, attendances at the Downe Hospitalrsquos emergency department rose signicantly.Decisions about change in the health service are political decisions. All of the major parties form the Northern Ireland Executive, which is collectively accountable for the program for government and all that it delivers or fails to deliver for the people.It is imperative that any attempt to change or restructure healthcare provision in Northern Ireland is done so in full consultation with the end users of the services, who are also the paymasters for it. This will be very dficult, as history has created a deep mistrust between substantial elements in our community and the Department of Health.Our community has suffered greatly from repeated cuts to services and the ruthless pursuit of a centralisation agenda a pursuit that has continued even in recent years when the NHS in England and Wales has been investing in and supporting smaller hospitals, recognising their crucial roles at the heart of local communities and using technological advances to support them.If it appears that Covid- is being used as a cover to implement long-standing Department of Health policy, then any changes would be resented by the community and in fact rejected by it. This would lead to an irreparable breach of trust between the people and the State.If an attempt is made to in any way reduce the services that are currently on offer at the Downe Hospital, this community, as it has done before, will rise up in righteous indignation.Twenty five thousand people took to the streets of Downpatrick in February . If our emergency department is not restored within a reasonable timescale mdash a matter of weeks mdash it is very likely that this area will see an unprecedented display of anger, with , plus people on the street, with legal challenges about any perceived abuse of process and a community-wide campaign, a cross-community campaign and political upheaval at the highest level of government.The people of East and South Down have had enough. They have reluctantly sacriced local services, as a temporary measure in the short term, but their resolve should not be underestimated.The people of Newcastle, Ballynahinch, Castlewellan, Ardglass, Killough, Clough, Downpatrick, Strangford, Crossgar, Lower Mourne and the vast surrounding rural hinterland need these services.Farmers, fishermen and builders need emergency care as much as ever, so too do the tourists who flock into our area every year and probably will do so in even greater numbers this year.It is time to restore the Downe Hospitalrsquos emergency department and it is time to concentrate investment in local services, delivering for the people who need the services, where they need those services.The NHS must serve the people from ldquocradle to grave. It is a part of the social contract between the people and those who govern them.Politicians and administrators come and go. The Downe hospital must live on, developing all the time the range of services it offers.Equality demands nothing less..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Revered servant of local cricket  ","story":"Robin Walsh remembers Alfie Linehan, the distinguished Downpatrick cricket stalwart who died last yearTHE great paradox of Alfie Linehan was to be found in his disposition on the cricket field and off it.At the crease, his was a belligerent style, hitting the ball farther than anyone , compiling his runs in a manner that kept the scorers busy. Beyond the boundary!Yet this domineering, almost bullying, approach belied one of Irish cricketrsquos truest gentlemen off it: soft-spoken, never a word that offended, never a word against him.In one of the most distinguished legacies to the local game, the late Downpatrick farmer captained the Ireland team before turning to administration in the roles of chairman and president of the Northern Cricket Union and president of the Irish Cricket Union.Yet it was where it mattered most, at the grassroots of the game, that Alfie left his indelible mark.His devotion to the Downpatrick club and its famous international ground The Meadow was boundless and le-long, from underage player to captain of the club, coach and ultimately chairman and president.He either played or captained Downpatrick in five NCU Senior League, three Senior Cup-winning sides and an Irish Senior Cup triumph along with his older brother Hugh, another talented batsman whose death at the age of  dealt a terrible blow to Alfie.In later years it was a source of great pride that Hughrsquos son, Paul, was to captain the club and daughter Anne played for Ireland.His wersquos nephew, James Cunningham, also captained the club.Alfiersquos hard-hitting ways over four decades from the s took him to  Irish appearances mdash six of them as captain mdash in the days when international caps were much less liberally awarded, and his contribution to the success of NCU representative cricket has rarely been equalled.Administration was an endless labour of love at local, provincial and national level. Such was his accommodating nature that he chaired countless committees ranging from solving an umpire shortage in the NCU to raising funds at ICU golf days.His contribution to his local community extended far beyond the boundaries of the cricket club.In his day he was a member of the NI Sports Council, a director of his local hospital trust and president of Ardglass Golf Club.Alfiersquos friends were legion, none more close than Cecil Walker, that leading light of the Lisburn club.Their playing days over, they travelled the world with their wives watching international cricket and storing delightful memories of new friendships, whether tales of the Bodyline era over tea with Harold Larwood at his home in Sydney, or a fond mention by David lsquoBumblersquo Lloyd from the commentary box.Of all thatrsquos been written down the years about Alfie Linehan, one game has been overlooked and yet it speaks more than any of his commitment to Downpatrick.It was Saturday, August , , and Downpatrick were due to play Lurgan. It was also the day of Alfiersquos wedding to his beloved Mary. No problem: wedding in the morning, cricket in the afternoon, reception in the evening, off on honeymoon the next day.Of all the tributes paid to Alfie none has been more signicant than that on BBC Televisionrsquos Sports Personality of the Year programme last December.He was included in the prestigious roll of honour of international sports personalities who had died during .

Following a prolonged period of dry weather water levels have dropped to around %. It hasnt been that low since . Picture: Michael CooperSince the beginning of lockdown, the company has seen a signicant rise in the amount of water used in homes.This rise, coupled with the dry weather, has contributed to a drop in water levels in reservoirs.Increased household use has not been offset by the closure of businesses, as many high water users, such as the agri-food sector, factories etc. have been able to stay operational during this time. NI Water Chief Executive Sara Venning said: “This recent dry spell, which has been breaking records, coupled with more people at home using more water, has resulted in a signicant drop in our water levels.  \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

We would need a period of reasonably wet weather before we would see a signicant change in the levels of most of our reservoirs.“There are a number of steps NI Water can take to alleviate the stress on reservoirs including a hosepipe ban.However, the key to conserving water is public action now.How we all use our water now will have a massive impact on our water levels during the summer months and on whether a hosepipe ban will be required.“For example, we know from the increase in our night usage some customers are leaving sprinklers and hoses on overnight we are appealing to them to stop.A sprinkler left on overnight is enough to meet the daily water needs of  families. We are also asking people to think before they use their pressure washer. Could the task be put off until we are out of this dry period  “However, the easiest way for everyone to save a little water and make a big dference is through normal household tasks.If each of us turned off the tap when brushing our teeth, in a month we would save enough water for the daily handwashing of  people.  “Similarly,you put a jug of water into the fridge rather than running the tap, those actions alone would save approximately  litres per day.This is enough to keep  people hydrated for a whole day! “We want everyone to enjoy their home and garden, we just need people to think about how they use their water andwhat they are doing is essential.If it is not essential we would really appeal to people not do it at the moment.”\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

We weren’t alone, with the BMA and nursing professional bodies concurring. We were denied sight of ‘the science’ until Imperial College’s research was leaked. This ideological, Darwinesque, anarchistic push from the libertarian-right set an unfortunate tone from which we should all guard. The botched ‘closure’ of schools in Northern Ireland, with + schools remaining open to receive, on average, just two, three or four children of key workers, was a reflection of local political dference. Far too many schools opened during lockdown and teachers could do little about this.NEU have contributed positively with the minister for education and the department to find ways forward. Our detailed -page discussion document “On ato Education in Northern Ireland” was widely praised as a positive pupil-centred contribution when presented publicly and to the Assembly Education Committee. Our teachers and educators have continued to work long hours, well beyond the constricts of their contracts. Teachers well understand that disadvantage is compounded for the most marginalised pupils during lockdown. With infection rates dropping, and the economy struggling, we all accept that calculated risks are required for some sort of normalisation to occur. Our recent meeting with the minister on th June was wholly constructive and collegiate.It is time to ‘dial-down’ the tone of the discourse and work together, positively, for a safeto schooling in mid to late August.Mark Langhammer, Regional Secretary, NEU, Northern Ireland ——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

in one of his articles that such a progressive town as Penarth was without an operatic and dramatic society, writes Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Societypresident, Mary Gardner.The response to his outcry was quickly taken up and within three weeks the Penarth Operatic Society was formed.The Societyrsquos first production was Gilbert  Sullivanrsquos Iolanthe, played at The Hippodrome which later burnt down, and what a glittering opening evening it must have been as the audience wore evening dress.The review featured next day read, ldquoBrilliant Initial Performance.More newsVale council issues warning over the use of parksFines increased for coronavirus lockdown breachesMarie Curie Great Blooming Tea Party goes virtualA few years later in , the drama section came into being and with it a new title of the Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Society, known affectionately as PODS.Since then PODS has progressed down through the decades with many highlights along the way.One being in  when PODS presented that great musical, The King And I, which won the premier prize at the Waterford International Festival, for which the company received a beautul Waterford crystal vase.The Town Council held a reception to honour the Society at the Paget Rooms, and James Callaghan, the local MP, paid his tribute to PODS saying it ldquoadded lustre and brought culture to Penarth.Another landmark was the play, Dear Octopus, by Dodie Smith produced for PODS th anniversary celebrations.One of our most challenging and exciting shows was Cabaret in , which won the National Operatic  Dramatic Associationrsquos award for Best Production and Best Stage Management and Technical presentation.More recently in , to honour and pay tribute to the many men who gave their lives in World War One, PODS presented the very special play, Last Man Standing, which also won a NODA award for Best Drama.In , PODS decided to do pantomime, and this has been a greatly gratying and popular addition to the companyrsquos output.Itrsquos wonderful to see children in the cast having on-stage experience, and then those children in the audience, perhaps for the first time, enjoying and loving live theatre.PODS is a very busy Society putting on four shows a year, a musical, two plays and a pantomime.Mrs Gardner said: ldquoThis year, sadly and very upsettingly after much hard work by all involved, the covid- virus struck as PODS had just set-up at the Paget Rooms ready for its run of Goodnight Mister Tom, only to be told the venue would be shut down next day.ldquoSince January, the Society had also been rehearsing for its May musical, The Full Monty, and that too has had to be cancelled.       ,params: .pushldquoNevertheless, when this terrible emergency is over the company will put on these two productions sometime in the future. ldquoPODS is proud of its achievement in giving much pleasure and entertainment to the local community with its first-class shows over the last  years, and its goal is to make its centenary in  with the help of its faithful audiences, friends and patrons.PODS is always ready to welcome new members, but at the moment it cannot meet or rehearse due to the covid- restrictions.It might be some time before restrictions are lted on groups being able to rehearse together, or audiences allowed back in theatres, meanwhile PODS members keep in touch on social media.There is a lsquoPODS public grouprsquo on Facebook, PODS quiz nights are being held on Zoom, and there is a website to keep track at podspenarth.org article_url   content_id   site_id

station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownThe campaign by the Save Dinas Powys Woods and Protect Homes from Flooding group was launched in March  after the Woodland Trust said NRW was proposing to build a dam within its site of Cwm George and Casehill Woods.The group said the proposals would involve cutting down  square metres of trees including  square metres of ancient trees and regular flooding upstream during high rainfall would result in further destruction of ancient trees, hedgerows, wildle, and plants.Dormice and other protected species like bats were at risk, the group said.The woods, much-loved by the community, attracts visitors from other areas and is the Woodland Trustrsquos most visited site in Wales with more than , visitors.Hundreds of people took part in marches in  to oppose the dam.NRW released its draft Outline Business Case in February  and a consultation period with the local community took place.Hundreds of people attended a meeting in February to oppose the dam and they wrote to NRW, with their views, during the coronavirus lockdown.Chairman of Save Dinas Powys Woods  Protect Homes From Flooding, Peter Smith said the group welcomed the announcement that NRW will not develop a dam in the Dinas Powys Woods.ldquoLocal people recognise the flood risk in the village, but are overwhelmingly in favour of a natural flood management programmein the Cadoxton River and Eastbrook catchments, plus improved channel maintenance andrequired local hard defences, rather than an environmentally unfriendly dam, Dr Smith said.ldquoOur proposals will slow the flow of the rivers upstream thus reducing the risk of flash flooding, and by removing obstacles improve flow downstream.ldquoWe now look forward to working with NRW and The Woodland Trust to design an effective NFM scheme.ldquoBoth have expertise in this area, and, having made funds available for NFM projects, we know that the Welsh Government is keen for Wales to become an exemplar of good practice. community involvement and support will remain key features of our campaign.He added: ldquoWe are grateful to people far and wide who have supported our campaign, including the Woodland Trust, our local community councils, and county councillors.ldquoWe extend our particular thanks our local MS, Jane Hutt, for her advocacy and support.Community councillor, Chris Franks said NRW must not now ignore any problems.ldquoClearly over the years there has been reduced spending on maintenance of the stream through Dinas Powys and towards Barry, he said.ldquoThe public has said that the NRW must improve monitoring of flows on the Cadoxton River, implement natural flood management measures and improve flow at Cardf Road bridge where the stream passes under the A to reduce flood risk.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquolsquoFollowing our meeting on May  Sir David Henshaw chairman of NRW wrote to me on May  to say that NRW received almost  responses to our

has spoken of the plight of rural communities during lockdown in Uganda.Three months ago, Jenipher Wetaka Sambazi, a Fairtrade coffee farmer from the Mt Elgon region in Uganda, was sharing her experiences of the benefit of Fairtrade in Penarthrsquos Tabernacle Baptist Church.More NewsVictory in campaign to save Dinas Powys ancient woodland as dam plan is abandonedVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownNow she and her family, like communities around the world, are under lockdown.In March, campaigners, businesses, supporters, and students from around Wales heard Jenipherrsquos story, face to face.Now she is unable to travel or even meet with her neighbours.This means the coffee picked at the end of the last harvest remains on the mountain and Jenipher and her fellow farmers are prohibited from travelling to gather it for processing under the current lockdown rules.There are currently several hundred known cases of covid- in Uganda, but none in the Mount Elgon region and no fatalities in Uganda as yet.Farmers want to keep it this way, but lockdown is causing other concerns such as limiting access to food and healthcare.This is the time of year when there is the least amount of food available, and the closing of markets and freedom to travel for farmers to source food and water means that times are exceptionally hard.Jenipher as vice-chairwoman of a Fairtrade coffee cooperative, is responsible for many who rely on the cooperative for work.The expert hand-sorters who are seasonal workers and rely on this part of the coffee chain to feed their family at this time, have no coffee to sort.While they may have some spare eggs, vegetables or matoke to trade, the threat of soldiers prohibiting them from doing so is too much for them.Farmer co-operatives, an essential element of Fairtrade, enable and encourage communities to work together.Fairtrade also requires an extra amount of money, the Fairtrade premium, to be paid to producers.Fairtrade farmers like Jenipher are struggling, but they have the benefits of a strong local community as well as the backup of the Fairtrade premium.Fairtrade International have announced a .m euro Fairtrade Producer Relief fund targeting the immediate needs and Resilience Fund to help producers rebuild their businesses after Covid-.Jenipher Wettaka Sambazi said: ldquoLe is hard.ldquoThe markets are shut so there is nowhere to sell or earn money, or to buy food and basic essentials.ldquoLocal health centres have been shut to reduce the chance of spreading the virus, but since all transport is banned, those who need operations, treatment or antenatal care need to walk  km to the nearest hospital.ldquoTwo women and their unborn babies have died on the way.\"Roger Casey, who attends Tabernacle Baptist Church said: ldquoIt was wonderful to meet Jenipher and hear her story.ldquoWe get through a lot of coffee in our office and meeting a real coffee farmer from Uganda makes you think about the real people and real lives behind that Fairtrade logo.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquoMeeting Jenipher during her visit to Wales earlier this year was inspiring.ldquoThe increasing dficulties facing rural farming communities because of the pandemic has shown how important Fairtrade cooperatives continue to be and I am glad that leaders like Jenipher continue to promote the benefits of Fairtrade and to support communities.National co-ordinator of Fair Trade Wales, Aileen Burmeister added: ldquoFair Trade producers are being impacted by covid- restrictions.ldquoGlobal stock markets are falling, meaning that farmers and workers are receiving far less for their produce.\"It is in these times that we can really see how important the Fairtrade minimum price is. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey

million development has been known as South Lake LeisureCentre but DUP party group leader, Councillor Mark Baxter feels this proposal is a fitting way to honour both the jewel in the council’s crown and the centenaryof Northern Ireland.“Our country celebrates a great milestone on the May  next year, our th anniversary as a nation within the United Kingdom,” said Cllr Baxter.“Given the current economic situation, as a party we have discussed a fitting and inexpensive way to mark this signicant anniversary.“At Council’s next monthly meeting we will propose that Council officially name the new leisure centre in Craigavon at the south lake as the ‘Centenary Leisure Centre’.“No official name had ever been discussed until this week so we feel it’s very timely.“This is an iconic building within our borough and indeed will be the most modern centre within Northern Ireland, we all look forward to the grand opening which will be a very welcome investment to the area.”The centre had been due to open in August of this year but this has been delayed due to the coronavirus lockdown.\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most

to get on its bikeThe Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon area cannot be ‘left behind’ in terms of providing cycle lanes, an Alliance councillor has said.By The NewsroomThursday, th June , : pm\"\"Cyclists.Alliance Party representative, Councillor Peter Lavery, called on Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council to take a more proactive role in local active travel and has asked that time be set aside during July’s meeting of Council’s planning committee to discuss the issue.“It has been great to see an increased number of people out cycling during the past few months,” said Cllr Lavery.“We as a public body need to be proactive and collaborate with experts to create ideas and put plans in place to harness this renewed enthusiasm for the long term.“Looking to the future, Alliance believes that government needs to rebalance funding away from roads and into more sustainable transportforms so that an increased number of transport choice are viable for residents.“This would include integrating public transport by creating links between the bus and rail network, car users and cyclists.”Noting recent announcements from the Department for Infrastructurerelating to cycle lanes and greenways, Cllr Lavery asked why this borough should not enjoy the same amenities.“The point also need to be made that when it comes to investment in projects like greenways and cycle lanes there is more to Northern Ireland than just Belfast and Derry,” he said.“Although I welcome investment in those cities, we in the ABC Council area are the second biggest in terms of population so we cannot be left behind.”A spokesperson for Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council said Council remains committed to active travel.“Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council is committed to active travel,” said the spokesperson.“Our Corporate plan outlines a number of short term outcomes to ensure, ‘There is understanding of and respect for the contribution of the built and natural environment and the role it plays in improving the health and vitality of urban and rural communities, their sense of place, character and identity’.“And, ‘Our physical and environmental assets are accessible. Everyone appreciates and takes responsibility for their protection, preservation and enhancement’.”The spokesperson continued: “In addition to a number of active travel projects already completed, the Council is continuing to develop and deliver initiativesto allow it to meet these objectives.“Active travel is a unique resource as a potential driver for economic regeneration and user well beingand the council is currently looking at ‘The One Path’ initiative in order to discuss and understand the issues people face when using shared paths and to collaboratively develop ways which help people to better share the space.“The Council is currently investigating the possibility of delivering a Landcare project in the Carn, Seagoe and Charlestown industrial areas of the Borough with the aim of developing the infrastructure around existing walking and cycling networks.“The Council fully understands the importance of implementing active travel within our infrastructure and is open to exploring all options to help benefit the lives of all who live, work and visit our Borough.”Adam Morton , Local Democracy Reporting Service\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews you can trust since News\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisCoronavirusSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1592493837675.jpg--health_minister_issues_shielding_advice.jpg?159249383700","title":"health minister issues shielding advice ","story":"Health Minister Robin Swann has announced plans to pause the shielding advice that was issued to people ahead of the Covid- peak in Northern Ireland. From  July, subject to the rate of community transmission continuing to be low, people will no longer need to shield and should instead follow the same guidance and precautions as those considered to be generally vulnerable. That involves taking particular care when out and about - and strictly maintaining social distancing.Letters will be issued in the coming days to all those covered by shielding informing them of the planned change.Mr Swann stated: “I have been clear that shielding would not last one minute longer than it needed to. We have now reached the point where,the current trends continue, there will be no need for anyone to shield after  July. “I have listened to many of you and to the challenges you have faced during this period. I am in no doubt as to the dficulties shielding has presented for a great many people.“It is unrealistic to think these dficulties will just vanish because the need to shield has ended. That is why the letters we issue will provide details of the support which will continue to be available up to and after  July.“While my announcement today will be welcome news for many who are shielding, some will view the prospect of an end to shielding with great anxiety. I want to assure them that they should decide what to do at their own pace. Everyone will approach this situation dferently.“As is so often the case at present, this will be about weighing up the options and making informed choices. Going outside can bring some degree of potential risk but this can be mitigated and minimised by strict social distancing. Staying indoors indefinitely is not good for anyone’s mental or physical health.“Finally, I would ask everyone to be considerate as people end their periods of shielding.We should all continue to social distance, but in the coming weeks I want you to be particularly understanding of the fact you might be encountering someone who has had to stay at home for many weeks. Please be aware of this, show respect and kindness to all and keep your distance.”  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:    n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_bdaefddafab   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_ddcabcbbfa   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
