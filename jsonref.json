They make it clear that Anne, with all her gifts, was above all also an ordinary girl.’The two pages were dated September 28, 1942, when Anne would have been 13, less than three months after she, her family and another Jewish family went into hiding from the Nazis in a secret annex in a house in Amsterdam.She had covered the pages with brown paper fearing they might be found – and the contents of the entries had remained a mystery ever since.A reproduction of a picture of Anne Frank from 1941 released by the Anne Frank Fonds in Frankfurt Main, Germany (picture: PA)Anne herself described the four jokes about sex as ‘dirty’ and she had written an explanation of women’s sexual development, sex, contraception and prostitution.On sex, Anne described how a young woman gets her period around age 14, saying that it is ‘a sign that she is ripe to have relations with a man but one doesn’t do that of course before one is married’.On prostitution, she wrote: ‘All men, if they are normal, go with women, women like that accost them on the street and then they go together. In Paris they have big houses for that.She also wrote in Dutch about being asked to describe sex, saying: ‘I sometimes imagine that someone might come to me and ask me to inform him about sexual matters.‘How would I go about it?’She is said to have answered her own question, mentioning ‘rhythmical movements’ to describe sex and ‘internal medicament’ when talking about contraception.Experts said the newly discovered text, when studied together with the rest of her diary, reveals more about Anne’s development as a writer than it does about her interest in sex.The house where Anne hid during the Second World War is now a museum in Amsterdam (Picture: Reuters)Mr Leopold said the words are similar to other passages dealing with sex that already have been published in the multimillion-selling diary.He said it provides an early example of how Anne ‘creates a fictional situation that makes it easier for her to address the sensitive topics that she writes about’.The deciphering was done by researchers from the Anne Frank museum, the Institute for War, Holocaust and Genocide Studies and the Huygens Institute of Netherlands History.They photographed the pages, backlit by a flash, and then used image-processing software to decipher the words, which were hard to read because they were jumbled up with the writing on the reverse sides of the pages.Anne and her family hid for more than two years during the Second World War, going into hiding in July 1942 until August 4 1944, when they were discovered and ultimately deported to Auschwitz.Only Anne’s father, Otto Frank, survived the war. Anne and her sister died in Bergen-Belsen camp when Anne was 15."},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/sec_12599779.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"tom hardy picks winner caught finger nose fonzo set","story":"Tom Hardy is a man for all seasons – but it’s nice to know he’s not averse to primal preening practices, either.The star, who is currently playing Al Capone in gangster flick Fonzo, was spotted in quite the position on set this week with his pointer firmly up his nostril.Just like Al, he was caught red handed!Frankly, it’s just nice to do another round of Celebrities: they’re just like us!Kitted out in the body makeup we’ve come to notice as he takes on the notorious don otherwise known as Scarface, while the star’s many, many tattoos were covered up in some hardcore makeup as he looked to be hanging out by his trailer.Look, when you’ve got to pick you’ve got to pick (Picture: MEGA)We guess that’s when the tickle upstairs beckoned.Look, when you’ve got to pick, you just can’t fight the urge sometimes.The guy needs a tissue – where are the assistants?!

In Britain these schools included fee-paying ones as well as state schools outside council control.However, while the existence of such schools enhanced attainment, they also had a negative effect on pupil wellbeing. One in EIGHT secondary schools in England falls below...Grammar schools across the country add extra pupil places as...Share this articleThe researchers found that increased competition sharpened the focus on academic achievement – leading to the adoption of learning tools which, although academically effective, were not necessarily inspiring or enjoyable for their pupils.These learning tools include more traditional teaching, instructional time and homework, the research found.They also include more hierarchical pupil-teacher relations and increased pressure from parents.But the study said the positive effects on academic achievement appear to outweigh the negative impacts on pupil wellbeing. It comes amid a row over the role of grammars in Britain’s educational landscape.Mr Heller-Sahlgren said that although his study did not examine the effects of selective schools – many of which are academies – they were likely to add to the phenomenon he had described. ‘One could make the argument that it increases choice and competition in the same way,’ he said.‘If grammar schools promote more choice and competition, you could argue in a roundabout way that the results might be relevant for that as well.’The study, which was based on data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, was published in the Economics of Education Review.          Tee study said the positive effects on academic achievement appear to outweigh the negative impacts on pupil wellbeing (file picture)The findings are a boost for Conservative education policies. Since coming to power, the party has been encouraging all schools to leave council control – and failing schools have been forced to do so.Last week it emerged that thousands more places are to be created at selective schools. Education Secretary Damian Hinds has approved a £50million fund to build extra classrooms. However, grammars bidding for the money must be able to prove that they are taking action to increase admissions of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds.It is thought that between 1,000 and 2,000 places could be created in areas where there is high demand from parents.The Department for Education said the move would give parents more choice and give more children of all backgrounds access to a good school place.But union leaders said ministers had no evidence that ‘shows strong educational benefit of this misguided policy’. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/16/02/4C44AC5800000578-5734013-image-a-2_1526433058218.jpg","title":"Nature works magic time year wisteria blooms make purple envy","story":"    The climbing plant was already mature when the owners moved into the house near Wells, Somerset, 35 years ago          Wisteria growing on the Castle Hotel in Taunton, SomersetBut now the entire property is drenched in purple splendour, with this year’s display even more stunning than usual.

I managed to grab his wrist and take the knife from him. I had to explain: \u0027Once you\u0027re dead, you don\u0027t come back. You\u0027re not invincible.\u0027But Riley is only just beginning to grasp the fact that actions have consequences and recognise the effects of his reckless behaviour.When Shelley caught him holding a lit match to the safety netting of their trampoline — with all four children sitting inside it — she showed him graphic pictures of burn victims.  Riley has autism and, though a sweet-natured child, he has no sense of danger, nor awareness of his own strengthShelley says: \u0027I had to try to get him to understand the danger of fire, to show him exactly what would happen to him and his brother and sisters if he started fires.\u0027Shelley\u0027s partner Max adds: \u0027We adopt shock tactics. All the children have fallen down stairs because he has chased or pushed them. We\u0027re constantly rationalising: \u0027If you do that, they could break an arm, a leg, their neck. They could be killed.\u0027 \u0027Shelley and Max are also parents to Brooke, six, Skyla, four, and 20-month-old Mikey, who suffers from a reflux disorder, is fed through a tube and often spends time in hospital. The demands on the adults\u0027 time and attention are ceaseless.Riley, however, is not a monster — though he does behave monstrously at times — and he is not wilfully delinquent. For his behaviour is the result of the autism with which he was diagnosed a year ago.It accounts for his boisterousness, his attention-seeking, his outbursts of violence and frequent meltdowns. He also has a raft of other labels and conditions, from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) to learning difficulties and oppositional defiant disorder (hostile, defiant and disobedient behaviour).Another condition, called sensory processing disorder, means that Riley\u0027s brain has difficulty responding to information that comes through his senses.\u0027He will cry if the seams of his socks aren\u0027t aligned properly,\u0027 says Shelley. \u0027Sometimes, we can go through five pairs that don\u0027t feel right before he\u0027s happy to wear them.\u0027But he can also be sweet-natured and protective, kind and endearing.  Then and now: Riley has been a handful for his Hertfordshire parents but he knows he is different and already worries about his future\u0027He is a mass of contradictions,\u0027 says his mum. \u0027He\u0027ll be the first to climb on the shed roof or to the top of a tree. Once, he broke his collarbone falling off a wardrobe. He\u0027d climbed up it to get a pack of cards.\u0027He doesn\u0027t feel pain, either. The next day, with his arm in a sling, he was scaling the kitchen units.\u0027But, in some ways, he\u0027s mature about safety. He panics and is over-protective of his siblings. He worries that the girls might be bullied — he focuses on it obsessively.\u0027If we go to the station, he\u0027ll say: \u0027Hold the pushchair in case it gets sucked under a train.\u0027\u0027If I go above level one in the car park, he\u0027ll have a meltdown. He hates glass lifts, the noise of hand-dryers, and roller coasters.\u0027          Shelley has had to quit work to look after her son with autism. Now, they hope they can get a dog for him which will guide him through lifeMax adds: \u0027Yet he thinks he can fly and leap across ravines. And, although he throws punches at his sisters and kicks them in the face, he can also be caring.\u0027When Mikey had to go into hospital, he stroked his head so gently. He was crying. One to one, he can be the most wonderful, comical little boy.\u0027He has multiple personalities. Sometimes, he demands our constant, unided attention. At others, he retreats to his bedroom and wants to be alone.\u0027Woman takes fight to court as doctors try to remove autistic...Boy, 11, who was suspended for \u0027tapping his pen\u0027 hasn\u0027t been...Share this articleThe family\u0027s warm, but chaotic, home near St Albans, Hertfordshire, bears evidence of Riley\u0027s volatility. Doors have been removed as he has kicked holes through them. A sardonic sign in the sitting room reads: \u0027Remember: as far as anyone knows we are a nice, normal family.\u0027The Riley I meet bursts into the room after school, sweet-faced and charming, fizzing with energy and eager to chat about his day, from the roast lunch he ate in its entirety (\u0027except the fat bits on the meat\u0027) to the sponge pudding he didn\u0027t finish because he wanted to rush out and play with his friends.          Riley has kicked holes in doors and threatened to throw knives-  but his mum says he is not a monster as he tries to understand his conditionThere is little to distinguish him from other boys his age — his gelled hair and cheeky grin signal mischief — except that he wears the collar of his polo shirt tucked inside to stop his obsessive habit of chewing it and he grasps a small American football as if it were a priceless treasure. The ball is carried everywhere — he even takes it into the bath and to bed.This compulsive attachment to one object was an early indication to Shelley that Riley had traits that set him apart. As she works with young children, she was alert to his differences. At first, she remembers, he seemed precociously advanced.\u0027We\u0027d go somewhere and he\u0027d remember how to get back there from that single visit,\u0027 she recalls. \u0027And he spoke in complete sentences from 18 months. He was good at problem-solving, too: if he wanted to reach something, he\u0027d build a tower and climb up it.\u0027He was also endlessly, exhaustingly, active: somersaulting off the sofa or hanging off it upside down while watching his favourite wildlife programmes on television. He would absorb information like a sponge, constantly reciting facts.Shelley\u0027s relationship with Riley\u0027s father broke down when he was a baby but, when he was 16 months old, she met pub manager Max, who has raised her son with the same love and care he gives their other three children.          Riley has autism and, though a sweet-natured child, he has no sense of danger, nor awareness of his own strength. Pictured with Brooke age 6, Skyla age 4 and Mikey (20 months)Yet Riley\u0027s behaviour continued to tax and baffle them. It was, Shelley says, a \u0027supreme relief\u0027 when he was diagnosed, aged seven, with autism.It meant there was a reason for his quirks, his flare-ups, his failure to make eye contact and his adherence to ritual. Importantly, there were also ways to help him.But, although he now takes anti-psychotic medication, there are still times when Riley tries his parents\u0027 patience to its limits.One day, Max caught Riley with his hands round Brooke\u0027s neck. \u0027They were arguing because she\u0027d gone into his bedroom — his sanctuary — and Riley had grabbed her round the throat,\u0027 says Max.\u0027I was so angry and scared that I shouted to Shelley: \u0027Keep your son away from my children.\u0027 It\u0027s the first and only time I\u0027ve said it — I make a huge effort not to treat Riley differently from the others and, in my heart, he\u0027s my son — but I felt he\u0027d crossed a boundary and that Shelley wasn\u0027t doing enough to discipline him.\u0027However, conventional forms of chastisement do not work with Riley. He doesn\u0027t respond to sanctions, restraint or withdrawal of privileges.  Shelley with Mikey (20 months) and daughters Brooke age six, Skyla age four, as well as son Riley, aged eightThe pressures on the family are immense and relentless. For the past 18 months, neither Shelley nor Max has worked, as it is a full-time job for both of them to look after the children.\u0027I don\u0027t like Riley sometimes, but I never stop loving him,\u0027 says Shelley. And she fears for him, too. Her elder son is heart-breakingly self-aware, acutely conscious that his brain is differently wired from most people\u0027s — and it causes him intense pain.\u0027It makes me so sad,\u0027 says Shelley. \u0027Sometimes, he\u0027ll say: \u0027I\u0027m an ugly, stupid boy,\u0027 and punch himself in the face and not seem to feel it.\u0027He gets upset about his behaviour and sobs. He says: \u0027Why do I have to have a brain like this?\u0027\u0027We\u0027ve always told him he has a \u0027special\u0027 brain. We\u0027ve built a story round it and told him not to be so hard on himself. We\u0027ve explained that he isn\u0027t \u0027bad\u0027. His brain just works differently.\u0027But Shelley worries about his future. Although he attends a mainstream junior school now, she knows he will need to go to a secondary school that caters for his special needs. What will happen in the future?She says: \u0027I have really down days sometimes, thinking: \u0027Is he going to cope? Where is his life leading? Will he ever have a relationship?\u0027\u0027My nan and granddad used to say: \u0027He\u0027ll grow out of it,\u0027 but, of course, he won\u0027t. Sometimes, he says he wishes he was dead — and that is the most painful thing for a mother to hear.\u0027Max adds: \u0027He says he doesn\u0027t know how to earn money or buy food and, even at his age, it worries him. Sometimes, he cries and says: \u0027What will I do when I\u0027m older?\u0027 But we tell him we\u0027ll always be here, that he can stay with us.\u0027          Riley once held his sister\u0027s head down in the bath and told his mum he was teaching her to breathe under waterOne glimmer of hope buoys them. When Shelley\u0027s sister, Jade, brought her border collie, Keiko, to stay with the family for a week, Riley was thrilled to be entrusted with the task of caring for the dog.\u0027His job was to get Keiko\u0027s food and water and he loved the procedure, the routine and the responsibility,\u0027 recalls Shelley.\u0027He precisely weighed out the food and he liked the fact that the dog gave him full-on attention.\u0027She loves chasing a ball — she never tires of it — and Riley spent hours outside throwing the ball for her to catch. He loved that she\u0027d sit when he asked her to and give him her paw. She slept on the floor in his bedroom and, all week, he didn\u0027t have a meltdown. It was as if the whole house gave a sigh of relief.\u0027\u0027That\u0027s what Riley needs. A dog,\u0027 Shelley said to Max after Keiko had gone back home.So she searched the internet and discovered Autism Life Dogs, a charity providing specially trained dogs for autistic people.          Shelley wants to try and raise enough money to buy a companion dog for her son who cries about being different to the other childrenSuch a dog costs £8,500, beyond the slender means of the family, so they are raising money for one.The dogs sense anxiety, hesitation, fear — all possible precursors to a meltdown — and signal before it happens. They are also wonderful companions.At present, Shelley and Max dare not let Riley out of their sight. \u0027He would run into the road chasing a ball without thinking about the traffic,\u0027 says Shelley. \u0027And he wouldn\u0027t realise the danger of getting into a car with a stranger.\u0027With a dog at his side, however, he could take the first small steps towards independence. \u0027A dog wouldn\u0027t just change Riley\u0027s life,\u0027 says Shelley. \u0027It could save it, too.\u0027 Shelley\u0027s JustGiving page can be found here.Crowdfunding to Fund an Autism Life Dog for my son.

Literally, I forgot entirely that they existed, which is one of the perils of a big chain … the left hand sometimes doesn’t know what the right hand is doing,” Daunt told the .“We will also need to work with them to ensure that we do not do anything predatory or anything that imperils them at all.”The U-turn was hailed as a “small victory” by Julie Danskin, the manager of Golden Hare Books, who said it was clear that the community had not responded well to the news.“We are very glad that James Daunt and Waterstones have done the decent thing. In future, though, one other thing that Waterstones can do is really dial down the discount offers on books because it does hit us in a way that does not need to happen.”Daunt said that the rollout of the unbranded stores – which began in 2014 with the opening of Southwold Books – would continue, although there would always be a clear role for its larger branches. The idea was to put “good people” in charge and encourage them to foster unbranded branches with a view to them evolving into “idiosyncratic, quirky little shops of the best sort”.“The key – and one of the things I have continued to struggle with at Waterstones – is how, within the context of a chain, you get the inidual booksellers to create a distinctive shop,” said Daunt, a former banker turned career bookseller who was brought in to rescue the chain in 2011 after a buyout by the Russian billionaire Alexander Mamut.“That is difficult and it’s about breaking a culture that has been trying for years to do something different.”The company, which was sold in April to US hedge fund Elliott Advisors, made its first profit in years last year – an achievement linked to a strategy of trying to run branches like local bookshops.Daunt, an opponent of Brexit, said that he also believed that Waterstones was very much “a force for good” in the current climate, adding: “These are times when we need bookshops, as things get spiky.”Gesturing down at the shop floor of the company’s London flagship in Piccadilly, he added that while its way of operating was different from branches in largely Brexit-voting towns such as Barrow-in-Furness, it was still important to keep outlets in such places.“We need to keep a shop there, and in Middlesbrough and Sunderland,” he added. “I am someone who finds Brexit an abomination and a betrayal of everything I stand for and I think that would be true of those who work in our shops. Booksellers have always been that way, but the importance of our shops is, ironically, often the case in places that perhaps in a wider sense appear to be more hostile environment. I think, though, that something much more complicated is going on in society at the moment.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77537ab1a820b0cef480ddc3c723e2f743486af6/292_625_3271_1962/master/3271.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c986a04cd1f06d8c07512e9a0ec342d2","title":"tom wolfe a life in pictures","story":"The writer Tom Wolfe, who has died aged 88, was a great dandy, both in his elaborate dress and his neon-lit prose.

A basic requirement of being the nation’s senior central banker is an ability to avoid making crassly sexist remarks. Ben Broadbent, one of four deputy governors and thus an internal candidate for the big job, has just failed the test after describing the UK economy as “menopausal”.Broadbent’s imagery, apart from being offensive, was also strange. In his interview with the Daily , he was trying to describe a period between important technological developments. The idea is that, just as there was a slowdown in growth in the 19th century after the invention of the steam engine but before the arrival of electricity, the UK economy has felt the benefits of the internet revolution and now awaits the next big thing, with artificial intelligence being a possibility.This phenomenon could be described by using any number of easy-to-understand comparisons. Waiting for the next tube train? Something like that. But menopausal? It doesn’t work, even if one is deaf to the offence caused by the implication that the menopause equates to a loss of productivity.They take public communication and reputation seriously at the Bank of England these days, as they should. One strand in governor Mark Carney’s “One Mission One Bank” modernisation programme is to open the doors of Threadneedle Street to counter the caricature of policy wonks inhabiting a world of their own. Another is to ensure more women occupy senior roles since the Bank compares poorly to the civil service on that measure. Broadbent’s comment, to put it mildly, won’t help either effort.He’s apologised quickly and straightforwardly, so his job is almost certainly safe. But the fact remains that any serious candidate for the governor of the Bank has to be trusted to conduct a newspaper interview safely. Remember, they practise for these occasions.Carney, who will depart at the end of June next year, currently stands accused of baffling everybody by giving mixed messages about the timing of rises in interest rates. But he’s never had to apologise for causing offence."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0713b6f7fea974b28b6462fe94de82a38c872815/971_872_3925_2355/master/3925.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=144e6ca6d7ac46d61c4999496e7f8140","title":"welcome cycle heaven moved family netherlands houten utrecht","story":"When Kylie van Dam went in search of a cycle-friendly city she found the almost car-free suburb of Houten. It’s a model more cities could copy, she writesBefore I’m out of bed, our 15-year-old slams the door and jumps on her bike, heading for school and meeting friends along the way.Last week, our eight and 13-year-olds attended four parties between them. They scoffed the obligatory birthday sugar, went bowling, shot lasers, played mini-golf and patted sheep – travelling to and from all of these activities by bike. There wasn’t a helmet or scrap of hi-vis between them. This is daily life in Houten, a suburb of Utrecht in the Netherlands. Spend any time here and you’ll soon see hordes of kids riding their bikes to gym lessons, parties, after-school care or sports activities through wind, rain or shine. One of my favourite Dutch expressions is “Jij bent niet van suiker gamaakt” (“You’re not made of sugar”), meaning you won’t dissolve in the rain – so get on your bike.This lifestyle drew us to the Netherlands from Britain. After 15 years of dreaming – via Sydney, London and Norwich – we went in search of a more cycle-friendly city.Now we’re Houtenaars, citizens of a world-renowned cycling suburb studied by future town planners around the globe. Houten has been on the map since Roman times, but modern development began in the late 1960s as an overspill for fast-growing Utrecht.Architect Rob Derks designed Houten to prioritise pedestrians and cyclists over motorists. A ring road circles the suburb, and residential districts within are only accessible to cars through these roads on the edge of town. Instead, there is an extensive network of paths and cycle lanes connecting these areas. Sharp bends and low speed limits mean roads are intentionally difficult to navigate by motor vehicle: in Houten, cars are slightly unwelcome guests. Unlike drivers, cyclists and walkers can travel direct, making a two-minute walk or ride a 10-minute trip by car, for example.Residents do own cars – although rarely more than one, and some prefer to use a car-share company. Children ride bikes as soon as they can walk, people with disabilities move freely and independently, elderly people cycle everywhere and if they start to feel unsafe on two wheels, they swap them for three. Immigrants who’ve never had a bicycle are taught to ride.Every now and again we get a strange sense of guilt about loving this perfectly planned life. We watch visitors’ first anxious sense that they’ve fallen into the Truman Show quickly disappear as they realise just how upside-down their perception of a “normal” city is.Here, good public space and architecture is for everyone. There’s a large amount of social housing in Houten but you’d be hard-pressed to pick it out because there’s little written into these buildings to declare who has money and who doesn’t. The shared architecture and wonderful functionality frees people to be who they are. Far from being claustrophobic, it’s liberating.My family were lucky – we had the Dutch passport my father-in-law handed down to his Australian-born children when his own family left post-war Holland. Our daughters were old enough to know what they were leaving behind in Norwich. They may have hated us the day we dropped them into a local Dutch school with no language, but they survived. They missed their friends at first but now they love their independence, the clean air and Houten’s close community. On visits to family in London and Australia, all three kids are astounded at how much time they have to spend in the car, how noisy everything is and how dependent children are on their parents.Not everyone has the chance to make the choices we did. But none of what Houten stands for is radical or alternative. This Dutch city’s choice to move away from the car, to clear the air, to invest in healthy iniduals, is not an unreachable ideal.Houten is the future many of us trapped in car-focused societies dream of, but it’s happening here and now. Nothing is stopping other cities from making the same decisions.

He wound up at Harmondsworth immigration detention centre, where he began a three-month hunger strike. He lost vision in both eyes, experienced chest pain and shortness of breath, and eventually became too weak to sit up unaided. At the time I thought he would die alone on a mattress on the floor of his cell. In the end, he was flown to Lagos by the British government and I never heard from him again. He told me: “I have never committed any crimes nothing like this has ever happened to me before.”A recent YouGov poll showed that the British public is mostly in favour of the “hostile environment” policies for immigrants, categorised as the requirement to show documents before accessing a GP, accepting a job, renting property or opening a bank account. Do the public also realise that Muazu’s experience is also a consequence of the hostile environment? That we lock up innocent people for indefinite periods of time and treat them worse than animals in a zoo?Only today, distressing footage emerged of Zixuan Qu, a woman who was encouraged by a British college to come here and study, being raided by six immigration officers. Qu has been waiting for the Home Office to sort her visa and has tried several ways of speeding up the process. In our names, her house was raided at 5am, and she was threatened with removal from the home she shares with her fiance.This is why Diane Abbott’s announcement that Labour will end the hostile environment is so welcome: the grotesque mix of incompetence and cruelty from the Home Office has led to the most abject and degrading treatment of migrants, ostensibly for the benefit of British people. Finally, Labour would close the detention centres that have been a stain on the national conscience for so long, rightfully recognising that people often come to this country seeking asylum because they are escaping war, violence or abuse. Labour would redirect the funds used to run detention centres to the services these asylum seekers desperately need.But the announcement should also come with political awareness. When 10 countries – including Poland, Hungary, Latvia and Lithuania – joined the EU in 2004, the Labour government made little attempt to engage with the public about what the effects might be. As a result, that vacuum was filled by the rightwing press, which responded to the change in the most aggressively xenophobic way possible.Lessons must be learned from that, and now Labour – with the support of civil society – needs to join the dots for the public about what the reality of UK immigration policy has been.Alongside this announcement should come a drive to reverse the frankly rabid rhetoric that habitually accompanies debates about immigration in this country. We can’t pretend descriptions of migrants as “swarms” and “cockroaches” have not set the tone on immigration, and will not have influenced the public in terms of what kinds of attitudes and behaviours are deemed permissible. This kind of rhetoric must be confronted head-on wherever possible, by all of us who want a more humane country. Labour’s announcement is fantastic, but the hostile environment extends further than policy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e43a0ed2bb317bcdacb7247e73b08c90e9af482c/0_104_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9f3f36ef35a3cfdb66ee6b0e4be6dfbe","title":"what have the royals done for the arts meghan markle prince harry wedding","story":"From the RSC to the ROH, Britain’s most prestigious arts institutions are all by royal appointment. But as Prince Harry marries Meghan Markle, is it goodbye Royal Variety Show and hello Royal Reprezent FM?The marriage of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle means many things to many people, but, while loyalists are bagging their picnic spots and unpacking the union-jack party plates, some hard-pressed arts organisations will be taking a longer view.Once the party is over, reality strikes: a royal wedding means the admittance of a new member into “the firm” – and for them, a lifetime of public patronage. It has already been announced that Markle will become a partner in the Royal Foundation, set up by Princes William and Harry in 2009 as an umbrella for a clutch of charities. Besides youth work, the foundation’s portfolio is dominated by the princes’ preoccupations with the armed forces and conservation, while the charities that will be picked for Markle’s inidual support will – in Palace parlance – “reflect Miss Markle’s own interests”.The National Portrait Gallery and the art therapy organisation, Art Room, were among the first four charities to be chosen for her future sister-in-law, Kate. A clue as to where Markle’s interests might lead her – as a cosmopolitan mixed-race TV actor, with avowedly feminist views – lies in the couple’s second official engagement in January. It took them (on their own request) to the “youth-led” radio station Reprezent FM, in Brixton, south London, which is credited with launching the careers of a galaxy of DJs and grime stars, including this year’s Brit award-winner Stormzy.But what does royal patronage actually mean for the arts? For Reprezent, which was saved from closure three years ago by a crowd-funding appeal, even a one-off visit has been an overwhelming experience. “To be honest, we’re hunkered down. We’ve been inundated with requests, and there’s been a three-line whip across the board not to talk to the press about anything at all,” said their phone operator.Over the next four years, the specialist graduate college – whose alumni include Sylvia Pankhurst, Ian Dury, David Hockney and Tracey Emin – will expand to a new campus in Battersea and increase its student numbers from 1,900 to 3,000. It already recruits from 74 countries and the rapid growth both in numbers and costs will increasingly involve looking overseas, where the word “royal” is an invaluable calling card.“The royal connection has always been hugely beneficial when being seen on the international stage,” said a spokeswoman, “so we are no different from other great institutions such as the Royal College of Music, Royal Academy of Music, Rada, Royal Opera House or Royal Shakespeare Company.” As Andy Hillier, editor of the charity sector magazine Third Sector, points out, the two great advantages of a royal association are publicity and trust. “For smaller organisations, the biggest advantage is publicity because it can be very difficult to draw attention to yourself. For larger organisations, the publicity benefit might not be so obvious unless you’re staging a big event, but trust is a big issue at the moment, and if you have a royal patron there is an assumption that there’s a royal stamp of approval and that you will have been thoroughly vetted.”The twists and turns of royal support are as bewildering as the Hampton Court maze. Presidencies and patronships come with varying, and not always consistent, levels of commitment. As a “royal visitor” Prince Charles is unlikely to visit the RCA much, though it hopes to profit from a hook-up with the Royal Drawing School, which he co-founded in 2000 as the Prince’s Drawing School, but which only went on to earn its “Royal” appellation in 2014. The announcement of this upgrade, by an institution that could be seen as the result of a hobbyist’s anachronistic obsession with “observational drawing”, is revealing: “With this name change, the Royal Drawing School joins the Royal Academy (1768), the Royal College of Music (1882), the Royal College of Art (1896) the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (1920) and the Royal Ballet School (1956), as a member of the small circle of prestigious, world-renowned arts education institutions to bear the Royal title. It is the first such institution to be granted the name since the Royal Ballet School, which received its title in 1956 – the fourth year of the reign of HM Queen Elizabeth II.”The Royal College of Art’s headquarters – along with the Royal College of Music – are in an area of London once known as Albertopolis, in memory of the royal spouse who played a bigger role than others in the development of the UK’s enduring cultural capital.Prince Albert was the driving force behind the Great Exhibition, staged in a custom-built Crystal Palace in Hyde Park in 1851 with the not inconsiderable ambition, according to Queen Victoria, “to promote among nations the cultivation of all those arts which are fostered by peace, and which in their turn contribute to maintain the peace of the world”.Despite the disapproval of critics including Karl Marx, who deplored it as an “emblem of the capitalist fetishism of commodities”, the self-financing extravaganza, which is said to have been visited by six million people, turned in a profit big enough to buy a swath of land in South Kensington for a new cultural quarter that would include the three great national museums on Exhibition Road and the Royal Albert Hall.It’s a mark of the decline of royal power that, while Albert could influence the shape of a city, Prince Charles has had to content himself with a model village, incarnating his ardent architectural philosophy in the Beatrix Potter cottages and Disneyland castles of Poundbury, a new town that was planned and developed at his command on 400 acres of Dorset land from 1989.But, though the capacities of this century’s royal patrons might be reduced, their credibility has greatly improved since the late 1980s, when National Theatre director Richard Eyre fought a valiant rearguard action against being landed with a royal charter. “The ‘Royal National’ nonsense has burst like a fat blister,” he wrote in his diary in June 1988. “I haven’t yet had to publicly defend it, and am not looking forward to having to lie in public … Neal Ascherson writes to me that ‘everyone is looking to you to stop this royal nonsense’.”Thirty years on, Ascherson – a leading Scottish author and academic – feels just as strongly. “I’m not a fanatical anti-monarchist,” he says. “What I fancy is a country with republican institutions which, if people wanted, could have an ornamental bobble-king on top, like the royal republic of Norway.” Ironically, given her propaganda wars with “the firm”, the change in public opinion was partly due to Princess Diana’s touchy-feely support of charities working in previously stigmatised fields such as support for people with Aids and leprosy. Hillier points out that the younger generation have continued that tradition by extending royal patronage into mental health, “which is not an area the royal family has supported in the past”. He cites their support for the Heads Together campaign – encouraging people to be more open about mental illness – which involves a partnership with existing charities to challenge this social taboo. In today’s celebrity culture, part of their value is their ability to pull in showbiz stars – as Prince William did for Heads Together with Lady Gaga last year. Their four-minute Facetime chat, filmed in Kensington Palace and Lady Gaga’s Hollywood kitchen, was part of a series of celebrity heart-to-hearts that are now on YouTube.But to what extent do these enthusiasms extend beyond celebrity to the arts themselves? Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, has concentrated on reading charities, with patronages including the National Literacy Trust and Book Trust. At the more glitzy end she’s become a regular at the Man Booker prize dinner, and will be hosting its 50th anniversary celebrations in July with a champagne reception at Buckingham Palace. Prince Charles – who has never sold himself as a great reader, though he’s known to love a spot of Shakespeare – discreetly backs (and personally attends) the Boswell book festival in the Scottish countryside. The boutique fiesta of biography and memoir takes place in Dumfries House – a Palladian mansion in Ayrshire that he rescued and restored, and which recently joined his School of Traditional Arts as part of the Prince’s Foundation.Prince Charles has never been one for public displays of emotion, but it won’t have escaped fans of Markle’s best-known TV role – paralegal Rachel in the series Suits – that one of her strongest suits is a capacity to emote to order. Social deprivation is likely to feature in her charity choices, with the arts as enablers. While Dumfries House is at the Chippendale end of royal patronages, it’s a fair bet that Markle’s furnishings will be more street than five-star suite.

He performed on five nights in the past week at the Comedy Cellar in Manhattan, always appearing as a surprise guest.In January, the website babe.net published a piece by a woman who had been on a date with Ansari and said she felt pressured by the comedian into sexual activity. The piece sparked widespread debate about sexual misconduct and how bad dating experiences fit into the #MeToo movement. Since then, Ansari has kept a low profile, avoiding social media and public appearances.The shows at the Comedy Cellar are likely to be seen as a testing ground for a wider comeback. Shows at the venue are not generally recorded, and are often seen as a place for acts to try out material away from critics, but some who saw the show have been telling us about Ansari’s return.The comedian Sam Morril was supposed to be performing on one of the nights but got bumped for Aziz, joking on Twitter: “Just got bumped by Aziz at the Cellar. It’s legal but he ruins nights!”He said the set went down very well. “He got a lot of love from the crowd and was killing. Even babe.net would’ve published that it was a lovely night.”We wondered if Morril, who has a Comedy Central special airing in September, was genuinely upset that he got bumped for Ansari, but he says his tweet was just a joke about how comics get jaded over time. “When you’re brand new, you’re like, ‘Oh my God, Chappelle!’ Then after a few years you’re like, ‘Oh ... well, there goes my night.’ But Aziz didn’t do long. Plus, it’s great for the club because big acts like Aziz are one of the reasons why the Cellar is always packed with comedy fans.”Most audiences seem to have responded to Ansari with enthusiasm. Candy Hernandez said when Ansari got on stage, “everyone seemed to be genuinely excited to see him there. It was as if they had forgotten about babe.net”.Colton Jordan saw Aziz on a different night, when Tracy Morgan had already performed as a surprise guest. He said “the room exploded” when Ansari came on stage. “His set was great but it was obvious that he was more interested in trying stuff out and than delivering a super tight set. Sometimes there were pauses as he mumbled into the mic and scanned the pages of his notebook.”Jordan says Ansari made no reference to the allegations made against him, directly or indirectly. That seems supported by most social media posts about the sets. But on the night Hernandez went, she said, she felt there were some oblique references. “He started talking about his outrage fatigue, people protesting businesses because of a few racist employees, and all of the fake outrage on Twitter,” she says. “It seemed as if he was subtly speaking about his experience with the sexual misconduct allegations.”She said that set wasn’t particularly funny. “The other comedians really brought some of their best jokes, but my friends and I felt like Aziz was the least funny one of them all. There were lots of tourists there, though, so perhaps that may have contributed to his quick acceptance.

On lazy, hazy summer Sundays, stretches of the Sir John A Macdonald Parkway are closed to traffic and become a pedestrian haven. Why not join the dog walkers and bicyclists, in-line skaters and joggers alongside the beaches and rapids of the Ottawa river? You can paddle the rivers that frame the city – the Ottawa, Gatineau or Rideau – or enjoy the wildlife in urban parks or the much-loved Greenbelt, around 20,000 hectares (around 49,500 acres) of farms, forests and wetlands that surrounds the capital. In May, admire the rich colours of the Canadian Tulip Festival it’s the world’s largest, with over a million orange, red and yellow flowers.In winter, locals descend en masse to skate on Ottawa’s central Rideau canal. The world’s largest naturally frozen ice-skating route is home to a hardy crowd who chow down on Beavertails (that’s a pastry, not an animal’s tail), pull on cosy clothes and toques (wool hats), and glide along for nearly 5 miles (around 7.8 km). For three weekends in February, the Winterlude festival brings ice sculptures, foodie events and a children’s Snowflake Kingdom.Thanks to it’s historical significance, Ottawa is not short of imposing buildings. Admire the vaulting neo-gothic spires of Parliament Hill, the crystal tower of the National Gallery of Canada and, just across the river in the twin city of Gatineau, the Canadian Museum of History, the design of which is inspired by Canada’s topography.The Hill is also the centre point for Canada Day, Canada’s birthday celebrations every 1 July. Expect to find a stage showcasing Canadian musicians, followed by fireworks at night. Watch from the Hill or behind the Fairmont Château Laurier, the historic “castle”, opened as a grand hotel in 1912. Parliament’s central Peace Tower is perfect for a bird’s-eye panorama of the city visit on Wednesdays at noon in summer for free yoga sessions in front of parliament on the lawn. Keep your eyes peeled: you might just see prime minister Justin Trudeau and his wife Sophie Grégoire Trudeau joining in.There’s a vibrant restaurant scene in Ottowa. Explore the eclectic cuisine of Canadian Culinary Champion Marc Lepine, the only chef to win the Gold Medal Plates competition twice, at his restaurant Atelier or the innovative Middle Eastern fare of Walid El-Tawel at Fairouz.City neighbourhoods are equally exciting and eminently walkable. ByWard Market is arguably the most vibrant, with more than 120 places to eat and drink in a four-block-by-four-block patch that’s also home to a great selection of shops. Also try Westboro and the Glebe, where you’ll find Lansdowne, a complex with a year-round farmers’ market and a new stadium where you can catch sports events downtown. Ottawa’s museum and gallery scene reflects Canadians’ past and future hopes. Gatineau’s Canadian Museum of History’s Grand Hall with its towering totem poles captures the lasting presence of indigenous cultures, while the museum’s new Canadian History Hall presents the largest and most comprehensive exhibition about Canadian history ever created. In contrast, quirky Bytown Museum reveals the history of Ottawa . Here you can discover the military raison d’être of the Rideau canal – a Unesco world heritage site – as you learn about its construction after the British colony’s war of 1812 with the US.

The company paid £100m in 2017 for curtailment. This year payments are already down by two-thirds.Emma Pinchbeck, the executive director at industry group RenewableUK, said: “It is great news for everyone that rather than turning turbines off to manage our ageing grid, the new cable instead will make best use of wind energy.”Mary Creagh, Labour MP and chair of the environmental audit committee, said: “Billions of pounds of investment is needed in clean energy, transport, heating and industry to meet our carbon targets. But a dramatic fall in investment is threatening the government’s ability to meet legally binding climate change targets.”Separately, the spending watchdog concluded that £23bn spent on a government subsidy scheme for low-carbon heating had been poor value for money and did not deliver its aims. The public accounts committee said the renewable heat incentive had “wildly optimistic” goals and that the government failed to understand what consumers wanted."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b384ffd30acbb20db9a8950c6efca36ddef19267/0_0_5888_3925/master/5888.jpg?w=480\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6003ae1c524d3bc60f4d80ff1b3efa55 480w","title":"romance was born collections that landed the australian label a paris couture show in pictures","story":"As the Australian fashion label launched its latest collection at Australian fashion week, designers Anna Plunkett and Luke Sales announced they have been invited to show during the Paris couture collections in July 2018 – a high honour in the fashion world.

They have produced some stunning free-flowing attacking football but that was not on display on this occasion. Instead, the Blues showed the grit of champions as they ground out a 2-0 win with what the striker Fran Kirby, who provided the assist for Jonna Andersson’s goal, described as an “average” performance.One person absent from the touchline and the celebrations, yet overwhelmingly responsible for the team’s success, was Emma Hayes. Rather than shouting and leaping from her seat in the dugout, as is often the case, the Chelsea manager watched her team clinch their second double, her double double if you like, from her sofa at home, with an altogether different double on her mind: the imminent arrival of twins. Hayes is 35 weeks’ pregnant and this season she has juggled Chelsea’s phenomenal campaign with the emotional and physical demands of pregnancy.It is an incredible feat and has put the 41-year-old in a bigger spotlight. Yet her management, recruitment and development of players deserve the spotlight on their own.Hayes joined Chelsea in 2012, replacing Matt Beard, who moved to Liverpool. She had gained managerial experience in the US, having been assistant manager at a then all-conquering Arsenal, and she swiftly set about building the team she wanted to lead.Two years into her Chelsea project her side narrowly missed out on the WSL1 title – on the last day of the season to Beard’s Liverpool – and a squad overhaul, which included winning the race for Kirby’s signature for a British record fee, put Chelsea on firm footing for 2015.That year, Chelsea won their first double. An FA Cup final victory over Notts County – the first time Wembley hosted the final – was followed by an emphatic 4-0 win at home to Sunderland to seal the league.It confirmed what Hayes is good at: analysing the strengths and weaknesses of her players, finding ways to pull more out of them than they might have thought possible, and working out how to take her team to the next level.It is what she has done this season too. The arrival of Manchester City on the women’s football scene offered a different challenge and they toppled Chelsea from their perch in 2016, Nick Cushing’s side winning the league by five points. But whereas City have failed to build on that, and have ended a promising season without a trophy, Hayes has reconstructed her side, again, into one of the world’s best despite an ever-improving field around her.Hayes’s ability to sign players who dramatically improve her squad is enviable and it is hard to see where she has put a foot wrong. After City’s title win Hayes brought in Ramona Bachmann from Wolfsburg and the Swiss forward has shone alongside Kirby and Ji So-yun up front, her two goals in this year’s FA Cup final the icing on the cake.Deanna Cooper arrived from London Bees at a similar time and was a mainstay in the Chelsea defence as they won the Spring Series (the mini-season designed to bridge the gap between the old summer league and new winter one). A cruciate ligament injury ruled her out for most of this WSL season but she returned in Chelsea’s last home game.Hayes, recognising defensive weakness before the campaign, brought in Sweden’s Magdalena Eriksson and Norway’s Maria Thorisdottir and, in January, Andersson – who has scored four goals in her nine appearances – and Anita Asante. All when called upon have stepped up to the plate.Despite injuries and a fixture pile-up that has come from the winter switch, Hayes has built a squad capable of being rotated to excellent effect. It is well balanced, with experience and youth gelled, and she has a remarkable likability that makes players want to run through walls for her.Having lifted Chelsea from five points behind City in 2016 to nine points clear with a game to play, Hayes means business. Next on the hit list is the elusive Champions League and expanding on her five major trophies in west London. If history is anything to go by, she is the manager capable of doing it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5805fbda48452561ae9c082f3824c642149ea148/421_221_4574_2744/master/4574.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=933148a9462da073c531b6ffaa00c81b","title":"david moyes leaves west ham","story":"David Moyes has left West Ham after the club decided against extending his contract. The former Everton and Manchester United manager was appointed to replace Slaven Bilic in November on a six-month deal and guided them to a 13th-place finish, having taken over with the team in the relegation zone.West Ham’s owners, David Sullivan and David Gold, had initially indicated that would be enough to earn Moyes a two-year extension but the Scot was informed in a meeting on Wednesday that his contract would not be renewed. The move comes after Sam Allardyce, a former West Ham manager, was also sacked by Everton.West Ham said they hope to appoint a “high-calibre” successor within the next 10 days and have previously expressed an interest in Shakhtar Donetsk’s Paulo Fonseca and Rafael Benítez, who might prove too expensive to prise away from Newcastle. They have held informal talks with Manuel Pellegrini, although the former Manchester City manager has also been heavily linked with Sevilla.Other options include Burnley’s Sean Dyche, Huddersfield’s David Wagner and Marco Silva, the former Hull and Watford manager. Their preference is to hire a manager who has worked in the Premier League, despite their interest in Fonseca.Sullivan said: “I would like to place on record my sincere thanks to David Moyes and his staff for achieving the target of keeping West Ham United in the Premier League.”The announcement arrived barely 12 hours after Gold said he hoped the 55-year-old former Manchester United and Everton manager would remain in charge for next season. Moyes’ assistants Alan Irvine, Stuart Pearce and Billy McKinlay have also departed.Sullivan added: “Throughout his time here, David has carried himself with dignity and honesty and we have all found him to be a pleasure to work with. He, Alan, Stuart and Billy accepted the challenge and attacked it head on, turning around a difficult situation. They deserve great respect for the job they have done and they leave the club with our best wishes.“When David and his team arrived, it was the wish of both parties that the focus be only on the six months until the end of the season, at which point a decision would be made with regards to the future. Having taken stock of the situation and reflected now the campaign is complete, we feel that it is right to move in a different direction.“We are already taking steps to identify and recruit the manager we believe can take West Ham United forward in line with our ambitions. We aim to appoint a high-calibre figure who we feel will lead the club into an exciting future for our loyal supporters within the next 10 days.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/382f8e92f040b3597652274f7e28fa8a783d5589/0_128_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e033457519d6843a1c22f6aa9026d271","title":"england world cup squad russia 2018","story":"The uncapped Liverpool youngster Trent Alexander-Arnold is set to be included in Gareth Southgate’s England squad for the summer’s World Cup, with the national manager to announce his 23-man selection on Wednesday afternoon.Alexander-Arnold, who has made three appearances for the Under-21s, had been invited to train with the senior squad ahead of the friendlies against the Netherlands and Italy in March and has enjoyed an impressive season with the Champions League finalists. The 19-year-old played a key role in the eye-catching knockout victories over Manchester City and Roma, with Southgate having taken note.The right-sided defender, who can also operate in midfield, has made the most of his opportunities this term with both Nathaniel Clyne and Joe Gomez having suffered injuries, and would offer competition at wing-back. Kieran Trippier’s fitness has been under scrutiny of late after he twisted his knee in Tottenham Hotspur’s recent victory over Newcastle, which forced him out of the final day win against Leicester, while Kyle Walker was utilised at centre-half in those games in March.It remains to be see whether the youngster’s inclusion is as a result of Trippier’s injury issue but it will not affect Gary Cahill’s situation. The Chelsea defender, omitted for the games against the Dutch and Azzurri, has regained his place at club level of late and is back in the fold with the national set-up having been selected in the travelling party. With 58 caps, the 32-year-old will be the most experienced member of the squad.Southgate will confirm his selection for the finals, with the group to be one of the youngest at the tournament in Russia.

The 63-year-old had another year remaining on the 18-month contract he signed when succeeding Ronald Koeman last November and, as he obtained a deal with no break clause, he is expected to leave with a £6m pay-off. He will have made around £9m for six months’ work.The former England manager, sacked by Everton on the day he could have been announcing the country’s World Cup squad, guided the team from 13th to eighth in the Premier League following a turbulent start to the season under Koeman and then caretaker manager David Unsworth. His managerial style never endeared him to Everton supporters, however, and there was mounting hostility towards Allardyce over the final months of the season.“On behalf of the chairman, board of directors and Mr Moshiri, I’d like to thank Sam for the job he has done at Everton over the last seven months,” read a statement from the club’s soon-to-be new chief executive, Professor Denise Barrett-Baxendale. “Sam was brought in at a challenging time last season to provide us with some stability and we are grateful to him for doing that.“However, we have made the decision that, as part of our longer-term plan, we will be appointing a new manager this summer and will be commencing this process immediately. Again, we’d like to place on record our sincere thanks to Sam for his work with us over the last few months and wish him well for the future.”Moshiri’s first choice to replace Allardyce is former Hull City and Watford manager Silva, who was sacked by the Vicarage Road club in January after a dramatic downturn in results. That followed what Watford claimed was an “unwarranted approach” by Everton that impacted on the focus and results of the Portuguese coach.Watford have made an official complaint to the Premier League over Everton’s alleged illegal approach and talks over a compensation package between the two clubs have failed to reach an agreement. While Silva is out of contract and technically available to replace Allardyce immediately, the dispute over Everton’s approach complicates that process and could lead to arbitration.Everton officials are expected to reopen talks with their Watford counterparts this week in a bid to resolve the matter and make a swift appointment in Silva."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92f93433091d559f96cd85c62359ce725d9fbd28/1058_890_1574_945/master/1574.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=57c4d13a12489da45cf9c9a39e51b6ed","title":"wretched football sam allardyce everton sack","story":"It was overshadowed at the time by his tales of Romelu Lukaku and voodoo, late-night calls from Jim White and Ross Barkley’s contract demands but even now, four months on, it is staggering to recall Farhad Moshiri telling Everton’s AGM he decided to give Sam Allardyce the most important job at the club after reading the former England manager’s autobiography. No Evertonian at the Philharmonic Hall in January needed to flick through ‘Big Sam’ to confirm suspicions the latest chapter would end acrimoniously and swiftly. His was a desperate and ill-judged appointment, and his removal alone will not rectify the serious drift at Goodison Park.Allardyce exits Everton after six miserable months with his reputation as a survival specialist intact. Therein lies the failure. Everton, as the 63-year-old admitted when installed as Ronald Koeman’s replacement in November, represented the best opportunity of his club career to shatter preconceptions about his management style. He succeeded only in confirming they were legitimate. Wretched football on a weekly basis, taking responsibility for victory while abdicating it in defeat and an arrogant dismissal of supporters were not the basis for building consensus or hope for the future. Not that the Everton hierarchy have delivered on that score.Yes, Allardyce inherited a weak squad that, one year after the costliest recruitment drive in Everton’s history – costly in every sense – is in need of major reconstruction. But it was a squad clear from relegation danger by Christmas after a seven-game unbeaten start to his reign. Allardyce had five months to implement improvement in style, performance and results while showing he was invested in Everton for the long term. He did not deliver on any count. The anaemic defeat at West Ham United last Sunday, coming after the manager had given players several days off in the buildup, was a fitting farewell to an appalling season from all concerned.In fairness to those who ignored Allardyce’s unsuitability and oversaw the unpopular appointment, there was a sensible economic reason for seeking insurance when the team floundered earlier in the season. Those behind the decision were Moshiri, the director of football Steve Walsh and the directors Alexander Ryazantsev and Keith Harris, who were promoted to chief finance and commercial officer and deputy chairman respectively on Tuesday.Everton’s unexpected regression on the pitch coincided with the club negotiating with Liverpool city council and global financial institutions for the £500m required to build a new stadium at Bramley Moore dock. The strength of Everton’s case to lenders is based, in part, on being a safe Premier League concern that has been ever-present in the top flight since 1954. This was not the season to demonstrate the fragility of that proud record by even flirting with relegation. Progress has been slow on the project that will define Moshiri’s legacy, however, when it could have strengthened the case for Allardyce’s appointment in the short term. The council is yet to sign off a proposed £280m loan that could generate a profit of £7m a year in interest for the austerity-battered authority over 25 years.Allardyce’s detractors have argued Everton were never seriously in peril and his claim to have inherited “chaos” from a caretaker manager in David Unsworth who was “struggling to cope” was part of a self-serving PR strategy. There is an element of truth to both sides. Everton were 13th but only five points above the relegation zone following Unsworth’s final game in charge, a 4-0 victory over West Ham that Allardyce shamelessly claimed as his own. That and many other erroneous boasts fuelled supporters’ antagonism as much as football devoid of joy or entertainment.One undeniable statistic favoured by the former Everton manager pinpointed his impact. Everton conceded an alarming 27 goals in the 10 games before Allardyce’s arrival (he would insist nine games on account of West Ham) but the same amount over the next 20. Defensive organisation apart, his average points return over 24 Premier League matches was almost identical to Unsworth’s over five – 1.41 per game compared with 1.4 under the club’s under-23s manager. And there was not one impressive performance among them. His tenure will be remembered instead, if at all, for attempting to bring on a defensive midfielder, Morgan Schneiderlin, at 0-0 against Watford, only to summon a striker when Troy Deeney scored the winner for being content with a point at Swansea City for having the second-lowest number of shots on target in the Premier League season and a style of play that one rival manager branded “Conference football” following a game at Goodison.Allardyce talked frequently of planning for next season but never convinced anyone that Everton was anything other than one brief, lucrative and possibly final job. He was up against it from the start in that respect. Moshiri initially offered him a six-month contract having been unable to prise Marco Silva from Watford. It took five weeks, culminating in a 5-1 home defeat by Atalanta and a 4-1 loss at Southampton in the space of four calamitous days, before the major shareholder bowed to Allardyce’s demands for an 18-month deal without a break clause. The manager would become a magnet for disenchantment among supporters fed mediocrity under Bill Kenwright’s ownership and now a lack of vision on the pitch under Moshiri. But Allardyce was emblematic of a deeper malaise at Everton, one the club’s board have to correct this summer.The club exposed its former manager to ridicule with the survey that asked club members to rate his performance on a scale of zero to 10. It may have been a wide-ranging survey, it may have been a repeat of last year’s exercise under Koeman, but its publication this year, when Allardyce was regularly being told where to go during away games, reflected the leadership vacuum in a business getting the small details wrong.Monaco-based Moshiri is expected to acquire a majority stake in Everton soon and can ill-afford his third managerial failure with the team regressing from the top six and the stadium vision yet to take shape. The rate of change occurring at Goodison is recognition of the need for improvement. A new director of football, or similar title, is expected, with PSV Eindhoven’s technical director Marcel Brands likely to arrive. Walsh is understood to have been offered a scouting role having presided over a disastrous recruitment policy. The deputy chief executive, Denise Barrett-Baxendale, has been confirmed as Robert Elstone’s replacement with the chief executive heading to Super League after 13 years. The growing influence of Harris and Ryazantsev behind the scenes was also recognised in Tuesday’s executive restructure.That leaves the not insignificant matters of a stadium finance deal and a fourth management team in eight months to be resolved. Everton are relieved of Allardyce but in many respects are also back to square one."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0569988e45e9ec3c562f4b2e2f632f8f078ffcc3/0_35_720_432/master/720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=38cc09dc30a1b3486ab7abf41b6b286f","title":"children were dying of hunger ecuador poor erika arteaga cruz podcast","story":"Medic turned health activist Dr Erika Arteaga-Cruz has vowed to remedy the country’s poor record on treatment for communities in dire needDr Erika Arteaga-Cruz left her work in an Ecuadorean hospital to become a health campaigner, trying to get medication and treatment to the country’s indigenous communities. ‘We took a huge range of medicines, but what they really needed was food.’ Arteaga-Cruz talks to Lucy Lamble about her work improving the living standards of the most vulnerable people in society.

We need to admit that the problem is real. Most universities, in line with other sectors, have action plans and training programmes in place, but the figures show that whatever it is we are doing – or think we are doing – is not working. I know from my own experience that culture change is hard and takes time, but we cannot afford to carry on letting down future generations of BAME students, academics and staff. Achieving race equality is not an add-on. It must be a key part of our agenda going forward.Leaders in higher education today are busy navigating their way through a complex set of policy changes. We are dealing with the transition to the new Office for Students the impact of leaving the EU on student recruitment, staff retention, collaboration and research new measures to assess teaching quality a framework to score knowledge transfer and a review of HE funding and the impact of government anti-terrorism legislation. But amid the backdrop of these changes, where does the challenge of addressing BAME representation sit? What priority does it have? Is racial equality in universities seen as a fundamental business, ethical and moral necessity – or just as a nice-to-have? For me it has to be part of the core of what we do.In Britain we find it hard to talk about race and the impact that racism has on all of us. That’s because the conversation often immediately leaps into the territory of whether iniduals are racist – and it degenerates from there. Socially and institutionally we find it hard to acknowledge the historical legacy and the insidious, invidious impact of racism because it quickly descends into a blame game. As a black person I know how hard it is to explain the pernicious and debilitating impact of day-to-day racism. Many of us don’t talk about it but that doesn’t mean it‘s not there. We all experience and deal with it differently. We need to find a way to open up conversation and discussion about difficult, contentious and controversial issues.I am proud of the way Soas students and staff have engaged in conversations around decolonising knowledge. It is not an easy agenda to grapple with as we see from the derogatory headlines which sometimes follow this work. But it’s crucial that we do. For too long, knowledge, experience and expertise have been seen through a narrow lens. Yet knowledge is all about pushing the boundaries. The best scholarship reflects the range of experiences of people inside and outside of the UK.The term “decolonising knowledge” has provoked intellectual interest and curiosity as well as outrage. That’s partly because we find it uncomfortable to look deep into our national psyche and identity, questioning versions of our history. But the deep-seated and structural nature of race inequality needs to be tackled at a societal, institutional as well as inidual level. It’s about culture and relationships as well as about policy and process. The important thing is to have the debate, and though we won’t all agree, I see that as a good thing.There are deep-seated prejudices and stereotypes which need to be overcome. University leaders need to acknowledge that we are not doing enough. The UK has some of the best universities in the world – but what is the point of that if we are not offering real equality of opportunity?Join the higher education network for more comment, analysis and job opportunities, direct to your inbox.

We’ve met exactly once, through Skype. Inside the package is a gift I’m really hoping they like. At the very least, I hope it doesn’t explode in transit. That sounds a hell of a lot scarier than it actually is – I just really want this parcel to make it to its destination. And there’s a decent chance it might not, because inside all the bubble wrap are two bottles of Hal’s New York Limited Edition Coffee Seltzer.For people like us, seltzer is way more than just a beverage.I am now the sort of person who knows about things like limited-edition coffee seltzer, because I have become a member of a somewhat-secret seltzer society called “Now Fizzing”. (My entry is granted after I track down members on Twitter and share my seltzer-loving truth.) It’s a closed Facebook group that’s been around since 21 November 2014, and it’s composed of more than 3,100 members from around the world. Within the group, its members offer and ask for tips on where to find sought-after flavors and brands (the Polar seltzer’s seasonal flavors are always a huge hit – right now, everyone is on the hunt for its Blood Orange Lemonade, Starfruit Lemonade and Strawberry Lemonade Seltzer’ade flavors), share selfies and videos of themselves trying new kinds of seltzer for the first time (called “seltzies” and “fizzeos”, respectively), and discuss other aspects of their lives through the lens of the drink that has brought them all together.There’s a two-year-old “star” of Now Fizzing, the daughter of a member who is being filmed doing a March Madness–style seltzer taste test. The group even has its own lexicon: seltzer is “fizz”, unflavored varieties are “ghosts” and other clear sweetened beverages that are simply masquerading as seltzer are called “snakes”.Now Fizzing was launched about a year before seltzer became the “it” drink that it is today. There has already been much ink spilled over the beverage’s meteoric rise, but to this day, even the makers of seltzer find themselves stunned and confused by the sudden trendiness of their product. Chris Taylor, senior vice-president of Boylan Bottling Co and a member of Now Fizzing, chalks up seltzer’s trendiness to all the innovation going on within the space, paired with the drink’s positioning as a healthy alternative to juice or soda. Say what you will about the seltzer craze that has swept the nation, tweet your vitriolic La Croix memes, or lambast the millennials for their obsession with something you see as (literally) devoid of substance, people love this drink. But few people love it as much as the Fizz Fam does.I was late to the seltzer bandwagon. I really only began drinking it this past summer, a love that developed out of an unexpected appreciation for the majorly refreshing and full-flavored La Croix Pamplemousse (grapefruit). Then, the Polar winter seasonals (particularly Lime Ginger Mule) and Trader Joe’s Starfruit Seltzer clinched my identity as a seltzer enthusiast, and my love for the fizzy drink has bubbled over since I decided to stop drinking alcohol for an indeterminate period back in February. And that’s no coincidence: a significant number of Fizzers don’t drink alcohol. Sometimes Fizzers post seltzies to celebrate sobriety anniversaries.I was first introduced to Now Fizzing nearly two years ago by a former roommate, who is an active member. The first time she mentioned it, I probably scoffed pretty hard, already a little annoyed with the accumulating boxes of Polar Seltzer’ades being stored in our communal space. And I didn’t fully get it – not just the seltzer obsession, but the idea of a selzter community – until I actually joined the group years later, using a new Facebook account created explicitly for that purpose.Having abandoned most social media platforms for their negative effect on my mental health about six months prior, wading into the supportive world of Now Fizzing was more refreshing than an ice-cold glass bottle of Topo Chico with a twist of fresh lime.When Solomon first created the group, he had no idea what would eventually come of it. Like many others, his own personal journey into the world of fizz began when he decided to give up soda (a major vice of his that resulted from managing a bar as a nondrinker). After a weekend trip with friends to a dry campground, where they guzzled seltzer nonstop, Solomon decided to create the group as a play on Now Spinning, a Facebook group for vinyl enthusiasts to share what they’re listening to.Since then, “it’s grown beyond whatever I could have imagined,” Solomon tells me. At first, the group was composed of just his friends, but it grew exponentially, perhaps aided by the seltzer craze that seems to have first struck around 2015, a year after the group was created. While Now Fizzing primarily exists online, its members have met up in Brooklyn, Philadelphia and Seattle. Besides these planned events, Fizzers occasionally recognize each other offline thanks to the distinguishing seltzer-shaped pin and Now Fizzing T-shirt created by members and advertised within the group. And this past December, a bunch of Fizzers banded together to ship Solomon six boxes of Polar’s Mango Limeade to ensure he’d be hydrated during his annual 25-hour radio show.To find out what made this group so joyful, I began asking around. In addition to being an active member of Now Fizzing, Amanda Brennan is an expert on online communities and fandoms. Understanding the way these networks function and thrive is literally part of her job as the senior content insights manager at Tumblr. And she says that, without question, Now Fizzing is particularly special.“In the climate of internet where there’s a lot of bad things going on, it’s so great to have this group that feels very pure and very positive just really about this thing that we all love,” Brennan tells me.Her sentiments are shared by the 15 other members I spoke with, all of whom were exceptionally enthusiastic in their love of both “fizz” and the group. Time and time again, the same adjectives came up: fun, supportive, wholesome, safe, pure, positive, friendly and earnest.Aria, a Boston-based member of Fizz Fam, tells me a story about a time when she called her mom, who was in the grocery store, to ask her to scope out the scene for new Polar Seltzer’ade flavors. Confused, her mom repeated her request out loud in the aisle, catching the attention of a man who was looking for the same thing. Unable to find it, her mom hung up – only to call back a minute later to tell Aria that the nice man had found it in another aisle and returned to share the good news.Fizzers, it appears, are the type of strangers for whom kindness comes naturally. “I’m not sure if all seltzer drinkers are good people,” a Fizzer named Randi explained in an email she wrote me while drinking Polar Orange Vanilla, “but these members are.”While scrolling through the group for new seltzer flavors, I became so intrigued by its dynamics that I decided to reach out to my former colleague Annemarie Dooling, now the audience development manager at Vox Media. She has more than 10 years of experience moderating communities and is an expert on digital human behavior.After patiently listening to me drone on about the group, Dooling tells me that there are a few logical reasons for Now Fizzing’s success. One of these is the group’s relatively small size. Another is the coincidental timing of seltzer becoming a cultural phenomenon. But mostly, she says, it’s simply the members who set the tone with such a laser-focused passion.“People who like certain things and are kind of fanatical about them always find each other,” Dooling tells me, stressing that communities of interest (rather than those of circumstance or geography) are inherently special in nature.“It’s not always easy to find people who are interested in your interests,” Dooling says. “There is always a group of people that are your tribe, and it’s about finding out who your tribe is. Sometimes that tribe is in front of you, sometimes it’s virtual.”Ian and Tracy, a married couple living in the Pacific north-west, tell me that Now Fizzing is very much their tribe. They’re exceptionally regular posters within the group. Last year, they scheduled their annual summer trip to New York City to coincide with a Prospect Park meet-up planned by Solomon. They tried new flavors, met the people they had bonded with online, and had such a blast that they ended up making extra room in their packed itinerary to hang out with the new friends they’d just made.Over Skype, the three of us compare our favorite brands and flavors and discuss the larger seltzer culture. I find they’re exceptionally easy to talk to, with deep, genuine laughs and cool art hanging in their home. They talk excitedly about how they look forward to reconnecting with their seltzer friends IRL the next time they come out east.Tracy laughs and shakes her head at the sheer absurdity of the statement. But I can tell we both agree with what Ian just said. Positivity, compassion and enthusiasm can be powerful forces, especially on the internet, and especially in these isive and often toxic times. I realize that they’re the reason people join groups like this in the first place.At the end of the call, I ask Ian and Tracy if there’s any type of seltzer on the east coast that they can’t get where they live. After a stop at my favorite cafe, which stocks five different seltzer brands, I head to the post office.Allee Manning is a freelance journalist writing here and there.

Heat the oven to 150C300Fgas 2. Grease and line a deep 20cm cake tin.Cream the butter and sugar until fluffy. Gradually add the eggs, vanilla and salt, and mix.In a separate bowl, whisk the flour and baking powder, then fold half into the butter. Add in the milk, then the remaining flour. Scrape the bottom of the bowl and mix once more. Pour into the prepared tin and smooth the top with a palette knife or spatula. Bake for 50-60 minutes. Leave to cool for 15-20 minutes, then remove from its tin by running a small paring knife along the inside of the tin to release the cake. Or, if you have used a loose-bottomed tin, set the base of the cake tin on top of a tin of tomatoes, or similar, and gently push the sides of the cake tin down.To make the icing, puree the raspberries with the two tablespoons of icing sugar, then strain. Transfer to an electric mixer. Add the milk, butter and 250g of the icing sugar, and beat on low for three minutes. Add the rest of the sugar and beat until the icing is light but holds its shape. Mix in the kirsch and lemon juice.Wash and dry the cake tin, and line with clingfilm with plenty lapping over the sides and set aside. Using a serrated bread knife (the longest one you have), score a horizontal line a third of the way up the side of the cake and then slowly cut the cake into thirds horizontally. Trim the top layer slightly if it is domed. Slide a tart tin base or cardboard disc between the bottom and middle layers of the cake, and lift off the top two layers on to a large plate. Slide the bottom layer of sponge into the lined cake tin and pipe a border of icing around the edge. Don’t worry if the icing touches the sides of the tin, as you are essentially creating a dam for the filling.Smooth half the jam over, and pipe a few stripes of icing on top. This acts as a glue to adhere one cake to another and it also creates delicious pockets of jam and icing between the layers.Put the middle sponge on top and repeat the above process. Top with the third sponge, pull up the sides of clingfilm and wrap up the cake. Chill for at least two hours, or overnight before removing from the tin to ice the top and sides. Scatter with more berries and serve.265g unsalted butter, softened, plus more for greasing265g caster sugar3-4 lemons, zested 3 eggs265g plain flour2 tsp baking powder1 tsp salt 100g milkFor the lemon drizzle1 tbsp sugar1 tbsp water2 tbsp lemon juiceFor the icing250g icing sugar2 tbsp lemon juiceHeat the oven to 180C350Fgas 4. Grease a 25cm x 10cm loaf tin with butter and line the base and sides with parchment paper, to about 5cm above the top of the tin.In an electric mixer, cream the butter and sugar well. Mix in the lemon zest, then beat in the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition.In a large bowl, whisk the flour, baking powder and salt. Mix half of this into the creamed butter mixture, scraping down the sides, until barely combined.With the mixer still going, beat in all the milk, then add the rest of the flour and mix until just combined. Scrape the bowl and give it one last mix.Scoop the mixture into the prepared tin and smooth the top with a palette knife or spatula. Bake for 50-60 minutes, until the top of the cake is springy and a skewer comes out clean.Meanwhile, make the lemon drizzle: in a small pan, heat the sugar, water and lemon juice until the sugar is just melted. Do not let it boil or it will lose its fresh flavour. While the cake is still in the tin, use a skewer to poke holes evenly throughout the baked loaf. Pour over the drizzle.To make the icing, in a small bowl, whisk the icing sugar and lemon juice until smooth. Take the cake out of the tin: run a small paring knife along the inside of the tin, then tilt the tin on its side and coax the loaf out, using the parchment as a handle. Peel off the paper and turn the loaf on your cooling rack or worktop. Drizzle with the icing and let it drip down the sides, then use a spatula or a cake or tart tin base to lift the loaf on to a serving dish.175g butter, softened, plus more for greasing175g light brown sugar2 eggsSeeds of 1 vanilla pod125g ground almonds175g wholemeal spelt flour2 tsp baking powder1 tsp salt200g halved cherries, or whole berries200g peaches or nectarines, sliced2 tbsp caster sugar, for sprinklingRose petals, for scattering (optional)For the icing (optional) 200g icing sugar1-2 tbsp rose waterHeat the oven to 160C325Fgas 3.

Beat in the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Add the vanilla and almonds, and mix to combine.In another bowl, whisk the flour, baking powder and salt, then gently beat the dry ingredients into the butter mixture.Spread the batter into the prepared tin and smooth the top with a palette knife or spatula. Scatter the cherries over the batter, then press the slices of peach into the top.Sprinkle with the caster sugar and bake for 60-70 minutes, until a skewer comes out clean and the top of the cake springs back to the touch. Let the cake cool in its tin for about 15 minutes before turning it out on to a serving plate.If using the icing, whisk the rose water into the icing sugar until smooth and runny. Drizzle this over the cooled cake, then scatter with garden rose petals, if you have them. This is best eaten on the day you bake it.100g unsalted butter, plus more for greasing 100g plain flour, plus more for dusting 1 tbsp honey2 tsp rose water100g caster sugar2 eggs 1 tsp baking powderFor the icing2-3 tbsp rose syrup 200g icing sugarYou will need a 12-hole madeleine tin to make these. First, prepare the tin. Melt a good amount of butter and leave to cool slightly, then brush it into the tin and dust with flour. Put the tin in your freezer for five minutes or so, then repeat the process – if you are using a silicone mould, you can omit this second step. Keep the tin in the freezer until you are ready to use it.Heat the oven to 160C325Fgas 3. In a heatproof bowl set over a pan of barely simmering water, carefully melt the butter, then take off the heat and leave to cool slightly. Add the honey to the butter to dissolve it, then add the rose water.In a bowl, whisk the caster sugar and eggs until smooth, then whisk in the melted butter mix. In another bowl, whisk the flour and baking powder, then whisk these dry ingredients into the egg and butter mix until smooth. Spoon the batter into the prepared tin.Bake for 10-12 minutes, until the madeleines have formed a peak in their middles and the tops spring back to the touch. Take out of the oven and leave to cool in the tin for a minute or two.Meanwhile, make the icing: whisk the rose syrup into the icing sugar until smooth and runny.Turn the madeleines out of the mould and dip them in the icing or drizzle over the top. Serve right away – they are best eaten within the hour. (Remember, you can make the madeleine mixture in advance and bake it just before you want to serve.)Butter, for greasing350g dates, pitted and chopped150g hazelnuts, toasted and chopped finely3 eggs1 tsp vanilla extract 50g caster sugar50g brown sugar200g oil140g plain flour2 tsp baking powder 1 tsp salt100g plain yoghurtFor the praline topping50g hazelnuts, toasted and skins removed50g water200g caster sugarFor the icing4 tbsp water 300g icing sugarHeat the oven to 160C325Fgas 3. Grease two 18cm cake tins with butter and line with parchment. Mix the dates and hazelnuts in a bowl and set aside.Using an electric mixer, whisk together the eggs, vanilla and sugars until light and fluffy. Keep whisking and slowly drizzle in the oil.In another bowl, whisk the flour, baking powder and salt. Add this to the egg mixture and whisk for a few seconds to combine. Whisk in the yoghurt, then fold in the dates and hazelnuts.Divide the mixture between the prepared tins and bake for 35-45 minutes, until the cakes are baked but not dry. The tops of the cakes will not spring back as much as other cakes do because the dates make the mixture moist and dense in the best possible way. Leave the cakes to cool in the tins while you make the topping.To make the topping, line a baking tray with parchment paper and spread the hazelnuts on the tray. Put the tray on your worktop, near the hob. Have your icing ingredients nearby, as they will be needed as soon as the caramel is ready.Put the water in a small, heavy-bottomed pan and sprinkle in the caster sugar. Bring to the boil and, just as the sugar starts to caramelise, pour half of it over the hazelnuts. Leave to cool and harden, then break into shards.To make the icing, add the water to the remaining caramel in the pan, then pour the runny caramel from the pan into the icing sugar and whisk to a smooth paste. Add more water or icing sugar until it has the consistency of soft buttercream. Spread the icing on the cooled cakes and top with the shards of praline.115g butter, melted, plus more for greasing90g plain flour1 tsp baking powder 50g ground almonds40g ground hazelnuts40g ground pistachios190g icing sugar5 egg whites, lightly whisked2 tsp vanilla extract200g fresh raspberries (about 40-50)50g slivered pistachiosIcing sugar, for dustingHeat the oven to 160C325Fgas 3.

The film, due to air early next year shortly before Britain leaves the EU in March, will be written by James Graham, who has won awards for his political plays such as This House and Ink.The TV production, partly based on books written by the Sunday Times political editor, Tim Shipman, and the former Downing Street director of communications Craig Oliver, is likely to examine how Cummings led Vote Leave to victory against the odds while having a sometimes tempestuous relationship with those around him. Cummings’ involvement in the Brexit campaign is still being examined by authorities, with MPs formally requesting the former Vote Leave strategist appears in front of a select committee to answer questions, while the Electoral Commission is investigating whether his campaign broke spending rules.The Brexit drama was one of several programmes unveiled for Channel 4 by the organisation’s new director of programmes, Ian Katz, who described it as a “knotty, topical” drama.The former Newsnight editor and  deputy editor said he was committed to looking for erse and new voices, while “doubling down on some of our shows which are more popular with younger viewers”.Other shows announced by Channel 4 on Wednesday include a sitcom starring the comedian Aisling Bea, a three-part series presented by Kathy Burke on what it means to be a woman in 2018, and a pilot of a late-night satirical news programme hosted by Deborah Frances-White. There will also be an 11pm talkshow hosted by Big Narstie and a reality TV show called The Circle, in which contestants compete to become the most popular inidual on a social network without ever actually meeting. The channel is looking to move many of its staff outside London, while investing in more regional productions, following a deal with the government to ensure its independence."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/33fb0aa04293d730b5e661ab2513fcf81f74cc47/0_13_4896_2938/master/4896.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=501e98e13f6e5d343cadf95b2f573d61","title":"stv closes ailing second channel in shift to online content","story":"Strategy means 59 job losses and end of flagship news programme in bid to boost STV PlayerSTV has announced it will close its struggling second channel STV2, as part of a broader shift towards online content and a reorganisation that will result in 59 job losses.Publishing the broadcaster’s three-year growth strategy on Wednesday morning, STV’s new chief executive, Simon Pitts, who took over from Rob Woodward in January, set out plans to drive viewers to STV Player, with more than a third of profits expected to come from outside linear TV advertising by the end of 2020.The closure of STV2, which was launched last spring following a merger of local and city digital services around Scotland, will mean the end of STV News Tonight, its flagship 7pm nightly news programme anchored from Glasgow by Halla Mohieddeen, with 25 jobs affected. The broadcaster had previously boasted that the second channel allowed the company to put Scotland’s first “Scottish Six” news programme on air.The five local TV licences that were part of STV2 will be sold to That’s Media, while wider restructuring of the news operation will result in a further 34 job losses and around £1m cost-cutting. STV’s head of news will also be replaced. The cuts follow an announcement by BBC Scotland on Tuesday that its new TV channel for Scotland will be on air from next February, subject to Ofcom approval. The new channel had initially planned to start broadcasting in the autumn.Launching the plans, Pitts said: “This is a positive vision for STV that will re-establish the company as a creative force in Scotland and beyond. We will invest in creative talent, new original programming and digital to ensure STV becomes Scotland’s home of news and entertainment and delivers long-term value for advertisers, shareholders and viewers alike.”In April, Alan Clements, the head of STV Productions, announced that he was leaving the company after a decade."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1cea16285cb9cf736069dd63138a9043bf7dfec2/0_0_4152_2584/master/4152.jpg?w=1010\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2070c810ef87669db995aea8703859cf 1010w","title":"east coast rail line to be temporarily renationalised virgin stagecoach","story":"London to Edinburgh service to come under public control after Virgin and Stagecoach could not meet paymentsThe East coast rail line will be temporarily renationalised, the government has decided, after operators Virgin and Stagecoach could no longer meet the promised payments in the £3.3bn contract.The London to Edinburgh service will be taken back into public control, a little over three years since Virgin Trains East Coast started running. Ahead of an expected statement by the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, to the House of Commons, Stagecoach announced that it had been advised he planned to appoint the “operator of last resort” – an Arup-led group under government control – to run the service.Grayling announced in November that the East Coast franchise would be terminated three years early in 2020, allowing the operators to avoid up to £2bn in payments until 2023. Lower passenger numbers and revenue than forecast have seen Stagecoach losing around £200m on the franchise to date. The transport secretary admitted in February that the franchise was “unsustainable” and instructed civil servants to consider the options. The collapse of the franchise marks the third time in a decade that a private train operator has failed to see out its contract on the East Coast line, which was renationalised between 2009 and 2015.

She said a shadow minister in the Lords had voted for a second referendum, and a shadow aid minister tweeted in favour of one. Would Corbyn rule it out?The Labour leader said there had been no progress in cabinet for five months. May said some people wanted the UK to forget about having an independent trade policy. And some said: don’t worry about the Irish border. Neither of those positions was a position of the government. There will be a white paper, she said.Corbyn said the PM’s own position was not supported by the cabinet, quoting Rolls-Royce, Ford and Vauxhall all warning about the future of trade. Michael Gove said this week there were question marks over the PM’s customs model. But at least he did not call it crazy, as Boris Johnson did. If May can’t persuade her cabinet, then how can she persuade the EU?May’s retort was that Corbyn said there wouldn’t be a deal before December. But there was.There are record numbers of people on zero-hour contracts, Corbyn went on, and record numbers of people in poverty. He said the Dutch have already started training new customs officers. How many HMRC extra staff have been recruited to deal with Brexit?Corbyn pointed out he asked about extra HMRC staff. The Dutch government is better prepared. The government is not ready. If the government can’t negotiate a good deal, why won’t it step aside and make way for a party that will?Corbyn is starting to make it look easy. It isn’t easy, of course (winning PMQs is about the hardest task for an opposition leader), and Corbyn isn’t a natural as a parliamentary performer, but for the second week in a row, on a subject that for months he avoided at all costs, he managed to knock May all over the place.He was also more versatile than usual, combining real humour (ie, a joke that actually made people laugh, not synthetic, parliamentary humour – the laughter after his first question went on so long they will probably have to edit it out in the radio bulletins), deadly specifics (the question about HMRC staff), good attack quotes (the ones from car manufacturers), but also questions that accurately and harshly summed up the government’s failings (primarily, the absence of a Brexit negotiating position only five months before the deal is supposed to be completed).Tories who have been withering about Corbyn’s abilities should start asking themselves what it is about the government’s record that has made a Brexit PMQs such a doddle for him. May did her best to retaliate, but attacking Labour over the EU referendum sounded irrelevant and, even though she has a point about the contradictions in Labour’s Brexit policy, it is a second order issue compared with the problems with her own position.Her claim that Labour said wrongly there would never be a deal before December is a standard bit of Downing Street spin but I’m not sure it has any basis in fact (I can’t recall anyone saying on the record there would be no December deal – only a few off-the-record comments about how it looked 5050).About the only life-raft left for May was to cling to the buoyant employment figures. But, with the growth rate looking dismal, as Corbyn pointed out, that wasn’t particularly effective either.When the prime minister wrote at the weekend that she wanted ‘as little friction as possible’, was she talking about EU trade or the next cabinet meeting?Theresa May’s response to Corbyn’s claim of unreadiness:His position was that we should have triggered article 50 immediately after the referendum, with no work having been done in preparation for the negotiations … And what would that have led to? … They’d have sold Britain out."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2f031ce40f22fe26bf5530859d87e31c4c49f26/0_161_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7013b1ae24438383dc66cfaa1eb8385b","title":"readytogo rift timing indyref2 scottish independence yes movement","story":"While some Scottish independence activists warn against an early poll, others say a lengthy delay could pose an even bigger threatAs the three candidates vying to replace Angus Robertson as Scottish National party deputy leader appear at crowded hustings events across the country, one question is dominating the debate: when should the party leader and first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, call another independence referendum?It’s a question made all the more acute after the Scottish parliament set itself on a constitutional collision course with Westminster on Tuesday afternoon, when it voted decisively to reject the UK government’s EU withdrawal bill. If Theresa May imposes the bill’s post-Brexit power-sharing plans on Scotland, overturning 20 years of precedent, then Sturgeon’s calls for a second independence referendum are unarguably bolstered. But polling consistently shows a majority across the country opposed both to independence and to holding another vote in the near future.While Scotland’s constitutional ide remains entrenched, a more recent breach has emerged among independence activists over the timing of a second referendum. In recent months, there have been public skirmishes about whether Sturgeon should deploy the mandate for a new referendum that she claims from the 2016 Holyrood elections before the parliamentary term ends in 2021, or delay until an unarguable economic case for independence has been built and public opinion is more favourable.With two out of three deputy leadership candidates calling for a vote before 2021, the ballot – the results of which will be announced at the SNP conference next month – is expected to provide a clear indication of where the party’s mass membership of more than 118,000 stands on this critical question, and how willing they will be to wait if the party leadership dismisses their growing sense of urgency.This was evident this month when more than 40,000 supporters of Scottish independence thronged the streets of Glasgow, brandishing saltires, “Still Yes” placards and the occasional unicorn, in the largest public demonstration in the city since the rally against the Iraq war in 2003. The organiser of the march, All Under One Banner, was calling for a second vote to be held before 2021, which marks the end of the Brexit transition period and the next Holyrood elections.Three years and eight months after Scotland’s momentous referendum, the appetite for energetic displays of solidarity like this one is undiminished among independence supporters. All three deputy leadership candidates attended and continue to answer questions about referendum timing at local hustings. Julie Hepburn, a favourite among activists, wants a second vote “at the earliest possible opportunity” councillor Chris McEleny is hoping for another referendum within 18 months, while Keith Brown, cabinet secretary for the economy, jobs and fair work and the most senior contender, is more circumspect, stressing the importance of campaign readiness whenever another referendum called.But, in contrast to the marchers’ #readytogo hashtag, a number of senior SNP figures have cautioned against an early poll. When Pete Wishart, the SNP’s longest-serving MP, did so last month, his pragmatism was met with outrage in some quarters of the yes movement, who denounced him on social media as “an Etonian boot-licker”.“There’s no question that we are at a turning point in the yes movement,” says Robin McAlpine, the head of Scotland’s only grassroots-funded thinktank, Common Weal, and veteran independence campaigner. “The fractiousness was always coming. There’s no more dangerous move than marching your troops back down the hill again, because they are fizzing with adrenalin and have nowhere to put it.”Sturgeon’s call in March 2017 for a second independence referendum before the start of the Brexit transition resulted in an unexpectedly fierce backlash at the general election in June. With about one-third of SNP voters backing Brexit in 2016, even those in favour of independence questioned the wisdom of linking Scotland’s future so closely to the EU. “Meanwhile, the membership are getting more restless. The assumption that the SNP have a secret plan that is so brilliant they don’t want to reveal it is in decline, and the sense that the leadership are actually a bit directionless is growing.”A more complex picture emerges from local yes groups, many of which continue to organise within their communities regardless of top-tier politicking.Among the grassroots activists that the  has spoken to, the preference remains for Sturgeon to exercise her mandate in this parliamentary term.Yes Linton – based in the Westminster constituency of the Scottish secretary, David Mundell – is one of the newest groups, having formed in January. Its founding member, Ian Reid, says: “People have a real political and strategic intelligence. The next referendum is discussed, but it’s not the only show in town.”“There are those who like the marches and the demos but on the whole we believe we are still in a preparatory phase and it is hard work and intelligent planning that matter.”Activists are also united in their determination to educate themselves in the arguments necessary to win over no voters, accessing a vast network of sympathetic experts who are willing to give talks at local meetings, from pro-independence organisations that have continued post-referendum, such as Commonweal, Business for Scotland or Nordic Horizons. Another Scotland-wide organisation that has reinvented itself as a broader campaign group is Women for Independence. With 55 affiliated groups, WFI has successfully opposed the building of a women’s super-prison, founded uniform banks for families struggling to clothe their children, and conducted groundbreaking research on period poverty.Jonathan Shafi, co-founder of the left-aligned Radical Independence Campaign, expects there will be “a significant demoralisation” if there is no second referendum within the next few years.McAlpine believes the yes movement faces another threat with more long-lasting consequences than a public split over the timing of another referendum.“The bigger risk is drift: when it becomes clear that Sturgeon is not calling another referendum the small risk is a screaming fit, and then the media will eviscerate us for being split. But the bigger risk is that everyone will find new things to do. You can only heal wounds when the people are still in the room.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9603b429d3516f770f4ddfd33cb6055396ef307b/0_248_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3bfc027befb53dff3dcebd44c0568107","title":"pmqs may corbyn brexit uk wont benefit from free trade deal with us say harvard academics politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happen, including Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn at PMQsLabour’s Jenny Chapman challenges Grayling to stand up and say, ‘My name’s Chris Grayling and I’ve just renationalised a railway.’Grayling says he does not think nationalisation is the long-term answer.

It is a field in which we are absolutely world class. From the FA to the RFU to the ECB to the Jockey Club and far beyond, we really bring home the bacon. All the cured pork, in fact. Of all the games we invented, this is the last one we can always be sure of winning.And yet, even by the high standards of his peers, the England and Wales Cricket Board chairman Colin Graves is having an excellent run. I think the clinching factor is how much Colin clearly seems to hate cricket. In one sense, even that’s not weird. All populists secretly hate their people. All bookies secretly hate their punters. And all sports blazers secretly hate their sport. You only have to look at Gianni Infantino’s sporticidal plans for a 48-team World Cup, and ever more competitive black-tie award ceremonies, to see a similar tendency.But the common thread is that they tend to do it secretly. Colin’s distaste for cricket appears ever more open. How else to read his comments to the BBC’s Simon Mann on Monday? Colin was justifying The Hundred, a highly uncalled-for fourth format of the game he seems bent on driving through, despite vocal resistance from the Professional Cricketers’ Association, many players past and present, and a demographic we’ll call “members of the public who like cricket”.He is doing this, he reasoned, because cricket as we know it has nothing to offer young people. “The younger generation, whether you like it or not, are just not attracted to cricket,” Colin explained. “They want something different. They want it to be more exciting. They want it shorter. They want it simpler to understand.”Before he makes a dash for the lawyers – of which more later – I should say it is perfectly possible Colin doesn’t realise he dislikes cricket at all. He almost certainly believes he loves it. That might be his tragedy. It is likely that his antipathy towards cricket is wholly subconscious, buried beneath that monogram-gated exterior. It is up to you to speculate quite how many – or quite how few – hours Colin would need on the couch of a Viennese-school psychoanalyst to tease out the possibility. Or, to keep an open mind, for the shrink to come up with another credible explanation as to why he has frequently disparaged the appeal of various forms of the game. It wasn’t long into his tenure at the ECB before he was describing the record ticket-selling T20 Blast competition as “mediocre”. So he has form for tipping on the ECB’s own products, to use the parlance of our times.Yet the more contradictory positions that emanate from the ECB, the harder it is to shake the feeling that if it isn’t happening in the immediate vicinity of the chairman’s walnut gearknobbed saloon, he isn’t powerfully aware of it. Colin’s interview aired on very day that the ECB announced that 50,000 youngsters have signed up to participate in its All Stars Cricket initiative this summer. Never mind knowing what the other is doing – is the ECB’s right hand even in the same time zone as its left hand?I’m reminded of Alan Partridge ringing his son and being appalled to discover where he is. “Fernando,” he despairs, “you’re 22 years old and you’re spending your Saturday afternoon in bed with a girl. You’re wasting your life.” And so with Colin’s declaration coming on the day of the All Stars news. Kids, you’re squandering your youth with this stuff! Have you tried football instead?Alas, Colin’s tenure has already become too much for some. As ECB board member Andy Nash put it in his resignation letter a few weeks ago: “I’ve recently become concerned that the standards of corporate governance at ECB are falling well short of what’s acceptable and in all conscience, I can’t allow myself to continue to be associated with it. I would be failing in my duty as a director if I didn’t bring these to the board’s attention and this I’ve tried to do.”What can one say? Not a lot, if the lawyers have anything to do with it. His regime is already reportedly suing ESPNcricinfo’s George Dobell. Other threats of a trip down the Strand seem likely. They might even sue over Nash’s resignation letter, who knows? After the Mann interview, Graves might be considering suing Glamorgan for the time-bending feat of pre-contradicting him. By way of recap, Graves said on Monday of the suggestion the ECB compensated counties for the years they miss out on staging a Test. “No payments have been made to counties at all.” Yet Glamorgan stated in March: “Following discussions with the ECB the club decided not to apply to host Test matches during the 2020 to 2024 period in return for a compensation payment of £2.5m.”As for the continuing point of Colin Graves, it is a matter of increasing speculation. He might well be a form of blazered Terminator, sent back in time with the sole mission of throwing former ECB chairman Giles Clarke into sympathetic relief. Either way, his innovation has more and more vocal detractors. Whatever the broadcasters might prefer, most believe that the various forms of the game we already have just need a little TLC. Which is to say: Colin is chasing waterfalls, when he really should stick to the rivers and the lakes that he’s used to."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b72d937ed45600eee0bfc9a17e68da42aff16fc8/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=761b8314eff254cc3f43301ab61692da","title":"say it aint so joe how 1919 informs americas entire worldview on gambling","story":"A society’s century-long distrust of sports betting can be traced to the night of 21 September 1919, when the Black Sox went nationalAmerica’s century-long distrust of sports betting can be traced to the night of 21 September 1919. That’s when several members of baseball’s Chicago White Sox met with gambling boss Arnold Rothstein in a New York hotel room to throw the following month’s World Series.The scandal that unraveled after the White Sox’s sluggish five-games-to-three loss to the Cincinnati Reds hurled into the fire the innocence of a nation and led to the appointment of baseball’s first commissioner: Kenesaw Mountain Landis. It also created a firm distaste for any implication that sports were somehow compromised. History forgets the eight players involved were found not guilty on charges of conspiracy to defraud, or that the whole scandal came to pass because the White Sox owner Charles Comiskey was a notorious cheapskate who treated his players poorly. The players were banned for life and the World Series fix forced US sports to send a strong message that gambling was not to be tolerated.“Everything after that was summed up in one phrase: ‘for the integrity of the game’,” says Brett Smiley, the editor of sportshandle, a website that covers the American sports gambling industry. While legal sports gambling has thrived in most countries, it’s long been considered taboo in the US, characterized as a murky industry operated by mobsters. Sports that permit gambling – such as horse- and greyhound-racing and jai alai – are often cast as enterprises surrounded by shady personalities. Sports leagues have vigilantly policed their members, squashing any attempts to associate their teams with betting. State and federal legislatures have passed laws banning sports gambling. For years, Nevada was the only state where gambling was legal, only furthering the image of betting as a sleazy business best left with the other sins found in Las Vegas. New Jersey, which brought the lawsuit challenging the Pasa, and West Virginia are among the states expected to quickly enact laws opening an industry most-often associated with Vegas casinos. Others will follow.The legalization of sports gambling will be a significant culture change for many Americans. It’s not just the White Sox affair that hurt gambling’s cause. Occasional scandals in which college basketball players were caught point shaving (intentionally missing baskets to keep the score below a bookie’s desired total) were treated as high crimes. Pete Rose, who has more major league hits than any other baseball player, is nearly three decades into a lifetime ban for betting on games while he played for the Cincinnati Reds.No league, however, has been as vigilant about eliminating connections to gambling as the NFL. In his book, America’s Game: The Epic Story Of How Pro Football Captured A Nation, Michael MacCambridge tells how NFL commissioner Bert Bell moved quickly in 1947 to suspend New York Giants players Merle Hapes and Frank Filchock when the two were suspected of fixing a playoff game – primarily to engender the impression that the league was serious about policing gambling.“Professional football can’t continue to exist unless it is based on absolute honesty,” MacCambridge quotes Bell as saying at the time. “The players must not only be absolutely honest they must be above suspicion. In short, the game and its players must be kept free of corruption.”The irony of the NFL’s stance is that the league was built on gambling. As MacCambridge points out, two of the NFL’s most powerful early owners, New York’s Tim Mara and Pittsburgh’s Art Rooney, had been involved in gambling enterprises (Mara as a onetime bookmaker and Rooney as a horse-track owner). Much of the league’s popularity comes from a weekly schedule that turns each Sunday’s games into big events, making it easy to bet on them. A boom of new fans in the 1990s coincided with the rise of fantasy leagues that gave people who might not have otherwise watched football a reason to watch the games. Still, the NFL and other leagues continued to push the line that linked sports betting to mobsters.President John F Kennedy and his brother Robert, the US attorney general, were fearful that organized crime was building too strong a grip on gambling, and they made controlling it an early priority. They urged Congress to pass several laws, most-importantly 1961’s Federal Wire Act, banning the use of phone lines for transmitting bets. The anti-gambling facade remained until the last decade, when money challenged the need to maintain a veneer of purity. As states like Connecticut found a windfall in the rise of casinos on native tribal lands and others relaxed regulations against large casino chains, they realized they could be making even more from betting. New Jersey’s leaders felt particularly penalized by the Pasa as Atlantic City fell farther behind Las Vegas in prominence. Sports leagues also realized they were losing millions by not embracing fantasy sports. When teams cut deals with daily fantasy companies like DraftKings, the old resistance to gambling began to wane. By the time New Jersey appealed an overturn of the Pasa to the Supreme Court, it seemed only a matter of time before the leagues who had fought gambling for decades were ready to cash in themselves. The stigma of betting as a domain of the mob wore away. That 1919 meeting at the Ansonia Hotel in New York started to seem like, well, 100 years ago.

The characters and beats come from a kind of theatre that steadfastly refuses to go out of style, no matter how stale it is.But something is strange about the words coming from these mouths on stage. The sentences, while technically complete, veer off on weird tangents. There is no witty dialogue here if the lines are funny it is because of their nonsense. But playwright Roslyn Helper can be forgiven. She wrote the play with the help of artificial intelligence.Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noonSo if AI is the way of the future, is it the way of theatre?Lifestyle, a play presented by Next Wave festival and Melbourne Knowledge Week, suggests not. The “artificial” of AI sits heavily on the work it’s amusing for its glitches rather than its sense. But as AI encroaches on our day to day lives, it will increasingly make its way into the art world. So how will it be used? And what does it mean for how we understand art?AI is a learning system. To create AI artists, humans will need to select the information the system learns from. So while AI is nominally intelligent and separate from humans, its algorithms are built through the lens of human bias. We are currently seeing a distinct white male bias in AI. Not surprisingly, the history of western theatre is also one of white male bias.Lifestyle isn’t the only work in Next Wave to be thinking about this robot future. Bureau of Meteoranxiety is an installation piece acting as satire on contemporary mindfulness and self-care, and our disconnection from nature and fears about climate change. As part of the work, you are invited to talk with an AI chatbot, Gail, about your weather-based anxieties. While she often seems to answer a question that is slightly different from the one you actually asked, there is something strangely comforting about this discussion of weather. Yet Gail’s female name (most chatbots, in a position of subservience, have female names) hides the male influences that have gone into her. In my discussion with her she quotes (uncredited) the work of male poets and then, gallingly, Donald Trump.By using AI in this artistic context, the artists encourage us to view the technology through a critical lens. The Bureau, and Gail, feel like services people might very much want to use, but if we did, whose biases would we be fed? For that matter, whose biases exist in the AI we increasingly use? If AI becomes the artist, how will we know to look at who created the AI? Who is the creator’s creator?But if this future was supposed to be an allegory for how robots will make our lives dull, it fell down at the first hurdle, as I watched audience members during the performance pull out their phones to amuse themselves. The technology of today has long surpassed the imagined technology of tomorrow.Perhaps AI art is only as interesting insofar as you know what has gone into its creation. Little is said about how SwiftKey, the AI that co-wrote Lifestyle, was specifically used, but the strange beginning of the work pays off when Helper and director Harriet Giles break out of the mould of traditional theatre: the cast dance screens show us the predictive text used to write the work the world dissolves further and further into the creative imagination of performance – which can only ever be truly realised through human collaboration.Next Wave has long held the edict of asking artists to be as ambitious as possible, so it is only natural that the artists of today, in their ambition, ask what AI can do for them. For the moment, the artists seem to be coming out on top. • Bureau of Meteoranxiety is showing in Melbourne until 19 May. NextWave festival runs until 20 May"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/78231c05308aea0b8e17ad1b21132f160d649253/0_57_1536_922/master/1536.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c14d44b6e696b4a4eff65693ce80c68f","title":"inbetweeners perfectly caricatured my life your favourite teen tv shows","story":"From a Thatcher-era coming of age tale to brooding US dramas and barely remembered just-back-from-school hits – the best of your responses to a celebration of the “definitive” teen showsHave to agree with Inbetweeners. Rarely has what it’s like to be a teenage boy been so wonderfully caricatured. There are moments watching it where I have had tears running down my face watching as the memories of what I was like aged 15 came flooding back. The nonsense, the bravado: wonderful stuff. CambridgeskipMy overriding memory of being a teenager is that I spent most of my life “having a laugh” and being generally daft with my mates. That’s why to my mind this is the only show to have anywhere near accurately captured what it’s like to be a teen growing up in the UK. Brighty76I love Fresh Meat. I wish more teenagers would watch it before going to university (I work in one) as I think it nails the reality of university for a lot of students. I see a lot who sit back and expect this amazing experience to just magically happen to them, but Fresh Meat shows a group who are thrown together in circumstances that none of them chose and yet they crack on and make the best of it.harriethedgehogBuffy still holds up incredibly well, even today when it’s very rooted in the 90s. Just great TV that also grew with its viewership – it wasn’t just a teen dramedy monster mash, it had massive themes about responsibility, growing up and trying to fit in in the world, the truth that sometimes even your friends and role models can disappoint you, and never giving up. It may well be that these themes have been tackled before in other shows, but Buffy brought them together and rammed a stake through the heart of some of them! HBrintGranted, it was primarily a hallucinatory, surreal pastiche of US daytime soaps, but the teenagers were central to the Twin Peaks world (in its original incarnation), and it conveyed the darkly confusing teen-transition to the adult world, in David Lynch’s inimitable style. YeOldeMerryPranksterJohnny Jarvis, starring the late Mark Farmer (who also played Gary Hargreaves in Grange Hill), was the best depiction ever of my generation growing up as teenagers in Thatcher’s Britain. The destruction of the law abiding working class and the creation of an underclass is in its infancy in this series. It is set in east London, but could be anywhere during that torrid time. Elephant63Despite not being being an “issues” show, it made the two leading characters in what was effectively an action science fiction being girls seems completely natural. Something that works get a show branded “social justice warrior propaganda” these days. Tell me it wasn’t as right on as I remember, but it was shows like this when I was a kid that made me want to only hang out with girls. SuddersNiche perhaps, but BBC Scotland’s 1981 teen mini-soap Maggie just tugged at the heartstrings of every teenager – boy or girl – coming to terms with school, relationships and parents. Kirsty Miller shone in the title role, heart-stoppingly vulnerable and feistily determined in the same scene.

His father was among the first professional guides after Nepal opened to foreign trekkers and mountaineers in 1950. His brother has scaled Everest 17 times. Most of his male relatives have reached the top at least once.Kami Rita first scaled Everest at 24, and has made the trip almost every year since then. He has also climbed many of the region’s other high peaks, including K-2, Cho-Oyu, Manaslu and Lhotse. In the autumn, he guides clients to smaller peaks in Nepal.The other two previous summit record-holders are also Sherpas. Apa, a 58-year-old guide who uses only one name, retired in 2011 and moved to Utah. Phurba Tashi, 47, retired from high-altitude climbing in 2013 but still works at Everest’s base camp, helping organise expeditions.Dozens of climbers are expected to reach the summit on Wednesday, taking advantage of the good weather on the mountain, according to Shrestha.The route to the summit was opened up by a team of Sherpas earlier this week.

Nuns should also pay close attention to “online content and the type and quantity of information”, it added.

Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillDr Peter Boylan has strongly defended an assertion that a clear majority of members of the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists support repeal of the Eight Amendment.Dr Boylan is the chairman of the institute and has also been a leading campaigner for the Yes vote.He has repeatedly said that the 80 per cent of institute members back repeal.This week an internal row has emerged as to whether Dr Boylan’s views are representative of the institute. Seventeen obstetricians based in the south and south west wrote to Dr Boylan saying his position as chairman was incompatible with advocating on the issue.The obstetricians, based in Cos Cork, Tipperary and Kerry, wrote that as the “public face” of the institute he should refrain from public advocacy. The letter said Dr Boylan should “temporarily stand aside as chairperson” if he wished to continue to campaign.The letter said the view of its signatories was that the institute should reflect the ersity of opinion by not campaigning on either side.Dr Boylan, a former master of the National Maternity Hospital, responded that he was being asked to stand aside at a time “he was standing up for Irish women and getting them the proper treatment”.He said the letter was rushed out to the media before he got a hard copy of it. “Now that is playing dirty,” he said.The assertion that four-fifths of obstetricians in the institute back repeal has been challenged by some obstetricians campaigning for a No vote, and by the Love Both campaign.Dr Boylan told The  yesterday that 18 or 19 members of the institute’s national executive had backed repeal at a meeting which specifically discussed the referendum earlier this year.He also referred to a Survey Monkey form which was distributed to all members of the institute, seeking their views on the referendum and on its related proposals for reform. He said that 79 or 80 members responded, of whom 81 per cent supported repeal.According to its website, the institute has “close to 200 members, who are experienced consultant obstetriciansgynaecologists and leading experts in their fields”.Dr Trevor Hayes, an obstetrician campaigning for a No vote, last night contended the institute was more ided on the issue than the results of the survey indicated.He said that there was a tight timeframe to respond to the survey and added he did not believe its findings were representative of the institute as a whole. He based this on his view that fewer than half of its members had responded.Dr Hayes said Dr Boylan was a highly respected obstetrician but he should not be campaigning as chairman of the institute as he was “taking a solo run”.Love Both spokeswoman Dr Cora Sherlock said the letter from obstetricians was “an indication that he does not speak for all professionals involved in the care of pregnant women in Ireland”.Get the latest news and best analysis ahead of the Eighth Amendment referendum here-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Anwar to take time off after pledging \u0026lsquocomplete support\u0026rsquo to new PM Mahathir MohamadOfficial says Pyongyang has no interest in holding \u0026lsquoone-sided\u0026rsquo talks with USPyongyang takes action after calling military exercises between allies a provocationChina keeping close eye on references to territories from Taiwan to TibetProcess demanded by West already \u0026lsquowell under way\u0026rsquo, says monitoring website\u0026lsquoWhen I looked over . . . half of my co-pilot\u0026rsquos body was hanging out of the window\u0026rsquoEight-year-old survives explosion in Surabaya, a day after 13 killed in similar attacksSydney Letter: Much of the growing concern is from coming from people wondering how their children are ever going to be able to afford a house in Sydney, Melbourne or other state capitals\u0026lsquoWhat Chairman Kim will get from America is our finest \u0026ndash entrepreneurs, risk-takers, capital providers\u0026rsquoIsis inspired attacks in Surabaya wound at least 40 people at three churchesPyongyang to take action as part of build up to summit with Donald TrumpLeaked flight manifesto showed Najib Razak was due to leave on a private jet to JakartaCandidate Fidelis Magalh\u0026atildees represents next generation in country still dominated by revolutionary leadersSecurity, neutrality and control of public gatherings drove choice for June 12thNew PM Mahathir Mohamad says king is willing to pardon rival turned allyBodies of three adults and four children found near tourist town of Margaret RiverTeaching English in China can be tricky affair due to unregulated agenciesMahathir, the oldest elected leader in world, ends ruling coalition\u0026rsquos six-decade reignUS president promises \u0026lsquospecial moment for world peace\u0026rsquo when leaders meet on June 12th"},{"url":null,"title":"national geographic travel photographer year 2018 pictures","story":"The competition continues in the 2018 National Geographic Travel Photographer of the Year contest!

David Conner while the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, will officiate as the couple make their marriage vows.Pioneering American bishop, the Most Rev Bishop Michael Curry, from Chicago, Illinois, has been invited to deliver the address as the couple strive to reflect their transatlantic relationship amid the tradition of St George\u0027s Chapel.Bishop Curry, who has been praised for his infectious laughter and self-deprecating humour, is the first African-American bishop to have served as the Episcopal Church\u0027s presiding bishop, a role he has held since November 2015.The music will also have an American influence according to Christopher Warren-Green, who will conduct musicians on the day.Ms Markle, who was a UN women\u0027s advocate, is unlikely to opt to obey the prince. The couple will probably choose the Series One (1966) Book of Common Prayer ceremony, just as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge did, which allows the bride to drop obey him and serve him from the religious proceedings.The regiments Prince Harry served with in Afghanistan will a have a “special place” during the ceremony.The 3 Regiment Army Air Corps, where the prince served as an Apache Pilot in Helmand Province will be represented, as well as The Royal Gurkha Rifles, his comrades in Afghanistan in 2007, and RAF Honington, where he is Honorary Air Commandant.Household Cavalry troopers will line the staircase at St George\u0027s Chapel, while streets within the precincts of the castle will be lined by members of the Windsor Castle Guard from 1st Battalion Irish Guards, and by Armed Forces personnel from the Royal Navy Small Ships and Diving, which has the Prince as Commodore-in-Chief, and the Royal Marines, where he is Captain General.Read more about St George\u0027s Chapel here.It has been announced that Prince William will be Prince Harry\u0027s best man. The decision means the Duke, who is President of the Football Association, will not attend the FA Cup final, which is happening on the same day as the wedding.Scheduled to start at 17:15, the FA Cup final will see Chelsea and Manchester United go head to head for the title. Windsor Castle is about an hour\u0027s drive from Wembley Stadium, which would have taken the Duke of Cambridge away from the proceedings for at least two hours.The Duke’s own stag do is reported to have been held on a Devon estate, Hartland Abbey, where he and close friends indulged in drinking, clay pigeon shooting, surfing and games.Prince Harry went on to tease his brother mercilessly during a none-the-less heartfelt best man’s speech at the wedding reception, allegedly wearing a fez, mimicking the lovestruck conversations between a young Kate and William, and ridiculing his bald spot.Royal Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan MarkleSuper fit police officer died while scuba ing as she went for a run the night before, inquest hears Meet Meghan Markle\u0026#39s family: The yoga teacher, the diplomat and the cannabis farmerHow to watch Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s royal wedding this SaturdayWhat royal titles will Meghan Markle and Prince Harry have after the wedding?Meet Doria Ragland: How Meghan Markle\u0026#39s mother became her rock and best friendUK weather: Royal wedding could be on the hottest day of the yearMeghan Markle: The American actress and newest addition to the royal familyRoyal wedding 2018 latest news: Full details for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s marriageRamadan 2018: Why Muslims celebrate the revelation of the KoranDambusters 75th anniversary: How the Second World War raid unfolded, hour by hourSyrian and Russian forces launch large-scale attack on Palestinian refugee camp controlled by IsilProcession route map for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s wedding day - where to spot the royal coupleRoyal wedding guest list: Here\u0026#39s who has received an invite from Harry and MeghanComment: If Donald Trump wants a successful deal with North Korea, the US has to stop using the Libya exampleAlgarve coach crash: 14 British tourists hurt in motorway smash with tanker on their way to airportNorth Korea takes aim at John Bolton as it threatens to scrap Trump summit over nuclear demands\u0026#39She\u0026#39s a good hugger and she has nice perfume.\u0026#39 Schoolgirl Sophia Roberts, 10, on meeting Meghan MarkleHow Prince Harry and Meghan Markle met - a look back at the matchmaker who started the couple\u0026#39s royal romanceFour men with samurai swords shot dead after Isil-claimed attack on Indonesia police stationWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/05/05/TELEMMGLPICT000162291773_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq5sXhkGf5k4c028Vyj7yi7oYb4LUIiHYzRv4kFMzBSV4.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"meet doria ragland meghan markles mother became rock best friend","story":"Meghan Markle, pictured with her mother Doria Ragland on Mother\u0026#39s DayHer final scenes as a single woman have been decidedly more telenovela than Hollywood classic.This week it was revealed her father allegedly staged a series of paparazzi shots in Mexico – encouraged by his other daughter, to make him seem “normal”.

And it seems they will waste no time getting started.The newlyweds\u0027 royal wedding schedule sees them undertake a tour of Windsor as their first trip as man and wife, to greet well-wishers who are expected to turn out from all over the world to see them.Here\u0027s everything you need to know about how to watch it and where to stand.Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will undertake a carriage ride through Windsor straight after the St George’s Chapel ceremony and before their reception. The journey is designed to allow members of the public to see the newlyweds in person while they are still dressed in their finery, in what is likely to be one of the most photographed occasions of the year.Such a display of ceremonial prowess has been used by kings and queens for centuries to celebrate as much as it has been used to impress their subjects and foreign powers. Be that with gun salutes, marching guards, or golden carriages. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge during their wedding carriage procession in 2011There is no doubt that this royal wedding will pack a punch, just like Queen Victoria\u0027s marriage to Albert which featured a 21-gun salute as she embarked on her carriage procession at St Jame\u0027s Palace.  But it was not until King George VI\u0027s marriage to Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon in 1923 that royal weddings became public affairs they were married to great fanfare in order to lift the spirits of the nation after World War One (and royal weddings have been lavish events ever since).At 1pm, immediately after the service, Prince Harry and Ms Markle will leave Windsor Castle by carriage. They will be driven along Castle Hill, the High Street and into Windsor town centre before returning along the beautiful, tree-lined Long Walk for their reception. The whole procession is expected to take just 25 minutes.Meanwhile, guests from the congregation will wait for the happy couple in St George\u0027s Hall, to celebrate the first of the day\u0027s two receptions.To see the newlyweds up close, the best positions will be on the 2.64 mile stretch that rolls from Snow Hill to the gates of Windsor Castle. This is known as the \u0027Long Walk\u0027. The length of this section will allow thousands of spectators to catch a glimpse of Harry and Meghan in the final minutes of the procession.  There will be events on the Long Walk  throughout the day, with live screens showing footage from the ceremony.  On the hilltop above the procession route, the eagle-eyed can find a sweeping aerial view of the carriage ride. Snow Hill will offer fantastic views of the final moments and will be a popular picnic spot on the day, so get there early to reserve a spot.According to legend, King Henry VIII sat on Snow Hill to wait for news of the execution of his second wife, Queen Anne Boleyn. A precedent that has fortunately not been followed since. Prince Edward and his bride Sophie Rhys-Jones pass the crowd inside the grounds of Windsor Castle in an open carriage in 1999Royal fans can also mingle with the residents of Windsor as the carriage passes through the streets of the town centre. Although you should probably arrive at the crack of dawn if you\u0027re after a front-row High Street viewing spot - it\u0027s bound to get busy.With Windsor dressed in bunting and ceremonial decorations – and bursting with local street entertainment – the town will provide a feast for the eyes. Expect big screens showing live footage of the wedding plus an array of food stalls and general facilities will be available at both the Long Walk and Alexandra Gardens.Spectators can also line the entirety of the procession route, on Castle Hill, High Street, Sheet Street, Kings Road, Albert Road and the Long Walk. Disabled viewing spots will be available at the junctions of Victoria Street and Albert Road. The council has advised that visitors should not bring tents, but foldable chairs and umbrellas are fine. Also look out for the weather forecast on the day, and prepare for large crowds with plenty of food supplies, water, and sun cream. Further information will be published on the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead Council website. Of the three parking options on offer, most motorists should make use of the 6,000 designated parking spaces available at the Review Ground, Windsor Great Park, which is located to the south of Windsor Castle and the town centre.  Parking tickets must be booked in advance for a price of £30. These are being allocated on a first-come, first-serve basis. With wedding invitations being sent to more than 2,000 members of the public and many more expected to watch the ceremony on the town\u0027s live screens, it\u0027s a good idea get these sooner rather than later.This car park opens at 4am and closes at 10pm. Though it is next to the Long Walk, motorists will have to take a 25 minute stroll to the nearest spectator spots.  The second parking option is provided by Windsor Racecourse\u0027s \u0027Park and Float\u0027 service, which must also be booked in advance. There are 3,000 spots available for £30, as well as weekend parking packages, and the opportunity to journey into the heart of Windsor on a return boat trip for £10. The third car park can be found at The Windsor Boy\u0027s School, where motorists can park on a first-come-first basis on the day without pre-booking. This is expected to fill-up early in the morning. To accommodate the large number of attendees at Windsor\u0027s public events over the weekend, there will also be a series of road closures, beginning with a 9am - 2pm closure of the procession route on Thursday May 17. Then, from 10pm on Friday May 18 and until late on Saturday May 19, road closures will affect the procession route and surrounding roads. During this time Windsor residents will be able to leave the road closure area, but only emergency services vehicles can enter.Access to the car park on the Long Walk will not be affected by the road closures in place, at any time. Road closures beyond the procession route will take effect from 6am on Saturday May 19 these include Maidenhead Road, Clarence Road, Alma Road, St Leonards Road, Frances Road, Barry Avenue, and Datchet Road. Local authorities suggest that you check this live map of road closures to check what time the roads reopen from Saturday evening onwards. Rail operators will be running a bumper service on the wedding to help everyone get in and out of the celebrations at Windsor, which is expected to be one of the largest one-day events ever held on the local rail network.  Both Great Western and South Western will be increasing train frequency and capacity, with trains running up to four times an hour from London Waterloo and Slough. These services will also benefit from extra carriages to keep up with the expected demand, given that some of the 100,000 expected visitors will arrive by public transport. Windsor is served by two train stations that are within minutes of the town centre and Windsor Castle, making the railway a reliable option for getting to the Royal wedding celebrations: Windsor and Eton Central and Windsor and Eton Riverside.Queuing systems are likely to be in place at London Waterloo, Slough, Staines, and Windsor, whilst \u0027park and walk\u0027 and \u0027park and glide\u0027 bus services will help people get into town.Great Western Railway services connect Windsor and Eton station to South Wales and the West of England, as well as Reading and Oxford, via Slough. This branch-line service will be running with four carriages running every 20 minutes, from the very early hours of the morning to late on Saturday night. The journey from Reading or Oxford takes around 30 - 50 minutes and 50 - 75 minutes respectively, with a change required at Slough. Cardiff and Swansea are around two and a half hours away from Windsor, requiring changes at Reading and then Slough. London is connected to Windsor via the direct Waterloo to Windsor and Eton Riverside service, which takes one hour. Travellers have been advised not to take the London Paddington - Slough route, in order to ease rail congestion around Windsor. From the Midlands, take a Cross Country service from Birmingham New Street to Reading, and then change at Slough for the Eton Riverside station. This takes around two and a half hours.Train services from the North require changes at London terminals. Almost five hours of train travel await any royal super-fans making their way from Newcastle.  Because it is such a huge event, it is wise to make travel plans ahead of time – so make ticket bookings and travel arrangements well before the big day. Up to date advice on the best routes and how to pre-book your tickets, can be found at: for Great Western Railway here and South Western Railway here.Royal wedding: the best hotels for celebrating Prince Harry\u0027s and Meghan Markle\u0027s big dayThere will be a designated pick up and drop off point on the wedding day at King Edward VII Hospital, St Leonards Road. This will be the termination point for buses towards Windsor, as well as local routes. A full timetable of buses is available at the Royal Borough website, and more information on transport and bus alterations can be found here. Hotels, B\u0026ampBs and guesthouses will be bursting at the seams, so expect no empty hotel rooms in town for the duration of the wedding weekend. Royal fans had only a few hours to book the local accommodation offerings before rooms ran out after the announcement that Windsor would play host for the big day.Many residents and visitors will no doubt find a solution via room sharing service AirBnb, with the average price of a room around Windsor currently standing at £321 for Friday night and £286 for the Saturday night. Such prices look like a bargain, with some of the most expensive hotel rooms in Windsor going for up to £10,000. Alternative locations with more \u0027last-minute\u0027 availability include Heathrow, Bracknell and Weybridge. The council also suggests that anyone wanting help to find accommodation can contact the Royal Windsor Information Centre on 01753 743907 or by emailing: windsor.accommodation@rbwm. gov.uk.The monarchy has embarked on grand processions from coronations, marriages, funerals and other state occasions since the 15th century. Each year, a carriage procession carries the Queen to the State Opening of Parliament and the races at Ascot, although royal weddings and coronations are arguably the grandest occasions.   The last royal couple to undertake a carriage procession in Windsor was Prince Edward and Sophie Rhys-Jones – now the Earl and Countess of Wessex – after their wedding in St George\u0027s Chapel in 1999.Prince Edward and Sophie Rhys-Jones pictured in their carriage after their wedding in 1999It was the biggest occasion in the Berkshire town since since the funeral of King George VI in 1952.More recently, the newly-wed Duke and Duchess of Cambridge travelled through Westminster in a 1902 State Landau after their 2011 wedding, waving at thousands of well-wishers who had packed the streets to catch a glimpse of the happy couple. It\u0027s possible Harry and Meghan could use the same carriage. Steeped in history, the carriage was specifically built for King Edward VII in 1902 and is usually used by the Queen to meet foreign heads of state when they arrive on state visits to Britain.The Prince and Princess of Wales used it to travel back from St Paul’s Cathedral after their 1981 royal wedding, as did the Duke and Duchess of York in 1986.

Here are all the latest updates about 2018\u0027s wedding of the year.Thomas Markle Snr had been intending to travel from his Mexico home to the UK to meet his future son-in-law for the first time, as well as the Queen, Prince Philip, Prince of Wales, Duchess of Cornwall and Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. He was also intending to walk Ms Markle down the aisle on Saturday, meeting her at the chapel\u0027s west door after her drive to the ceremony with her mother.But after disclosures about his alleged dealings with the paparazzi and reports he suffered a heart attack earlier this month, the 73-year-old said on Monday he would avoid the ceremony for fear of embarrassing his daughter.The Mail On Sunday newspaper reported the story at the weekend claiming the images were staged and published CCTV footage stills of the US actress\u0027 father in the internet cafe with a photographer.The pictures were published earlier this month in a number of newspapers and news websites showing Mr Markle in a series of royal wedding related activities, apparently unaware he was being snapped.Mr Markle was pictured being measured for what was thought to be his wedding suit, looking at screen pictures of Ms Markle and Harry while in an internet cafe, and reading a picture book about Britain while having a coffee.Thomas Markle Snr: How Meghan Markle\u0026#039s father set her on a path to stardomMs Markle\u0027s half-sister Samantha Markle attempted to shoulder some of the blame when she earlier tweeted it was her idea for Mr Markle to pose for what she described as positive photos in a bid to combat his bad portrayal in the press, but stated it was not done for money.A Kensington Palace said it was a deeply personal moment for Ms Markle in the days before her wedding and called for understand and respect to be extended to Mr Markle. It would not comment further.However, on Tuesday he raised hopes of attending after all by saying his daughter had been in touch to reassure him, and was prepared to fly to Britain if his medical condition allowed.Mr Markle is reported to have said: “I hate the idea of missing one of the greatest moments in history and walking my daughter down the aisle.”But within hours he appeared to change his plans for a third time, claiming he required heart surgery after falling unwell again.Meanwhile, other members of Ms Markle\u0027s family have arrived in London - depsite reportedly not receiving an invite to the wedding.Tracy Dooley – who was married to Meghan Markle\u0027s half-brother Thomas Markle Jr – was pictured at Heathrow Airport with her sons, Tyler, 25, and Thomas, 26 on Monday.Ms Dooley, who has admitted she has not seen Ms Markle for 20 years, has previously told ITV\u0027s Good Morning Britain she had not received an invitation to the ceremony at Windsor Castle on Saturday.Yet she is expected to cover the event for an American broadcasting network and said she will be in the front row cheering them on in Windsor.Days until the Royal WeddingThe wedding is this weekend - Saturday, May 19 - at St George’s Chapel in the grounds of Windsor Castle, where Prince Harry was christened. It is said to have become a very special place for the couple in their relationship so far. The Lord Chamberlain\u0027s Office at Buckingham Palace is responsible for organising royal weddings, but the Prince and Ms Markle are leading the show. However, under the guidance of Harry\u0027s private secretary, Edward Lane Fox, the Lord Chamberlain\u0027s Office is dealing with the ceremonial aspects of the day.The service will begin at 12pm. The public will have the opportunity to watch the action from their sofas with several broadcasters showing the ceremony live.Read more about how to watch the wedding here.Copy of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle: The story of their relationship, in picturesInvitations have been posted to 600 lucky guests, with a select 200 close friends invited to an after party at Frogmore House, in the grounds of Windsor Castle. The couple do not have an official list of political leaders on the guest list, which means neither Prime Minister Theresa May or US President Donald Trump will be going, and former US President Barack Obama has also missed out. Expect to see many members of the Royal family, Ms Markle\u0027s family (apart from her father, Thomas Markle Snr), famous faces from the cast of Suits, conservationists, sportsmen and women and charity heads closest to the couple’s hearts.Invitations for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s wedding in MayThose invited include Dave Henson, the former Team GB captain at the Invictus Games, the head of a tiny overlooked Welsh charity and the Botswanan friends so discreet even they do not know which others in their set are going.Some members of the public have received an invitation to wait in the grounds outside the chapel to watch the bride and groom and their wedding guests arrive and leave.As well a dress code, the guest list also reportedly includes \u0027critical guidance\u0027for the big day.The instructions ban cameras and bulky bags, adding that guests will be asked to surrender mobile telephones\u0085 and any devices used for image capture. They further specify that guests should not wear medals, in a list of suggestions about accessories that includes: No swords.Jessica Mulroney and Meghan Markle in 2016The invitations were produced by Barnard \u0026amp Westwood, which has held the Royal Warrant for Printing \u0026amp Bookbinding by Appointment to Her Majesty The Queen since 1985.Die-stamped in gold and then burnished, the invitation features The Three Feather Badge of The Prince of Wales. They also reveal that the dress code is Uniform, Morning Coat or Lounge Suit, or Day Dress with Hat.Read more about who is on the guest list here.The Duke of Cambridge will be Harry\u0027s best man, missing the FA Cup final to be at his brother\u0027s side.The Duke, who has always been the front-runner for the supporting role at the May wedding, is honoured to have been asked, Kensington Palace said.Prince William and Prince Harry in borrowed policemen outfitsKensington Palace has announced that Ms Markle will have no adult bridesmaids \u0027because she\u0027s unable to choose between her friends\u0027, and will instead be surrounded by children as page boys, bridesmaids and flower girls.On Wednesday, it was announced the bridesmaids are Princess Charlotte, Florence van Custem, Remi Litt, Rylan Litt, Ivy Mulroney and Zalie Warren. The pageboys are Prince George, Jasper Dyer, Brian Mulroney and John Mulroney.Royal siblings Prince George and Princess Charlotte already know the score - they performed those roles at the wedding of Pippa Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s younger sister, to James Matthews in May last year.  Prince Harry has paid tribute to former mentor and close friend Mark Dyer by requesting his son Jasper as a pageboy, while Ms Markle has publicly recognised one of her best friends, stylist Jessica Mulroney, by choosing her twin sons to take part in the wedding.Read more about the pageboys and bridesmaids here.Bookmakers suspended betting on the designer of Ms Markle\u0027s wedding dress in March when British couture company Ralph \u0026amp Russo pulled ahead to become 13 favourites.The label, helmed by Australians Tamara Ralph and Michael Russo (a couple in real life) have shot to prominence after a string of celebrity endorsements.In 2014, Angelina Jolie wore the label to Buckingham Palace to receive an honorary damehood, in 2016 Gwyneth Paltrow to the Oscars. Add to that list of fans Beyonce, Rihanna and, finally, Meghan Markle herself, who chose a £56,000 embellished couture gown for the official photos taken to mark her engagement to Prince Harry.Before betting was suspended, London-based designer Erdem was at 31. Ms Markle\u0027s stylist and close friend Ms Mulroney runs a bridal store in Toronto was said to have helped the bride choose her gown.Read more about Ralph and Russo here.The couple will be make their vows at St George\u0027s Chapel, which last hosted a royal wedding in May 2008 when Peter Phillips - son of The Princess Royal - married Autumn Kelly. The traditional ceremony will be conducted by The Dean of Windsor, The Rt Revd. David Conner while the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, will officiate as the couple make their marriage vows.Pioneering American bishop, the Most Rev Bishop Michael Curry, from Chicago, Illinois, has been invited to deliver the address as the couple strive to reflect their transatlantic relationship amid the tradition of St George\u0027s Chapel.Bishop Curry, who has been praised for his infectious laughter and self-deprecating humour, is the first African-American bishop to have served as the Episcopal Church\u0027s presiding bishop, a role he has held since November 2015.The music will also have an American influence according to Christopher Warren-Green, who will conduct musicians on the day.Miss Markle, who was a UN women\u0027s advocate, is unlikely to opt to obey the prince. The couple will probably choose the Series One (1966) Book of Common Prayer ceremony, just as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge did, which allows the bride to drop obey him and serve him from the religious proceedings.The regiments Prince Harry served with in Afghanistan will a have a “special place” during the ceremony.The 3 Regiment Army Air Corps, where the prince served as an Apache Pilot in Helmand Province will be represented, as well as The Royal Gurkha Rifles, his comrades in Afghanistan in 2007, and RAF Honington, where he is Honorary Air Commandant.Household Cavalry troopers will line the staircase at St George\u0027s Chapel, while streets within the precincts of the castle will be lined by members of the Windsor Castle Guard from 1st Battalion Irish Guards, and by Armed Forces personnel from the Royal Navy Small Ships and Diving, which has the Prince as Commodore-in-Chief, and the Royal Marines, where he is Captain General.Read more about St George\u0027s Chapel here.WATCH: How Diana, the in-laws and Prince Louis will fit into the Royal WeddingAfter the ceremony, among the first people to congratulate the couple will be some of the 2,640 charity workers, community champions and local school children who are being invited to watch the wedding from inside the walls of Windsor Castle. Then at 1pm, the newlyweds will undertake a two mile tour of Windsor in an Ascot Landau carriage, greeting well-wishers, which is expected to take 25 minutes.It\u0027s the same carriage the prince used in the procession at the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton,when he was surrounded by small bridesmaids and page boys.The couple will leave Windsor Castle by carriage via Castle Hill, travelling along the High Street and through Windsor Town before returning along the Long Walk for the first reception at St George\u0027s Hall.Read more about the procession here.Wedding at Windsor CastleFollowing the carriage ride, the congregation will await the happy couple in St George\u0027s Hall, for the first of two receptions.The first, more formal afternoon reception for some 600 guests, will be hosted by the Queen. The 180-ft long room, traditionally used for state banquets, seats up to 162 people and was redesigned in a modern Gothic style – with walls lined with suits of armour – following the fire at the castle in 1992.Fashionable \u0027bowl food\u0027 will be served at the standing-only reception. Made with seasonal ingredients grown on the Crown Estates, the food is intended to be eaten standing up, allowing guests to mingle freely in St George’s Hall.The food is likely to be accompanied by champagne and wine from the extensive Royal cellars, and soft drinks.The second evening reception, for 200 close friends and family, will be thrown at Frogmore House by the Prince of Wales. Standing about half a mile south of Windsor Castle in Windsor Home Park, Frogmore House has been a Royal Residence since 1792. It is where Harry and Ms Markle posed for their official engagement photos in November.The location of the venue - away from the Castle - will offer the pair privacy as they celebrate with friends and family.Read more about the food here.The couple have asked Claire Ptak, an east London pastry chef, to make an organic lemon and elderflower wedding cake incorporating the bright flavours of spring, according to Kensington Palace. It will be covered with buttercream and decorated with fresh flowers.It is believed to be the first time a Royal couple have eschewed tradition by not serving a fruit cake to their wedding guests.Claire Ptak, owner of Violet Bakery in Hackney, east LondonThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge chose Fiona Cairns to make their 2011 wedding cake, a traditional multi-layered fruit cake with a floral design.Read more about the wedding cake here.The couple have chosen high society florist Philippa Craddock to design their day, using seasonal plants and flowers from the Crown Estates and Royal Parks chosen particularly for their pollinator-friendly properties.Aisles, pews, tables and halls will be lined with plants from wildflower meadows, picked to “provide a great habitat for bees and help to nurture and sustain entire ecosystems by promoting a healthy and bioerse environment”, Kensington Palace said.Ms Craddock has been named “Queen of London florists” by British Vogue and “a floral mastermind” by Tatler.Peonies are one of Ms Markle\u0027s favourite flowers, so it is likely her floral bouquet will include these fragrant blooms, which are in season in May.Read more about the wedding florist here.The prince will be putting pen to paper to write his speech for their reception. But Ms Markle, who is an accomplished public speaker, is expected to break with tradition and deliver her own as well, offering “affectionate” praise of her new husband, thanks to the Queen and a few suitable jokes.The former actress, is “ready” to speak at the reception, should her father choose to avoid the limelight, the Sunday Times reported earlier this year.Mr Markle, an award-winning Hollywood writing director who now lives a quiet life in Mexico, was expected to walk Ms Markle down the aisle before changing his plans to attend.At the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, reception speeches included words from best man Prince Harry, the groom’s father the Prince of Wales and Michael Middleton, who affectionately described how he knew his daughter’s relationship was serious when her boyfriend landed a helicopter in his garden.Meghan Markle and her mother, Doria Radlan at the Invictus GamesMs Markle will become an HRH and a senior royal after marrying Prince Harry. She is also expected to become a duchess, as Kate Middleton did when she became the Duchess of Cambridge after saying her vows in 2011.By tradition, male members of the Royal family receive a title from the monarch on their wedding day, and the vacant title Duke of Sussex is regarded as the most likely choice for the Prince, meaning Ms Markle would become HRH The Duchess of Sussex.Like Prince Harry, the previous Duke of Sussex lived at Kensington Palace, and he also married for love, rather than choosing brides who fitted the traditional royal mould.Read more about royal titles here.Prince William and his wife Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, outside Westminster Abbey on their wedding day in 2011The wedding is on a Saturday, so there will be no new bank holiday. Although the public were given a day off to celebrate the weddings of Prince Charles to Diana Spencer in 1981, Prince William to Catherine Middleton in 2011, and Princess Anne to Mark Phillips in 1973, no such national holidays were awarded for Prince Andrew or Prince Edward.However, it\u0027s not all bad news because pubs and bars will be allowed to do away with the usual curbs on opening hours on the wedding weekend. Ministers have extended licensing hours across Britain to allow venues to remain open until 1am on Friday and Saturday - which is also the day of the FA Cup final.There will also be lots of street parties planned across the UK.For information about how to host your own, click here.The royal bride and groom-to-be have approved a range of commemorative china to celebrate their nuptials. The exclusive design in white and cornflower blue has a monogram of the couple\u0027s initials at its centre, tied together with white ribbons and surmounted by the coronet of Prince Harry.  The decorative border of each piece is inspired by the ironwork of the 13th-century Gilebertus door of St George\u0027s Chapel and each is finished with 22-carat gold.The Royal Collection Trust range, which is made in Stoke-on-Trent, includes a decorative miniature coffee mug, coffee mug, pillbox, tankard and plate. The Royal wedding souvenir phenomenon dates back to Queen Victoria’s wedding to Prince Albert in 1840, linked to the rise of mass production in Victorian Britain. It remains a thriving industry today, with an estimated £222 million spent on memorabilia in the run-up to the 2011 royal wedding, according to the Centre for Retail Research.Prince Harry and Ms Markle will delay their honeymoon to go straight back to work in the week after their wedding, scheduling their first public engagement as a married couple just days later.The couple will go on honeymoon privately later this year, before a “busy” autumn including a trip to Sydney for the Invictus Games. But where will they go?Namibia has pulled ahead as the odds-on favourite. The southern African nation is best known among travellers for the enormous Sossusvlei sand dunes of the the Namib Desert, but reports suggest that the couple are looking instead at a safari trip to Hoanib Valley Camp in the country\u0027s north west.Botswana, where they holidayed in the early days of their whirlwind relationship, is also a good bet, (Ms Markle\u0027s engagement ring features diamonds from Diana\u0027s personal collection, and a stone from Botswana), but wherever they go, the newlyweds will be looking for seclusion away from the limelight as they start their married life together.Other possible destinations could include Tuscany, Hawaii, Turkey and the Philippines.Read more about the honeymoon options here.Meghan Markle and Prince Harry wedding features gridPrince Harry and Meghan MarkleRoyal Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan MarkleSuper fit police officer died while scuba ing as she went for a run the night before, inquest hears Meet Meghan Markle\u0026#39s family: The yoga teacher, the diplomat and the cannabis farmerHow to watch Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s royal wedding this SaturdayWhat royal titles will Meghan Markle and Prince Harry have after the wedding?Meet Doria Ragland: How Meghan Markle\u0026#39s mother became her rock and best friendUK weather: Royal wedding could be on the hottest day of the yearMeghan Markle: The American actress and newest addition to the royal familyRamadan 2018: Why Muslims celebrate the revelation of the KoranDambusters 75th anniversary: How the Second World War raid unfolded, hour by hourSyrian and Russian forces launch large-scale attack on Palestinian refugee camp controlled by IsilProcession route map for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s wedding day - where to spot the royal coupleRoyal wedding guest list: Here\u0026#39s who has received an invite from Harry and MeghanBridesmaids and pageboys announced for Harry and Meghan\u0026#39s Royal wedding - George and Charlotte to take centre stageComment: If Donald Trump wants a successful deal with North Korea, the US has to stop using the Libya exampleAlgarve coach crash: 14 British tourists hurt in motorway smash with tanker on their way to airportNorth Korea takes aim at John Bolton as it threatens to scrap Trump summit over nuclear demands\u0026#39She\u0026#39s a good hugger and she has nice perfume.\u0026#39 Schoolgirl Sophia Roberts, 10, on meeting Meghan MarkleHow Prince Harry and Meghan Markle met - a look back at the matchmaker who started the couple\u0026#39s royal romanceFour men with samurai swords shot dead after Isil-claimed attack on Indonesia police stationWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/05/10/TELEMMGLPICT000147765142_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqBkgTubK2nUGJfXAw3Hj_sHdPYRjgfD-mIEJt7w0iV5Q.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"royal wedding guest list has received invite harry meghan","story":"Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are due to wed this Saturday 19 MayWith only three days left until the royal wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, the final details are being fine-tuned.

Prince Edward also wed Sophie, the Countess of Wessex, there in June 1999 plus Prince Harry was christened there in 1984 by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Robert Runcie.Members of the public who have been invited to watch from the grounds of Windsor Castle will  begin to arrive from 9am.Guests will arrive between 9:30am and 11am by coach. Two driving routes have been suggested, with guests required to meet at the Windsor Farm Shop – founded in 2001 after the Duke of Edinburgh had an idea to support local businesses by selling produce.Wedding at Windsor CastleThere, three miles away from the venue, guests will be put through security checks and asked to show identification they will then be ushered onto buses to travel to Windsor Castle, where they will alight at the castle\u0027s Round Tower and enter the chapel through the south door.Instructions reportedly sent to the guests ban cameras and bulky bags, adding that guests will be asked to surrender mobile telephones\u0085 and any devices used for image capture.The rules further specify that guests should not wear medals, in a list of suggestions about accessories that includes: No swords.At 11:20am, members of the Royal Family will arrive and enter the chapel through the Galilee Porch. Some will arrive in state car from the Royal Mews, including Bentleys, Rolls-Royces and Daimlers.A view of the Quire in St George\u0026#39s Chapel at Windsor Castle, where Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will have their wedding servicePrince Harry and his brother and best man the Duke of Cambridge are expected to arrive at the chapel\u0027s west steps at 11:45am. It is assumed they will enter the grounds on foot, giving Prince Harry the opportunity to walk past the crowds in the grounds. He will pass 200 representatives from charities he is associated with, who are expected to gather in the horseshoe cloister at the bottom of the steps.The Queen will be the final member of the Royal Family to arrive for the service, and is expected at 11:55am.The service will begin at 12pm, with Ms Markle due to arrive at the chapel\u0027s west steps at 11:59am.She has chosen her mother, Doria, to travel with her to the wedding, travelling from their overnight accommodation to St George’s Chapel by car. The decision breaks with UK tradition, which usually sees the bride travel with her father before he gives her away in the wedding ceremony.Instead, Ms Markle wanted to include both parents in her wedding day. When the car stops at the castle, her mother will exchange places with the bridesmaids and pageboys. Ms Ragland will enter the chapel by the Galilee Porch.The most beautiful royal wedding dresses of all timeHowever, while it was planned that Meghan\u0027s father would meet her at the chapel\u0027s west door before walking her down the aisle, this step of the day has been thrown into confusion. On Monday it was reported the father-of-the-bride revealed he no longer intends to travel from Mexico to the UK to attend the ceremony it is still unconfirmed who will walk the bride down the aisle.The traditional ceremony will be conducted by the Dean of Windsor, The Rt Revd. David Conner while the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, will officiate as the couple make their marriage vows. Under the guidance of Harry\u0027s private secretary, Edward Lane Fox, the Lord Chamberlain\u0027s Office is dealing with the ceremonial aspects of the day.It is assumed that Ms Markle is unlikely to opt to obey the prince and will probably choose the Series One (1966) Book of Common Prayer ceremony, just as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge did. This allows the bride to drop the phrases obey him and serve him from the religious proceedings. Harry must decide whether to wear a wedding ring William does not wear one.The regiments Prince Harry served with in Afghanistan will also have a special place during the ceremony. Household Cavalry troopers will line the staircase at St George\u0027s Chapel, while streets within the precincts of the castle will be lined by members of the Windsor Castle Guard from 1st Battalion Irish Guards, and by Armed Forces personnel from the Royal Navy Small Ships and Diving, which has the Prince as Commodore-in-Chief, and the Royal Marines, where he is Captain General.The 3 Regiment Army Air Corps, where Prince Harry served as an Apache Pilot in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, will also be represented, as well as The Royal Gurkha Rifles, his comrades in Afghanistan in 2007, and RAF Honington, where he is Honorary Air Commandant.The service will end at 1pm and the newlyweds will leave the chapel at the west steps, before leaving the castle by carriage. Prince Harry and Ms Markle will be driven for two miles along Castle Hill, the High Street and into Windsor town centre before returning along the beautiful, tree-lined Long Walk for their reception.Kensington Palace has said: Prince Harry and Ms Markle are very much looking forward to this short journey which they hope will be a memorable moment for everyone who has gathered together in Windsor to enjoy the atmosphere of this special day.While we don\u0027t know for sure how long the procession will take, a similar procession in 1999 by Edward and Sophie took 15 minutes.The best photo opportunity will be the West Steps of St George’s Chapel, when the bride and groom and their families emerge after the service. If you are lucky enough to be in Windsor on the day, head for the grass of the Horseshoe Cloisters opposite those steps for the view.The Ascot Landau open carriage stands in the Royal Mews at Buckingham Palace in LondonThe newlyweds will make their journey through Windsor in an open-topped Ascot Landau carriage, Kensington Palace has confirmed. It is the same carriage Prince Harry used in the procession at the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton, when he was surrounded by small bridesmaids and page boys.Crown Equerry Colonel Toby Browne, who runs the royal mews where the carriage was selected, said: The fair weather option, the Ascot Landau, it was selected because it\u0027s a wonderfully bright, small, lovely carriage.

The invitations have been dispatched, the cake is being iced and the final flourishes are being added to the wedding gown. For those of us not lucky enough to be on the guest list or among the members of the public invited to Windsor, the next best option is to watch live from home. As with previous royal weddings and milestone celebrations, you can expect hours of television coverage streamed live from the lawns of Windsor Castle and the heights of St George\u0027s Chapel nave. This wedding will go beyond the heights of Suits, in which Ms Markle stars, or The Crown. There will be as much tradition and pomp as any drama or history series ever needed. The schedule for the royal day means you can expect cheering crowds in any weather packing the pavements of Windsor and thousands celebrating in their local communities at street parties across the nation. To make sure you catch every second on TV - including the dizzying spectacle of the FA Cup Final which falls on the same day - read on.  Not long to go...

The wedding and procession will be televised live on networks around the world.

The series follows Indian guru Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, also known as Osho, and the free-love community which built up around him in Oregon in the 1980s.It’s perhaps the archetypal image of the cult we’ve come to recognise: the followers of Rajneesh, who died in 1990, dressed in orange their leader was a charismatic Indian guru (who relocated to the US after the Indian government frowned upon his activities) the disciples gave huge amounts of cash to their figurehead, lost contact with their families.But cults don’t have to follow the pattern of Rajneeshpuram, as the Oregon ranch was renamed, or the bloodbaths at Jonestown or Waco, where David Koresh’s sect the Branch Davidians was raided by the FBI in 1993. More often than not, they are more mundane than that… but no less damaging.Rajneesh, also known as Osho, with his ‘Orange People’ followers (Netflix)Katy Morgan-Davies last month published a book about her experiences living in Brixton with the cult leader – and her father – Aravindan Balakrishnan, who was jailed on charges of rape and imprisonment in 2015. Morgan-Davies managed to flee the cult in 2013 after 30 years – her entire life.Cults are back in the news again, but for Ian Haworth they never went away. As the head of the UK-based Cult Information Centre, he spends his life collating information on cults, offering advice and help to those who have escaped – or wish to – and campaigns for stricter legislation to control the reach and influence of these malign groups.“I’ve dealt with more than 1,000 different cults,” says Haworth. “That includes the Rajneesh group. The Netflix documentary series has generated a lot of interest internationally, which can’t be a bad thing.”Katy Morgan-Davies, 33, formerly known as Rosie Davies, who was kept as a prisoner by her father Aravindan Balakrishnan (PA)That interest comes in peaks and troughs, naturally, with particular focus at the moment thanks to Wild Wild Country and Morgan-Davies’ memoir. Haworth says: “I suppose the biggest peak we’ve had began on 1 January 1999, when there was a huge amount of cult activity related to the millennium, when all kinds of things were promised or predicted. Of course, mathematically, the millennium ended at the end of the year 2000, not the end of 1999, but cult leaders don’t really care about such things. They care about money, and controlling people, and power.”Born in Lancashire, the son of a farmer, Haworth emigrated to Canada in 1972 while in his twenties. By 1978 he was working as a communications consultant for a large company, and had never given a thought to cults. Aged 31, he happened to be stopped by a woman with a clipboard in a Toronto street.After fleeing a cult in 1978, Ian Haworth has dedicated his life to helping others in the same situation (Cult Information Centre)“She was very attractive and I was very single,” remembers Haworth. “When she asked me if I had time to answer a few questions for what I thought was market research, I said yes.”But after only half a dozen questions, the tone of the exchange altered. The woman told Haworth that his answers indicated he’d fit in very well with a group she was involved with, and that it would enable him to give something back to society rather than just taking. A meeting was taking place the following week and Haworth was invited along.“I turned up and there were about a hundred people there,” he says. “A woman was talking about her addiction to alcohol and drugs, and how this group had helped her. I was planning to sneak away at the end, because I’d been brought up to be polite and didn’t want to just walk out. Then they brought out drinks and cakes, and as I’d paid $2 (£1.50) to attend I decided I might as well get my money’s worth before leaving.”The world of Cults: in picturesThe world of Cults: in picturesAravindan Balakrishnan, known as ‘Comrade Bala’ within the women-only collective he founded 40 years ago, carried out a brutal campaign of sexual degradation against the women over several decades. In this picture, he stands with some of his cult followers including his daughter. Rexwords by Hardeep Matharu Balakrishnan brainwashed the cult into thinking he had God-like powers and that he could read their minds, as a means of subjecting them to years of abuse.politan Policewords by Hardeep Matharu Katy Morgan-Davies, 33, formerly known as Rosie Davies, who was kept as a prisoner by her father Aravindan Balakrishnan. Revealing her real identity, Miss Morgan-Davies said that waiving her anonymity was an important step – “to retrieve the identity the cult tried to steal from me”.\u0026#13PAwords by Hardeep Matharu Evidence picture showing the bedroom of the imprisoned daughter of Aravindan Balakrishnan. She was banned from leaving the house unaccompanied and routinely psychologically and physically abused.\u0026#13Rexwords by Hardeep Matharu Boarded up windows in Peckford Place, Brixton, south London. Aravindan Balakrishnan was jailed for 23 years in 2016. To keep his devotees in check, Balakrishnan invented \u0027Jackie\u0027, which he said could kill or trigger earthquakes if anyone went against his will. He claimed that a challenge to his leadership resulted in the 1986 space shuttle disaster and Jackie, an invisible war machine, was responsible for the election of Jeremy Corbyn as Labour party leader. PAwords by Hardeep Matharu Jim Jones, founder of the Peoples Temple sect in Jonestown, north Guyana, in 1978. Believers of the Peoples Temple of the Disciples of Christ followed Reverend Jones to Guyana in the Seventies, hoping to create a utopia in the jungle. Jonestown was envisaged as a “rainbow family” of all ages and races, the preacher had promised them: “Divine principles. Total equality. A society where people own all things in common, where there is no rich or poor, where there are no races.” APwords by Adam LusherReverend Jones wanted to create a glorious sacrifice, a defiant act of “revolutionary suicide” that would echo through history. Some disciples willingly colluded, cheering as he exhorted them to kill themselves and their children. But the bodies found with bent needles in their arms testified to the fact that some refused and were forcibly injected. Rexwords by Adam LusherWhen they finally counted the bodies after what would become known as the Jonestown massacre of 18 November 1978, the total came to 918, of whom 304 were children. They had been persuaded to “drink the Kool-Aid”, Flavor Aid, used to mask the bitter taste of cyanide, mixed with a dash of Valium.APwords by Adam LusherMaude Julien, now 60, was forced to hold onto an electric fence for without showing feeling as a child. The ritual was considered to be a test of her willpower by her father, who wanted to make her “superhuman”.\u0026#13Indian guru Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, also known as Osho, and the free-love community which was built up around him in Oregon in the 1980s. Rajneesh, who died in 1990, was a charismatic Indian guru (who relocated to the US after the Indian government frowned upon his activities). His disciples gave huge amounts of cash to their figurehead and lost contact with their families.During a break he went into the corridor for a cigarette, and that’s when the cult members pounced. Haworth had seen his doctor not long before and been told if he carried on smoking like he did he’d be lucky to see 40. The group told him that they would absolutely guarantee he would stop smoking if he attended a further course for $220. He’d already looked into smoking-cessation courses that were of comparable cost, so decided he’d give this one a go.“The course took place in September, 1978,” says Haworth. “By the end of the course I’d given notice at my job, promised to dedicate my life to the cult, and handed over all my savings, which amounted to about $1,500.”Jonestown commune mass suicide in 1978 (AP)Even now, Haworth cannot identify the tipping point that turned him from someone who’d turned up for a meeting at the behest of an attractive woman to someone who gave himself, body and soul, to a cult, other than mid-way through the course when he stopped smoking. “I suppose that was the moment I went over to them – they had done what they said they would do.”Cults often thrive on feeding into people’s desires. Sometimes they will promise success, artistic or creative talent, fulfil a desire in their targets to effect social change or, as with Haworth, to “give something back” to the world. They will promise freedom from addictions or improved physical or mental health. They’re what Haworth calls therapy cults, as opposed to the religious cults that offer more spiritual promises.If you’re born into a cult you don’t have that ‘Real Ian’ vs ‘Cult Ian’ internal battle that I had. You emerge from that and the first question is… who am I? It’s an incredibly difficult and delicate situationOver the next month, Haworth tried to recruit his friends and even neighbours to the group. They were appalled at the change in him, but, he says, “I thought they were wrong, I knew they weren’t part of the elite, like I was.”It was an almost textbook recruitment, and Haworth firmly believes he would have been lost to everyone who knew him but for one error on the part of the cult. “Most cults programme their members against the media very early on. These people didn’t do that,” he says. And that was what saved him.A neighbour gave him a copy of the Toronto Star which had featured a front-page exposé of the group Haworth was involved in, written by the investigative reporter Sidney Katz. Haworth read the piece and contacted Katz immediately to verify his facts. He then, as he describes it, “fell apart at the seams”. Having seen Katz’s research and evidence first hand, at the invitation of the journalist, Haworth angrily confronted the cult’s leaders, and they effectively banished him. He was finally free of them.“That was in October,” he says. “Then, in the November, everything came out about the Jonestown cult. And I knew that could have been me. It took me 11 months to fully recover and get back to myself.”NXIVM (which calls itself a ‘multi-level marketing organisation’) member Allison Mack leaving US District Court after her bail hearing in Brooklyn (Getty)It took that long for the nagging whispers of “Cult Ian”, as Haworth describes the person he was when he was with the group, to be finally silenced, and for “Real Ian” to reassert himself. And good sense would dictate that was the point he turned his back on cults forever and got on with his life.“I come from a farming background in Lancashire,” says Haworth. “People used to say, ‘If there’s summat up, then tha’ does summat about it’. So I did summat about it.”Sidney Katz put Haworth in touch with a TV producer called Peter Scott and together they set up what was first called the Council for Mind Abuse, and which later metamorphosed into the Cult Information Centre in 1987, now run as a charity.I’ve dealt with more than 1,000 different cults. That includes the Rajneesh group. The Netflix documentary series has generated a lot of interest internationally, which can’t be a bad thingHaworth and Scott concentrated on the group he had been involved with, even handing out flyers to a party of new recruits flown into Canada, exhorting them to go back to the airport. Faced with Haworth’s evidence, many of them did. Eventually, the resistance proved too much for the group. “Toronto wasn’t big enough for the both of us,” he smiles. “They got out.”Haworth doesn’t know where they are now, or if they still exist. Cults change their names often, to keep one step ahead of the media or inquisitive minds, and to muddy the paper trail they leave behind. Besides, he soon had more than enough on his plate as more and more people began to get in touch, especially after he had relocated back to the UK.One of the Cult Information Centre’s primary roles is working with ex-cult members. He likens the trauma that recovering cult followers go through to PTSD, and says systems to deal with and help them are variable, if present at all.He would also like to see stronger laws to deal with cults there’s no specific legislation surrounding them, and it’s only when cult leaders are discovered to have committed actual crimes, such as Aravindan Balakrishnan in 2015, that the law can act.Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh surrounded by devotees (Netflix)The Aravindan Balakrishnan case, and the revelations of Katy Morgan-Davies in her new book, add an extra dimension to Haworth’s work. It’s one thing to try to help cult members who have managed to break free return to their old, pre-cult lives, but what of those born into cults?“If you’re born into a cult you don’t have that ‘Real Ian’ vs ‘Cult Ian’ internal battle that I had,” says Haworth. “You emerge from that and the first question is… who am I? It’s an incredibly difficult and delicate situation.”And don’t think it is only stupid people who would fall for a cult. Experts say that cults are most likely to be attractive to intelligent, well-educated people… they have flexible minds can consider and be seduced by the alternative lifestyles offered by cults.Documentary about alleged sex cult NXIVM being producedSmallville actor allegedly tried to recruit Emma Watson to ‘sex cult’Waco: what really happened when David Koresh’s cult faced the FBI?From Jonestown in the Seventies to Rajneeshpuram in the 1980s to Brixton in the 2000s: cults endure, and spring up all across the world. Nothing about modern life and its complexities has inured us against the attractions of a charismatic guru or cult leader.“They start off wanting the usual things,” says Haworth. “Money, sex, power over people. Then, after perhaps about 10 years, they start to believe the things they say, they maybe start to believe they are gods.”And as long as the false gods continue to prey on the innocent, Ian Haworth will continue his 40-years-and-counting battle against the scourge of the cults.For more information on Haworth’s work at the Cult Information Centre go to cultinformation.org.ukor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Or, you know, just google it.Jokes aside, this is actually a good question. The sun sets at marginally different times across the country – a minute later in Newcastle than in Sunderland and a whole half an hour earlier in London than Edinburgh.This is important because breaking the fast even a minute too early could render the day invalid, so it’s vital for hungry families who are counting down the minutes to know precisely when the moment comes. Fasting is not supposed to hinder your health, so anyone with a pre-existing medical condition likely to fall ill as a result of the fast is not expected to adhere to it.It is for this reason that children, those on prescription medicines, the infirm and elderly, pregnant women and those on their period are not required to participate.Not between the hours of sunrise and sunset, no sir.Yeah all day. Nothing at all. Zilch. Zero. Just that sweet oxygen. It’s common for Muslims to treat themselves to a few farewell rounds of their favourite dishes before Ramadan begins but, after that, it’s very much a matter of personal preference.Some go for soups, salad and dates while others are partial to samosas and kebabs. Those who indulge with a hearty blowout are setting themselves up for a much worse bout of hunger the next day so many prefer to eat moderately.Overdoing it with hot or salty foods, meanwhile, can leave you badly dehydrated and given that you can’t drink water the following day...That’s the idea.Absolutely not. There’s a strong expectation that all non-Muslims must refrain from eating in the company of a fasting Muslim.Doing otherwise is regarded as grossly offensive and insensitive.Oh yes. Every time a non-Muslim eats during Ramadan, a fairy dies of sadness and then bursts into flames.This is a contentious issue but some say as long as you’re not actually devouring Colgate by the tube, it’s fine.However some devout Muslims feel uneasy about the practice and prefer to brush with a finely-fibred miswak twig instead.Don’t be an idiot.In pictures: Ramadan around the worldIn pictures: Ramadan around the worldRussian Muslims pray outside the central mosque in Moscow, during celebrations of Eid al-Fitr marking the end of the fasting month of RamadanTurkish Muslims offer Eid al Fitr prayers as they mark the first day of the Eid al-Fitr at Fatih Sultan Mosque in IstanbulA Syrian Dervish dances as part of a traditional event organised by the Syrian Ministry of Tourism under the title \u0027Music and Dervishes\u0027 in the old city of DamascusA Bosnian Muslim man, wearing a traditional Bosnian outfit, fires a canon from a vantage point overlooking Sarajevo to mark the end of daily fasting on the final day of the Islamic holy month of RamadanA general view of an illuminated Mosque as Muslims pray during the 27th night of Ramadan, in PeshawarMuslim women offer prayer of the Jumat-ul-wida, the last Friday of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan at a mosque in LahoreMuslims offer prayers on the last Friday of the holy month of Ramadan in Dargah Khwaja Moinuddin Chisti The Prophet Mohammed Mosque in the holy city of Medina, during Ramadan A Malaysian swings around fireworks to celebrate the last day of the Muslims\u0027 Holy fasting month of Ramadan, in Shah Alam, outside Kuala LumpurKyrgyz Muslims pray during the Eid al-Fitr Muslim celebration marking the end of Ramadan in BishkekPeople pray during the Laylat Al Qadr prayers on the 27th day of the Islamic month of fasting, Ramadan in the front of the Aghin mosque in AbidjanSyrians shop for traditional sweets in Kafr Batna in the rebel-held Eastern Ghouta area, on the outskirts of the capital Damascus, ahead of Eid al-Fitr which marks the end of the Muslim holy month of RamadanA Palestinian woman prays on the third Friday of the holy fasting month of Ramadan on the compound known to Muslims as Noble Sanctuary and to Jews as Temple Mount in Jerusalem\u0027s Old CityIranian Shiite Muslims pray at the graves of soldiers who were killed during 1980-88 Iran-Iraq War, at the Behesht-e-Zahra cemetery, during the holy fasting month of Ramadan, just outside Tehran, IranA Palestinian man pours water on Muslim worshippers\u0027 heads to cool off in the heat, as others pray outside the Dome of the Rock at the al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem during the last Friday prayers of the Muslim holy month of RamadanAfghan women wait to receive food ration during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan in HeratA Pakistani Muslim reads the holy Koran as he observes Itikaf at a Mosque, in PeshawarKashmiri Muslim women offer prayers as the head priest (not pictured) displays a holy relic believed to be hair from the beard of the Prophet Mohammed, during special prayers to observe the Martyr Day of Hazrat Ali, cousin of Prophet Mohammed, on the 21st day of Ramadan, at the Hazratbal Shrine in Srinagar, the summer capital of Indian KashmirIndian Muslims sit with bowls of porridge(Nombu kanji)as they prepare to break the fast with the Iftar meal during the Islamic month of Ramadan at The Wallajah Big Mosque in Chennai Spectators watch fireworks as a giant Fanous, or Ramadan lantern, is switched on four days before the start of Ramadan month in front of Mohamed al-Amine Mosque in downtown BeirutLebanese children perform during activities celebrating the upcoming Muslim holy month of Ramadan, in downtown BeirutPalestinian men drink tea on the promenade of Gaza beach Members of Nahdlatul Ulama, the biggest Muslim organisation in Indonesia, hold a mass prayer session to welcome in Ramadan in Jakarta Iraqis shop for food in a preparation for the Muslim holy month of Ramadan in BaghdadFoods is seen during \u0027Unggah-unggahan\u0027 ceremony to welcome in the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan in Pekuncen villageIn the short term, yes, you might do, depending on how much you consume in the evenings.But given that your metabolism quickly adjusts to your calorie intake, you will quickly put the pounds back on afterwards when you return to your usual dietary regime.Looking beach-ready is not really the main goal of this solemn observance anyway. Its true purpose is to bring followers closer to Allah and prompt a re-evaluation of yourself as a Muslim.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Moments later, Home Office official Hugh Ind told MPs the figure was ”up to five”.Mr Ind also admitted during his evidence that about £3.3m was paid out last year in compensation for detentions later ruled unlawful in the courts, and acknowledged that there was a “deep problem” with wrongful immigration detentions.When quizzed on whether Windrush citizens had been wrongly detained during the hearing on Tuesday, Mr Javid said he did not know, saying his priority was to know whether people had been wrongly been deported.UK news in picturesUK news in picturesA demonstrator holds a flare during a protest against Turkey\u0027s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan outside the entrance to Downing Street in central London.The funeral cortege of Alfie Evans goes past Everton\u0027s Goodison Park ground in Liverpool.

Another is those who were refused entry.

It is theirs as a right, just like it is my right and the right of most people in this room today.Labour will end this scandalous practice.Ms Abbott said a Labour government would commit the \u0026pound20 million a year it would save from closing Yarl\u0027s Wood, which is run by Serco, and Brook House, run by G4S, to support the survivors of modern slavery, trafficking and domestic abuse.People are being kept in detention for months, even years on end. They include the Windrush generation, victims of torture, refugees and victims of sexual exploitation, she said.Yarl\u0027s Wood in particular has caused so much pain to vulnerable women that we should have been protecting. Diverting these resources directly to them is not only essential, but the right thing to do.She added: This Government and its predecessors have long had an obsession with enriching the private sector from the public purse. This is despite the costs, either financially, in shoddy service or in human misery.Labour will end this rotten system. Private firms have no business in detention.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

They have been in negotiations since Thursday in a bid to fuse their differing policies into a workable joint platform to end a 10-week political stalemate.Berlusconi allowed to run again for election as Italy’s prime minister“It has been a very productive day,” 31-year-old Mr Di Maio told reporters on Sunday, following several hours of talks with his counterpart in Milan.  He said they were close to a “historic” agreement, but their choice of prime minister has not yet been announced and confusion remains over who it will be.The Five Star Movement won 32 per cent of the vote at the election and the League took 17 per cent, making them the two largest groups in parliament.The leaders both said their talks on Sunday made progress on a policy document which is likely to be tough on immigration and the EU. Mr Salvini has previous pledged illegal immigrants would be rounded up and sent home “in 15 minutes” if he and his allies take power.The two parties are said to have agreed on who would be prime minister but there has been no word on who would lead the proposed government, with neither Mr Salvini nor Mr Di Maio willing to let the other take the helm.The far-right leader argues that, although his party has far fewer votes, he represents a centre-right alliance that won the support of 37 per cent of the electorate. That alliance also includes former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi‘s party Forza Italia, which said during the election campaign it would use the police and the military to round up 600,000 undocumented migrants and deport them if it came to power.The League and Five Star Movement have been in discussions over nominating an independent figure to lead the government, without allegiance to either party.On Sunday, Mr Di Maio said the prime minister would be a “political” figure, rather than a non-partisan technocrat.A 71-year-old economist and university professor, Giulio Sapelli, said on Monday he had spoken to both leaders and would be willing to do the job as long as former centre-right economy minister Domenico Siniscalco was appointed finance minister.Mr Sapelli said another candidate for the prime minister’s job was also under consideration law professor Giuseppe Conte.World news in picturesWorld news in picturesPalestinians run away from tear gas shot at them by Israeli forces during a protest in Ramallah, in the occupied West BankA Palestinian demonstrator runs during a protest against the US embassy move to Jerusalem and ahead of the 70th anniversary of the Nakba at the Israel-Gaza border.A bullet hole on the window of a cafe in Paris, the day after a knifeman killed one man and wounded four other people before being shot dead by policeGermany\u0027s Chancellor Angela Merkel looks on after receiving the \u0027Lamp of Peace, the Nobel Catholic award for her work of conciliation for the peaceful cohabitation of peoples at The Basilica Superiore of St Francis of Assisi in Italy.Police forensics investigate the death of seven people in a suspected murder-suicide in Australia.

His supporters successfully campaigned for social and political reform and against a corrupt and dysfunctional political establishment.It was the latest surprise in the career of a man who barely survived the murder of his father, the revered Shia religious leader Mohammed Sadiq al-Sadr, and his two brothers, on the orders of Saddam Hussein in 1999.Four years later, after the US invasion of Iraq, he was in danger once again of being killed, this time by American forces who twice besieged him in the holy city of Najaf in 2004.Mr Sadr will be very much the kingmaker – though he will have no official position – in the formation of a new Iraqi government.His coalition, which includes the Iraqi Communist Party, independents and secularists as well as his religious followers, appealed strongly to Iraqis who feel that, with the war won against Isis, they need to rebuild their country.The Iraqi prime minister Haider al-Abadi hoped to win the election – though no party was ever likely to win an absolute majority – by appealing to voters as the leader who recaptured Mosul from Isis last year.He followed this up with a largely bloodless reoccupation of Kirkuk, held by the Kurds since 2003, and the restoration of a large measure of government authority in Iraqi Kurdistan.The political movement formed out of the largely Shia paramilitaries, the Hashd al-Shaabi, which came second in the polls, had, like Mr Abadi, hoped to win more votes through their role in the war against Isis.Coalition led by nationalist cleric takes shock lead in Iraqi electionUS and Iran battle for influence in first post-Isis Iraq electionWomen brace for Iraq’s election after race marked by harassment What would Trump have done about Saddam Hussein? But the drop in violence to a level not seen since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein means that Iraqis are focusing on the theft by the political elite of hundreds of billions of dollars in oil revenues that should have been used to improve the supply of water, electricity, waste disposal as well medical care and education.Mr Sadr has been frequently underestimated as a political leader since he first emerged from house arrest in Najaf at the time of the US invasion.He was described by the western media as a ‘maverick’ or ‘firebrand cleric’, but his views were always more sophisticated and flexible than he was given credit for.The origin of Mr Sadr’s influence was his family’s role as religious leaders and the martyrdom of many of them, beginning with the execution of Mohammed Baqr al-Sadr in 1980.His father led a movement that appealed to the Shia poor of Baghdad and southern Iraq, combining religious revivalism with social and political radicalism. From the start, Sadrism had a strong element of Iraqi nationalism in opposition to all foreign interference in Iraq, be it American, British or Iranian.‘The near future of Iraq is dark’: Warning from Muqtada al-Sadr -In an interview with The Independent in Najaf in 2013 – the first he had given face to face to a Western journalist for 10 years – Mr Sadr spoke graphically of the ill effects of Iraq inviting in different foreign powers to try to solve its problems. He compared this to “somebody who found a mouse in his house, then he kept a cat, then he wanted to get the cat out of the house so he kept a dog, then to get the dog out of his house he bought an elephant, so he bought a mouse”,Mr Sadr created the Shia paramilitary Mehdi Army to resist the Americans. He was later to stand this down during the Sunni-Shia sectarian mass killings of 2006-7, saying that it had been infiltrated by people not under his control.He was denounced by the US as a pro-Iranian proxy, but he has made clear over the years that he opposes Iranian interference as well as that of other countries.The Sadrist success in the election this month will be unwelcome in both Washington and Tehran.The US had done everything it could to back Mr Abadi as a victorious war leader and a sort of Iraqi Winston Churchill – forgetting, perhaps, that Churchill lost the British general election in 1945.Mr Sadr’s influence over an incoming government in Baghdad puts in doubt the future of the 10,000 American troops and military contractors in Iraq, though a Sadrist spokesman said after the election that US training and the weapons procurement from the US could continue.World news in picturesWorld news in picturesPalestinians run away from tear gas shot at them by Israeli forces during a protest in Ramallah, in the occupied West BankA Palestinian demonstrator runs during a protest against the US embassy move to Jerusalem and ahead of the 70th anniversary of the Nakba at the Israel-Gaza border.A bullet hole on the window of a cafe in Paris, the day after a knifeman killed one man and wounded four other people before being shot dead by policeGermany\u0027s Chancellor Angela Merkel looks on after receiving the \u0027Lamp of Peace, the Nobel Catholic award for her work of conciliation for the peaceful cohabitation of peoples at The Basilica Superiore of St Francis of Assisi in Italy.Police forensics investigate the death of seven people in a suspected murder-suicide in Australia.

A further 16 people were still missing after flames broke out at the four-storey Winter Cherry mall in the city of Kemerovo in Siberia, according to Russian Emergencies Minister Vladimir Puchkov. The fire was extinguished in the morning after burning through the night. Parts of the building were still smouldering and the floors of the cinema hall had caved in in places, another emergency official said.Iran, for its part, has close links with the Hashd al-Shaabi and the group led by the former prime minister Nouri al-Maliki and will be wary of Mr Sadr’s Iraqi nationalism. Mr Abadi stays in power until the formation of a new government, which he may lead in an alliance with the Sadrists.Mr Sadr is perceptive about political developments in Iraq. When I interviewed him five years ago he warned against Sunni-Shia sectarianism and foreign interference. He said: “The Iraqi people will disintegrate, its government will disintegrate and it will be easy for foreign powers to control the country.” This prediction was to be fulfilled six months later when Isis took Mosul and the Iraqi army broke up.Mr Sadr said that sectarianism was spreading at street level and “if it spreads among the people, it will be difficult to fight”.Iraqi politics is still largely based on sectarian or ethnic identity – Shia, Sunni and Kurd – but the religious parties that were in the ascendant after 2003 have discredited themselves. The majority Shia community is also more confident, after its military victories last year, that it is firmly in control and is not going to be dispossessed from power.Mr Sadr said that the problem was that the Iraqi psychology had been shaped by a “constant cycle of violence: Saddam, occupation, war after war, first Gulf war, the second Gulf war, then the occupation war”.The election this month, in which so many voters gave priority to social rather than security issues, may show that, as violence ebbs, Iraqis are becoming less traumatised.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The former Suits actress could be forgiven for feeling she is losing control of her special day.But then if marrying into the Royal Family means also wedding yourself to centuries of tradition perhaps the nervous bride can take some comfort from the fact that even if dad is not there on Saturday royal weddings have a long history of mishaps.Distressing though the absence of her father might be for Meghan, back in 1328 Princess Philippa of Hainault had to contend not with a missing parent but a missing roof.Her wedding to Edward III was conducted in York Minster, which was still under construction and the happy couple were forced to say their vows in the middle of a snow storm.THROW IN THE TOWEL? Diana was talked into not pulling outMore recently the union of Prince Harry\u0027s mother and father in 1981 is still held up as the ultimate in royal pomp but the truth is it nearly didn\u0027t happen.Days before the ceremony Lady Diana, then just 20 years old, tried to call the whole thing off after discovering that her 32-year-old fianc\u0026eacute had not ended his affair with mistress Camilla Parker Bowles.She was convinced to change her mind by older sister Lady Sarah McCorquodale (coincidentally an old flame of Charles) who told Diana she had to go through with it because the tea towels are printed.Diana later fluffed her lines at the altar, pledging herself to Philip Charles Arthur George instead of Charles Philip Arthur George, prompting Prince Andrew to quip: You\u0027ve married his father.Royal weddings: The bride and groom with their bridal parties.                    PA1 of 10Royal weddings and their bridal partiesBut if Harry\u0027s mum came close to backing out of her wedding, in 2011 Princess Charlene of Monaco - then plain old Charlene Wittstock - is said to have made no fewer than three serious attempts to escape her marriage to Prince Albert.According to the French press she first tried to flee when visiting Paris to try on her wedding dress, before making a second bid for freedom during the Monaco Grand Prix.Then a week before she was due to walk up the aisle royal officials are said to have intercepted her en route to Nice airport and even confiscated her passport.The wedding went ahead, however, and the couple are still together though during the ceremony Charlene was pictured dabbing away tears.Tiaras, tulle and fairy tale flair are in full swing at a Royal Wedding                     PopperfotoGetty Images1 of 17Masahito, Prince Hitachi and Hanako Tsugaru (Hanako, Princess Hitachi) pictured together in ceremonial dress in Japan on the day of their wedding, 30th September 1964.Even the 70-year marriage of Meghan\u0027s new grandmother-inlaw and current Queen saw a few hitches on the big day.The ceremony came within a whisker of being delayed, first after courtiers had to battle through crowds to retrieve Elizabeth\u0027s necklace from St James\u0027s Palace and then after the frame of her diamond tiara snapped as her hairdresser attached the veil.At least Meghan can be sure her new husband loves her. Seven monarchs before Elizabeth and Prince Philip\u0027s wedding, the union of the future George IV and his cousin Princess Caroline of Brunswick in 1795 seemed to be doomed from the start.A dissolute, overweight drunkard, his happy day - and choice of bride - had been arranged by his father who demanded George wed her in return for paying off his debts.The couple married after having met just once. Upon laying eyes on his fianc\u0026eacutee for the first time George declared: I\u0027m not well! Get me a glass of brandy! It then emerged that he was already secretly married to one of his mistresses: Catholic widow Maria Fitzherbert.That wedding was quickly declared invalid according to the new Royal Marriages Act.After the service George is said to have spent the majority of the evening passed out in a drunken stupor on his bedroom floor.And even if things don\u0027t go according to plan on Saturday afternoon Meghan can be reassured that whatever happens her big day will be better than that of Princess Augusta of Saxe-Gotha who in 1736 married George IV\u0027s grandfather Frederick, Prince of Wales.Their wedding ceremony was a shambles.First Princess Augusta publicly begged her mother not to leave her at the altar and then, unable to speak a word of English, she had to have her vows shouted into her ear by Frederick so she could repeat them phonetically.As if all that was not spectacle enough she rounded off proceedings in technicolour style by vomiting all over her gown and her mother-in-law Queen Caroline.Now that really would be a day to remember."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/106/590x/Meghan-Markle-Doria-Ragland-Royal-wedding-960464.jpg","title":"meghan markle doria

and it went up to £7.38 from April 1, 2018.The wage increased from £5.60 to £5.90 for 18 to 20-year-olds, and from £4.05 to £4.20 for under 18s.However, apprentices were only entitled to £3.50 if they are under-19 - this increased to £3.70 from April 1, 2018.In April 2018, the minimum wage for 25-year-olds rose from £7.50 to £7.83 an hour.The national limits are legally binding.Anyone who thinks they are not getting the National Living Wage or National Minimum Wage should complain to their employer in the first instance.If this does not get anywhere, the next step is to take the complaint to HMRC who will investigate.Those who are self-employed, voluntary workers, company directors and family members who live in the home of the employer and do household chores do not qualify for either rate.There is no difference in pay for those that live in London compared to elsewhere.The only discrepancy is for people working in agriculture or horticulture.Workers already employed before October 1, 2013 are entitled to the pay set under their contract of employment.This is a voluntary scheme aiming to recognise the actual cost of living, to which 3,000 employers have signed up.Under it, the lowest rate of pay is calculated according to the cost of living in the UK based on the changing cost of a basket of groceries.The amount is set by the charity Living Wage Foundation, and accredited employers include local authorities, NHS trusts, banks, retailers, charities and construction companies.The foundations calculations put the real Living Wage at £8.75 an hour - and £10.20 in London.These rates also apply to over-18s in recognition that young people face the same living costs as everyone else.And while companies are not legally entitled to pay more than the National Living and Minimum Wages, those which have signed up to the real Living Wage scheme have pledged to pay all workers those rates.The rate is calculated every November, and accredited employers are committed to any increases.While theres no legal obligation for your employer to pay you more than the National Living Wage (£7.50 from April 1, 2017), if your company is accredited by the Living Wage Foundation you should be receiving more than that.The foundations head of partnerships Graham Griffiths said anyone concerned can use their online whistleblowing service, and any employer not adhering to the Real Living Wage faced losing its accreditation.Graham said one area where it was challenging to pay the living wage were retail and hospitality but pointed to Ikea, Aldi and Lidl, which have agreed to pay the same rate.The scheme was launched in 2001 by parents in East London, and the foundation was set up in 2011.In 2005 following a growing interest from employers, the Greater London Authority established the Living Wage Unit to calculate what the lowest pay should ideally be.In 2008 Trust for London selected the scheme as a special initiative and made a grant of more than £1million to campaign for it and set up an accreditation scheme for employers.In April 2016 it became the inspiration for the governments higher minimum wage rate, which it rebranded the National Living Wage.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

On Saturday at 11.59am precisely — these royal weddings really do run like Rolex watches — Thomas will meet his daughter at the West Door of St George’s Chapel, Windsor, and escort her to where her ginger Prince Charming is waiting.“Poor Pa Markle!” sighed one pundit. “A total nightmare!”I have a different prediction. This shy man with an allergy to publicity will tug on the heartstrings of the world at Meghan’s wedding to Harry.Because no matter how awkward it feels to be under the pitiless gaze of planet Earth, Thomas Markle is above and beyond all else, a proud and loving father.No matter how bashful his instincts may be, no matter how comfortable he was in obscure retirement in Rosarito, Mexico, I would bet my life that there was never a chance that he would miss his daughter’s wedding. Thomas Markle is clearly — and understandably — apprehensive about the big day.He has been seen in one of his local cafes in Mexico, head buried in a book called Images Of Britain. At an internet cafe, he stares with some bewilderment at the engagement photos of Meghan and Harry. But what father of the bride, any bride, would not feel a giddy cocktail of pride, anxiety and a touch of sadness at the prospect of walking his baby girl down the aisle?I doubt if he is enjoying the big build-up — having a wedding suit made to fit his bear-like frame, contemplating meeting the Queen, Prince Philip and the sprawling royal clan, and, horror of horrors, working out what to say when he rises to his feet to make that wedding speech.But Thomas Markle’s nerves about the big day do not make him a misfit or a freak. They make him gloriously human. Meghan Markle is loved because she brings some Hollywood flash to our staid, stoic, rather fusty Royal Family.But Meghan is also loved because she seems strangely familiar to us — a mixed-race child of divorced parents, divorced herself and a working woman who has fought hard for her success.Beyond the showbiz gloss, we have some understanding of the life of Meghan Markle. Because millions of our own lives are not so different.Because no matter how self-conscious this shy man feels taking to the global stage, his overwhelming emotions on his daughter’s wedding day will be love and pride. As any father of the bride will tell you, love and pride trump everything.IT is exciting news that Major League Baseball is coming to the capital for the first time next year, when the Boston Red Sox meet the New York Yankees at the London Stadium.  Mayor Sadiq Khan has worked hard to make this happen.WITH their fiery eyes and flashing thighs, female cadets in Vladimir Putin’s barmy Red Army look as though they are ready to invade somewhere.Possibly Stringfellows.WHAT makes Brexit inevitable is the total lack of respect shown to this country by Brussels since we decided to leave.German EU commissioner Gunther Oettinger sneers that Theresa May is “weak” and mocks Boris Johnson for having the same hair as Donald Trump.“That says everything,” sneers Herr Oettinger, 64, who once called a group of Chinese ministers “slitty-eyed” and has joked that gay marriage will become compulsory.And that says all you need to know about this buffoon. LABOUR’S Emily Thornberry has called for the Little Miss books to be renamed because they are sexist.“I don’t like this thing about being little,” says Emily. “I think that’s my problem with the Mr Men books.” Funny enough, that’s my problem with the Labour Party. The institutionalised sexism. The casual misogyny. The assumption that men should lead and the little ladies should tiptoe meekly behind.The Labour Party is at least as overtly sexist as the Little Miss books, Emily.The Tories are already on their second female Prime Minister while Labour have never even had a woman as their leader. Why not? It’s not as though the long line of miserable male mediocrities who have led Labour were much cop.It’s hard to believe that Barbara Castle or Yvette Cooper wouldn’t have done a better job of leading Labour than Foot, Kinnock, Brown, Miliband or Corbyn – who didn’t win one General Election between them.If Thornberry truly wants to prove that women can do anything that men can do, she should be demanding to know why no woman has ever led Labour in its 118-year-history.When washing down the next bacon butty, better stick to the decaffeinated coffee, Ed.SIR BOBBY ROBSON inspired the current managers of Manchester United and Manchester City, and inspired love in all who played for him from England to Barcelona, including Paul Gascoigne in his mercurial prime. Sir Bobby remains one of only two England managers to take our national team to a World Cup semi-final.The subject of a new feature film called Bobby Robson: More Than A Manager, Robson was clearly a wise and com-passionate man.In comparison, Sir Alf Ramse was a cold, distant and aloof figure with a robotic voice and a weird accent fabricated by elocution lessons. He went to school with my father – he should have talked like a Cockney, not the Duchess of Devonshire.But Sir Alf did it. He made the dream – that eternal dream of every England football fan – come true.So I have to beg to differ when Gary Lineker says that Sir Bobby Robson is the “best England manager of all time”. There is only one Sir Alf Ramsey.THE Met Gala is the most fashionable party in New York and this year the theme was Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination – inspiring a host of celebrities to bowl up in what looked like deeply religious lingerie. Rihanna was possibly a mini-skirted Pope or perhaps a cleavage-flashing cardinal. Katy Perry was an angel.Rosie Huntington-Whiteley had a golden halo and a neckline that skimmed her navel. Madonna wore a crown made of multiple crucifixes.It is true that these Big Apple fashionistas – the Met Gala is hosted by the editor of American Vogue, Anna Wintour – would not have taken the mick out of any non-Christian religion. But perhaps that is a compliment to Christianity. It can be mocked by empty-headed, attention-seeking celebrities and nobody gets a death threat. Perhaps all religions should be this tolerant.“I no longer want to continue life,” said Dr Goodall before he died. “I’m happy to have the chance to end it.”Every one of us should have that choice. Dr Goodall should never have been compelled to go to Switzerland.IN more than 50 years of going to watch football matches, I have still never had one of those mythical half-time pies. But man and boy, I have collected football programmes. What could be a more evocative memento of a match? An overpriced replica shirt? A polyester team scarf? A football programme is the next best thing to memories.But now, after more than a century of programmes being sold on match days, the English Football League will decide in June if it will continue to make it compulsory for clubs to produce them.In the age of social media, the death of football programmes makes sense, although 600,000 of them are still sold every weekend. But there will be a little less magic in the world if they are allowed to die.I still have my treasured copy of England v West Germany in the World Cup Final of 1966. Second-hand editions go for anything from £10 for a fake to £10,000 for the real thing.But to me, that programme is priceless.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Because it is supported by wooden peers.”The second chamber that acts within constitutional conventions is beneficial and helps prevent the “elected dictatorship” that our system of government can create.Asking the Government and the House of Commons to think again is both reasonable and valuable — it also has a distinguished history.As long ago as 1539, when Henry VIII was at his most powerful, the Lords amended his Act of Proclamation, which would have allowed monarchical despotism.This is the first example I know of the Upper House acting successfully as a revising chamber and preserving the nation’s liberties. The legislation was so ineffective that it was repealed eight years later.It is that act which spawned the expression “Henry VIII powers”, now used to describe the ability of ministerial action to amend the law.In the EU Withdrawal Bill, it is wholly unexceptional for the Lords to seek to reduce the number and extent of the Henry VIII powers available to the Government.These are technical issues when it is a matter of judgement as to where the balance between efficiency and process lies. It is not an attack on the democratic process or a power grab by an unelected chamber.This is not true of some of the other amendments passed against the withdrawal bill. There is a rule that the Lords does not oppose manifesto commitments.It was introduced in the 1940s to stop an inbuilt Tory majority blocking the then Labour government’s programme.It has relevance of a particular kind today when a Labour and LibDem majority could vote down any government proposal it dislikes.As was found in the 1940s, the Lords needs to observe this self-denying ordinance if it is to maintain credibility, otherwise it quickly becomes a matter of Peers against the People.In trying to insist on the UK remaining in a customs union, the Lords has overturned a specific manifesto promise by the Conservatives. Removing the date of departure — March 29, 2019 — similarly overturns an implicit guarantee in the same document.These are two of the most egregious breaches of the convention and raise the question: What is the Lords for?Tomorrow, it may be about to get worse. There is an amendment to the Data Protection Bill to require the Government to carry out Part Two of the Leveson Inquiry.This is in the name of Baroness Hollins, who has every right to feel her family was badly treated by the Press. And although I disagree with her, she deserves considerable sympathy because of what happened.Nonetheless, she is on dangerous constitutional ground.Page 80 of the Tory party manifesto says: “Given the comprehensive nature of the first stage of the Leveson Inquiry and the lengthy investigations by the police and Crown Prosecution Service into alleged wrongdoing, we will not proceed with the second stage of the Leveson Inquiry into the culture, practices and ethics of the Press.”This could not be clearer, yet the Lords are contemplating legislating to force this second stage upon the nation. It is a clear and outright tearing up of conventions.Unfortunately, it is even more serious than an arrogant desire to overrule a manifesto commitment — it is a proposal for the Lords to do the opposite of what it is there to do.The Lords ought to protect the liberties of the country against attempts by the government to erode them.It used to do this when it opposed extensions to detention without trial or efforts to reduce freedom of speech.Now it is suggested it will do the reverse to make our media less free and to ignore fundamental rights of justice.In just four years, the UK has already fallen ten places — from 30th to 40th — in the global rankings for free speech.Dozens of journalists have been put on trial and mainly acquitted for the reporting of stories involving the police and other public officials.The Leveson Inquiry was used to put journalists in the public pillory and now it is proposed that this should happen all over again.People who have been acquitted of a crime have nothing further to answer for and to demand they go on oath to rehash issues settled by a jury is the type of bullying of the Press normally seen in totalitarian states.If Lady Hollins’s amendment were passed, it would be giving in to the vested interests of the rich and powerful to punish newspapers which had exposed their peccadilloes.It would deter the Press from such fearless reporting in future and would be an attack on one of our most ancient and precious freedoms, a pillar of our constitution.A free Press must not be bullied or harried by those who do not like what it reports or else self-censorship will be the rule of the day.Fundamental questions will arise about the Lords if it ignores the constitutional conventions, sets Peers against the People and, instead of being the bulwark against an over-mighty Government becomes the cheerleader for censorship.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is enforceable.If foam-flecked ex-Labour leader Ed Miliband gets his way, we won’t be able to write it, either.We won’t be able to expose silly hypocrisy like this, let alone the misdeeds and corruption of those who abuse their power over us.We could soon be kissing goodbye to 300 years of Press freedom, the cornerstone of democracy.Red Ed’s campaign to curb newspapers might be applauded by the young voters Labour is seeking to cultivate — ­millennial “snowflakes” who cannot be in the same room as someone with a different point of view.They demand “safe spaces” to protect their sensitive souls or, better, a total ban on speakers they dislike.The attack on Press freedom by Labour — and, to their ­eternal shame, some Tories — is simply a monstrous extension of this intolerance.How can we have come within nine votes of state ­censorship?Soon we may be breaking a law if we fail to say “please” or “thanks” to ­someone who labels themselves a “victim” or a “survivor”.Survivors used to be people who escaped mortal danger.Today, they include anyone ­subjected to heavy-handed ­flirtation or mild embarrass-ment.This is one-way traffic.Self-proclaimed victims or survivors can say anything they like. They are exempt from ­criticism.Only whites can be racist. Only men can be sexist.All white men are “privileged” — another invented offence — ­simply because they are white and male.This group is decreed by the Left to embrace all Tories who, by definition, are “scum”. Only Tories can be cruel.Schools might churn out 16-year-olds who can’t read or write but that is apparently because Tories support ­grammar schools, not because left-wing teaching unions ­outlawed classroom ­discipline.A tower-block inferno could have erupted in Labour- controlled Islington but fate picked Kensington and “evil” Tories are now forever ­identified with the incineration of poor immigrants.The NHS is in crisis — and has been under every ­government for the past 30 years.But despite pouring ­billions into healthcare, Tory “scum” are to blame.Labour delivered mass ­immigration but it is the “vile” Tories who failed to see we would need extra houses, schools and hospitals.Welfare was out of control but it was “callous” Tories who swapped jobs for benefits.Now, preposterously, the United Nations apparently agrees.After a brief flying visit — and without a shred of ­evidence — the UN’s racism busybody, Zambian Tendayi Achiume, says we are a racist nation in breach of international human rights laws, thanks to Brexit and austerity.Has she been to Europe recently, where attitudes to immigration suggest Britain is in fact a haven of tolerance and integration?Luckily, ­people are not ­stupid. They can sniff ­hypocrisy.So it is refreshing to see, in poll after poll, they put those evil Tory scum running this country ahead of saintly Jezza’s Labour Party.Can I say that?Tessa’s political achievements were significant, not least London’s 2012 Olympics triumph.But what set her apart was her role as good- natured peacemaker and cross-party conciliator.In the Blair-Brown years she was a smiling bridge builder for the embattled Blair government, not just with the press but with members of other ­parties who now mourn her death.This talent is now vanishingly rare.Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour could learn a lot from her example of old-fashioned give and take across the political divide.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It took only days for peers to resurrect it.Another inquiry would be an obscene waste of time and money and serves no purpose. The public do not want it. Even  opposes it.It’s not hard to see why some peers might have a vested interest in silencing the media.Some have been exposed by the Press for wrongdoing — whether it was fiddling their expenses or having extra-marital affairs.And many of the Labour peers rooting for it believe their party has been unfairly covered in the media.They want newspapers they can tame into giving them an easy ride. Well, that is not the role of the Press in a democracy.The Leveson inquiry and subsequent police probes cost taxpayers more than £48million after dozens of failed trials against journalists.Leveson’s 2012 report ran to 1,987 pages and contained over a million words. What do these peers seriously think is left to learn?They are foolish, too, to think the media landscape looks as it once did. Today, Facebook and Google dominate. Most newspapers belong to IPSO, a self-funded, independent regulator that holds the Press to account more than any regulator before.Then again, this is not really about probing the relationship between cops and the Press, or phone-hacking. That is a Trojan horse.These politicians, with their celebrity pals at Hacked Off, really just want to see newspapers neutered. This must not be allowed to happen.Traditionally, the House of Lords respects the Government’s manifesto commitments. The Tory manifesto said they would not pursue the second part of Leveson. That peers have so recklessly binned a constitutional convention is disgraceful.Britain has slumped in the global ranking for free speech. In the past four years, we have fallen from 30th to 40th. “Leveson 2” would mean we shamefully fall even further.Our free Press may not be perfect, but it noisily holds power to account.

Everyone cheers.He does a fist pump to his mates and she pulls down her boob tube, flashing her breasts at her girlfriends.The same guy went on to have sex with five other women that evening.By the end of the night he was rubbing cocaine on his willy to try to maintain an erection.Over one summer I saw people having sex on stage, witnessed vast quantities of alcohol downed in seconds and dodged more puke on pavements in one hour than an A\u0026ampE nurse cleans up over New Year’s Eve.It might sound depraved and debauched but the fortnight rite of passage ensured those same kids returned home as smarter and wiser adults.Over the years I have made ­countless 18-30-based documentaries around the Med.The behaviour is wilder and more X-rated than any brochure can suggest — without it being relegated to the top shelf.That’s why I am gutted that there is a question mark dangling over the experience Club 18-30 owners Thomas Cook said this week it is “exploring options” for the brand’s future, including a possible sale.Naysayers may comment “bloody good riddance” to the iconic institution that sticks two fingers up to political correctness. But I disagree.Back in the Eighties and Nineties there were no low-cost flights to Alicante or flight-comparison websites.Instead the entire package tour was laid on for you — and there were zero complaints.The hotels were laughably basic. The food was about as foreign as a Maccy D’s.The pools often had more than lilos floating in them. But none of that mattered.The “factory fortnight” annual leave was when things really kicked off in resorts such as Ibiza’s San Antonio and Corfu’s Kavos.When the night flights churned out the up-for-it guys and girls, most didn’t bother going to bed.When you arrived the reps flogged you the tours that went with the holiday — the bar crawls, booze cruises and wet T-shirt contests.In reality, the price of the add-on excursions doubled the cost of the holiday. But no one cared because to decline was to miss out on the opportunity for lots of sex.Sex underpins the 18-30 experience and the games designed by the reps encourage it.Whether it is passing a water-filled condom down a line using only your thighs, or timing who can put the condom on an oiled courgette the quickest.To be a holiday rep you need the drinking stamina of an elephant and the energy of the Duracell bunny. Many burned out or got kicked out and sent back to the UK. Holiday reps aren’t supposed to shag one another — obviously that rule goes out the window the second the plane lifts off from Britain.In every resort I have filmed at, the reps have kept score of the ­number of women they had sex with. Did the girls know this? Absolutely. Did they care? No.Is it a suspect institution rotten to the core? Nope. What I saw is that underneath the sex, the dubious games and the round-the-clock drinking was an 18-30 safety net that protected men and women on ­holiday. The bar crawls were staffed by dozens of reps ensuring everyone got safely from one pub to another.Admittedly by the end of each bar crawl it wasn’t unusual to see couples attempting to have sex against the bar, someone crashed out on the pavement in his urine-stained jeans or a girl face down in a goldfish-sized cocktail bowl of her own vomit.But the purpose of the night was to consume enough shots to fill an Olympic-sized swimming pool — and make it out alive afterwards.The opportunity for sex is jumped on every minute of the day. I made the mistake of meeting the groups I was filming for a morning-after catch-up.I soon stopped using my universal door card key — because I’d often interrupt a couple in the kitchen, the loo or even on the balcony going at it hell for leather.The same women who prefer the missionary position and the lights off in the bedroom back in the UK don’t give a monkeys when they are away.It can be the only reason so many willingly enter the wet T-shirt competitions.My theory is the more that a girl says “no way” the more likely you are to see her on stage, arms in the air, egging the crowd on with her soaked top clinging to her braless boobs.Us Brits are certainly not afraid to get wet and wildInclude a contact number and any pics when emailing into features@the-sunWho are we to judge if — for some women — there is something empowering about a bloke pouring a jug of water over her nipples? No one was forced to do it, either.While filming a beach sunrise, I got used to seeing women doing the walk of shame to their hotel. Sick in their hair, one shoe missing but usually with a cheeky smile on their faces. Sloping off to do the deed in the dunes And the beaches get busier when the sun goes down. While on a pub crawl it is easier to slope off to the sandy stretches than it is to bonk in an awkward, tiny loo with pee all over the floor.We could always tells those who had done the deed in the dunes — bites on their legs and sand burns on their knees. My favourite nights to film were out with groups of girls. “We’re not here for a long time, we’re here for a good time!” was the motto of one lot I followed.Make no mistake. Every girl had already earmarked their target.Getting ready and the female camaraderie was just as important as the night out itself. And if you didn’t get laid? You always had a mate to walk back to the apartment with. Perhaps the most outrageous nights were the foam parties.When the soapy liquid was fired over the dance floor it was as though a “have sex now!” klaxon had sounded. Clothes would regularly be lost in the foam. More than once I saw women in a panic because after the foam had evaporated they had nothing to wear to go home in.It wasn’t all sex, either. During one season a couple had a holiday romance and got engaged on the dance floor. On another island I’ve seen a holiday rep have the confidence to come out. For those who went home without a tan it was to be celebrated.But in the middle of the chaos, these holidays are a rite of passage that forge friendships, teach kids about responsibility and let them make the mistakes that turn teenagers into adults — and I for one am sad to see them go.FOR decades Club 18-30 promised a debauched week of sun, sea and sex.For many it was their first ever trip abroad, delivering cheap, basic accommodation and the freedom to misbehave with impunity (and no chance of an embarrassing Facebook post alerting folks back home).Fast forward through the decades and today’s Millennial youngsters are light years ahead of their parents. They’ve been on umpteen foreign holidays with their families and got used to decent hotels and great pools.So now our sophisticated young travellers are looking further – and wanting more. The success of TV show Love Island conjoured up the paradise excess they all wanted to emulate.Add to that Instagrammers bragging about their global travels and Snapchat feeds full of celebs living it large in luxury and today’s youngsters aren’t satisfied with a dodgy 2H hotel in Malia and a pub crawl up Bar Street.Today’s youngsters with limited budgets are savvy enough to know how to book a holiday on one of the many online travel agencies.Thomas Cook is now targetting the Millennials with money who want to be seen in the right resorts with plenty of selfie-perfect settings.It’s new Cook’s Club hotels – the first of which will open in Crete this summer – will offer urban-cool, stylish rooms, decent food and chilled tunes around a signature pool.Thomas Cook wants to ditch the lower end of the market to concentrate on those aspiring Millennials prepared to dig deeper to emulate their social media idols.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Two Home Secretaries, the Immigration Minister and officials claimed they didn’t know there had been any wrongful deportations.“Last week they claimed there were only a handful – now we find out that it’s at least 63 – and that’s only Windrush cases.”The confession follows weeks spent by Home Office officials suggesting no Windrush-era immigrants had been wrongly deported.The scandal exploded into light last month when Commonwealth leaders slammed Downing Street for refusing them a meeting with Theresa May over the crisis during the Commonwealth Summit.Amber Rudd resigned as Home Secretary after mistakenly telling the Home Affairs Select Committee the Home Office didn’t use immigration removal targets.Mr Javid yesterday said the department was now investigating a potential 4,482 Windrush cases, where citizens needed to be given a permanent leave to remain. So far just 526 have been given the necessary documents. The new Home Secretary also risked a backlash from Theresa May by saying he wouldn’t be using the term “hostile environment” that she adopted in her spell at the Home Office – saying the term hostile was “unBritish”.He separately hinted a new policy paper on post-Brexit immigration could be brought forward to as early as July.Last night Labour’s Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott demanded justice for the Windrush generation.She blasted: “The hostile environment created by Theresa May has led to illegal deportations of lawful citizens.“Their lives have been potentially destroyed and uprooted because of this Government’s immigration policies.“Apologies and empty words of sympathy are not enough to undo the damage and great pain that has been caused to an entire community.”Home Affairs Select Committee chair Yvette Cooper said there were still many unanswered questions over Windrush.She added: “It is shocking to find that 63 people may have been wrongly removed or deported and troubling that they have not yet been contacted.“It was also significant that the Home Secretary admitted they have no way of knowing either how many Windrush cases may have lost their homes and jobs.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A senior female member of staff discovered “inappropriate material of a sexual nature” in their station cupboard.That is, she found a pair of novelty tea mugs which featured nude women with the crew members’ heads super-imposed on them.They had swapped them as secret Santa gifts.Four other crew members have resigned in protest at the sackings, locals have started a petition to reinstate the pair and long-term donors have threatened to withdraw funding. But the RNLI insists it has not gone overboard. A statement claims the incident was “not trivial” as the saucy mugs presented a “safeguarding breach”.“Safeguarding” in this context clearly has nothing to do with the physical safety of those at risk of drowning, ostensibly the remit of the RNLI. One of the offenders had 15 years’ experience of saving lives at sea, which he is now forbidden to make use of.Apparently, safeguarding the emotional safety of any potential offence-taker is more important. Similarly, few will be surprised to hear of a humour deficit in academia. But one incident shows that a poorly received joke is no laughing matter.At the annual meeting of the International Studies Association (ISA) in San Francisco, some scholars found themselves in a crowded hotel lift. Simona Sharoni, a professor of women’s and gender studies at Merrimack College in Massachusetts, offered to press the buttons for her colleagues.Richard Ned Lebow, a political scientist at King’s College London, jokingly asked to be let off at the “ladies’ lingerie” department. It was a fairly standard, if old-fashioned, gag. But Sharoni claims that “as a survivor of sexual harassment”, she was “quite shaken by this incident”. Later that day she lodged a formal complaint.Hearing she had done it, Lebow attempted to reach out to her, writing that: “Like you, I am strongly opposed to the exploitation, coercion or humiliation of women.”However, making such a “frivolous” complaint, he argued, risked diverting attention from “the real offences that trouble us both”. By describing the obviously frivolous complaint as frivolous, he aggravated matters further, it seems. Sharoni hit back, saying she “cannot and will not remain silent when misogyny is at play”.She was not alone in confusing a harmless attempt at humour with a hatred for womankind.Last week, the ISA upheld her complaint, ordering Lebow to write an “unequivocal apology” for his “offensive and inappropriate” joke or face disciplinary action.To his credit, he has refused to comply and denounced the ISA’s ruling as a “horrifying and chilling example of political correctness” that “encourages others to censor their remarks for fear of retribution”.No reasonable adult of sound mind, with any experience of real life, could possibly find Lebow’s joke about ladies’ lingerie offensive, let alone misogynistic. But policing of such saucy jokes is more common than you would think.Free Speech University Rankings, recently revealed by online free speech website Spiked, showed some British universities and students’ unions have bans on offensive jokes and banter — usually as part of their policies against sexual harassment.And it is not just jobsworth bosses, snow- flake students and highly strung academics taking offence at harmless banter — as saucy puns can even become a police matter. A butcher in Staffordshire was recently rapped by the police for the innuendo-laden signs outside his shop.Slogans promoting “big-breasted birds”, “big cocks” and offers to “have your rump tenderized” have adorned his boards for ten years. No member of the public felt sufficiently offended to complain to the police in that time.Nevertheless, the local police chief inspector warned the butcher to “give careful consideration” to his slogans, in case anyone takes offence in future. The joyless claims that smutty humour constitutes sexual harassment, a safe- guarding breach or any tangible harm whatsoever, are certainly worthy of ridicule.But when jokes no naughtier than Victorian postcards can see people disciplined and sacked, and innuendos no saucier than a Carry On one-liner draw the attention of the police, we need to get serious about defending smut.Fraser Myers writes for spiked-online, where this article also appears.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

You will see thousands of police as you approach the stadium.“You will be walking down avenues of police with shields, helmets and guns.”Chief Inspector Joseph Stokoe, of the Met Police and head hooligan spotter in Russia, added : “People need to be aware that the numbers of police and military that you will see at games will frankly be off the scale as to what you see in the UK.”British police say the chances of violence at matches will be “remote.”Football policing boss Mr Roberts said : “Russia is committed to providing a safe haven and a festival of football.“Notwithstanding everything else that is going on, we do have a shared interest in this,” he said in reference to the Salisbury poisoning of Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, and Boris Johnson’s comparison of Vladimir Putin to Hitler.At a briefing held at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in Westminster yesterday, Mr Roberts outlined the punishment awaiting hooligans falling foul of local Russian cops.At the minor end of the scale, touts face a £20,000 fine and deportation for every ticket they are caught selling while petty offences are punishable with 15 days imprisonment and a £291 fine.Individual hooligans causing trouble face five years hard labour in a detention centre, 480 hours of community service and a £5,825 fine.Anyone caught and convicted of mass disorder will be sentenced to between eight and 15 years hard labour and 10 years in a modern day gulag for assaulting anyone in authority, such as a cop or soldier.Up to 10,000 England fans are expected to travel to Russia, despite the paltry allocation of official tickets, through the FA.Just 1,460 tickets have been allocated to England for the Tunisia match, 1,772 for the second group game against Panama in Nizhny Novgorod on June 24 and 2,359 for the final encounter four days later against Belgium in Kalinigrad, on the Polish border.Mr Roberts warned that any fans travelling without a ticket for the World Cup would be unlikely to be granted a visa to enter Russia.He also pointed out the logistical problems caused by the “huge distances” between cities and shortage of available accommodation.A total of 1,751 football banning orders have been issued by courts against yobs who must surrender their passports in advance of the tournament.Spotters from the UK Football Policing Unit are being deployed at UK ports to watch for hardcore thugs trying to sneak out of the country and will also be on the ground in Russia to engage with fans.Police chief Mr Roberts said the main concern were middle-of-the road fans who end up drinking too much and causing trouble rather than known hooligans.He said : “They are the people who there with a stag party excess...this gives me a degree of concern.”Warning of the particular concern about offence being caused in Volgograd and at its commemorative sites, he added : “Any student of history will know Russian casualties during World War Two were horrific.“If people from any other country got drunk and placed their flag on the Cenotaph it would make the locals here angry.”Kevin Miles, chief executive of the England Supporters’ Federation, has visited the cities where the Three Lions are playing, and said : “We have to treat the place with respect.“It is one thing to hang a flag up in a bar where the landlord has been taking your money.“But it is quite another to put in a place of particular sensitivity.“We want to be treated as welcome guests.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She’s been devastated by what’s happened.“After the revelation he had staged those paparazzi pictures, she has felt so let down and majorly questioned his loyalties.“He collaborated with the Press yet never condemned the actions of his other children Samantha and Junior, who were forever publicly disparaging Meghan.”While history has taught us is that the royals are adept at looking after themselves, this latest episode has left many wondering: just who is looking out for Thomas Markle?Clearly, the retired Hollywood lighting director has been left to fend for himself.Palace sources indicate that he was offered significant help and advice — but he turned it down.They also suggested that Meghan, 36, and Harry, 33, had tried to contact him before she finally got through yesterday.Thomas said he had not heard from his younger daughter after it made global news that he was not going to the wedding.But he said he had changed his mind after Meghan had called him.As for the advice — maybe it was never offered or perhaps he refused it as a proud man who believed he could handle the pressure.Either way, the Palace suits should have stayed in close contact because they must know the pressure is worse than he expected.Now he’s so anxious he’s been “popping Valium for the pain, especially when I hear about my oldest daughter”.That is Samantha Markle — Meghan’s estranged half-sister who hasn’t seen her for ten years and is not invited.She has been shading Meghan as a “pushy princess” at every opportunity.And why no intervention from the Palace?Why has no one flown over to collect him, protect him behind castle gates and show some ­concern for a vulnerable man with heart problems?Where did it all go wrong and who to believe in this sorry saga?Thomas Markle Snr was a successful lighting director, but obviously bad with money.After his retirement he declared himself bankrupt in 2016 with credit card debts of £24,181 and savings of just £160.He moved to tiny Rosarito just across the US border with Mexico, hiding from the world in a ­ramshackle cliff-top house and not socialising with any of the expats.Thomas was so upset after he was pictured earlier this year looking dishevelled, he wanted to control the narrative.He colluded with a photo agency to get shots of him being measured for a suit, working out, reading a book on English history and looking at internet ­pictures of Harry and Meghan.Then came the bombshell revelation that he was so embarrassed to have been rumbled taking cash for the snaps, that he was pulling out of the wedding.Princess Diana’s best friend Rosa Monckton helped her pal dodge the paparazzi — but also knew how she used them for her own ends.Rosa told The Sun: “He strikes me as a man who is out of his depth at every level on this and I don’t judge him at all.“They should have advised him to hide up somewhere until after the wedding. He’s obviously very vulnerable and I don’t know what could have been done or should have been done to offer him more advice and protection.”So should that advice have come from Meghan — the actress with a grasp of the pitfalls of global fameTo answer that you need to understand their up-and-down relationship. Thomas was overjoyed at the birth of his baby girl with second wife Doria Ragland and appears to have been a positive role model for Suits star Meghan.Meghan has credited her dad — who won two Emmys — with being a huge influence on her career.Describing him as “hardworking” and “caring”, she has said that he “invested in my future so that I could grow up to have so much”.For a man from a poor family who grew up on simple dinners of “potatoes and spam”, this was helped by a £500,000 lottery win when Meghan was nine. Her half-brother Tom Jnr said: “That money allowed Meg to go to the best schools and get the best training”.Thomas Snr overcame the racial prejudice of others to marry an African-American and helped develop his daughter’s social conscience.He and Doria got hitched in 1979 but separated when Meghan was six.However, Thomas stayed in close contact with his daughter.Meghan recalled him buying a white Barbie family set and a black Barbie family — splitting them up to make “her” family. But as a teenager she didn’t want to see her father.Driving through her home city of Los Angeles aged 18 with then-best friend Ninaki Priddy, she said she would not visit her dad as they “weren’t on the best of terms”.But a post Meghan sent to her dad on Instagram on Father’s Day 2016 showed the extent of his influence on her and her love for him.She declared: “To this day your hugs are still the very best in the whole wide world. Thanks for my work ethic, my love of Busby Berkeley films and club sandwiches, for teaching me the importance of handwritten thank-you notes, and for giving me that signature Markle nose. I love you xo — Bean.” It was accompanied by a photo showing Meghan as an infant laying on her father’s chest.But a friend said of Thomas: “He’s always been a bit of a slob, selfish with no emotional intelligence.“They didn’t really connect when she was growing up as a girl and didn’t bond when she was a woman.“There were periods when they were closer — he helped her move to Toronto when she started Suits (in 2012). But as he’s become older he’s become much more reclusive.“The man he is today is not the man he was even ten, 15 years ago. He just eats junk food, sleeps in, drinks and reads.“She has helped him many times financially. But there just comes a point when you have to let go.“Not exactly wash her hands of him but there is only so much she can do.“Hence why she didn’t feel Harry had to meet him or that she needed her dad’s approval to get married.”Thomas is now saying he will make the wedding — as long as doctors allow him to fly. Let’s hope for Meghan’s sake he does.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Holmes who owned a hotel in Chicago who created a factory of death to murder the innocents who visited the fair.He was the first serial killer, he claims, adding that he was a pure evil genius.Her half-sister Samantha Markle also spoke of her relationship with the Royal bride and her own relationship with her husband before telling the host her husband is addicted to tabloid stories about Meghan and Samantha, and slammed rumours she was writing a tell-all.Amelia travelled across America to track down significant people from Meghan’s past and met members of her extended family.At its heart, the wedding is a story of two people in love, but the couples union allowed Amelia to explore a wide range of subjects and will ask what the Americans really think of Meghan joining the Royal Family.On her documentary, the host says: “Exploring Meghan Markle’s America was a crazy journey for me. This is my first documentary for TV and I wasn’t sure how the Americans would take my style of humour.“But I met some extraordinary people who welcomed me with open arms and strangely enough, now I feel like I almost know Meghan... so where’s my invite?Meet The Markles aired tonight on Channel 4 at 10pm or you can watch it on catch up on 4OD."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000406535264.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"meghan markle mum doria ragland airport royal wedding","story":"Doria Ragland was seen carrying a Burberry garment bag as she was picked up outside her California home by a black SUV on Tuesday.The 61-year-olds driver could be seen loading a suitcase and holdall into the back before heading to Los Angeles International Airport, where they entered through a private entrance.According to TMZ, the mother-of-the-bride was dropped off at the terminals new private suite - reserved for the rich and famous - and comes with a hefty price tag.Doria, dressed in a black blazer over a white T-shirt and loose-fitting khaki trousers, got the full VIP treatment as she was driven privately across the tarmac straight to her first-class flight.Shes set to stay at Cliveden House in Berkshire, where rooms cost up to £1,500 a night, with Meghan for her last night before she officially joins the royal family.What we know so far...As the yoga instructor made her way to the airport, speculation resurfaced about who would walk Meghan down the aisle after her dad Thomas Markle Snr pulled out of the wedding for a second time.The 73-year-old told TMZ he is due to undergo major surgery later today after suffering a heart attack last week - which hes since blamed on his son Thomas Jnr.He told the entertainment website: “They [doctors] will go in and clear blockage, repair damage and put a stent where it is needed.”Mr Markle reportedly said his ex-wife should walk their daughter down the aisle as she weds Prince Harry at Windsor Castle on Saturday.The latest revelation came just hours after it was reported he wanted to go to the wedding — itself only 24 hours after announcing he would not be there.He said he had changed his mind after Meghan begged him to come, sending him a heartfelt text message saying: I love you.He said of the decision: “I’d like to be part of history. Of course I’d walk her down the aisle.  This is a ­historic moment.“I hate the idea of missing one of the greatest moments in history and walking my daughter down the aisle.”The retired lighting director, who lives in Rosarito, Mexico, said medics had told him his heart was “seriously damaged” after a heart attack a week ago.He blamed his health troubles on an open letter written by his son Thomas Jnr, urging the prince not to marry his half-sister.On Monday, Thomas said he would not attend the Windsor wedding because he did not want to embarrass his daughter or the royals after admitting he was paid for staged paparazzi photos."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000357307780-e1526455303211.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"meghan markle mum doria dad thomas barely speaking royal wedding","story":"Yoga instructor Doria Ragland is said to be upset at her ex-husband Thomas Markle for the controversy - and for failing to stop his family from trashing their daughter ahead of her wedding to Prince Harry.Doria, who was today pictured heading to the airport to make her way to the UK for her daughters big day, is now tipped to give Meghan away after Thomas said he had to miss the wedding on Saturday and undergo a heart operation.A source close to the family said Dorias relationship with Thomas had already been put under strain as his family continued to bad-mouth their daughter.What we know so far...Reclusive Thomas was recently pictured leaving potted plants out the front of Dorias LA home in an apparent attempt to make peace.The source told The Sun Online: Thomas and Doria are currently barely speaking to one another. He is trying to make peace after everything that has happened.Their relationship had been hanging by a thread for months before the staged photo scandals. He had told friends that he wanted to come with the peace gesture for an appeasement before the wedding and his daughters big day, but his recent actions have crushed that.The source added: The couple were also at odds with one another because of his other children speaking out so disrespectfully about Meghan in the last year.She had asked him to have them not do so, but little changed.Their divorce was quite acrimonious, and they really lived very separate lives and would only connect when necessary.Meghans estranged family certainly havent been shy at speaking out about the US actress ahead of the royal wedding.Her half-brother Thomas Jr even wrote an open letter to Prince Harry, telling the 33-year-old royal to call off the upcoming nuptials, blasting it as a fake fairy tale.Thomas letter, published in In Touch Weekly, warned: As more time passes to your royal wedding it becomes very clear that this is the biggest mistake in royal history.Half-sister Samantha Markle has also not held back in discussing Meghan and was even labelled a vulture by Piers Morgan for continually criticising the actress.After Meghan wore a £56,000 designer dress for her engagement photo, Samantha Markle, 52, said: If you can spend $75,000 on a dress, you can spend $75,000 on your dad.Some family members are also expected to cash in on the Royal Wedding, with a Channel 4 documentary giving an insight into Prince Harrys future in-laws.Her family members were also pictured arriving in London, drafted in as special correspondents for Good Morning Britain for the big day.But Meghans support system has also started to fly into the UK, with best pal Jessica Mulroney arriving at London Heathrow last night.The support couldnt come at a better time for Meghan, with the US actress having had to beg her dad to come to her wedding after TMZ revealed he would not be walking her down the aisle.The 73-year-old recluse had initially intended on being by his daughters side but pulled out after it was revealed he had staged photographs with paparazzi - later admitting they were stupid and hammy.He soon changed his mind, telling TMZ: I hate the idea of missing one of the greatest moments in history and walking my daughter down the aisle.”But he again did an about-face, revealing that he needed urgent heart surgery and would not be able to fly to the UK for the wedding - or to meet his future son-in-law and the royal family.Thomas later said that he believed Doria would be a good choice to walk Meghan down the aisle.Yoga instructor Doria, who has already met Prince Harry, is described as a free-spirited clinical therapist who has been by her daughters side for  a number of events.Ladbrokes has since put it at 4/6 odds that Meghans mum Doria will be by her side when she walks down the aisle, while Prince Charles is tipped at 2/1.The Duke of Cambridge has also been tipped to step up to the plate, with 5/1 odds of walking Meghan down the aisle, while there have been a flurry of bets predicting the US actress would walk down the aisle alone."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict0004038848791.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"royal wedding princess charlotte meghan markle bridesmaid prince george page boy","story":"The pair are among four boys and six girls who will play a part in the ceremony this Saturday.Both Meghan and Harry have chosen children close to their heart to take part, with Prince Williams eldest two children securing starring roles.As well as Charlotte, the bridesmaids will include Ms Markles seven-year-old twin goddaughters Rylan Litt and Remi Litt.What we know so far...Harrys goddaughters, three-year-old Florence van Cutsem and two-year-old Zalie Warren, are also bridesmaids, along with Ivy Mulroney, the four-year-old daughter of Meghans best friend Jessica Mulroney.Ivys twin brothers, seven-year-old Brian and John Mulroney, will be page boys alongside Prince George and Harrys godson Jasper Dyer, six.The two eldest children of Prince William and Kate Middleton will be by their uncles side for the royal wedding.The pair are certain to shine in front during the ceremony -

It was scary.“But I tried not to show this, we were hiding in the house.”Officials say all her documents were lost during the Second Chechen War from 1999 to 2009.The pension fund, a state body, claims there are 37 people over 110 years of age in Russia.But all these claims, including Koku’s, are impossible to verify because of the lack of reliable birth or early childhood written records.Since the death of 117-year-old Nabi Tajima in Japan last month, the oldest documented woman in the world is regarded as Chiyo Miyako, born on 2 May 1901, also from Japan.The oldest documented human lifespan is Jeanne Calment, from France, who lived 122 years, 164 days, dying in 1997."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa may jeremy corbyn brexit pmqs","story":"The PM blasted the Labour boss in the Commons after a string of shadow ministers expressed support for a re-run of the EU vote.And she warned that Mr Corbyn would “sell Britain out” in negotiations with Brussels if he ever got into power.The pair clashed in fiery exchanges at Prime Minister’s Questions - as the Labour leader accused the PM of being unable to unite her warring ministers.Mr Corbyn said: “When the Prime Minister wrote at the weekend that she wanted as little friction as possible, was she talking about EU trade or the next Cabinet meeting?”But Mrs May pointed out that shadow ministers Lord Hunt and Preet Gill both recently expressed support for a second referendum which could overturn the will of the people on Brexit.The PM said to Mr Corbyn: “This month the Shadow Health Minister in the Lords voted for a second referendum, at the weekend the Shadow Brexit Secretary refused to rule out a second referendum, and on Monday the Shadow International Development Minister tweeted in favour of a second referendum.“So perhaps when he stands up he could put the minds of the British people and this house at rest and rule out a second referendum.”The Labour boss responded by mocking Cabinet divisions over post-Brexit customs, saying: “If the Prime Minister cannot even convince her own Cabinet of a strategy, what chance does she have of convincing 27 other EU governments?”Mrs May reminded MPs that Mr Corbyn wanted to trigger Article 50 the day after the EU referendum - which would have left just two years to complete the whole Brexit process.She added: “What would that have led to? What Labour do every time they’re in government - they’d have sold Britain out.”The PM insisted voters “simply cannot trust” anything Labour say.And she also sent out a message to all MPs who are trying to backslide on the referendum result - saying: I consider it to be a matter of integrity of politicians that having given the choice to the British people, we should then deliver for them on that choice.Mrs May is currently trying to thrash out an agreement on what customs arrangement to push for once we have quit the EU.But Labour is also divided - with backbenchers pushing Mr Corbyn to support plans to keep Britain tied to the European single market.During todays PMQs, Mrs May also announced that the Government will pick up the full £400million bill for removing dangerous cladding from tower blocks in the wake of the Grenfell disaster."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000406430371-e1526458001558.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"anne frank diary dirty jokes new hidden pages","story":"Digital editing techniques have deciphered the writing on two pages of Anne Frank’s diary that she had covered over with brown masking paper, discovering four risque jokes and a candid explanation of sex, contraception and prostitution.“Anyone who reads the passages that have now been discovered will be unable to suppress a smile,” said Frank van Vree, director of the Netherlands Institute for War Holocaust and Genocide Studies.“The ‘dirty’ jokes are classics among growing children. They make it clear that Anne, with all her gifts, was above all also an ordinary girl.”Anne, age 13 at the time, wrote the two pages on September 28, 1942, less than three months after she, her family and another Jewish family went into hiding from the Nazis in a secret annex behind a canal-side house in Amsterdam.Later on, possibly fearing prying eyes or no longer liking what she had written, she covered them over with brown paper, their content remaining a mystery for decades.But its now emerged the pages contained four jokes about sex that Anne herself described as “dirty” and an explanation of women’s sexual development, sex, contraception and prostitution.“They bring us even closer to the girl and the writer Anne Frank,” Ronald Leopold, executive director of the Anne Frank House museum said.Experts on Anne’s diary said the newly discovered text, when studied together with the rest of her diary, reveals more about Anne’s development as a writer than it does about her interest in sex.Leopold said the words are similar to other passages dealing with sex that already have been published in the multimillion-selling diary.However, he said it provides an early example of how Anne “creates a fictional situation that makes it easier for her to address the sensitive topics that she writes about.”In her diary, for example, she addressed entries to a fictional friend named Kitty.Anne wrote her diary while she and her family hid for more than two years during World War II.The family went into hiding in July 1942 and remained there, provided with food and other essentials by a close-knit group of helpers, until August 4 1944, when they were discovered and ultimately deported to Auschwitz.Only Anne’s father Otto Frank survived the war while Anne, at the age of 15, and her sister died in Bergen-Belsen camp.After the war, Otto Frank had his daughter’s diary published, and it went on to become a symbol of hope and resilience that has been translated into dozens of languages, and the house where the Franks hid was turned into a museum that is one of Amsterdam’s most popular tourist attractions."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/05/2048x1152/skynews-ben-broadbent-bank-of-england_4311385.jpg?20180516064955 ","title":"bank of england deputy sorry for menopausal metaphor","story":"Another, @amelie_elyse, tweeted: \"Mr Broadbent et al. clearly need to grow up and conjure up some less sexist economic jargon.\"And Elizabeth Burke, an investor and lawyer, said: \"I guess the man has a very limited vocabulary.\""},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/05/2048x1152/skynews-sichuan-airlines-plane_4310816.jpg?20180515124009 ","title":"how vodafone was shaped into a behemoth","story":"The second Vodafone chief executive, who succeeded Sir Gerry at the end of 1996, was Sir Chris Gent, a prot\u0026#233g\u0026#233 of Sir Ernie Harrison, the East End docker\u0027s son who as chairman had taken Racal into telecoms in the first place.His period at the helm is remembered as a period of swashbuckling global expansion, during which Vodafone first moved into the US in a big way with the 1999 acquisition of Airtouch, for $66bn.This was followed a year later by what remains the biggest takeover ever done by a British company - the $183bn acquisition of German mobile operator Mannesmann, which put itself in play after agreeing to buy Orange in the UK, going back on a gentleman\u0027s agreement that the two companies had not to encroach on each other\u0027s turf.As required by the EU\u0027s competition authorities, Vodafone subsequently sold Orange to France Telecom, which today trades under the Orange name.Sir Chris was subsequently criticised for overpaying for Mannesmann, the deal having been done at the height of the bubble in telecoms, media and technology stocks, but his genius was in using Vodafone shares as its acquisition currency rather than cash.That not only meant Vodafone rode out the later downturn in the sector because, unlike some rivals that had used cash to do deals, its balance sheet was not as heavily geared. It also meant the company\u0027s by-then prodigious cash-flow - augmented by the sale of unwanted assets - could be invested in upgrading and expanding its networks, rather than having to be spent on servicing debt.Sir Chris\u0027s time is also associated with heavy investment in 3G licences around Europe.It was a thrilling time to be covering the company\u0027s fortunes and the soundtrack to it all was Bohemian Like You, a track by the US band The Dandy Warhols, which became ubiquitous as Vodafone became one of the world\u0027s heaviest-spending advertisers.When Sir Chris stepped down, in 2003, it fell to his Indian-born successor, Arun Sarin, to make all that investment pay off."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/05/2048x1152/skynews-robbery-london_4311408.jpg?20180516105629 ","title":"hunt for creeping burglar targeting wealthy homes in kensington and chelsea","story":"\"This burglary has made me feel very sad,\" they said, explaining that the watch and ring had been in her family for more than 70 years. \"The fact that someone came into my house uninvited and rifled through my possessions is distressing.\"Police have described the burglar as \"organised and diligent\", waiting until dark to climb into gardens and scale walls and drainpipes before rifling through cupboards and drawers armed with a torch.They say the man has been targeting properties, located in an area where average house prices are between \u0026#1632m and \u0026#1634m, with \"great care\".In another incident, the thief broke into the top floor of a four-storey house, breaking through the window while the family were downstairs having dinner and searching a bedroom while the children were having a bath next door.One another occasion the homeowner, who was abroad, checked in on his children and their nanny via cameras in the house and saw the burglar creeping around.\"This type of crime has a huge impact on not only the victims and their families, who no longer feel safe in their own homes, but upon the local community who are worried he will strike again,\" Detective Constable Eve Kelly said.\"He is not afraid to break in when families are at home, although I must stress he takes care not to be seen and has not physically harmed anyone.\"The suspect is described as white, between 20 and 40, and of athletic build, and has been pictured wearing a hooded jumper."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/05/2048x1152/skynews-mit-crypto-blockchain_4311566.jpg?20180516105132 ","title":"in the future youll mine cryptocurrency by dancing","story":"Talking to Sky News, Agnes Cameron said the future-of-work suggestion was a little joke at the expense of \"cryptocurrency bros\" who have a habit of claiming to have invented \"solutions\" for post-automation societies.\"There\u0027s a lot of utopianism around cryptocurrencies at the minute - and some of it for good reason - but in some camps there\u0027s this idea that all the world\u0027s problems are going to be solved by blockchain,\" said Ms Cameron.\"In general, it\u0027s good to be wary of the claims people make about these technologies.\"Blockchains are a really interesting application for some very specific use-cases, but they\u0027ve also become this crazy buzzword, and you see them getting used in all sorts of useless ways.\"The dancing is a bit artificial in terms of the network,\" said Ms Cameron.\"There\u0027s nothing to stop you, for example, just using the arrow keys on your computer (or, better, just writing a script to play the game for you), but if we wanted to create a system of \u0027artificial scarcity\u0027 that really did rely on dancing, then you could use force-meters in the pads or something to ensure someone was actually dancing.\"This sounds silly, but it\u0027s actually not such a wild proposition.

David Davis has told the Prime Minister that her favoured plan for a customs partnership with the EU could violate international trade law. Lorand Bartels, senior counsel at Linklaters who teaches WTO law at Cambridge University, said: “The customs union partnership model raises a question of WTO legality. It requires businesses to track imported products but not competitive domestic products. That violates one of the WTO’s non-discrimination obligations.”  It comes as Labour is set to stage a Commons ambush in a bid to force the Government to publish secret papers on its plans for a customs deal with Brussels after Brexit .    In the Commons, Labour will use ancient parliamentary rules to force a binding vote which could see ministers having to hand over all the papers presented to the Brexit war Cabinet on the economic effects of both options.  Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer said: “The Government’s Brexit strategy is in complete and utter deadlock. Nearly two years on from the referendum ministers have still yet to agree what our future customs and trading relationship with Europe will look like after Brexit. Instead, the Prime Minister has wasted months pursing her two fatally flawed customs options and presiding over a government that is too busy arguing with itself to negotiate for Britain.” But the de facto deputy Prime Minister insisted that the UK will not be asking for an extension to the almost two-year transition period with the European Union.   Cabinet Office minister David Lidington said the Government wanted to demonstrate that we have thought this through with its Brexit white paper.   He said two ministerial working groups set up by Theresa May last week to look for improvements to customs proposals could take weeks. The PM has asked smaller groups of ministers to go away and test out over the next days and weeks those detailed questions, he told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme. So, for example, on the new customs partnership the questions are around to what extent does this inhibit an independent trade policy for the future and can we mitigate those impacts? Mr Lidington confirmed that assessments are being made on the legal risks of the customs options being considered.

Since the disaster only seven of the 160 social housing blocks covered in dangerous cladding have been replaced. The government had previously said councils could apply for the money to carry out the vital work but cash-strapped local authorities have reported difficulties in getting the funding.  Earlier this week survivors of the fire which killed 71 people last June called on the government to urgently strip flammable cladding from hundreds of tower blocks around the country. Mrs May said that since the Grenfell Tower fire last year, the fire and rescue services had visited more than 1,250 high-rise buildings and that immediate action had been taken to ensure the safety of every resident.   She said there were 210 households in total in need of a new home in the wake of the fire, of which 201 had accepted an offer of either temporary or permanent accommodations.  As we approach the anniversary of the appalling tragedy that was the Grenfell Tower fire our thoughts are with the victims and survivors and all those affected by that tragedy, she said. It comes as Labour calls for a ban on combustible cladding in residential properties and an overhaul of building regulations.  In a letter to the Housing Secretary James Brokenshire, Labour\u0027s John Healey said: “More than 11 months on, the time for warm words is long past, and people are rightly asking why so little has changed since the Grenfell Tower fire.

They want local authorities to be able to apply to the courts to confiscate any block which is putting lives at risk because of dangerous cladding, and which the owner is refusing to fix. It comes after survivors of the fire which killed 71 people last June called on the government to urgently strip flammable cladding from hundreds of tower blocks around the country. The government says it is down to landlords to replace failed cladding but that position is being kept under review.  Legal disputes between freeholders and leaseholders over who should pay mean that lots of blocks remain untouched.    The review of building regulations from Dame Judith Hackitt, which was commissioned by the government in the wake of Grenfell, is expected to report back this week. But there are concerns that Dame Judith won\u0027t go far enough. Labour is calling for a complete overhaul of building safety checks and controls in a debate in Parliament this afternoon.  The Shadow Housing Secretary, John Healey MP, has written to Secretary of State, James Brokenshire setting out Labour’s detailed demands on building safety, including: requiring non-combustible cladding and insulation on high-rise blocks, a ban on ‘desktop studies’, full publication of the ownership and safety status of all tower blocks, clear powers for councils to enforce testing on suspect blocks and a \u0026pound1bn emergency Fire Safety Fund. In the letter, John Healey MP, Labour’s Shadow Housing Secretary, said: “More than 11 months on, the time for warm words is long past, and people are rightly asking why so little has changed since the Grenfell Tower fire. “A series of commitments made by Ministers up to and including the Prime Minister have not been honoured. When Grenfell survivors and worried residents in other tower blocks should have seen action, they have had to suffer painfully slow progress and broken promises.  What was a national disaster is now becoming a national disgrace. “The forthcoming final report of the Hackitt Review into building regulations and fire safety will be an important chance for the Government to show its commitment to a complete overhaul of the discredited system of building safety checks and controls. When people’s lives are at risk, the Government’s duty is clear-cut and Government action must be equally clear-cut.” The full letter from John Healey MP to Housing Secretary, James Brokenshire Dear James  As we approach the one-year anniversary of the terrible fire at Grenfell Tower, our unwavering commitment remains to ensure Grenfell residents have the help and new homes they need, those responsible are held fully to account, and all necessary steps are taken so that a disaster like this can never happen again.  However, more than 11 months on the time for warm words is long past, and people are rightly asking why so little has changed since 14 June last year.  A series of commitments made by Ministers up to and including the Prime Minister have not been honoured.

At their weekly clash he accused the Cabinet of being \u0027too busy negotiating with each other\u0027 to negotiate with the EU as the Tories\u0027 customs deadlock continues.  Mr Corbyn drew laughs in the Commons with his first question, saying: When the Prime Minister wrote at the weekend that she wanted \u0027as little friction as possible\u0027, was she talking about EU trade or the next Cabinet meeting? And he laid bare the lack of progress made in the negotiations since Britain voted to leave the EU.  We have had 23 months since the referendum we have just 10 months to complete the negotiation and the government is in complete disarray, he stormed.   The government is so busy negotiating with itself it cannot negotiate with anybody else.  Mr Corbyn also gave a damning verdict on the Tories\u0027 attempts to prepare for leaving the block.  Referring to the recruitment of more officials to handle  He asked the prime minister to give details of the number of HMRC officials they are recruiting but she refused to answer.   The Labour leader said the numbers reportedly being recruited would not even cover those lost since 2010 because of Tory cuts.  Mr Corbyn said: It seems that the Dutch government is more prepared for Brexit than the British government.  But Theresa May tried to shift the focus onto divisions within the Labour Party including the shadow health minister in the Lords voting for a second referendum.  More than 80 Labour Lords also defied the whip to support keeping the UK in the single market.  The Prime Minister said: This government has a policy of leaving the customs union and of ensuring that as we do so we have as frictionless trade as possible with the EU.   But if he\u0027s talking about friction, perhaps he could reflect on the fact that this month the shadow health minister in the Lords voted for a second referendum.

Thomas Markle Snr says he is due to undergo an operation this morning, just three days before Meghan ties the knot with Prince Harry. He told TMZ details of the surgery, saying: They [doctors] will go in and clear blockage, repair damage and put a stent where it is needed. It comes after Mr Markle Snr reportedly revealed that he wanted to walk Meghan, 36, down the aisle at Windsor Castle, Berkshire, on Saturday.  The 73-year-old was said to have had a \u0027change of mind\u0027 - less than 24 hours after pulling out of performing the honour at St George\u0027s Chapel. He earlier told the gossip site: I hate the idea of missing one of the greatest moments in history and walking my daughter down the aisle. But he feared his heart problems could prevent him from doing this.  It is thought Meghan\u0027s mum Doria Ragland has stepped in to walk her down the aisle in her father\u0027s absence. Earlier on Tuesday, the 61-year-old was picked up from her LA home and chauffeur driven to LAX airport, according to TMZ. The website reports that she was given the A-list treatment, dropped off at the new Private Suite before being driven directly to her flight. The father was said to be back in hospital, undergoing a series of tests, after suffering from serious chest pains following a heart attack last week.  Speaking to Australian news programme Sunrise, Samantha Markle, Meghan\u0027s half sister, said: Everything about him being under an incredible amount of stress is true and he, you know, sent me a message that he was undergoing heart surgery so all of that was true. He\u0027s been under a tremendous amount of stress amidst challenges and I hope, I think we\u0027re all hoping he pulls through this now and can still go the wedding.  The surgery is said to be taking place at 7.30am local time. Mr Markle Snr will likely be recovering from the procedure when his former actress daughter, 36, and Harry, 33, tie the knot in Windsor this weekend. In a statement earlier this month, Kensington Palace said the father, who lives near Rosarito, Mexico, would walk Meghan down the aisle of St George\u0027s Chapel. A spokesman said at the time: “Prince Harry and Ms Markle are very much looking forward to welcoming Ms Markle\u0027s parents to Windsor for the wedding. Mr Thomas Markle and Ms Doria Ragland will be arriving in the UK in the week of the wedding, allowing time for Prince Harry\u0027s family, including The Queen, The Duke of Edinburgh, The Prince of Wales, The Duchess of Cornwall, and The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, to spend time with them before the big day.  Both of the bride\u0027s parents will have important roles in the wedding. On the morning of the wedding, Ms Ragland will travel with Ms Markle by car to Windsor Castle. Mr Markle will walk his daughter down the aisle of St George\u0027s Chapel. Ms. Markle is delighted to have her parents by her side on this important and happy occasion.” But last night, it was claimed that Mr Markle Snr no longer planned to travel to Britain to give Meghan away after he admitted staging photos for the paparazzi. The father earlier told TMZ that he had meant no harm to his daughter or the Royal Family when he set up a photoshoot in an Internet cafe. The shoot is said to have been part of a deal worth \u0026pound100,000.  Reports suggested some wedding plans had been thrown into turmoil with the ex-Hollywood lighting director deciding to stay put at home. It was claimed Harry was blaming himself for the situation, while Meghan was said to be distraught and standing by her father. Last night, the couple released a statement addressing the reports that Mr Markle Snr was not going to attend the ceremony. A spokesman for Kensington Palace said: This is a deeply personal moment for Ms Markle in the days before her wedding. She and Prince Harry ask again for understanding and respect to be extended to Mr Markle in this difficult situation.

The couple are due to wed at St George\u0027s Chapel on Saturday, with about 100,000 of well-wishers expected in the Berkshire town and police on high alert. A number of homeless people living near the Queen\u0027s residence had their belongings cleared, but police say the rough sleepers they gave them up voluntarily under a scheme overseen by a local charity. As the royal wedding draws near, the area around Windsor Castle is on lockdown and anti-terror bollards are going up as extra police patrol the town.  Thames Valley Police said the sleeping bags and other belongings, including bedding and books, are being stored by the Windsor Homeless Project and will be returned to the rough sleepers after Saturday\u0027s nuptials. Tory council leader Simon Dudley had sparked anger months ago after asking police to remove rough sleepers from the affluent borough before the royal wedding. He complained about rough sleepers on Twitter while he was on a Christmas skiing holiday, and then wrote a letter to the police - copying in Prime Minister Theresa May and then-Home Secretary Amber Rudd after he returned to the UK.    Footage obtained by MailOnline shows two homeless men, who were camped outside a Barclays bank across from the castle, putting their possessions in clear plastic bags. The bags were sealed and taken away in a police van. One of the rough sleepers said: There was big speak on the TV about the homeless being helped but when they said helped they meant removed. But a police spokesman insisted that the rough sleepers voluntarily gave up their possessions and they were not forcibly taken away as part of security measures.  He said the possessions will be returned after Windsor hosts the wedding, and officers were just assisting the Windsor Homeless Project with the scheme. Officers will be carrying out security sweeps and screening the thousands of well-wishers who will cram pavements around the castle, hoping to catch a glimpse of Harry and Meghan. But the police spokesman warned that large items deemed to be a security risk will likely be removed by officers. The spokesman said: “Thames Valley Police is working closely with The Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead council, The Windsor Homeless Project, and local support services in order to offer support to homeless people in Windsor. \u2028 "},{"url":null,"title":"royal wedding bridesmaids pageboys meghan","story":"NewsRoyal wedding: Meghan Markle and Prince Harry reveal bridesmaids and page boys - including Prince George and Princess CharlotteThe palace have announced bridesmaids and page boys will include Princess Charlotte and Prince George\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByAbigail O\u0027Leary11:45, 16 MAY 2018Updated12:56, 16 MAY 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailPrincess Charlotte and Prince George will play key roles in the royal wedding of Meghan Markle and Prince Harry, it\u0027s been revealed.

The airline has slashed the time passengers are able to check-in from four days before departure to just 48 hours. This means that those who don\u0027t reserve a seat have two days to check in before their flight - and if they don\u0027t do so within two hours they could be hit with a \u0026pound55 fee for doing so at the airport.  But, the Liverpool Echo reports, Mr Lewis has a way to save you some cash.   The TV favourite says that, while the new short check-in time applies to people who don’t reserve a seat, it can cost as little as just \u0026pound4 to reserve a standard seat with Ryanair. So for families or friends hoping to sit together, or those who can’t check in within the 48hr time limit, this could save you a few headaches. A Ryanair spokesperson said: “Online check-in - for those customers who don’t choose reserved seats - will be available from 48 hours to 2 hours pre-departure for all flights from Wednesday 13 June. “This is more than double the 24-hour check-in period operated by British Airways, Lufthansa, Norwegian and Iberia. This will give reserve seat customers more time to select their preferred seats prior to departure.”  How is it changing? Money Saving Expert’s Martin Lewis explains: “At the moment, you can check in for free up to four days in advance - and this is actually measured in complete calendar days. So if you’re flying at 8pm on Friday, you can check in any time after 00.01am on Monday. From 13 June, the free check-in window’s being cut to 48 hours - so you won’t be able to check in until 8pm on Wednesday. “The change means that if you don’t want to pay for a reservation you’ll have a much narrower window to remember to check in online or via Ryanair’s app - and holidaymakers returning to the UK after even short breaks will need to access the internet abroad to do so.

Adam, 18, was told he may never walk again but today every tentative step he takes is in memory of mum Gaynor Finney who died of cervical cancer as he underwent gruelling chemotherapy.  The teen said: “I think about what mum went through and how she can\u0027t be here and I want to make her proud.” Adam\u0027s is a story of tragedy but incredible human endurance. In October 2013, aged, 14, he started suffering headaches and when he fell ill at school Adam was rushed to North Staffordshire Hospital, then Alder Hey in Liverpool where an MRI detected childhood Medulloblastoma. Medics broke the news he had three brain tumours and his family were told he had little chance of survival.  Aunt Joanne Finney, who now helps care for Adam, says: “He was so poorly that when he got to hospital he collapsed in the car park. He was throwing up everywhere and it was obvious something was seriously wrong. “We were devastated when the doctors said he had brain tumours. They had to operate straight away because he had fluid on the brain and we were told it was very touch and go as to whether he would live. “I remember the consultant taking his mum and I into a room and telling us the procedure wasn\u0027t about Adam getting better, but about making whatever time he had left more comfortable.” But Adam did live through the surgery and mum Gaynor, 43, spent hours, days and weeks sitting by her son\u0027s bed. Joanne, 46, said: “After the operation Adam was really poorly and couldn\u0027t remember hardly anyone. He didn\u0027t recognise his grandparents or his mum and we were worried about the long-term affects on him.” Worried sick, mum Gaynor spent days and months sitting by Adam\u0027s bedside and, when she started losing weight, her family thought it was from the stress of watching her son\u0027s slow recovery. Joanne said: “She didn\u0027t leave his side, she slept on a chair next to his bed and refused to leave it. “He could no longer talk and was unable to move anything except his toes, fingers and head. He also had double vision and his pupils wandered around continuously.” Adam, of Meir, Staffordshire, started a harrowing 12 months of chemotherapy in February 2014 and, incredibly, the tumours began to shrink.  But as his treatment started to come to an end Gaynor went to see her GP about constant bleeding and was tragically diagnosed with Stage 4 cervical cancer. She was too weak for chemotherapy and died within weeks in May 2015 – at the same hospital which first saved her son\u0027s life. Joanne said: “We were all heartbroken “She was too weak for chemotherapy and nothing could be done. “Gaynor had been through so much with Adam being ill. She\u0027d previously been to the doctor about heavy bleeding but in looking after Adam she\u0027d put her own health aside. “She\u0027d lost so much weight, four or five stone in a couple of months and just couldn\u0027t fight the cancer. “We didnt\u0027 tell her she was dying because we felt she had been through enough.” Adam, who lives his uncle Lance, 49, and grandparents, remembers very little about his mother\u0027s illness. His recovery came in fits and starts, his mobility was extremely limited and his memory was poor. But Joanne recalls the moment she had to tell him his mum had died: “It was just awful,” she says. “He just started crying and there was little we could do to comfort him.” Adam suffered another setback when he was warned he might never regain control of his legs and he resigned himself to life in a wheeelchair. But things improved when he was sent on an intensive physiotherapy course. His balance started to improve and he began to believe he could walk again.

Revellers for the Royal wedding are set for a sizzling treat with forecasters confident the blue skies and sunshine will hold out until Saturday - and probably beyond.  There is a chance the mercury could even beat the record currently set for May 19 (28.3C), which was recorded in the Argyll Forest Park in Scotland in 1948. Exacta Weather forecaster James Madden told The Express spring could end with another potentially record-breaking bank holiday scorcher.  He said: “The remainder of this month will remain predominantly summery and confidence is increasing for another burst of very warm to hot temperatures for the next bank holiday weekend. “It is plausible that maximum temperatures could rise into the high 20Cs or even the low 30Cs for several days in a row within this period. This will pave the way for a warm and settled start to summer.” The weather will see a brief dip on Wednesday before turning warmer again. Spokesman Grahame Madge said: “High pressure is back in charge and so the outlook is for the weather to be largely fine through this week. “Confidence for good weather on Saturday is increasing, we expect temperatures of between 20C (68F) and 23C (73.4F).  “Temperatures will build through the start of this week with Tuesday likely to be the warmest day, we could possibly see 25C (77F) in parts. “A cold front will bring these values down by around six to nine degrees on Wednesday before it turns warmer again. “There may be some fronts approaching the northwest bringing unsettled conditions over the weekend, but for the majority of the UK we expect conditions to remain dry and fine. “There are no strong signals yet for this pattern of weather coming to an end.”  MeteoGroup forecaster Mario Cuellar said on Monday: “Air will probably start coming to the UK from France, with 24C shown on forecast models by May 21 as temperatures increase. “The weather for the royal wedding looks good for people enjoying time outdoors.” American Ms Markle will be relieved after her reported worries about Britain’s weather disrupting her wedding. The couple will travel in an open-topped carriage if dry, but a covered carriage if wet.

Danielle Dick, 32, died peacefully as she lay next to her husband Tyler in her hospital bed. She received the shock diagnosis after she suffered headaches and struggled to speak 17 weeks into her pregnancy. An obstetrician initially thought it was just pregnancy brain. But after she was rushed to A\u0026ampE doctors discovered that she had three masses in her brain, and they were later confirmed to be stage 4 melanoma.  Tyler, from Goddard in the US state of Kansas, is now speaking out to raise awareness about skin cancer and encourage people to protect themselves and get checked. In 2011, he had noticed a strange mole on his wife\u0027s back and a biopsy found that it wasn\u0027t cancerous. But the mole grew back and a biopsy determined it was melanoma.  Tyler, 32, told the Today programme the mole and the lymph nodes were removed and it was believed Danielle, a physical therapist, was in the clear.   She gave birth to the couple\u0027s first child, a daughter named Taylor, in 2015 and fell pregnant with twins in 2016. But in April 2017 she became frustrated when she couldn\u0027t find the right words. They visited an obstetrician, who told them it was probably pregnancy brain, said Tyler, a nurse anesthetist. However, the couple rushed to A\u0026ampE one day when Danielle couldn\u0027t speak at all. An MRI revealed three melanoma masses in her brain. Danielle would have had a 20 per cent chance of surviving five years if she began immediate radiation treatment, but she chose to delay it so her unborn twins would survive.  She eventually took a chemotherapy pill and underwent some pinpoint radiation. The twins - a boy named Colby and a daughter named Reagan - were delivered prematurely via Caesarean section at 29 weeks on July 12 last year, allowing Danielle to begin aggressive treatment. It was too late, however, as the cancer had spread rapidly through her body. Immediate treatment failed to help and doctors later found almost 20 new masses in her brain. The twins remained in neonatal intensive care until they were strong enough to go home.  She underwent full brain radiation but the cancer spread to her spinal cord, and she was transferred to a hospital in Houston, Texas, for further care as her condition deteriorated. Danielle died next to her husband on April 25, just nine months after giving birth. Tyler said doctors will be carrying out tests to find out if the cancer has possibly spread to the twins. He told Today that his best friend was determined to do as much as she could with their three children and remained upbeat, even when she felt ill or exhausted, before she died.  He said: “She never got any breaks. Every time she went to the doctor she got the worst news of her life. It was just shocking how they would get one [tumour] to shrink or go away and another would pop up.” He added: “She loved those babies so much. She also began ticking things off her bucket list, including swimming with dolphins, going to see The Killers in concert and attending college basketball games.

Abdul Baqi, from Nasirabad village in Pakistan\u0027s Balochistan province, on Saturday expressed his desire to his family that he wants to marry a girl he was in relationship with. The 22-year-old asked the family to take an engagement proposal to the girl\u0027s house. But the news did not go down well with his father and brothers. His 70-year-old father Dost Muhammmad and four brothers - Abdul Ghani, Abdul Sattar, Abdul Rehman and Abdul Karim - held him in a room and gouged out his eyes of their sockets.  They locked his mother in another room so that she could not intervene and save her son. Baqi, who is currently admitted in Jinnah Post Graduate Medical Centre in Karachi, said: I requested my father and brothers that I want to marry a girl I have been in relationship with. My father agreed first. But, three hours later I was taken to a room by my father and four brothers where they tied me to a bed and started taking out my eyes. I kept shouting at them what were they doing? But they didn\u0027t listen to my pleas. Narrating the tragic incident, Baqi said: My father used the back of a spoon to take out my first eye. I saw my eye dangling out of the socket. He then used a knife to cut the veins.  When they removed my first eye, I requested them to leave me now. But they didn\u0027t listen to me at all and removed the other one as well. After they finished, I pleaded to them to please kill me now but they replied they want me be an example for other boys in the village. Abdul Baqi was rushed to a government-run hospital in Quetta by his other siblings, who were informed by neighbours about the incident. From Quetta, he was immediately referred to Karachi\u0027s Jinnah Post Graduate Medical Centre, where doctors confirmed Baqi won\u0027t be able to see again.

city development, has told the authority of his intention to retire.It is thought he will depart before the end of the financial year next March, having guided the Waterfront project towards the completion of two major milestones: a new rail station entrance, and the V\u0026ampA Dundee.Mr Galloway has led the regeneration efforts in Dundee since 1997 when the project first began.Since then, he has developed the area’s masterplan and pushed for new investment coming into the city.As such, he leaves a diverse legacy in his wake after 21 years: the demolition of Tayside House, the relocation of the Olympia, realigned Tay Road Bridge ramps, the Waterfront plots and, of course, the V\u0026ampA Dundee.Mr Galloway was born in Aberfeldy and raised in Glasgow, but later attended Perth Academy before earning a degree at Dundee University.He left the city after graduating, working for almost two decades as a city planner before returning to Dundee to work on the Waterfront

simon murray back to tannadice","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United are set to launch an audacious bid to bring back striker Simon Murray to Tannadice.As manager Csaba Laszlo rebuilds almost an entire squad for next term, the striker has been identified as a man who can grab the goals to get them back to the Premiership.The 26-year-old scored 25 times in a two-year spell with the Tangerines before moving to Hibs when his contract expired last summer.Despite scoring 14 times during his first six months at Easter Road, he was loaned out to Dundee for the second half of the campaign.He hit the net three times for the Dark Blues, helping them get vital points as they survived in the top flight.Murray has now returned to the Hibees and has a year left on his contract but the feeling is he will be allowed to leave this summer if another club comes in for him.Dundee could be interested in making his switch to Dens permanent but are understood to be considering other options as well, while Scottish Cup finalists Motherwell are eying a move for him. And United are definitely considering taking him back.If a deal comes off, the Dundonian will be one of more than an entire team of new faces fixed up in the coming few months.One stumbling block could be the fact Hibs, despite signing him for free a year ago, are likely to demand a fee.As United’s rebuilding process goes into overdrive, former Hamilton Accies and Partick Thistle full-back Ziggy Gordon is another name under consideration.The 25-year-old has spent the last year-and-a-bit in Poland with Jagiellonia Bialystok, but would welcome a move back to Scotland.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/04/5ae6e6a402efc-726x564.jpg ","title":"dundee united star picked for tunisia world cup squad","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United could have a representative at this summer\u0026#8217s World Cup in Russia.Tunisia have named Bilel Mohsni in their provisional squad for the championships, which kicks off on June 14.The 30-year-old has already played for his country six times, including a qualifier for the 2017 African Cup of Nations.If selected for the full squad, the calibre of opposition will be in stark contrast to what he\u0026#8217s come up against this season in the SPFL Championship.He could be getting to grips with the likes of Harry Kane and Raheem Sterling for England, while he could also be trying to stop Eden Hazard and Kevin de Bruyne against Belgium.Panama, the final team in Group G, might provide less of a test than the other two.Soon to be out of contract Mohsni has been a standout performer for United since joining in March.Boss Csaba Laszlo said a trip to the World Cup would only benefit the defender.He said previously: “This can be a great development for him. You see how important the name Dundee United is in Europe and it is important players who come here can make the World Cups.”Mohsni has been picked for the 29-man provisional squad, which will be whittled down to 23 to be announced on June 4.Meanwhile, the other Tunisian to play in Dundee, Sofien Moussa appears to have been overlooked despite being the Dark Blues top scorer.The 30-year-old netted 12 times in the Premiership and League Cup for the Dens Park side \u0026#8211 but that was enough to earn a call up for his country.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"stv2 to close after just a year with bbc blamed","story":"\t\t\t\t\tSTV has announced that STV 2 is to close, with 59 jobs to go.The broadcaster announced today that the channel will close at the end of June.It says it will shift \u0026#8220content investment\u0026#8221 to online.

leaving","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA well-known department store chain has announced it will be returning to the Wellgate.TJ Hughes left the shopping centre in 2011 after it previously occupied a site on the top floor on Victoria Road.The Liverpool-based discount store has agreed a 15-year lease to occupy the unit formerly occupied by British Home Stores following its closure in August 2016.Today’s statement comes on the back of discount gym operator, Xercise4Less, confirming its intention to open on July 31 after investing nearly £1 million in the site.The imminent arrival of the gym and the announcement of TJ Hughes coming back are being heralded as a “catalyst” to attract further investment in the centre.Despite clothing store, New Look, confirming earlier this year that it will be closing its doors at the Wellgate, centre manager Peter Aitken said he was delighted to welcome “national giant” TJ Hughes back into the fold.He said: “We are absolutely delighted to welcome TJ Hughes to Wellgate, which we believe will play a pivotal role in the centre’s ongoing development.“Not only will this national department store reinvigorate the centre but also provide a catalyst for other businesses to invest within the Wellgate.“The news is especially significant in light of the imminent opening of the Xercise4Less gym – together, these new tenants will enliven both entrances to the centre and generate a significant increase in footfall.”Savills UK retail and leisure agency team helped to secure the deal and confirmed that TJ Hughes’ arrival will “significantly” improve the profile of the centre.Stuart Moncur, head of national retail at Savills, said: “Our strategy has been to secure new anchor occupiers.‘‘With the arrival of both Xercise4Less and TJ Hughes, we certainly believe the Wellgate is on the up.“TJ Hughes will occupy the former BhS store at the front of the Wellgate and will significantly improve the profile of the centre as well as drive substantial levels of footfall.“We are excited about the prospects for the centre going forward.‘‘We also expect to have further new lettings to be announced later on in the year.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5afacbe5bfeac.jpg ","title":"travellers pitch up","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA group of Travellers has set up camp near Dundee Ice Arena.Two motorhomes and two caravans have arrived at a car park across from the venue at Camperdown Leisure Park.It comes just days after a group was seen outside the former Toys ‘R’ Us store — which closed in April — at Kingsway West Retail Park.Managers at the site started legal proceedings to evict the Travellers who have since moved on from the area.While the Toys ‘R’ Us store is shut, the unit in which the store operated and the land outside it are owned by fund management firm ARES and operated by property firm GVA.A spokesman said: “Both the owner and management team were aware of the occupiers in situ outside the store.“They did not have permission to be on site and as such were served notice that they must leave the land immediately.’’Similar to the Toys ‘R’ Us site, the area at Camperdown Leisure Park is not licensed for the purposes of camping — meaning anyone who sets up caravans there is doing so illegally.Travellers have been seen in the area surrounding the ice arena and Cineworld on several occasions in the last few years.Dundee City Council operates a licensed site for Travellers at Balmuir Wood in Tealing.Twenty pitches are available for Travelling communities, each of which features an electricity supply, utility rooms with showers and toilets and 24-hour access.According to housing charity Shelter Scotland, Travellers staying on private sites can be evicted “fairly easily” by landowners if they do not have permission to be there.The charity said: “If you park up on private land without consent, the owner or legal occupier (for example, a tenant) can take steps to evict you.“If the landowner or occupier does decide to evict you, they may apply to the court for an interdict or possession order requiring you to move off the land, ask the council to take action, ask the police to take action or move you on themselves.”A council spokeswoman said: ‘‘We are aware of their presence and are monitoring the situation.”Police Scotland was approached for comment but no response had been received by the Tele at the time of going to press.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"wighton hopes frustrating end to campaign can spur dundee to success next term","story":"\t\t\t\t\tCraig Wighton hopes the anger at the way Dundee finished their season can spur them on to better things next campaign.A long season for most may have just come to an end with the 1-0 home reverse to Partick.For Wighton, however, it feels like it has only just begun after missing the first nine months of the term with a serious knee injury.With the manager and players alike angry at how they finished off 2017/18, Dundee’s youngest-ever goalscorer has more to be annoyed about.He said: “The frustrating thing for me, personally, is I’m just starting to get into it, starting to feel fully match fit and the season’s done.“That is frustrating but I’ll go away in the summer and work hard, come back fit and, hopefully, get a full pre-season under my belt and start the next campaign well.“Maybe Tuesday night against Ross County I got a bit leggy towards the end before I came off but I felt good again against Partick.“It was difficult, it was warm which took its toll on everyone but I feel fit, I feel good and, as I say, it’s a bit frustrating that’s the season done now.“For a lot of the boys they’ll maybe be glad it’s done because it’s been a long one but, for me, I’ve just had a pre-season!“This is basically the start for me and already it’s done which is unfortunate.”Wighton admits the performance across the board at the weekend wasn’t up to scratch.“The manager wasn’t happy and the players weren’t either,” he added.“It’s alright if it’s just not your day and you get beat but the way we played, second half especially, is not acceptable.“We weren’t at it at all.“We knew Partick were fighting for their lives and they would have a go at us but I don’t think we showed any real quality in the final third.“We were slow in possession at the back and Partick deserved the win for their second half.”The defeat echoed the finale to the last campaign – a 4-0 thumping at the hands of 11th-placed Hamilton.That stung for Wighton and he’s hoping this year’s failure to perform on the last day can niggle away at the squad over the summer break enough to spark better next time out.“Obviously, we did our business early in the split but it doesn’t mean that’s it – we wanted to win every game and four out of five would have been a good return so we are disappointed.“Last year it didn’t affect us but when you come back it’s still on your mind a wee bit, it still annoys you.“I think everyone will go away and have a good summer and next season we know we have to be a lot better.”One thing he personally is looking to add is goals – something the team as a whole has lacked in the past year.“Not taking our chances this season has really cost us. We haven’t been clinical enough in front of goal and that’s the difference,” he added.“You look at Kilmarnock – Boyd scoring goals for them – but we feel we’re a better side than Kilmarnock. We are but we just haven’t had that cutting edge in the final third.“Obviously, I never got a goal this term which is frustrating but I think the main thing for me was I didn’t think I would play this season.“Just playing is a big thing for me but next season I do need to start adding goals to my game. It doesn’t matter where I play, goals and assists are where I’ll get judged on at the end of the day.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7486028.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th\u0026nbspAcademy Awards."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7590066.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"11 things you d only hear in Glasgow","story":"                          There are some things you will only ever hear in Glasgow or Glesga, as us locals call it,\u0026nbspand this is our definitive list of the best."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7608211.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"New documentary about Celtic legend Tommy Burns to be made to air on TV this year","story":"                          A NEW documentary about Celtic legend Tommy Burns has been announced on the 10th anniversary of his death."},{"url":null,"title":"Discarded needles and a poo in a sock  Shocking scenes in a Glasgow city centre lane","story":"                          THESE are the shocking images showing the blight of drugs on Glasgow\u0027s streets -

But the Courier understands the \u0026pound370,000 art installation, still branded by Highland Council as the Gathering Place, will be divided into two sections positioned on either side of the river. The installation is thought to be a mix of stone and wooden construction.There is great excitement among city councillors who have seen two-dimensional design work, and there is apparent consensus that it is aesthetically pleasing and will easily blend into the local, tranquil environment.The \"pier\" project, proposed for a spot by Eden Court, was aborted two years ago due to the scale of public objections to the design.The location for the new proposal is believed to be nearby, slightly further upriver, at the most shallow point on the edge of the Ness Islands.The council\u0027 Inverness city committee delegated powers of approval to the Inverness city arts working group. Its current chairwoman, councillor Isabelle MacKenzie, said she had closely scrutinised the fresh concept adding that it was \"within budget\".Giving little away, she added: \"I can see it appealing to the local community.

Mr Hendry branded it the \u0026ldquoworst kind of postcode lottery and asked the Department of Work and Pensions minister to make urgent changes.And he also called on the minister to follow the Scottish government\u0027 lead and remove the legal definition of terminal illness, currently set at six months by the UK government.\u0026ldquoUnder existing UK government rules, people with conditions such as terminal heart failure, motor neurone disease and other terminal conditions need to apply for social security in the usual way and are subject to the normal assessments, including work assessments.\u0026ldquoThey are quite simply not considered terminal enough \u0026ndash this policy exposes a Tory government at its very worst and they are wilfully failing families dealing with the trauma of terminal illness.\u0026ldquoPeople who are dying should not be forced to go to appointments with work coaches, nor should they have to spend their last month\u0027 fighting for much needed financial support.\u0026ldquoEven those who fall under the UK government\u0027 \u0026lsquosix months to live\u0026rsquo definition are subjected to heart-breaking waits for their financial support.Wednesday 16 May 2018 1:51 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"}]
