Now, it is associated instead with ‘The Duchess of Givenchy’.    Meghan wowed her groom - and the world - in May in a bespoke Givenchy wedding dress and 16ft-long train stitched with flowers from 53 Commonwealth countries. The estimated cost is £200,000    Last month\u0027s visit to meet chefs at the Hubb Community Kitchen, who collaborated on her community cookbook, saw Meghan finish off her outfit with Givenchy\u0027s £790 \u0027GV3\u0027 black ankle boots          Another wedding, another Givenchy outfit. the Duchess wore this bespoke navy coat dress to Princess Eugenie\u0027s nuptials in October, worth an estimated £8,000The label’s parent company LVMH appears to be reaping the benefits. Turnover on fashion and leather goods is up from £9.7 million last year to £11.7 million in the first three quarters of this year.In its interim financial report, for the first six months of this year, it states: ‘Givenchy benefited from the success of Clare Waight Keller’s first collections, presented with an exclusive staging at several emblematic boutiques. The main highlight... was the design of the Duchess of Sussex’s wedding gown, with media coverage of the event generating extremely high visibility for Givenchy.’So who is Clare Waight Keller, and how did her partnership begin with one of the world’s most closely scrutinised women?           A return to the trusted Givenchy for Meghan\u0027s first solo outing at the Royal Academy of Arts\u0027 Oceania exhibition in September. The velvet appliqued midi dress with sheer panels cost £2,960    This elegant Givenchy cape dress, estimated to be wroth £8,000, was Meghan\u0027s choice fr her first joint engagement with the Queen in June. Her accessories are also Givenchy: a £899 clutch and £340 \u0027Double G\u0027 beltIt started in such secrecy that Keller, a mother of three, didn’t even tell her American architect husband Philip. Even the Arnault family, which owns the brand, were kept in the dark.Birmingham-born Keller, 48, who studied at the Royal College of Art before working for Calvin Klein in New York, became the creative head of the fashion house in May last year and had been burying herself in the brand’s archives when she received a phone call.It was November 2017, immediately after Prince Harry and Meghan’s engagement. The request came completely out of the blue: the Royal bride-to-be wanted Keller to design her wedding dress.‘I think she had seen my work and knew what I did,’ the designer said after the wedding.           Arriving in Ireland in July, Meghan wore the first of four jaw-droppingly expensive outfits for her Irish tour. The Givenchy £1,199 patch pocket skirt was matched with a £600 crew-necked top, also Givenchy          The Duchess opted for a £1,885 Givenchy trouser suit for a trip to Dublin\u0027s Croke Park in July. There\u0027s also her trusty £340 \u0027Double G\u0027 belt and a new £1,765 \u0027GV3\u0027 frame bag - plus her trademark sky-high heels    Channeling My Fair Lady at Ascot in June with a bespoke white Givenchy dress, worth about £8,000.

Both have a similar sense of style and a collection of Manolo Blahnik shoes.Meghan has the designer’s BB pumps in five colours and Clare has a lizard pair she loves. Their joint interests extend to the great outdoors and their much-adored pets. Still, their heritage makes them unlikely bedfellows.           Another entirely Givenchy outfit for the Duke and Duchess\u0027s public walkabout in Rotorua, New Zealand, this October.

The request came completely out of the blue: the Royal bride-to-be wanted Keller to design her wedding dress          Prince Harry and Meghan wave from the Ascot Landau Carriage. Meghan’s vision, which was elegant, classical and timeless, was true Givenchy. All ‘seven or eight’ fittings with the bride were done personally, in secret, in LondonThere, she worked alongside another of Meghan’s muses – Carolyn Bessette, who married John F. Kennedy Jr.Four years later, the ambitious designer was off to Ralph Lauren for the launch of his bespoke men’s Purple Label collection.Then, in 2000, at the age of 29, she returned to London to work for Gucci’s Tom Ford.Her big breakthrough came when she turned around the fortunes of Scottish knitwear brand Pringle. Her work there won her the coveted Designer of the Year trophy at the Scottish Fashion Awards.But it was only in 2011, when she took over as creative designer at Chloé, that she began to achieve public acclaim. She is rumoured to have left because the label wouldn’t give her ‘salary increases proportionate to sales’ but was keen, too, to return to Britain for her twin girls’ education.These days, she spends half the week in the family home in World’s End, Chelsea, the rest in Parisian hotels for Givenchy. She has immersed herself in the brand and befriended its founder, the late Count Hubert de Givenchy, who told her that Givenchy was ‘all about the shoulders, darling’.Sadly, he died in March, two months before Meghan walked down the aisle in a dress which showed to the world that it was indeed all about the shoulders. Talking about being the first female designer at Givenchy, Keller said recently: ‘I can understand why people touch on it, because of course whenever women get into higher positions it’s always something to be applauded.‘But I don’t think we should anchor everything on that, because it’s so important to actually think of women as strong creatives: people who can bring and contribute something, rather than just purely for the fact that they’re female.‘It’s through the work that I do that I’m able to push up higher and be so successful.’A mantra, it seems, which is not so different from that of the Duchess of Sussex herself."},{"url":null,"title":"Chronic fatigue condition caused active immune study claims","story":"NHS volunteer army to DOUBLE: As 23,500 sign up for Mail...Best mates until the end: Friends, 27, died in each others...Share this articleTheir findings are based on a study of patients with Hepatitis C.Thirty per cent of them, when treated with a drug called interferon alpha, developed tiredness symptoms mirroring those of chronic fatigue syndrome.

The Government could call such a vote at any time. Labour also has some opportunities to call a vote - though winning such a vote would have less power.It could even be a whole general election where one or more sides puts a new referendum in their manifesto. What would the question and be who decides? Nobody knows for sure - and this is probably the hardest question of all.Some say it should be a simple repeat of last time, with Leave or Remain on the ballot paper. Others say it should be Remain versus Mrs May\u0027s Brexit deal.Others advocate a two stage referendum - between Remain and Leave, followed by Mrs May\u0027s deal versus No Deal if Leave wins. Still others say there could be multiple questions on the ballot paper, possible using a ranking system known as alternative vote.The Electoral Commission would make a recommendation and MPs would make the final decision on what the question would be. Would exit have to be delayed from March 29? Yes. On the shortest timescale imaginable, a referendum would take almost six months from the point the decision was taken - something which has not happened yet. Exit day is less than four months away."},{"url":null,"title":"Thousands march Brussels against U N migration pact","story":"    A protester throws a missile at the police during an anti-migrant demonstration outside of EU headquarters in Brussels          A Flemish nationalist attends a protest against Marrakesh Migration Pact in Brussels.

But I don’t care if I just find a nail. It’s still such a thrill!’Of course, every so often there’s the occasional find — a crotal bell which once hung round the neck of an animal with a rattling metal pea inside an old locket with an intricate design and a selection of Roman coins — ‘2,000 years old, at least’.‘Just think, all the time that stuff’s been in the ground!’ says Len, aglow as he cradles what look suspiciously like a pendant circa 1970 in his giant paws.But finally, his luck changed. He came across a 2,000-year-old Roman figure sitting in a large Flora margarine tub.‘The minute I saw it, I just had a feeling,’ he says. ‘The colour, the weight. I thought it was important and very, very old.’ Although, technically, he did not actually detect it.It all started last December when Len was hunting a new stretch of fields near his home. He was chatting to the landowner who then showed him a small broken statuette, found on the land 15 years earlier by a fellow detectorist, dismissed as a copy, dumped in the Flora tub, and left in a room off the kitchen.She haunted Len, who knew she was something special. And when, six months later, he’d unearthed a few bits and bobs himself, he asked the farmer if he could take her along with his own hoard, to be identified and dated at the Museum Resource Centre in nearby Standlake.The landowner agreed and Len lovingly swaddled her, plus body parts, in white tissue paper and placed her in a large sandwich box.‘The little head and the little arms were separate, so I got a plastic bag and popped them in. I was very careful. I knew she was important.’The minute the expert saw it, she was on the phone, one thing led to another and, last week, Len and Denise were up at dawn to attend the big unveiling ceremony at the British Museum.           Toby Jones and Mackenzie Crook in the third series of DetectoristsBecause Len had brought to light a 2,000-year-old, silver-eyed, copper alloy and lead statuette of Minerva, the Roman goddess of wisdom.The mere sight of her sent historians, archaeologists and the curators at the British Museum into a frenzy and turned the orderly lives of Len, Denise, a legal secretary, and their two cats Rosie and Polly, upside down.Len became an instant celebrity. News channels from around the world wanted to interview him.‘They’re talking about this in Australia!’ he says. ‘It’s all very strange. We haven’t landed back on the floor yet.’ Meanwhile, Len’s fellow detectorists were thrilled for him and green with envy in equal measure. Because as anyone will know who has watched the Jackmans’ favourite show, BBC4’s award-winning Detectorists, starring Mackenzie Crook, Toby Jones and Rachael Stirling, there is an entire metal-detecting community out there.‘The programme is very, very true to form,’ says Len.So there are websites, Facebook groups, YouTube channels (Len’s personal favourite is iDetect, by a chap called Harry which has over 28,000 subscribers) and two dedicated magazines, The Searcher and Treasure Hunting. Some detectorists hunt in pairs, others prefer organised one-day rallies with an entrance fee.Len, however, prefers to search alone ‘so I can’t fall out with anyone’.Last year, though, he splashed out and bought Denise her own detector — an XP Deus that cost over £1,000.It was not a success. ‘I went once,’ she says. ‘A bitterly cold day and we were out for about four hours and I found nothing. That was enough.’Kenyan warriors compete in running, jumping and...Family of woman, 33, \u0027left for dead by drunk Tinder date...Mystery of woman, 33, who \u0027fell off the back of a motorcycle...Share this articleSo now she sticks to her cross stitch embroideries. Though she’s always on hand to help Len clean his treasures under the tap with an old toothbrush and sweep up the mud from the floor of their immaculate home.Len first caught the bug 20 years ago when he was working as a lorry driver at a nearby gravel pit, and a colleague mentioned he was a detectorist.‘I thought: “Ooh, I wouldn’t mind doing that!” ’So he bought himself a Viking metal detector for about £100, asked a local landowner if he could hunt on his land and that was that. It was the perfect hobby for Len. ‘I’m not interested in sport at all. I just really like walking round fields,’ he says. ‘And what I find might look like a load of old junk to some people, but I’ve always liked history, it’s just a shame we didn’t do more at school.’ He left aged 15 to work first as a tractor driver on a farm, then a coalman, before joining the gravel pit.‘I worked there for 38 years and eight months — all sitting down — so it’s nice to get out for a walk,’ he says.Until the Minerva his finds have been modest. Even so, like many detectorists, Len is rightly obsessive about secrecy. His number is ex-directory.He makes me promise not to ulge the name of his village, or include photos of his car, in case he’s followed. The location of the Minerva is top secret and must remain so. He even has a detectoring alias: ‘Alien.’‘Last week, a drone was following me!’ he says. ‘You have to be careful.’ Because while Len is a stickler for the rules — always seeking permission from landowners, declaring any interesting finds and carefully refilling any holes — some detectorists are not so responsible.‘I once had to tell another detectorist to clear off because he didn’t have permission!’ says Len. ‘People don’t read the rules. They justpick up a detector and think they can go anywhere when, of course, you can’t even go on public footpaths unless you have permission from the landowner.’Even worse are the ‘night hawkers’, detectorists who come out under cover of darkness. ‘They go out at night and dig holes and steal treasures,’ he says. ‘They give us a bad name. They spoil it for the rest of us who do things by the book.’(The Minerva is one of 78,000 archaeological items unearthed by the British public last year and voluntarily recorded with the Portable Antiquities Scheme, managed by the British Museum.)By now, we’re standing in sticky mud in a ploughed field at a secret location near Witney, in an area that used to be awash with Romans. Because Len has kindly agreed to bend his own rules and, just this once, detect a deux, giving me a lesson in how to ‘play’ a field.‘They also call it swinging. So I say to Denise: “I’m off swinging,” and she says: “I hope not, Len!” ’He shows me how to turn on my detector — Denise’s languishing XP Deus. How to twiddle the knobs to tune different metal types in or out and how to swing it ‘low and slow’ in smooth arcs just above the mud.Today it is bright and dry and glitteringly cold with a biting wind, but the chill just bounces off Len.‘I never feel it. I could go on for hours,’ he says. ‘Sometimes I get so engrossed I forget to eat my packed lunch!’          The Romano-British statuette of Minerva which was found in a margarine tub in Hailey, Oxfordshire You’d think that, just perhaps, a once-in-a-lifetime find like the Minerva — which has not yet had a monetary value ascribed to it, but is already wanted by a number of museums — might take the edge off future hunting. But no. ‘People ask me if I want a reward, but the biggest reward I could ask for is to walk round these fields and not be bothered by anyone.’I can see his point. Because despite the juddering cold, it’s rather nice walking across a stubbly field in thin wintery sun, waving Denise’s next to new XP Deus. Even better when it lets out a volley of beeps: Len rushes over and, after a bit of digging, a lot of probing and scrabbling about through the soil, we unearth an ancient buckle.‘Beginners’ luck!’ says Len, who brightens up no end when I give it to him for his collection. ‘Could be medieval!’ he beams. ‘I couldn’t say for sure, but definitely old.’And then he’s back in detectorist heaven, walking up and down, sweeping his machine — and dreaming of another beautiful Minerva. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/17/01/4D512CEB00000578-0-image-m-13_1529194496670.jpg","title":"Tributes pour HQ Trivia founder Colin Kroll apparent overdose","story":"    Colin Kroll, CEO and co-founder of HQ Trivia and previously of Vine, was found dead in his New York City apartment of an apparent overdose. He was just 34 years old Mr Kroll said his son did not have a drug problem but took drugs recreationally.He said: \u0027He worked too many hours and too hard... I think New York City got to him a little bit.\u0027You need to have great constraint to have a disciplined life there. All of that leads to getting too much drugs or bad drugs and overdosing.\u0027 Last night, Scott Rogowsky, the primary host of live game show Trivia HQ, paid tribute to Kroll - with a video message on the app. Rogowsky praised Kroll for changing \u0027the game twice, first with Vine and then with this very app that you\u0027re hearing and seeing me through right now.\u0027 \u0027HQ Trivia, the game show that you love so much, would not exist without him,\u0027 he added. Rogowsky called Kroll a \u0027good friend and colleague\u0027 and said he was a person of \u0027compassion and generosity\u0027. \u0027His sudden loss leaves all of us here at HQ shocked and deeply saddened,\u0027 the host continued. \u0027Colin was also a loving son and brother and our thoughts and sympathies are with his family at this time.\u0027 \u0027Out of respect there will be no show tonight, but we will resume our regularly scheduled programming with HQ Trivia tomorrow night.\u0027           Police found Kroll dead in his apartment in Manhattan (pictured) shortly after midnight Sunday morning with drugs believed to be cocaine and heroin nearby          HQ and Vine co-founder Rus Yusupov (pictured with Kroll) later tweeted his condolences            \u0027I found a good deal of negative sentiment about Colin and the Vine team and some discomfort with his behavior, but I did not find evidence that warrants his removal from the company,\u0027 Liew said in a statement. Kroll later told Axios that the experience was \u0027eye-opening\u0027 and a \u0027catalyst for professional development and greater awareness in the office\u0027. \u0027I now realize that there are things I said and did that made some feel unappreciated or uncomfortable. I apologize to those people,\u0027 he added. Following his son\u0027s death, Kroll\u0027s father Alan said the Recode article had \u0027troubled and hurt\u0027 his son. Alan told the New York Times that Kroll had recently stopped drinking and did not have a drug problem that he was aware of, but that he often worked 100 hours a week. \u0027He worked too many hours and too hard,\u0027 Alan said. \u0027I think New York City got to him a bit. You need to have great constraint to have a disciplined life there.\u0027 \u0027All of that leads to getting too much drugs or bad drugs and overdosing.\u0027 Alan, who was aware that his son used drugs recreationally, said that Kroll recently had talked about moving away from New York. \u0027He had so much talent and had accomplished so much at such a young age. It truly is a waste,\u0027 he added. \u0027At 34, imagine the things he\u0027d done and the skills he had. It would have been really fun to watch him at 50.\u0027             HQ Trivia host, Sharon Carpenter, took to her social media to express her condolences           HQ Trivia\u0027s main Twitter account also tweeted condolences to Kroll\u0027s family Kroll\u0027s HQ and Vine co-founder Rus Yusupov tweeted his condolences on Sunday. \u0027So sad to hear about the passing of my friend and co-founder Colin Kroll.

Don’t panic – our guide will help you get organised, giving you more time to relax and enjoy the festive season. Find out how to be a savvy Christmas shopper with our expert tips.Start earlyIt’s never too soon in December to think about Christmas purchases, says Amanda McCall, director at Gifts International. “The chronic procrastinators among us may not like to admit it, but the only way to do a good job on your Christmas shopping is to start early. We’ve all left buying an important gift until the last minute at some point, but you’re simply not going to find the perfect present if you’re dashing around the shops in a panic on Christmas Eve. So, this year, leave yourself plenty of time.”Be online shopping savvyBe organised about your online shopping and you’ll save time and money. “Decide on some themes from what you know about your family and friends,” says Lena Gore, co-owner of online retail company Find Me A Gift.Simon Exton from AO agrees: “I have lots of young nieces and nephews, so I decided that I was going to buy gaming stuff for them.”Put key dates in your diaryGet familiar with the last posting dates - this year, it’s 18 December for second class, 20 December for first class, 21 December for Royal Mail Tracked 24, and 22 December for Royal Mail Special Delivery Guaranteed.Ask for suggestionsWe all want to give presents that our loved ones actually want. So rather than stressing about finding the perfect surprise, just ask them, says Lucy Ward, creative brand director at online marketplace Trouva. “More often than not, surprises can be a bit of a disappointment, and, in a world that’s thinking more sustainably, we want to be giving less and giving better gifts. I’m an advocate of just straight up asking people what they want. That way, you can guarantee your gift isn’t going to waste.”Stick to your budgetAgain, starting early is key to making sure you don’t spend too much. Make sure you know exactly how much you want to spend – Gore recommends working out an overall budget first, then inidual gift budgets. And she suggests subscribing to the newsletters of the websites you’re thinking of using, to keep an eye on their offers. “Buy as soon as you see an offer you like. If you leave it until the last minute, you’re more likely to impulse buy, which may mean breaking your budget.”Check your delivery datesMcCall recommends going for nominated day delivery options whenever possible. This means you can pick a time and day convenient for you, which is particularly helpful during the busy festive season. “You can also arrange for gifts to arrive while your family are out, so it won’t spoil the surprise before Christmas morning.” Check the delivery options available before you buy: electricals specialist AO offers free delivery on all items, including its Christmas gift ideas and stocking fillers, and provides both click and collect and next-day delivery.Be preparedAvoid the stress of unexpected visitors by stockpiling extra gifts, says McCall. “It’s always lovely to see family and friends during the festive season, but it can be quite embarrassing if you receive a gift and have nothing to offer in return.” She recommends keeping a few festive gifts wrapped up with the tags blank, so you can fill them out at a moment’s notice. “Chances are they’ll never even realise it was a last-minute gift.”Visit AO for great ideas for Christmas gifts and stocking fillers"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ccf1d1aa9648925db063971e9e31f639b1a7624/0_47_3005_1803/master/3005.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=37ed961b78c3803744b4319f9eda9eaa","title":"practical makes perfect why the best gifts are the useful ones","story":"We’ve either got gadgets coming out of our ears or we’re jammed into city flatshares too cramped for tat. Is it any wonder many gift recipients simply want something whose function will enhance their lives?Christmas present buyers generally fall into two camps. There are those who believe a present should be thoughtful and sentimental and whimsical, a touch of decadent luxury you would never buy for yourself – think champagne truffles, sparkly gloves or fancy underwear. Then there are the practical gift-givers, the functional Father Christmases, who want to buy a present they know will actually be useful – even if that means wrapping up a microwave oven. But is it possible to find that sweet spot between the two?“With a rising awareness of sustainability, and a general sense of “peak stuff”, we’re seeing people increasingly lean towards either experiences, as opposed to a physical gift, or presents that are more meaningful and useful,” says Lucie Greene, trend forecaster at JWT Innovation. “The era of frivolous novelty junk is almost over. It’s a tax on the planet, and adds nothing to our lives, especially when many live in cities, where space is at a premium.”So those £1 flashing reindeer socks are out, but that doesn’t mean we can’t have a dose of sentimentality in our stocking fillers. “I think the movement in gifting is towards more considered and thoughtful presents,” says Greene. “This ties in with the growing influence of Nordic philosophy, which is to focus on quality over quantity.” Whether it’s food, furniture, electrical items or clothing, buying gifts that are seasonless, of high quality and well-designed is always appreciated. “We might be buying less and spending less, but we’re putting more thought in.”Interestingly, being too thoughtful might actually be making us worse present-givers. According to a 2014 study from the Journal of Consumer Research, we imagine our loved ones will want a gift that is impressive, expensive, and sentimental. And yet gift receivers actually report being happier when they get exactly what they asked for. For coffee aficionados, that might mean getting a top-notch, luxury coffee maker, although your average Joe might be happier with a simpler machine.“Have nothing in your houses that you do not know to be useful or believe to be beautiful” was designer and poet William Morris’s golden rule, and it’s a pretty good rule of thumb for presents too. But, of course, the definition of useful is pretty subjective one person’s deeply practical, everyday item is another’s frivolous folly.“Try to think about a person’s interests and what they like to do on a daily basis, and then elevate it so that you make it a bit special,” says Polly Hadden-Paton, a professional gift-buyer tasked with buying last-minute gifts for many famous or busy clients.As with many trends that have become mainstream, millennials were early adopters of what’s been called “stealth luxury”. David Burstein, author of Fast Future: How the Millennial Generation Is Shaping Our World, explains: “The younger generation came of age at a time when spending lots of money on flash things had a negative connotation, thanks to the 2008 financial crisis. While a few decades ago Yuppies splashed their cash on expensive gadgets for their significant others, such as watches and jewellery, now Muppies (that’s millennial yuppies, FYI) are more likely to want to receive high-value items that serve a purpose and add real value to their lives, such as iPhones or Nutribullets.”Veer too far towards utility, of course, and you’ll find yourself in the doghouse. “I had a friend whose mother-in-law bought her a drying rack for Christmas,” recalls Hadden-Paton. “That’s probably a bit too practical.”Visit AO for great ideas for Christmas gifts and stocking fillers"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cfd7c1ec0e7dd10eada046f5e340928c26ddfa96/0_0_2924_1754/master/2924.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f5cc37abf797038b5aa571db9b03d29e","title":"top toys for 2018 and the 500 extra youll spend five facts about christmas shopping","story":"Expect to see slime and the Boxer robot topping children’s gift lists, plenty of online shopping, and more socks under the treeWe spend the equivalent of two working weeks preparing for ChristmasChristmas is time-consuming.

Can Jeremy Corbyn and Bernie Sanders help to take it further?The world is burning. The water is rising. A figure of exceptional cruelty sits in the White House, an inspiration to reactionaries everywhere. The wise men and women of the political centre are bewildered. (The norms are shredded, the civility is gone, fact-checking doesn’t appear to have its intended effect.) Disoriented by their loss of legitimacy, they dream of gluing their broken politics back together. They prefer not to reflect on why their politics broke in the first place.If all of this sounds pretty grim, it should. We are hurtling towards a bad future. Yet that future isn’t inevitable – and, in recent years, a growing number of people have been working hard to make it less likely. This is the bright spot in our mostly bleak moment: a rising wave of militancy and mobilisation on the left, particularly the socialist left, in the US and the UK, two countries where the left in general and socialism in particular have been in retreat since the late 1970s.American and British socialists are no longer constantly losing. They are occasionally even winning. They are building institutions, running for office, organising workplaces, engaging in direct action and mutual aid. Against the nihilism of the right and the timidity of the centre, they are advancing a vision of a habitable future, one where the working class in all of its variety – young, migrant, queer – can live.The movements in the UK and US are not monolithic. They are composed of distinct currents, and contoured by countless debates. Socialism is a complex and contested tradition, no less so in 2018 than in 1968 or 1918. Still, two figures loom large: Jeremy Corbyn and Bernie Sanders. For all their differences, both belong to the socialist tradition – Corbyn hailing from the Bennite Labour left, Sanders from the Young People’s Socialist League. Both are “survivors” in Peter Frase’s term: they form a living link between the present and socialism’s last period of strength in the 1960s and 70s, having kept the faith through the long night of Thatcherism, Reaganism, Blairism and Clintonism. And both are central to the socialist resurgence in their respective countries. While the socialist moment certainly exceeds them – and indeed includes elements that are indifferent or hostile to them – they remain critically important to its prospects.Two new books offer insights into their respective projects. Economics for the Many (Verso), a collection of essays edited by Corbyn’s shadow chancellor John McDonnell, is an overview of the new economic thinking around Corbynism, and a sketch of policies that a future Labour government might pursue. Sanders’ Where We Go from Here: Two Years in the Resistance (Biteback) is a memoir of political struggle since 2016, and a roadmap of sorts for progressive advance under Trump.Whatever your thoughts on Corbyn and Sanders, the forces they have channelled and inspired are at an interesting stage of development: no longer in their insurgent phase, they have succeeded in pushing formerly fringe ideas into the mainstream, but don’t yet wield power on the scale required to put those ideas into practice. They may soon. Even if it were to disappear tomorrow, Corbynism is an impressive achievement. When Corbyn won the leadership of the Labour party in 2015, the official consensus was that he wouldn’t last long. Memorably, Tony Blair warned of Labour’s “annihilation”. Three years later, Corbyn remains at the helm and Labour is in good health. Far from annihilating the party, Corbyn has invigorated it. Membership has soared: buoyed by an influx of some 350,000 new members, the party has nearly tripled in size. The general election in 2017 saw Labour’s largest increase in vote share since 1945 on the strength of its most radical manifesto in decades.Corbynism has shown the political viability of an unambiguously leftwing programme, one that directly attacks the logic of austerity and the supremacy of finance capital. I write this in the week of the Brexit non-vote and the challenge to Theresa May’s leadership the immediate future is unclear. But if Labour were to win the next election, what would Corbyn in power look like?Economics for the Many offers materials towards an answer. Its 16 essays cover a wide range of subjects, from trade to taxes to tech. They set forth different ways to think about the economy and provide a number of proposals for restructuring it. Broadly, the common thread is what Martin O’Neill and Joe Guinan have called Labour’s “institutional turn”: the ambition to move beyond tweaking existing institutional arrangements and begin generating new ones. Corbynism aspires to transform the British political economy as thoroughly as Thatcherism did.What might this transformation look like? Judging from Economics for the Many, the desired outcome is a high-wage, high-productivity economy oriented away from finance and towards productive sectors. It’s one in which public banks, public investment and public ownership play a significant role, along with a large network of co-operatives. An active industrial policy shepherds the transition to a post-carbon society through a “Green New Deal”, while increased spending on healthcare, childcare and education sustains a robust system of social provision.This arrangement is still recognisably capitalist, but rebalanced on the basis of a new social-democratic settlement that pulls British society in a more humane and egalitarian direction. It’s also an arrangement that capital will fight tooth and nail to prevent. Even if Corbynism doesn’t break with capitalism, its agenda entails substantial social control over the accumulation process. If history is any guide, capital will try, or at least threaten, to sabotage this agenda by blowing up the economy: refusing to lend, refusing to invest, or pulling its money out of the country.McDonnell is aware of this danger, which is why he has been “war-gaming” different scenarios. Many of the book’s contributors seem aware of it too: in one essay, Simon Wren-Lewis explains Labour’s “fiscal credibility rule”, designed to soothe financial markets by promising not to overspend. Other manoeuvres suggest themselves: playing small capital off against big capital, playing productive capital off against financial capital.But these are, at best, short-term tactical moves to create a bit of breathing room while deeper developments are under way. The only force capable of securing a new social-democratic settlement is the same force that secured the last one: large-scale mobilisation from below. The welfare states of the postwar period were possible because millions of people expected and demanded change. The long postwar boom also meant, crucially, that those concessions could be funded out of growth, not redistribution.Today, there is relatively little growth. As a result, an even greater mobilisation will be required. Contemporary social democracy will have to cut into capital’s slice rather than count on a bigger pie. This makes the question of class struggle centrally important – a question that is curiously absent from Economics for the Many. It’s a testament to the intellectual richness of Corbynism that there are enough ideas swirling around it to fill a very interesting book. Ideas aren’t the only thing, however, and may not even be the most important thing. One suspects that Corbynism’s fortunes will have more to do with how many people are willing to engage in disruptive action in their communities and workplaces to defend its project, and to develop it in new directions from below. Winning an election is only the first step. “The really important question,” Ralph Miliband once wrote, “is what happens then.”On the other side of the Atlantic, the balance of forces is somewhat less favourable. Nobody is war‑gaming capital flight. The American left is more confident and combative than it has been in decades, but its enemies are stronger. In Where We Go from Here, Sanders describes the anger he felt on the day of Trump’s inauguration. He wanted to work on “enormous problems” like healthcare, inequality and climate change. Under Trump, however, he knew he would be pushed into a different posture: operating “in a defensive mode, preventing bad situations from becoming worse”.In the age of Trump, the left is necessarily playing defence. But it’s important to play the right kind. Since the 2016 election, two schools of anti-Trumpism have emerged. The first wants to turn back the clock and restore the status quo ante. It places its faith in norms, bipartisanship and constitutionalism. This is the position of the liberal centre and the Democratic party leadership. It was well articulated by Nancy Pelosi in her victory speech after the Democrats regained the House of Representatives in the recent midterms, when she vowed to restore “the Constitution’s checks and balances to the Trump administration”.The other anti-Trumpism, by contrast, emphasises politics over proceduralism. It wants to build a new progressive majority that both dismantles Trumpism and departs sharply from the business-friendly centrism that has long dominated the Democratic party. Sanders is the chief proponent of this vision, and Where We Go from Here shows him working tirelessly towards it. In a series of short chapters, we see him running all over the country, holding rallies in town halls.There are certain prominent figures within the Democratic party who seem discombobulated by our political moment to the point of psychic disintegration. Creatures of consensus, they crave compromise. They need to believe in the existence of anti-Trump Republicans, despite the fact that virtually none exist. They keep trying to find and hold the centre while the right runs circles around them.Sanders is not one of those figures. His approach to politics is rooted in conflict rather than consensus, which makes him better suited to the present situation than most of his Democratic colleagues. In fact, conflict is the theme of his book – not conflict between the parties, exactly, but conflict between the classes. Where We Go From Here is dripping in class struggle. On the very first page, Sanders takes aim at “the billionaire class and the politicians they own”, and it’s a theme he returns to repeatedly. This shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone who has ever heard him speak, but it’s still a little astonishing to see a leading American politician – one of the most popular in the country – talk this way. It is perhaps the most distinctively socialist thing about him. There aren’t just rich people and poor people, he reminds us: the rich are rich because the poor are poor. The rich are pushing down wages, jacking up healthcare costs, making a killing from endless war, stripping Puerto Rico for parts.The solution, Sanders says, is to launch a “political revolution” against them. By this he means pulling in the masses of people typically excluded from electoral politics – in particular the young, people of colour and the working class – and composing them into a grassroots movement that demands less plutocracy and more democracy. His vision is a majoritarian one. “Today, what the American people want is not what they are getting,” he writes, citing broad support for social-democratic policies such as Medicare for All.When Sanders proposed such policies during his 2016 primary run, they were labelled “extreme” and “unrealistic”, he recalls. Now they are mainstream, and many more elected Democrats support them. Two years ago, he notes, he introduced legislation to raise the minimum wage. It had five co-sponsors. When he did so again in April 2017, 22 senators came onboard, including most of the Democratic leadership.Clearly, Sanders is winning some battles. But many others remain. He has succeeded in pushing the Democratic party leftwards in some respects, and has helped inspire a new generation of challengers such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The struggle is far from over, however. The party is still ruled by the centre, which enjoys structural advantages that may be difficult or impossible to dislodge. The Democratic party is extremely adept at co-opting and demobilising social movements, and has successfully resisted any number of attempts to restructure it into a true party of the left.It’s easy to feed the pessimism of the intellect, but it’s important to find sources of hope to keep fuelling the optimism of the will. And the best basis for optimism might ultimately be the strangeness of the situation we find ourselves in – a situation strange enough to make two old socialists central players in British and US politics. There are junctures in history when the elements come unstuck and rearrange themselves into new and surprising patterns. The course of events becomes impossible to predict. Time moves raggedly, in leaps and ruptures.

The firm also runs energy networks and power stations.Innogy SE, npower’s German parent company, warned that keeping npower will hit its retail profits by €50m (£45m) this year and overall group profits will fall by as much as €250m in 2019. The company said it was considering its options regarding the supplier’s future.Martin Herrmann, the chief operating officer at Innogy SE’s retail unit, said: “Adverse developments in the UK retail market and regulatory interventions such as the price cap have had a significant impact on the outlook for the planned retail company.”SSE said the transaction was “complex with many moving parts” and the newly created firm would have faced “very challenging conditions” just as it was hit by integration costs. The company faces a bill of at least £67m for the failed merger.“We closely monitored the impact of all developments and continually reviewed whether this remained the right deal to do for our customers, our employees and our shareholders. Ultimately, we have now concluded that it is not,” SSE’s chief executive, Alistair Phillips-Davies, said.He denied it was a “botched merger” or a mistake to have embarked on the deal 13 months ago. Market conditions and the performance of the firms had changed significantly in the interim, he said, while the final level of the cap had “a big impact” and had been tighter than SSE expected.The cancellation of the merger means the big six that dominate the market – SSE, npower, British Gas, Scottish Power, EDF and E.ON – will not immediately shrink to the big five.SSE has 7.35m customers and Npower has 4.06m after losing half a million in the first nine months of the year.Phillips-Davies said he expected the big six would still lose customers to smaller rivals next year, but at a slower rate than before. “Overall the non-big six will continue to grow their market share,” he said.There could still be consolidation in the sector. Another larger supplier could buy up the SSE unit that supplies energy to households and businesses, while npower’s customers could end up with those of another German company, E.ON, because of an asset swap between E.ON and Innogy SE’s owner, RWE.Analysts said the failure of the deal was a negative for Innogy SE and E.ON. “E.ON would likely have to absorb npower and would likely spend several painful years to restructure and integrate it,” Jefferies bank said.Industry watchers also said they believed SSE’s retail unit would be too small to pursue an independent listing.Experts at Bernstein Bank said that despite SSE management claiming no new IT investments would be needed for the supplier, one of the attractions of the merger had been that npower has a newer IT system.Phillips-Davies insisted that a standalone company was a viable option, but would not be drawn on a timetable for the retail arm’s future. “We’ll take our time to think about it,” he said.If the group was stuck with the energy supply business for an extended period of time, he said the company would have to review what it meant for idends."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd50118cc82e4d4104e7fd1c1f675e8cae95c3f8/0_147_2874_1725/master/2874.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9ba3eba1d9a273db1b0e7bfcc7394d8a","title":"baghdad green zone finally opens gates iraq","story":"For a trial period, cars are allowed in the fortified area, a move many feel does not go far enoughKareem Talal twice helped to bring down the concrete walls surrounding Baghdad’s Green Zone.In 2016 he was among thousands of angry protesters loyal to the Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr who broke into the fortified enclave that houses government institutions and foreign embassies.And in a recent – and this time legitimate – effort to dismantle the barriers, Talal was part of a team of municipality workers who removed concrete blocks in the lead-up to the partial reopening of the central district last Monday.But for Talal, 21, the changes haven’t gone far enough. “The Green Zone should be like any other neighbourhood. The streets should be open to everyone. I should be able to live next door to a minister,” he said as he sat outside a fast-food restaurant with a group of friends in the adjacent Harithiya quarter.Since the US-led invasion in 2003 that toppled Saddam Hussein, the Green Zone has been off-limits to most civilians. While the rest of the capital, known as the Red Zone, reeled from sectarian violence and terrorist attacks for much of the past 15 years, Iraq’s elites took up residence in the relative safety of the Green Zone. It came to symbolise enduring American influence and the growing disparity between Iraq’s leaders and their constituents.The decision by the prime minister, Adel Abdul-Mahdi, to open parts of the high-security area came into force on the first anniversary of the government’s victory over Isis, in a sign that Iraq is enjoying a period of relative stability.For a trial period of two weeks, cars are allowed to traverse the Green Zone from 5pm to 1am along 14th of July Street, a main thoroughfare that connects west and east Baghdad via the 14th of July Bridge – known as the “hanging bridge”. Side roads remain closed off and it is forbidden to stop along the way.Sporadic celebrations could be seen on the night of the reopening, but for many Iraqis the partial return of the area of their city has been long overdue.Talal and his friends live just a couple of miles away, but three of the five young men have never set foot in the Green Zone. “The politicians are comfortable inside. They are just sleeping on money,” said Abbas Fathi. “Look at the other neighbourhoods, they have nothing.”The stark contrast between the Green Zone and the Red Zone becomes evident immediately on passing the entrance checkpoint on 14th of July Street. The streets are clean. Traffic is sparse and orderly. Green lawns and fountains line one side of the boulevard as it leads past the monument of the unknown soldier, built in the 1980s to commemorate the Iran-Iraq war and just one of many historic sites that have been unreachable for the public.Hunain al-Qaddo, a politician, moved into the Green Zone with his wife and three children in 2011. Rather than it being a luxury, he says the relocation was a necessity to protect his family after he received threats. “It’s like living inside a prison,” Qaddo said. They need badges to enter and exit, while special permissions are required to leave at night and to move furniture, electronics or anything that could be used to assemble an explosive device.The physical separation inevitably ushered in social segregation. Stringent entry procedures for non-residents have deterred relatives from visiting. Qaddo’s 12-year-old son has no friends outside the perimeter. His daughter Aya commutes to the Red Zone to attend university, but has not told any of her classmates where she lives. “It’s for security, but also because they would look at me differently,” she said.While the family welcomes the partial opening of the Green Zone, Aya fears that extremist groups could take advantage of the move to launch attacks. “Maybe there will be more explosions and car bombs,” she said.The very concept that parts of the city are safe while others are not has been a source of tension between Iraqis. “We hated the idea of having a safe area within the city,” said Husham al-Madfai, an urban planner and former deputy mayor of Baghdad, who lives in the Mansour neighbourhood. “So the government was safe while the people weren’t.”During his decades of public service, Madfai was in charge of developing master plans for the capital. Karadat Maryam, the Green Zone’s original name and one that Madfai still prefers to use, was supposed to be a residential area interspersed with government offices. But the Ba’ath party closed some roads after it rose to power in 1968. In 2003, US forces shut it off entirely, permanently reshaping Baghdad’s society.“Normal citizens were pushed out,” Madfai explained, not because they were forced, but because movement restrictions made daily life impossible.Baghdadis have yet to feel the impact of the partial reopening. During morning and afternoon rush hours, when the Green Zone is closed, the city’s dilapidated roads and bridges remain clogged with traffic. Traders near the entrance checkpoints still complain that soldiers hassle customers who want to park their cars for quick shopping trips.Talal and his friends, in the meantime, are impatiently waiting for Abdul-Mahdi’s new government to deliver what they need most: jobs and services.“If they don’t meet the demands for the people, we will once again storm the Green Zone. We will enter the ministers’ houses and there will be trouble.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dcf081fbcf5fde026fdeb29f80999ea027cc8e18/0_202_2992_1795/master/2992.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c1544d2963cc2facbe3c0144d214af57","title":"peoples vote brexit cabinet tories second no deal","story":"In the generally dismal year of 2018, one of the most cheering spectacles has been the transformation of the People’s Vote movement from a campaign that could plausibly be presented as the liberal elite demanding its job back, to a grassroots insurgency driven by young people that rallied 700,000 people on to the streets of London in October.Its true faces are not political figures from the past, but tribunes of the future like Femi Oluwole, Lara Spirit and Will Dry. To quote that astute political observer Mr Zimmerman: “Your old road is Rapidly agin’  Please get out of the new one  If you can’t lend your hand.”It would be a serious exaggeration to say that Westminster has embraced this generational moment – but it is undeniable that the notion of a fresh referendum has moved, in the past 12 months, from the periphery of political discourse to the point where it is being seriously discussed in No 10. In response to a Sunday Times report that he was preparing for such a vote, Gavin Barwell, the prime minister’s chief of staff, tweeted this morning that he did not “want” and was not “planning” a second referendum – not quite an absolute denial, I would suggest.David Lidington, Theresa May’s de facto deputy, is also said to be in talks with Labour MPs on how to break the impasse. He and his fellow cabinet members Amber Rudd, Philip Hammond, David Gauke and Greg Clark, are certainly open to the idea of second referendum. I am cautious when any such groupings are instantly characterised as a disciplined caucus – in this case the “gang of five” – since the alignments in this extraordinary constitutional crisis are constantly changing, not least as inidual cabinet ministers weigh up their leadership prospects: one might call it agenda fluidity.The point, however, is that senior Tories are now discussing the option of a people’s vote. Their change of heart is not driven by principle or enthusiasm – none of them wants to go through the root-canal treatment of 2016 again – but practicality and empiricism.As ignominious for May as Wednesday’s confidence vote undoubtedly was, her treatment in Brussels on Thursday was much worse. Having assured her cabinet colleagues on the phone that she would bring home the legal assurances to make her 585-deal acceptable to the Commons, she came back with nothing to offer except a debate about the correct use of the word “nebulous”.Her agreement with Brussels is fit only for the political mortuary, and everyone knows this. Whether the “meaningful vote” in the Commons is held this week or on January 21 (the deadline), it is not coming back to life. None of the alternatives – “Norway-plus”, “Canada-plus-plus”, or variants thereupon – command a parliamentary majority. So the cabinet and MPs must now consider how they feel about a second referendum and a no-deal exit.I say “and” rather than “or” because the options are by no means mutually exclusive. Those cabinet ministers who have come round to a “managed no deal” – an oxymoron if ever there was one – know perfectly well that they have to do much more than run out the clock and march forth to glory on 29 March.For them, the worst outcome is a binary referendum in which the voters are offered a choice between May’s deal and remain. In such circumstances, remain would win by a mile. The Brexiteers would argue – for once, with some justice – that they had been shoddily treated. Hence, those ministers who believe no deal would be merely bumpy rather than completely catastrophic need urgently to persuade the public that it is eminently deliverable, true to the spirit of the 2016 referendum result, and (crucially) a lot better than the status quo of EU membership.Meanwhile, Liz Truss, the able chief secretary to the Treasury, is busily allocating a £2bn pot to deal with the challenges of a no-deal exit. That strikes me as a conservative figure, given what we already know about the implications of crashing out of the EU for healthcare, trade, haulage and transport.It seems to me that there would be a refreshing honesty in a referendum that offered voters a straightforward choice between remain and a no-deal exit. Nobody, on either side, could subsequently complain that the public had not known what it was choosing between.But I doubt that such a clarity of choice will be easily achieved.There are plenty of senior Tories and Labour figures who would only accept deal v no deal, on the grounds that a second referendum can only clarify rather than reverse the 2016 decision. Others favour a three-option ballot paper (deal, no deal, remain) with an “alternative vote” mechanism to determine the most acceptable option.The official Brexit date is little more than 100 days away. Yet in less than a week we have been whisked from “will May go ahead with the meaningful vote?” to “what should appear on the ballot paper in a second referendum?”So there is a festive whisper of hope that we might yet escape this mess. But only a whisper. It would be highly irresponsible to suggest that anyone is yet safe from – whatever is claimed to the contrary – the appalling risk of a no-deal tumble into the abyss. Because nobody is."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71c72b869090a745e7bf1c84594c103e97152198/0_271_4648_2788/master/4648.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4a6cc72c2cc85240df773319a9fc4754","title":"brexit football gary lineker jonathan agnew","story":"The stars of England’s 1990 World Cup team are playing a game of remain v leave, with Jacob Rees-Mogg as refereeIt was inevitable that Brexit would ide the country. But who would have thought it would also do for that supreme symbol of English pride, togetherness, bulldog spirit, hope and almost-glory – the 1990 World Cup football team?Twenty-eight years ago, football very nearly came home (six years before the actual song) when England finished a heroic fourth in the World Cup. Back then the nation was united by Gary Lineker’s goals, Peter Shilton’s saves, Gazza’s tears, and Chris Waddle’s penalty miss.And now? It seems as if we’d be hard-pressed to get the boys to share the same football pitch, never mind a vision for our post-Brexit future. The scuffle started last week – on Twitter, of course – when Waddle (62 caps, six goals for England) tweeted: “Well done Theresa May, now let’s leave Brexit with no deal we will be fine.” As is the way with controversial celebrity tweets, it has now been deleted.The centre-forward Lineker (80 caps, 48 goals) responded to his ex-wing man by telling him to “stick to football”. A rather audacious case of pot and kettle you might think (which he acknowledged with his use of smiling, laughing emoji). After all, this is the very Gary Lineker who announced in July: “There are some things in life that, even for someone like me, are more important than football,” and who has spent the past five months campaigning for a people’s vote.Indeed, such is the schismatic might of Brexit that, at times, Lineker has appeared to be at war with himself. Last year he tweeted: “Leave won. Get over it.” He has since said he is “happy to admit I’ve now changed my mind,” and that he “did not envisage at the time that we’d ever contemplate a no-deal Brexit and the ensuing carnage that would bring”.Waddle and Lineker at war? We’ve barely started. Jonathan Agnew, who heads up the BBC’s cricket coverage, told Lineker in no uncertain terms (yes, on Twitter, of course) that he should heed his own advice and stick to football. “You are the face of BBC Sport. Please observe BBC editorial guidelines and keep your political views, whatever they are and whatever the subject, to yourself. I’d be sacked if I followed your example.” Such bravura pomposity would put the effortlessly supercilious Jacob Rees-Mogg to shame.Talking of whom, the great Brexiteer himself was then up for a discussion in what was fast becoming a debate of Solomon-eque sagacity. And strangely enough this takes us straight back to England’s 1990 World Cup squad. None other than the legendary goalkeeper Peter Shilton, England’s most capped player (125) tweeted on Wednesday: “Have been so impressed with @Jacob_Rees_Mogg @Conservatives @itvnews with interviews in the last few days.”Not surprisingly, this got Lineker’s goatee. “What’s that old saying?” he tweeted. “You should never see a tweet from your heroes?” Lineker found himself supported by the former England midfield enforcer Peter Reid (who played in the World Cup in 1986, though he had retired by 1990). “I’ll agree to disagree on that one, Goalie. He’s loopy, doesn’t know his arse from his elbow,” Reid tweeted.At the time of writing, the world is still waiting for Paul Gascoigne’s contribution. But we have it on good authority that he’s feeling rather lachrymose about the whole sorry Brexit soccer shitshow. Meanwhile, it looks as if Rees-Mogg, newly reborn as a Harry Redknapp‑esque man of the people, has been called in to arbitrate. A panicked Shilts tweeted him begging: “Help me out here! @Jacob_Rees_Mogg I only said you interviewed well on @itvnews I’m getting hammered.” If we’re relying on the honourable member for the 18th century to bring people together, then we really are in trouble.• Simon Hattenstone is a features writer for the "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9025b36d32b36f54832b95f278519c8dfa0f7b9f/0_245_4840_2904/master/4840.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=72d98268ae4dc0b0972e38cad6ec3cd9","title":"poor people grammar school middle class petition birmingham","story":"“Middle-class families protest at their exclusion from grammar schools.” Not your usual headline, but news nonetheless of a petition signed by thousands of parents objecting to a plan by Birmingham’s six grammar schools to boost the number of poorer children gaining entry. The parents say they are concerned at the possible dilution of high academic standards, but not far beneath is a clear worry that changes to admissions will mean fewer places for middle-class kids.So, at a time of increasing crisis in classroom budgets, the government has had little choice but to make the admission of a few more children from less affluent families a condition of extra funding for selective schools. Earlier this month, 16 grammars were awarded extra cash in return for unscrutinised plans to increase the number of places for poorer pupils.The paucity of these proposals should have been the real story. Instead, we’ve witnessed a powerful backlash from those parents who assume a shot at a place at one of those schools to be their right. More broadly, they reflect the attitudes of a swathe of affluent families across the country, who have long seen the country’s 163 grammar schools as their rightful preserve.Yet the petitioners are walking a tightrope. There’s some unattractive social snobbery in their suggestion that allowing in more local children, as a result of a marginal drop in the pass mark, risks diluting previously high standards. Nor does it look good to appear to oppose educational opportunity for poorer kids.But perhaps the most telling aspect of the whole affair is the publicity the petition has attracted. In this story, as with most coverage of selective education, rarely do we hear from the largest group of all: those who never had a hope in hell of a grammar school in the first place. When was the last time you heard a parent talking on Radio 4’s Today programme about how their child failed the 11-plus, perhaps on grounds of family circumstance or chronic poverty, and was sent to an under-resourced nearby school with few high-attaining children?Where are the petitions from the hundreds of thousands of families whose members have been belittled by a socially discriminatory school system, thus passing down the generations limited opportunities and a lack of self belief?The evidence is overwhelming: grammar schools perpetuate a two-tier system that dangerously constrains the educational progress, confidence and life chances of the vast majority of poorer children.Only well-resourced comprehensive education, with high-quality schools in every area, can provide the best mix of excellence and equity. Tinkering with admissions in a fundamentally flawed system clearly solves nothing and, as the Birmingham petition conclusively shows, ends up pleasing no one.• Melissa Benn is a founder of the Local Schools Network, and chair of Comprehensive Future.

If everyone matured at the same, fixed rate, it wouldn’t be a human process. Indeed, maturation happens at varying speeds across different categories within the same inidual, so I’d say I was easily old enough to vote at 16, but nobody should have given me a credit card until I was 32, and I’ve got the county court judgment to prove it.However, we broadly agree that there’s a difference between a child and an adult, even if we might bicker about the transition point. So the political theorist David Runciman’s view that six-year-olds should be allowed to vote ventures way beyond any standard argument about the age of civic responsibility. Nobody would say that a six-year-old could be held criminally responsible, could be sent to war, could be capable of consent, could be given responsibility for anything. So allowing them the vote – along with, inevitably, seven-year-olds who are even dafter, if anything – is quite a salty proposition.Runciman’s argument is that this is the only way to rebalance political life, which is currently skewed in favour of the old, who don’t (he added) ever need to demonstrate mental capacity, even long after they’ve lost it.The first part of his case is self-evident: pensions are protected while children’s centres are closed, concepts such as sovereignty are prioritised over the far more urgent business of the future: climate change. Nostalgia for a past the young wouldn’t even recognise occupies a centrality that is completely unwarranted.Problematically, most of the arguments against giving six-year-olds a vote have been capsized by the referendum – what if someone cynically made unrealistic promises to them, which could never be realised, and they ended up voting for something damaging and chaotic, run by charlatans? Well, adults do that.Of course, it wouldn’t necessarily tilt politics back towards the interests of the future: people don’t always vote in their own best interests. There’s no guarantee that the under-10s wouldn’t get caught in the wild enthusiasms of a climate-change denier, if it came in a clownish and exaggerated package.Having said that, children do tend towards the progressive, having a natural sense of justice (which kicks in at the age of six months, psychologists have shown, by simulating scenes of great unfairness to babies, and making them cry) and an underdeveloped sense of self-interest. My kid, when he was six, made quite a trenchant case against private property, on the basis that, since everybody needed a house, they shouldn’t cost money, because nobody would want anyone else not to have one. Also, food should be free. It was a kind of pre-Marx communism, where you limit the coverage of the market to only those things that you wouldn’t mind someone else not having.This way of thinking would have been quite useful to have on the electoral register at that time when we’d collectively forgotten how to talk about anything except the deficit. On that particular day, he was quite far to the left of me, but in the normal run of things, we’re aligned, which brings us to the nub of the problem: children obey you on almost nothing, but they do seem to cleave to your politics until they’re adolescent. So giving kids the vote is really just a way of giving parents extra votes. And what’s to stop us having even more children, once there’s so much enfranchisement in it for us?Now, if parents could be trusted to use their influence wisely, and inculcate children with the politics it will take to assure a better future, then I wouldn’t necessarily have a problem with that, apart from, obviously, that culture is already wildly skewed towards parents, and I can envisage a few non-parents brimming over with an inferno of deadly rage. But that’s moot anyway, because parents can’t be trusted, otherwise we’d all already vote Green.In short: no, six-year-olds should not get the vote but while we’re here, should any votes come up in the near future, some vote, as a wild for-instance, that will have an impact on the next five decades of British political life, alongside EU migrants, 16-year-olds certainly should be enfranchised."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82ae2d3ff40f21e889cba92492469c0a1722ad9a/0_105_2581_1549/master/2581.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf5d0894bd3aee92292334bf2dc64e14","title":"tories strong economy brexit austerity theresa may corbyn","story":"Despite Brexit chaos and the failures of austerity, Theresa May still says Britain’s greatest threat is a Corbyn government It usually takes time for established preconceptions to catch up with reality. For political parties, conventional wisdom about their characteristic strengths and opponents’ weaknesses is their bread and butter. It underpins David Cameron’s now famously ironic tweet, ahead of the 2015 election, that the British faced a choice between stability with the Conservatives, or chaos with Ed Miliband. The tweet now stands, like Ozymandias’s hubristic boast, “Look on my works, ye mighty, and despair!”, an inscription on a diminishing Conservative party that has spent the last two years cannibalising itself.And yet, many have still not caught up with the new reality of the Conservatives, because there is another side to the party where perceptions haven’t changed. Last week the Wall Street Journal published a report announcing that there was only thing investors in the UK feared more than Brexit: Jeremy Corbyn. “It isn’t just Brexit that has investors on edge in the UK,” the article warned, “it’s the possibility of a new Labour government run by an avowed socialist.” Quotes from analysts described a Labour victory as a “lose-lose proposition”, “apocalyptic” and “Armageddon”.This was a curious angle to take, given the last two years in general, and the last two weeks in particular. One headscratcher features someone opining on how a Labour government would hit sterling, a currency that reached 18-month lows the week the article was published, and which the Bank of England is forecasting might reach parity with the dollar after a hard Brexit.The Labour-as-doomsday scenario is contemplated by money men with little idea of real life under the Tories. Yet business leaders’ faith in the UK is already plummeting. According to the Financial Times, Britain’s retail investor confidence is at the lowest level since 1995, when records began. The apocalypse is already upon us.When facts do not change perception, we are firmly in the ground of ideology. The Tories themselves have clearly announced the break with business for the sake of another ideology they hold dearer – Brexit. Tory MPs and ministers say “fuck business”, hide from business leaders and insult the Bank of England governor. Their economic credibility, even literacy, is shot, promising £20bn for the NHS from a phantom “Brexit idend”. The UK boss of ThyssenKrupp said only last month that the Conservatives have “failed business” by not making decisions to benefit the economy, but “to prevent an implosion in their own party”.None of the anchors are there any more. The institution that likes to think of itself as the natural party of government has none of the qualities – stability, internal cohesion, economic pragmatism – it once prided itself on. Its key economic policy over the last eight years – austerity – has now been roundly debunked by economists, including at the Internatonal Monetary Fund. Yet still it marches on: a zombie idea, advanced by a zombie party. And with the Tories’ main foreign policy reduced to attacking friends and standing by those who don’t have the country’s best interests at heart, the Tories have vandalised the last of their alleged traditional strengths.But the established consensus is so skewed against the left, so anchored in outdated ideas about “winters of discontent” and economic bailouts, that, despite the Tories’s unravelling and the impending cliff edge of Brexit, a Labour government is still regarded as somehow more risky for the economy. This bogeyman is the only weapon the Conservatives have left, and so Theresa May has retreated from the “stability with us” point that Cameron made in 2015, and focuses on the “chaos” part. She has no other way to promote the Tories anymore: no positive vision for the future, no economic idends from austerity, no harmony within her own party and no friends on the global stage.But, of course, whether the fearmongering comes from the Conservative party or Wall Street Journal, the real threat they fear from a redistributive Corbyn government isn’t to economic stability, but to economic ideology. Hacking back the public realm in favour of the private sector has for too long been accepted as indisputably effective, despite all evidence to the contrary. But events on the ground are fast overtaking these entrenched biases.Brexit has laid waste to the Conservative party and its economic orthodoxy, its slogans now mere etchings on colossal ruins. For its leaders, and their allies in the markets, there is indeed only one thing to fear more than a hard Brexit and that is that biases dissolve quickly enough to usher in a Labour electoral win, and make it the new natural party of government."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0db5e052c250986dfe4d1bb165d6deeb6e40a6d9/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9794cd7634b0316debf97dad3e4524fa","title":"workers rights bosses tech amazon profits staff","story":"As anyone with a TV will know, Amazon’s Christmas ad campaign is built around a surreal fantasia in which its delivery boxes acquire voices and become a global choir, belting out the Jacksons’ 1980 hit Can You Feel It. It’s pretty clear why Amazon chose the song: the music conveys euphoric optimism, while its lyrics evoke a feelgood creed to which everyone could sign up: “If you look around  The whole world’s coming together now … All the colours of the world should be  Lovin’ each other wholeheartedly.”While Jeff Bezos’s company pushes its workers through the frenzy of Christmas, some are trying to make that promise of human unity and universal hope a little more specific. In New York, employees at a “fulfilment centre” in Staten Island have announced that they want to break through the company’s longstanding hostility to organised labour, and collectively unionise. On Black Friday there were strikes and protests by Amazon workers in Spain, Germany, France, Italy and the UK against low wages and “inhuman conditions”. In Australia, where the company has been operating for only a year, two unions have combined to try and organise Amazon workers after one activist was sacked from his agency job at a fulfilment centre in Sydney.A fascinating story is being played out in Minneapolis, where a group of Somalia-born workers has pushed Amazon to accept a very limited form of collective representation. The details of the story include the company’s decision to increase packing targets from 160 items an hour to 230, and workers’ insistence that demands should slacken as people fast over Ramadan. There is still a long way to go, but Amazon has at least changed some management practices at the warehouse and agreed to meet workers four times a year.In terms of PR, the company has one dependable card to play: thanks partly to pressure from US senator and former presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders, it has raised its minimum hourly wage in the US from $11 to $15 (£12) and its lowest British rate from £8 to £9.50. At the same time, however, Amazon has done away with share and incentive schemes, whose loss will reportedly cost some UK workers up to £1,500 a year. In any case, anyone with even a passing interest knows what defines work at Amazon’s sharp end, no matter what the going rate: frantic working under constant scrutiny, a culture in which basic human demands too often come second to increased efficiency, and questions about wellbeing and safety that will not go away.Here, when the GMB union recently put in a freedom of information request about Amazon’s vast fulfilment centre in the former coal town of Rugeley, Staffordshire, it found that ambulances had been called there 115 times in three years, with three incidents “relating to pregnancy or maternity problems and three for major trauma”. When I spoke this week to a union organiser who focuses on Rugeley, they went through a range of other issues: mandatory productivity rates seemingly based on the “fastest, fittest workers” breathing problems that reportedly come from dust around mountains of cardboard and workers peeing in plastic bottles for fear of toilet breaks dropping their output.Union representatives can represent inidual workers in disciplinary proceedings and apparently go into the warehouse three or four times a week, but collective negotiating is a nonstarter. “We’ve shifted some things for iniduals,” said the organiser. “But overall, Amazon is not changing the way it does things.”Or maybe it is, but in the worst possible way. Many Amazon warehouse workers carry handheld computers that monitor and control their movement and the rate at which they complete their tasks. But soon enough that kind of technology may be superseded by “augmented reality”. Workers in a host of occupations will soon be wearing headsets and goggles that combine their view of immediate surroundings with instructions that may repeatedly flash in front of their eyes. Amazon patented its version of this technology – which it calls “augmented reality user interface facilitating fulfilment” – in 2017. To quote one report, the device can “detect where a person is at all times and when they have stopped moving”. Most importantly, it also means that the demands of efficiency can be beamed direct into people’s heads. Who would want to work like that?Given Bezos’s incredible wealth and his company’s pretty much unchallenged dominance of online retailing, why does Amazon seemingly treat so many of its workers so badly? At the risk of sounding hopelessly naive, instead of him looking like a caricatured capitalist from an old Soviet propaganda poster (albeit one who wears futuristic casual wear), why not behave better?One answer is blunt: that the idea of meaningfully philanthropic capitalism, along with a role at the heart of business for trade unions, began to wither around the time the postwar welfarist dream breathed its last, in the early 1980s. Three decades on, one of the most depressing aspects of Amazon’s rise is the way public authorities who jostle to bring offices and warehouses to their areas blithely hand out tax breaks but never seem to insist on the most basic labour standards. And neither, of course, do the rest of us – it’s one of the benefits of a model of consumerism in which people remotely click away and never see the systems that service their wants.Up close, the development of the tech Amazon has used over the last two decades confirms something glaringly obvious. Last year, I was invited inside the company’s cutting-edge fulfilment centre near Manchester airport, where robot “drives” scuttle around bringing items to pickers, and the speed at which orders are processed is flatly surreal. Most human workers were really only placeholders.Across so-called logistics, no end of research and development work is now focused on machines aimed at replacing human hands. In that sense, a cold and clinical corporate mind might come to a simple conclusion: why worry about the predicament of mere workers when they soon won’t be needed? Contrary to the optimistic stuff we hear about automation, it looks like the path to some imagined workless economy– (which, obviously, may well be a nightmare) involves the realities of many people’s employment conditions getting steadily worse. It’s a two-step process: you eventually lose your job to a robot, but the first thing you surrender is your self-respect.The valiant union activists who are starting to challenge what all this means deserve nothing but praise: soon enough, their example will be followed in many other places. The rest of us would do well to realise that behind all that Christmas clicking lies a burgeoning dystopia. As the song goes, can you feel it?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3dad367bd7a594b5f7102b7f17e645fcd157d56/0_0_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=921aebf2f2dfb0f9d530e1fa64fe79e8","title":"londons new official plan for cycling is bold but has a major flaw","story":"With no new infrastructure or funding, questions remain on how to genuinely democratise cycling in a big cityLondon has a new official plan for cycling. It’s full of bold statements of intent and has some interesting ideas. That’s the good news. Here’s the drawback: within the 59 glossy pages I could detect no new plans for cycling infrastructure.This all might seem a bit niche, not to say London-centric. But there is a wider lesson here: if cities are to truly move ahead in making cycling everyday and for everyone, good intentions aren’t enough. It involves political boldness, and taking risks.The arguments as to why London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, has or has not been a disappointment on this front have been well documented on this blog, so I won’t go over them again.Instead, let’s look at the new template for cycling, jointly produced by Khan’s office and Transport for London (TfL), to ine more general points about how you can genuinely democratise cycling in a big city, and what isn’t going to do this.It is, of course, just my view. By all means disagree (or agree) below:The optics and stated intentions of the report, the Cycling Action Plan, with the ambitious subtitle of “Making London the world’s best big city for cycling”, are fine. In fact, they’re not far different to what I’d argue myself.Such is the need for a more active, safer, cleaner city, it argues, that building for mass cycling is a must. “Without a big increase in cycling, we won’t be able to address London’s congestion and air quality issues,” it says at one point – an obvious point, perhaps, but worth reiterating amid the evidence-free agitations of cab lobbyists and some other malcontents.The report is also clear on how to achieve more cycling. In his introduction to the report Khan’s cycling and walking supremo, Will Norman, notes that Dutch and Danish cities are filled with bikes not due to some cultural quirk, but “because their streets have been designed to prioritise people, not cars”.Even the photos spread the inclusive message, showing lots of people riding in everyday clothes, as well as children, and someone riding a handcycle.When the public discourse about cycling is so dominated by irrelevancies such as red-light jumping and helmets, this very clear public stance is reassuring.In what might be termed a lesson learned, the report says that the current branding distinction between so-called cycle superhighways – direct routes on main roads, sometimes with separated lanes – and the more back-route, on-road quietways and “mini-Holland” areas is to end.Londoners have told TfL that the current system can be “misleading and confusing”. I’d agree, but I’d argue more that they’re irrelevant.To work, cycle routes have to be – both literally and figuratively – joined up. They have to be as useful for a parent meandering to a school or nursery, going to a job and then returning via a shop as they are for a rapid, end-to-end commuter.The problem with London’s cycling efforts, emphasised by the focus on the relatively few separated-lane superhighways, is that cycling is too often convenient for commuters heading to and from central London, but not for many others.Strange as it might sound, digging up main roads to install separated bike routes is the easy bit of cycle provision. The only way to properly democratise the streets is to also comprehensively tackle back roads, especially where people live – enforcing very low speed limits, cutting off rat runs, basically making it less convenient to drive short distances. This is hugely politically difficult, and London has yet to get to grips with it.As with lots of other issues, not least crime, Khan is the public face of problems for which he is by no means entirely responsible.An obvious example here is Westminster council, always a top contender for the UK’s least human-friendly local authority, which has in recent months telephoned in policies from the 1970s such as blocking construction of a well-supported new bike lane on a dangerous intersection, and halting moves to pedestrianise Oxford Street.Other councils are almost as venal – take a bow, Kensington and Chelsea – and even in areas where there is more official support, a lack of ambition and a terror of the drivers’ vote has, in particular, resulted in the failure of the quietways programme.The new report directly tackles the tendency of some councils to water down bike schemes, saying that from now on there will be no central funding for routes “that do not address the fundamental reasons why people don’t currently cycle”.In tandem with this there are six “quality criteria” for routes, such as low traffic volumes where cycles have to mix with vehicles, low speeds, and limited numbers of lorries.This is all good, but the report argues that not all have to be met, and as I understand things, it would still be possible under this system for a bike route to be deemed good if only one of the two main factors (low traffic volume and low speed) was achieved. This seems curious. A bike route is useless if it is clogged by traffic, however low-speed, and can never feel safe if the vehicles speed past, however infrequent they are.After reading the report, I asked the very helpful TfL press person a simple question: does it announce any new routes, or any new funding? This prompted a slightly confusing chain of messages in which I was told several times about all the work due to start.I pressed: but is there anything new? Eventually the reply came: none of the routes outlined are new. As it turns out, there is some more funding – an extra £1m for the so-called Healthy Streets (pdf) scheme, amounting to £200,000 extra per year for the five-year programme.All this takes us back to the fundamental worry many people have about London’s plans for more cycling and walking: it’s all going too slowly, and at a terrible cost, not least in air quality, congestion and sedentary living, as well as the social price of cycling being out of bounds to all but – in the main – the young and gung-ho. London also faces the risk of not only being overtaken by more ambitious overseas cities, but others in the UK such as Manchester.This is the central lesson I take from the document, which has repercussions for towns and cities everywhere: it takes boldness and political will to reshape places for the future, and the cost of failure is high."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/969d6318d92b4587ccd6f6154885db38913a7e2a/956_635_4122_2472/master/4122.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9abdee00e6373deebb3691eec16cfd29","title":"best films 2018 uk us private life","story":"Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti were excellent as a sympathetic New York couple struggling to have a baby in Tamara Jenkins’s intensely personal dramaAfter her intriguing, if flawed, sibling drama The Savages in 2007, Tamara Jenkins has returned with another intensely personal film. It is a triumph. She shows an uncanny knack of absorbing and transforming her own experiences into a compelling movie. Private Life is superbly acted and written, giving the audience vivid access to a painful yet funny human drama.Kathryn Hahn, a seasoned comedy-character turn, is an absolute revelation in the demanding role of Rachel, a New York literary author who has critical prestige but not much in the way of sales. Her partner is Richard, a former off-Broadway theatre director who has retired from this business, without much regret, and now makes a living selling his pickles at artisanal markets. This is a role made for Paul Giamatti, and it is a pleasure to see him in a challenging part to be compared with those in the movies that made his name: American Splendor and Sideways.Rachel and Richard are trying to have a baby, either by fertility treatment or by adoption. We can see how they have reached the autumn of their lives, taken stock of their careers, and now want their relationship to mean something – with a baby. But they have left it very late. The adoption process means making online contact with a likely young pregnant woman and arranging to take her baby, and it is a minefield – the mother can change her mind or she can reveal that for various reasons she was never serious about adoption. As for IVF, that is a brutally punishing, intimately upsetting, financially ruinous business to have to go through over and over again. But just when Rachel’s eggs look as if they are not viable, it seems they have found an egg donor. Richard’s stepniece Sadie – his brother’s stepdaughter by marriage and a longtime family friend – offers to donate one of hers, in return for lodging with her cool uncle and aunt in their New York apartment while she tries to establish herself as a writer. It’s a great role for relative newcomer Kayli Carter.Giamatti and Hahn are excellent at portraying an intelligent, sympathetic couple who are going through denial. They are submitting to a kind of agony. It is horrible, but they have to endure it, and behave as if everything is normal. And so they are pathetically grateful to this impulsive, sweet-natured, generous if scatterbrained young woman who is prepared to make a remarkable gesture of love and friendship to them. But of course it is fraught with difficulty. She should not have sex while she is having the hormone treatment, and for Richard and Rachel to police this rule is horribly embarrassing. Could it be that they have, in fact, already acquired a child – Sadie?A hostile approach to this film would be to dismiss it with the boorish phrase “first world problems”, and a different type of film would satirise all three principal players in an attempt to forestall that objection. But Jenkins’s script is funny, smart and sweet without ironising anyone. Sadie in particular isn’t the brat that you might expect her to be. Richard and Rachel are creatures of their time and of their background of course, but their humanity is so persuasive. It’s a richly satisfying film."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d3fec2a972e8802b28b56d4219474f9da6d050a/328_210_4610_2766/master/4610.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f418394c9c30e4e0412d467685e748cc","title":"food trends 2019 vegan jerky no thanks frazzles rachel cooke","story":"Kelp noodles, tahini ice-cream … who dreams up these lists of food trends and what we’ll be eating in 2019?This time of year brings with it plenty of quite stupid traditions, and few of them more daft than the food industry’s annual announcement of what it believes we will all be eating next year. When I first noticed this particular brand of crystal-ball-gazing several years ago, I remember thinking: well, I guess it’s better than “What your star sign has in store for you”. But I’ve come to my senses now. Who comes up with this stuff? Is it possible they’ve never once stepped inside a supermarket, cooked dinner, or even ordered a takeaway? I sometimes get the feeling that these lists are generated by someone – or something – who does not eat at all.According to what I’ve read so far, 2019 will be the year of Pacific-rim flavours such as dragon fruit and dried shrimp shelf-stable probiotics (which seems to be an incredibly unsexy way of describing kimchi) and various new kinds of “frozen treats” (think tahini-flavoured ice-cream). Seaweed and hemp will be big, and so, too, will fake meat in the form of vegan jerky and faux bacon snacks – and, no, before you get excited, this doesn’t mean we’ll all be passing off Frazzles as the latest thing in canapes (alas).Finally, there is fat. In the age of the low-carb diet, apparently the search is on for “new sources” of fat: dieters need the energy it provides. I think this means that these people, with their strange breath and their joyless attitude to potatoes, are going to be eating a lot more coconut butter in the near future. But, to be honest, by the time I got to this point my own energy levels were so low, there seemed to be nothing for it but to go downstairs and eat the Twix I stashed in the fridge earlier.What will you be eating in 2019? Pretty much the same as you ate in 2018, I expect. What will I be eating in 2019? Ditto. Most of us don’t go in for the kind of preposterousness that comprises these lists, not only because life is too short to track down a dragon fruit, but because, with good reason, we’re suspicious of such stick-on modishness. What has it to do with us, and our lives? As it happens, I ate a small scoop of sallow-looking tahini ice-cream in a horribly fashionable restaurant only the other night, and while it wasn’t actively unpleasant, it seemed kind of pointless: as if the chef had forgotten to add the chocolate or the vanilla. It was certainly frozen, or just about, but a treat it most definitely was not.You will say that these predictions are just so much silly marketing talk, and that people who work in commercial food development have to be seen to be doing something beyond improving the “recipe” of this or that ready meal – and in a way, you’d be right. Why am I getting so het up? All the same, I see this kind of thing as all of piece with our increasingly weird, confused and disconnected relationship with food. If, at one end of the scale, you’ve got the kind of disordered eating that involves scoffing a family-sized bag of Doritos in one go, at the other, you’ve got this stuff: nonsensical drivel about “wellness-focused” condiments, “fat bombs” and kelp noodles.If I could gaze into a crystal ball and see 2019 in food, what would I like to find there? (Apart, perhaps, from a giant bag of Frazzles.) Well, this isn’t a prediction, but it remains a desperate hope, and it is that some time quite soon we will return to what the experts refer to as intuitive eating – by which they mean that we will put aside our crazy diets and loopy fads once and for all, and instead eat a little of everything, as and when it is easily available, whenever we like, though preferably at mealtimes. We will do this without feeling guilty or conflicted about it, and always, if possible, in the company of family and friends. The words “wellness-focused” will mean, as they do now, nothing at all to us, but we will nevertheless feel much better: happier, more in balance, perfectly at ease in our own kitchen cupboards."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4d954756d9bcffc5d65f71effd80694a2ccd529/0_2043_4832_2899/master/4832.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8679b0989150fa0ed418602a6631d6fc","title":"nigel slater recipes christmas in between days","story":"There’s more to the festivities than feasting. Simple meals, like smoked haddock with lentils, parsnip poutine and ice-cream with nougat, can be just as specialThe tree is up. The holly is hanging from its hook on the front door. The house smells deliciously of the season. There has been much anticipation – and more than a little planning – for the major feasts of Christmas Eve and the following day, but Christmas cooking is always about more than the main feasts. The whole season is punctuated with smaller, simpler, but equally significant dinners for friends and family which still demand to be just that little bit special.If I’m honest I look forward to cooking these “other dinners”. They allow you do something slightly out of the ordinary – no one wants the full turkey dinner the week before Christmas – but have, at their heart, all the flavours and ingredients that we associate with this time of year. In many ways, these little meals are the best of both worlds. Straightforward to cook – they are family suppers – but drenched in everything we love about yuletide.The recipes that follow – a platter of meatballs with pistachios and lipstick-red pomegranates a tangle of roasted parsnips with a porcini gravy and soft, fresh cheese brussels sprouts with Japanese pickles a smoky fish and rice dish – feel special to me. They are not something I would cook every day, but all have enough seasonal spirit about them to fit the occasion. Any one of them would do nicely in the run-up to Christmas Day and right through to New Year.As with so much of what I cook, a dish can be served as a side dish or given the principal role. I find such flexible recipes invaluable. Informal, simple food that fits neatly in wherever you need it to.I don’t eat pudding on a daily basis, but at this time of year it seems appropriate to bring something out for everyone to coo over. I have been known to send out a jug of warm chocolate sauce to the table, spiced with ground cardamom or cinnamon, for pouring over vanilla ice-cream or slices of soft-crumbed almond sponge cake. You can use it as a sweet fondue too, with a plate of sliced pear or clementines for dipping. This is also the only time of year when you can bring out the sticky dates, balsawood caskets of Turkish delight and boxes of crystalised fruit in lieu of a pudding without it looking like you don’t care.After Christmas Day, of course, there are leftovers to plunder. I probably enjoy these more than I do on their first outing. Potatoes mashed into bubble and squeak with chopped brussels a frittata of kale and bacon and, if there could ever be such a thing, leftover pigs in blankets. The latter make a fine pasta sauce once chopped up, fried lightly and tossed with a little mustard and cream. The roast bird is a treasure chest all of its own. Every piece of burnished skin, juicy little nugget of flesh and the bones themselves offer endless possibilities for informal eating. My favourite of all being the “big soup” I make with the leftover roast, its bones, meat and that gorgeous jelly that hides under the carcass, simmered with the usual aromatics then finished with tiny pasta such orzo, shredded greens and some fat slices of slightly tired bread I have toasted and rubbed with garlic.I find the informality of such meals a welcome breath of fresh air. No one minds having a collection of sweet leftovers scattered around the table. Boxes of Carlsbad plums and marrons glacés that have already been started, boxes of chocolates with as many empty paper cases as full ones, or a collection of edible Christmas-tree decorations will all find takers. I do tend to use the last bits of cheeses in the kitchen, though. I’m not sure anyone really wants to be presented with the hollowed-out crust of a ripe but drying stilton.Fried in a little oil and butter, the miso paste forms a fine crust on the outside of the sprouts. Serve them as an accompaniment if you wish, but I like them as the star of the show, tucked into a bowl of sticky rice and scattered with salty Japanese pickles. I serve this as it is, but also as a side dish for slices of cold roast pork and its crackling. This is sticky rice, my favourite, but you don’t want it in lumps, so running the tines of a fork through the cooked grain is a good idea.Put the rice in a bowl, cover with warm water, then run your fingers through the rice. Drain, repeat, then tip into a saucepan, cover with cold water and set aside for half an hour.Trim the sprouts, then cut each in half. Bring the soaked rice to the boil, add half a teaspoon of salt, cover and lower the heat so the water simmers. Leave for 40 minutes or until the rice is approaching tenderness. Remove the pan from the heat and leave to rest for 10 minutes before removing the lid.Warm the oil in a shallow pan. Wash and dry the sprouts. Toss them with the miso paste then transfer to the hot oil, moving them round the pan as they become crisp and pale golden brown.Remove the lid from the rice, run a fork thought the grains to separate them, then ide between two bowls. Spoon the miso sprouts into the rice, then add some of the Japanese pickles.A calming recipe for when the Christmas preparations get the better of us. A dish of smoky flavours and soft textures, made by continually stirring the rice, risotto style, an activity that soothes as successfully as the dish sustains. We serve this at the table, in the pan in which it was cooked, together with a salad of chicory, watercress and some of the Christmas walnuts.Serves 4smoked haddock 450gmilk 500mlwater 500mlblack peppercorns 8bay leaves 3green lentils 125gbutter 40garborio rice 250gdill a handfulbutter to finish 20gPlace the haddock, skin side down, in a large shallow pan, pour over the milk and water, then add the peppercorns and bay leaves. Bring to the boil, then lower the heat and simmer for 10 minutes or until the fish can easily be separated from its skin. Reserve the cooking liquid.Peel the skin from the haddock, break the flesh into large flakes, then cover and set aside. In another, deeper pan, simmer the lentils in deep water for 15-20 minutes till buttery and tender. Drain and set aside.Wipe the pan the lentils were cooked in and place over a moderate heat. Melt the butter in the pan then add the rice. Ladle 800ml of the cooking liquid from the fish into the rice, ladle by ladle, stirring almost continually, as if you were making a risotto. Season with salt and a little pepper. Chop the dill.As soon as the rice is tender and to your liking (probably about 15-20 minutes) stir in the cooked lentils, the chopped dill, the butter and then, lastly, the flaked haddock.Sweet, crisp and chewy roast parsnips with a thick and glossy mushroom gravy and soft, light cheese. I put this on the table with a bowl of lightly dressed lettuce leaves so everyone can mop the gravy from their plates with the soft leaves.Set the oven at 200Cgas mark 6. Peel the parsnips, then cut them in half lengthways, then in half again. Put them into a roasting tin with 100ml of the olive oil, rosemary sprigs, and a little salt and black pepper. Let the parsnips roast for 1 hour, turning them halfway through.Bring the water to the boil in a deep saucepan. Add the porcini, cover with a lid and continue cooking on a very low heat for 20 minutes.Peel the shallots and cut them into thick slices, then cook them in the remaining oil for 10 minutes over a moderate heat till soft. As they start to turn pale gold, add the flour and continue to cook, stirring regularly, for 3 minutes.Pour the porcini and their broth into the onions, a little at a time, stirring almost continuously. Remove the leaves from the thyme and stir in. Turn up the heat and let the sauce bubble until you have a rich, quite thick gravy.Remove the parsnips when they are golden and lightly crisp, spoon over the shallot and porcini gravy, then serve with the goat’s curd.If you find a good sausage, one that has been generously filled and thoughtfully seasoned, it is a doddle to peel off its skin and use the meat as a base for a stuffing, a filling for a sausage roll or for meatballs. I use my butcher’s breakfast sausages as something to toss with ribbons of pasta for a midweek dinner. It saves the hassle of making your own very fine mince and breadcrumb mixture.The recipe for merguez sausages hails from North Africa, and involves minced lamb or beef often seasoned with paprika, cumin and ground coriander seeds with a casing usually made from lamb intestines. Peeled from their skins – it takes but a minute or two – the stuffing is something to which you can add other ingredients such as finely chopped dried fruits or nuts. Dates or figs would make the recipe feel particularly at home.This Christmas I have been using mint and chopped pistachios in my meatballs to add a note of freshness to the earthy spicing. Once cooked (slowly, in a little olive oil) until they are glossy and sticky, I finish them with crunchy, ruby red pomegranate seeds. The sharpness of the fruit is a wake-up call for the sleepy spices.Serves 4banana shallots 2olive oil 3 tbspmerguez sausages 500gparsley 10gmint 20 leavespistachios 30golive or groundnut oil for frying 3 tbspTo finishpistachios 20gparsley a handful of leavespomegranate seeds from ½Peel and finely chop the shallots. Warm the olive oil in a shallow pan over a moderate heat, add the shallots then leave them to cook for 10-15 minutes until soft and turning golden. The occasional stir will ensure even cooking. While the shallots soften, remove the skins from the sausages, putting the meat into a mixing bowl. Keep the shallots cooking for a few minutes longer till they turn pale bronze then transfer them to a mixing bowl.Chop the parsley, mint leaves and pistachios and stir into the sausage meat, then add the shallots and combine. Form the mixture into 12 balls, setting them on a small tray as you go. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.Warm a shallow layer of oil in a sauté pan then add the balls and fry till nicely browned, turning them occasionally so they colour evenly. While they cook, roughly chop the pistachios and the parsley leaves. When the meatballs are dark and glossy, remove from the pan, place on a serving dish then finish with a scattering of the chopped nuts, herbs and pomegranate seeds.Bring a pan of water to the boil, then balance a heatproof bowl above the water. Lower the heat to a simmer, then break the chocolate into small pieces, drop into the bowl and leave to melt. Do not stir.Crack the cardamom pods open, extract the black seeds within and crush them to a very fine powder in a spice mill or pestle and mortar. Pour the cream into a small saucepan, add the ground cardamom and bring to the boil. Immediately remove from the heat, cover and set aside for the spice to infuse the cream.Pour the cream into the chocolate and stir gently. Scoop the ice-cream into bowls then pour over the warm chocolate and cardamom sauce. Slice the nougat and scatter over the ice cream.

The razzle-dazzle surrounding exotic, distant or just plain surprising sources of whisky – whether that’s Japan, Australia or Sweden – can make it seem staid.If scotch regularly loses out to bourbons and Japanese malts in such annual gongs as Jim Murray’s Whisky Bible whisky of the year (this year’s winner was a remarkable rare bourbon, William Larue Weller 128.2 Proof, from the 2017 Buffalo Trace Antique Collection), things are, in fact, pretty healthy in the spirit’s spiritual home.One sign of the scotch renaissance is the number of independent distillers that have set up in the past couple of years. These are small or, in many cases, tiny but distinctive producers of a similar crafty outlook to those that have revolutionised beer and gin in the past decade. That many of them are still too young to have produced any whisky ready for sale (in fact, most are selling quicker-to-produce gin or beer to provide the cash flow while they wait for their first whiskies to mature) in no way takes the edge off the optimism caused by newbies such as the Holyrood Park in Edinburgh and Abhainn Dearg on the Isle of Lewis.Not that the drinks giants that still dominate scotch whisky have been quiet. Diageo delighted whisky geeks late last year by announcing it would be bringing two of scotch’s best-loved “ghost” distilleries back from the dead – the only question being whether the prices commanded by rare old stocks of Port Ellen on Islay and Brora on the east coast of Sutherland, both of which were mothballed in the 1980s, will hold once the pair are up and running again in 2020.It’s not all about the future: much of the excitement around scotch has to do with the work of its independent bottlers, whose stock in trade is very much about working their contacts to source rare or forgotten casks from the dusty distillery corners and bottling them anew. Whether it’s the invigorating, glossily packaged range of relative newcomers such as Rest \u0026amp Be Thankful (look out for its bottlings of Islay’s Bruichladdich), North Star Spirits or the exceptional monthly variety conferred by membership of the Scotch Whisky Society, independent bottlers are just one of the reasons why scotch remains the whisky world leader, no matter what the hype machine may say.Co-op Irresistible Single Highland Malt Scotch Whisky(£23.49, The Co-op)It’s hard to find decent single malt for less than £30, but the Co-op’s Highland Malt has been the most reliable of the supermarket own-labels for a while now, offering a spicy and warming dram with a sheen of dark-sherry complexity. Good value.Aldi Highland Black 8 Year Old Blended Scotch Whisky(£12.99, Aldi)Speyside malt and Lowland grain combine in Aldi’s excellent value blend, which has sufficient age (spending a minimum of 8 years in cask) to give it real depth of fruit, wisps of smoke and a smoothness not always apparent at this sort of price.

Except that player was Virgil van Dijk, who plays for Liverpool.Lukaku stopped, looked baffled, almost seemed ready to scratch his head. They say the best players carry a picture around with them, a flashing radar screen of every other moving part on the pitch. On a cold, wet, merciless day at Anfield Lukaku seemed to be carrying a picture of something else altogether, a game of noughts and crosses perhaps or a hastily sketched pencil drawing of a hamster.In the first half he completed one pass. He made one fine run down the flank to help set up United’s equaliser. Otherwise Lukaku was a No 9-shaped absence. Often the ball just seemed like an irritation, a side issue as he got on with the wider task of repeatedly bouncing off Van Dijk like a fly banging its head against a window pane.And yet, while he was bad here, and has been bad for weeks, Lukaku is not the problem with this team. Like so many elements associated with Manchester United he has simply been deflated, all sense of joy and zest sucked from his game by the anti-chemistry of this grey regime, a player who has gained nothing, learned nothing, gone nowhere.“Don’t sack Mourinho, don’t sack Mourinho” – by the end this was almost too much for the Anfield crowd, left drowning in honey by a late-breaking 3-1 win that returned Liverpool to the top of the table, left United’s season looking beached and provided another near death-blow for a manager who had haunted this stadium ever since the last time Liverpool fancied themselves title contenders four years go, Demba Ba and all that.They will not sack Mourinho, not yet. That new contract will need paying up. Plus there is nowhere to go at this stage of the season, no obvious remedy, not least when the entire club seems shot through with a sickness of the spirit that goes well beyond the head coach.Liverpool are of course the main story here. Jürgen Klopp’s team were overwhelmingly superior. They had 36 shots at goal. They might have won by five goals. Klopp made a perfectly judged substitution, bringing on Xherdan Shaqiri to take the game away. But still, somehow, Liverpool’s excellence was overshadowed by the sheer barren awfulness of their opponents.This was beyond dire – dire squared, dire football played in dire fashion by a dire selection. Imagine a bad plan, enacted badly, by someone not very good at enacting bad plans. Imagine a negative approach, applied with extreme negativity by a group of players feeling negative about the actual merits of all this negativity. Why would anyone want to keep doing this? Is Mourinho enjoying it? Even United’s starting XI was a deathly thing with seven of the 10 starting outfield players either defenders or defensive midfielders.And from the start Liverpool tore into those deep blue-grey shirts. Eric Bailly’s first significant act was to come charging forward out of defence and perform a kind of rugby spear-tackle on Firmino. For a while United looked like a massively hung-over pub team startled to find itself facing a group of peak-condition professionals. What’s the point of picking a tough, battling, muscular team if they get out-battled, out-muscled and out-toughed?The goal was coming. You could hear it approaching, bells jingling, footsteps crunching across the corrugated roof. It arrived after Bailly had done something extraordinary, barrelling out of defence again like lane three at the world 60 metres championships. This time he reached the Liverpool half before hurling himself on to his back. Liverpool foraged down the left and moments later Fabinho played a dreamy pass over the top for Sadio Mané to finish neatly. A José Mourinho team that can’t defend: what, exactly, is the point of this?Meanwhile Lukaku continued to fret. Each time the ball approached he looked startled, waving a leg, running the other way, like a cat startled by a remote controlled toy on Christmas Day. But he was there to spin and sprint down the left flank and set up a close-range finish for Jesse Lingard on 33 minutes.For long periods the second half was a neck-cricking affair, all 20 outfield players dragged towards the United goal like snooker balls on a wonky table. United’s best attacking player, Anthony Martial, came on with 12 minutes to go. It seemed fitting the goal that re-established Liverpool’s lead should come with the help of four deflections and Shaqiri’s decisive third via another.Liverpool march on and will now face a vital couple of weeks in their pursuit of the league title. United will continue to drift strangely, a vast, malfunctioning machine, clogged at every level and producing here a performance of such painful, fearful negativity it almost felt like a piece of doomed and terrifying art."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26312657567410845e705ed343a8b0a947364487/159_193_3057_1835/master/3057.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=89138c5f6271d4bc225c79be30143d8b","title":"jose mourinho safe manchester united manager business as usual liverpool","story":"José Mourinho is safe as Manchester United manager for the immediate future, with it being business as usual for the 55-year-old despite Sunday’s insipid 3-1 loss at Liverpool.Mourinho is coming under increasing pressure because of United’s poor season so far, a run that has left them in sixth place, yet the  understands that Mourinho is to remain in place.The defeat by Jürgen Klopp’s team left United 19 points behind Liverpool, the leaders, and 11 from Chelsea in the final Champions League berth. After 17 games, Mourinho’s side have a goal difference of zero and have lost five matches, winning seven times, in United’s poorest start to the season since 1990.As United have been knocked out of the Carabao Cup Mourinho has a clear week to prepare for Saturday’s trip to Cardiff City. The rest of their fixtures during the festive period are the visits of Huddersfield Town and Bournemouth before the trip to Newcastle United on 2 January.Mourinho made the stark admission after the game at Anfield that his team had been unable to cope with Liverpool’s physicality and intensity. “Robertson, Mané, Salah, Wijnaldum, Keïta, Fabinho: they are physical players and on top of that they are good players technically,” he said. “I have lot of good players technically but we don’t have lots of players with that intensity, that physicality, so when the game has high levels of intensity it is difficult for us.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a2417db4c4b1a120689ba42bf77f4d6888ce9d9c/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b2c1ca3ee22221866dac6ee32de7645","title":"premier league 10 talking points football","story":"Southampton have had an instant new-manager bounce while Huddersfield and Fulham look as if they must spendMaurizio Sarri fell short of accusing his players of complacency, but admitted something strange keeps happening when his Chelsea team appear to be in complete control of matches. At Wolves recently their early lead was overhauled and they were beaten. They had more leeway at Brighton with a two-goal cushion established but still ended a contest, in which they had been utterly dominant, heaving to repel Albion’s late flurry of attacks. Every long ball suddenly seemed a threat, every set piece a route to parity. It ensured what had been an impressive display felt rather undermined at the death. “We are a danger to ourselves,” admitted the Italian. It is affecting some more than others in their ranks, with Marcos Alonso’s early-season composure having evaporated of late. He rather personifies this team’s current fragility in periods within games. They escaped real damage at Brighton. “But suddenly the level of application and attention lowered,” added Sarri. That, in truth, does sound like complacency at work. Dominic FifieldIn a senior career ning just over a decade Martin Kelly has made fewer than 200 appearances in all competitions for Liverpool, Huddersfield and Crystal Palace combined. Injuries have taken their toll on the 28-year-old, not least a ruptured cruciate ligament and thigh problems that sidelined him for the best part of a year. Those aside, he has developed a perhaps unwanted reputation as a diligent, low-maintenance understudy. At Palace he sits on the substitutes’ bench far more often than not now Aaron Wan-Bissaka has made the right-back berth his own. Kelly’s limited appearances this season have been at centre-back and with James Tomkins suspended he started alongside Mamadou Sakho against Leicester. With Sakho calling the shots in the role of senior partner, Kelly was immense as his side kept a rare clean sheet. His reward will almost certainly be a return to the dugout now that Tomkins has served his ban. Barry GlendenningClaudio Ranieri said it was too soon to talk about the January transfer window while also admitting his Fulham squad requires refreshing. “I am honest, I speak with my owner and he understands we must do something,” he said. Shahid Khan, having spent more than £100m in the summer, is on the hook for further spending if Fulham are to have a chance of staying up. Gary Cahill, an outcast at Chelsea, has been linked of late. Something needs to be done about a defence that collapsed for West Ham’s decisive first-half goals but Ranieri also needs far better from the players that he inherited from Slavisa Jokanovic. Jean Michaël Seri had the highest billing of Fulham’s hefty summer spree but was a lost soul in a midfield that Declan Rice and Mark Noble took hold of. The Ivorian’s 61st-minute substitution received a chorus of ironic cheers from home fans. John BrewinThe loss of Aaron Mooy to a knee injury that is expected to keep him out until February is a serious blow to Huddersfield. Yet they did not particularly miss the Australian during Saturday’s defeat by Newcastle because Juninho Bacuna, a summer recruit making his first Premier League start, did well alongside the excellent Philip Billing and Jonathan Hogg. That trio helped Huddersfield to dominate in possession terms. But the team lost because of familiar bluntness up front. None of the attacking players signed in the summer – Ramadan Sobhi, Isaac Mbenza and Adama Diakhaby – have made an impact and the existing centre-forwards, Laurent Depoitre and Steve Mounié, have not got goals to complement their otherwise useful work – unlike Newcastle’s Salomón Rondón. Sharper January signings would help Huddersfield climb out of trouble. Paul DoyleAs recently as last month there were rumblings that after a slow start to life at Anfield, Fabinho might be in line for a January departure. If it was nonsense then – and Jürgen Klopp always stressed he had a long-term plan for the player – it is cloud cuckoo land now. He was the best player on the pitch against Manchester United, delivering the wonderful chipped pass from which Sadio Mané opened the scoring and using the ball superbly throughout. Fabinho exuded control without diminishing Liverpool’s urgency this was only his sixth Premier League start but he is surely in the side to stay and Jordan Henderson, for one, faces a battle to get back in now. Klopp has a formidable selection of central options these days and Fabinho, looking fresh and fully accustomed to the pace of the English game, has risen sharply towards the top of the pack. Manchester United may have had an £89m midfielder on the bench but what a difference the Brazilian’s quality might have made to them. Nick AmesManchester City’s first goal against Everton came after a sloppy clearance from Yerry Mina, although it is worth wondering why the centre-back had possession in the first place. Mina was dealt a short pass by Jordan Pickford within yards of the byline and, with Riyad Mahrez bearing down at speed, panicked it would be a stretch to imagine even one of Pep Guardiola’s vintage Barcelona teams contriving a slick back‑to‑front goal from that position and what followed was a reminder that sometimes idealism should be put to one side. Marco Silva said Mina should have returned the ball to Pickford or cleared it on the other side but the issue would have been avoided if the goalkeeper had made the correct calculation of risk versus reward. “We have our way of playing,” Silva said, emphasising that the responsibility for such a mistake was his own but a little compromise here would have given Everton a chance to build on a strong start to the game. Permitting the occasional launch upfield does not have to turn you into the next Charles Hughes. NAWhile it is too soon to apply too much analysis to Ralph Hasenhüttl’s early work, he unquestionably has Southampton playing with a zip and verve seldom seen during the ponderous and predictable days of Mark Hughes and Mauricio Pellegrino. However, to rescue Saints’ season completely, drastic surgery is also required at the defensive end. Jan Bednarek is one of the subtle tweaks Hasenhüttl has made to the starting XI, the Pole having largely been ignored by Hughes, and he was excellent against Arsenal. Playing on the right of a back three, the 22-year-old dramatically reduced the threat of Alexandre Lacazette’s second-half introduction irrelevant while one outstanding interception denied Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang a regulation first-half tap-in. There are serious questions over the quality and suitability of the squad at his disposal but, in Bednarek, Hasenhüttl may have discovered an inidual around whom he can build his new-look defence. James PiercyWatford’s key performers against Cardiff were Gerard Deulofeu and Abdoulaye Doucouré. Aged 24 and 25 respectively, they are players whom the Hornets could count on for years to come (provided they can hold on to them, of course). But Vicarage Road is bedding in an even younger generation. Adalberto Peñaranda, Ben Wilmot and Domingos Quina are under-21 talents knocking on the door of the first team. In the case of Quina, the 19-year-old Portuguese midfielder has had two strong performances in a week, and became the club’s youngest goalscorer with a pearler on Saturday. “I didn’t know many things about Domingos before he came,” Javi Gracia said. “Now I can see him every day training his level, his desire, his ambition. It is good for me to work with these young players, like Ben Wilmot too. I think they are good players and you have to put these players in.” Paul MacInnesWith five goals and five assists since his summer arrival Raúl Jiménez’s signing is starting to look like the smartest business Wolves have done since promotion. The Mexican can create and score, as Nuno Espírito Santo looks to inject swagger. The only concern is that it will cost Wolves a further £34m to make the deal from Benfica permanent – but considering he is 27 and is helping his side to relative comfort in one of Europe’s most competitive leagues, one has to assume the wheels are in motion to ensure he puts down roots. Otherwise they may need to search through the Jorge Mendes Rolodex, which will not aid the long-term stability of the Wolves forward line as they look to secure their place in the top flight.

He seems excited.It’s been a fantastic week for Liverpool. Two really big games and we came out top in both games. They’re consistent now, they’ve got a settled side now. They’ve got a squad now capable of doing really, really well. There’s some great names in the Champions League. At this stage it doesn’t matter who you get, it’s going to be a difficult game. Our first game’s at home, we’ve got to try to take advantage. The atmosphere’s going to be incredible at Anfield, I just hope that can help us as well.So there were four English teams and three Spanish teams, but no England v Spain round of 16 ties. There were also three German teams, and there will be three England v Germany ties. What are the odds*? * You don’t actually have to answer that.And that concludes today’s Champions League draw. Short and very sweet, I’m sure you’ll agree.Which leaves Liverpool left in a like-it-or-lump-it match-up with Bayern Munich!Ajax can now only play Real Madrid, so that’s what’s going to happen.Roma will play Porto! That’s an excellent draw for both teams.Next up it’s Lyon v Barcelona! Lyon have never beaten Barcelona, in six attempts.Now it’s Tottenham’s turn, and they will play Borussia Dortmund! They’ve played each other four times previously, with each side winning two of those games.Manchester United are picked next. Of the available group winners, they get Paris St-Germain! The clubs have never met in European competition, so this is history we’re watching right here!Atlético Madrid are the second runners-up to be drawn. They will play Juventus. Juve have won four of their seven previous meetings.Schalke are out of the hat first (they’re picking runners-up first, you see). And they will play Manchester City!One thing I didn’t mention: After the draw, Uefa will determine which matches are played on Tuesday, which on Wednesday, and which will be played in which week, based on whatever they think is important.Now a brief pause while the regulations are read out. You know the regulations, because I quoted the way down at the bottom of this page, so you’re missing nothing.Then García is asked what brought about Liverpool’s fantastic half-timely turnaround in 2005. “I cannot tell you the whole truth,” he says. These interviews are going excellently.Georges is asked who she thinks will win. “I wouldn’t pick anyone special,” she says. Bayern Munich’s Laura Georges and the former Liverpool ace Luis García are introduced as today’s special guests and ball-pluckers.After a lot of chat about which teams deserve particular commendation for their group-stage achievements, Marchatti pauses and says: “Ladies and gentlemen, we are getting closer to the draw.” This is not entirely encouraging.The draw will be led by Giorgio Marchetti, Uefa’s deputy general secretary and drawmaster in chief, who has just taken the stage.We start with a rousing and dramatically-soundtracked group stage highlights package.The view from the hall. It’s probably better on TV:Lots of empty seats in the hall still, but then I suppose there are only 16 teams involved. Anyway, action!The draw starts in 90 seconds!Schalke are the bookies’ outsiders for the competition, which given that they are the only team that will absolutely certainly get a nightmare draw is probably understandable. Manchester City are the favourites, with three-time defending champions Real Madrid seventh. Here’s the chaps from WhoScored predicting how every team will do:“Looking at the potential match ups every English team other than city can focus on the EPL after March,” says Krish.Here’s a team-by-team analysis from last week:Over on Uefa, they have managed to ask dozens of famous players at Champions League clubs about the draw, and elicited almost identical responses from all of them. Thus Mario Gotze says:Regardless of which opponent you get in the Champions League last 16, it will be tense and very, very tough. Whoever we’re drawn against, we’re going to have to play very well. You come up against good opposition in every game so we’ll see who we get.Here’s an English-team can-get-ometer, just so everybody knows where they stand:Today we will mainly be thinking about Article 18 of the 2018-19 Champions League regulations, in which paragraph one sets out the basic rules for this draw as follows:18.01 The round of 16 pairings are determined by means of a draw in accordance with the following principles:a. Clubs from the same association cannot be drawn against each other.b. Group winners must be drawn against runners-up from a different group.c. The runners-up play the first leg at home (on 1213 February and 1920 February), and then the second leg away (on 56 and 1213 March).And, just for interest: 18.02 The eight winners of the round of 16 contest the quarter-finals. The quarter-final pairings are determined by means of a draw.Date for the diary: this draw will be held on 15 MarchSo what this means is that Manchester City, who came top of Group F, can’t be drawn against Lyon, the runners-up in that group, or against Tottenham, Liverpool or Manchester United, who were runners-up in different groups but are from the same association, and so can only play one of Atlético Madrid, Schalke, Ajax or Roma. They have the fewest potential opponents with four, with Atlético next on that list with five. Only two teams have the full house of seven potential quarter-final pairs, with only the other qualified team from their own group ruled out, and they are Porto and Ajax.Even before the draw poor Schalke know they are going to get royally skewered: having come second in Group D they can’t play the winners of that group – Porto – while the other German sides, Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich, are also ruled out. Thus they know that one of Barcelona, PSG, Manchester City, Real Madrid or Juventus will be their opponents. SAD!The draw is due to start at 11am GMT12pm CET. It will feature literally hundreds of balls in 16 separate bowls, because when Uefa holds a draw they like to go all in. So strap yourselves in, and brace yourselves for an hour and a bit of ball-picking goodness."},{"url":null,"title":"tell us what was your favourite game of 2018","story":"As we publish the ’s top 20 video games of 2018, we want to hear what you’ve been playingThe year in video games has truly brought something for everyone, whether you’re into cute stories about anthropomorphic mice, psychedelic Tetris, or unnervingly detailed historical role-play in the Old West.

Measures will also be taken to ensure that seasonal workers get the paid time off they are entitled to.The reforms will be seen as a direct appeal to Labour voters and an attempt to get back to the values expressed by Theresa May in July 2016. In her first speech as prime minister, May said: “If you’re from an ordinary working class family, life is much harder than many people in Westminster realise. You have a job but you don’t always have job security.” She pledged to protect those who were “just about managing”.Labour has questioned whether the plans will do anything for people on zero-hours contracts. Unions said the reforms were a missed opportunity to rebalance power in the gig economy.The reforms, covered in a report called the Good Work Plan, are based on the recommendations made by former Tony Blair adviser Matthew Taylor in his review into employment, especially in the so-called gig economy. The government has pledged to implement 51 of Taylor’s suggested 53 reforms.Legislation will be introduced to give workers details of their rights from the first day in a job, such as eligibility for sick leave, pay levels, maternity and paternity leave.The maximum employment tribunal fines for employers demonstrated to have shown malice, spite or gross oversight will increase from £5,000 to £20,000.Ministers are also committing to legislate to improve employment status tests to “reflect the reality of the modern working relationships”. Despite calls from unions, the government said the reforms would not ban zero-hours contracts, in keeping with Taylor’s recommendations, because that would “negatively impact” more people than it helped.TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady welcomed some reforms such as the decision to scrap the so-called “agency worker loophole”.However, Grady said the government had missed an opportunity to bolster the rights of zero-hours workers. “These reforms as a whole won’t shift the balance of power in the gig economy. Unless unions get the right to organise and bargain for workers in places like Uber and Amazon, too many working people will continue to be treated like disposable labour.“The right to request guaranteed working hours is no right at all. Zero-hours contract workers will have no more leverage than Oliver Twist,” she said.Rebecca Long Bailey, shadow business secretary, said the reforms will do little to combat the government’s attacks on workers’ rights such as an increase in employment tribunal fees, the Trade Union Act and low wage growth.“These proposals do nothing to tackle the growing number of people on precarious zero-hours contracts and with their botched Brexit deal threatening jobs and rights they’ll have to do a lot more than this to reassure workers,” she said.The government claims the reforms will make the UK the first country in the world to address the opportunities and challenges of the gig economy and its impact on a modern economy.They form a key part of the government’s modern industrial strategy, a long-term plan to help businesses create better, higher-paying jobs in every part of the UK.Clark said: “The world of work is changing, bringing new opportunities for innovative businesses and new business models to flourish, creating jobs across the country and boosting our economy.“Today’s largest upgrade in workers’ rights in over a generation is a key part of building a labour market that continues to reward people for hard work, that celebrates good employers and is boosting productivity and earning potential across the UK.”Taylor told the : “I think this is a welcome and substantive response from the government and will make a real difference to the working lives of millions of workers, particularly those in the most vulnerable positions.”One business representative broadly welcomed the suggested reforms. Matthew Fell, CBI chief UK policy director, said: “Businesses support a strong floor of workplace rights, and it’s right that these laws keep pace with changes in the economy and society.“They welcome a new law giving all workers the right to request more predictable working hours which will help to facilitate the conversations that are essential to ensuring flexibility benefits both parties.“However, legislation to amend employment status rules risks making the law less able to adapt to new forms of work in the future,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3318994f724b574ee48a01cfaf4202d5f9c7b299/0_34_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b91ba024cc71993216c3ec641337fd55","title":"have you or your partner recently given birth share your experiences with us","story":"We’d like to hear about your physical and mental recovery after birthMost parents will tell you that nothing prepares you for the arrival of your first child.

How do you give someone a maid-a-milking? And what are mince pies?The short answer is that it’s a Christian festival that celebrates the birth of Jesus.According to the nativity story, Mary and Joseph travelled from their home in Nazareth (in what is now Israel) to Bethlehem (in what is now the West Bank) to take part in a census. Months earlier, Mary had been visited by the Angel Gabriel and told she would give birth to a boy who she would name Jesus, and who would be the son of God. The child was delivered in a stable. Shepherds and wise men brought birthday gifts.The bible does not specify the date of Jesus’s birth. Some people have suggested it was in the spring because of the custom of sending sheep into the fields at that time of year. “And in the same region there were some shepherds staying out in the fields, and keeping watch over their flock by night.” (Luke 2:8)In the fourth century, Pope Julius I chose 25 December as the date of the Feast of the Nativity. It took a while to catch on: Christmas wasn’t celebrated in England until the end of the sixth century, didn’t reach northern Europe until the end of the eighth century, and Christmas Day didn’t become a federal holiday in the US until 1870.25 December is the day that the Roman Catholic and Protestant churches celebrate Christmas, but many Orthodox Christians use the Julian calendar, which runs 13 days behind the standard international Gregorian calendar, for religious festivals. Christmas is celebrated by Orthodox Christians on 7 January in Russia, Ukraine, Serbia, Belarus, Egypt, Ethiopia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Macedonia, Moldova and Montenegro.Not as a festival to celebrate the nativity, obviously. But the reason why Pope Julius I picked 25 December was to appropriate pagan midwinter festivals and transform them into a Christian occasion.In Scandinavia, the Norse celebrated ‘Jul’ (Yule) from the winter solstice (21 December) for as long as it took for large logs to burn out, usually about 12 days. There was plenty of meat as animals were slaughtered so they wouldn’t need feeding over the winter, and home-brewed wine and beer was ready for drinking at Yuletide.In Rome, Saturnalia – honouring Saturn, the god of agriculture – began just before the winter solstice and continued for seven days. Men dressed as women, masters dressed as servants, and there was much feasting and rowdy behaviour.In the British Isles, druids cut and blessed mistletoe to mark the winter solstice.Not quite. When Oliver Cromwell and his Puritan forces took over England, Christmas was banned. Noting that the date of Jesus’s birth is not in the Bible, the Puritans decided it was all a just a pseudo-Christian gloss for the earlier pagan festivals. In 1644, Christmas was outlawed – no decorations, no mince pies and definitely no decadence. An “Ordinance for Abolishing of Festivals” was passed by parliament in June 1647 banning Christmas, Easter and Whitsun. In the US, where the Puritans were even more, well, puritan, anyone showing a bit of Christmas spirit in Boston faced a hefty fine of five shillings. Some referred to Christmas as “Foolstide”.Along with the monarchy, the festival was soon restored, and it was the Victorians who really shaped Christmas as we know it today. They instituted carol singing, decorated trees and the exchange of cards. The first Christmas tree was brought from Germany by Prince Albert to the royal household in 1834. These days, about 7m real trees are sold in the UK each year, and as many as 30m in the US.One in six people say it takes up to a whole year to pay off the cost of their Christmas splurge, and then the pressure to spend begins piling up again from about mid-October onwards.Perhaps, but Christmas is also a boom time for churches, with many people attending a service over the holiday even if they don’t consider themselves to be believers. Even some hardened atheists find candle-lit midnight mass on Christmas Eve or a children’s nativity service hard to resist.This year the C of E has launched a digital campaign, #FollowTheStar, inviting people to visit their local church over Christmas.Rather then being resentful of a Christian festival, Muslims often commit to extra charity work over the Christmas period, and some mosques hold special lectures about Jesus, considered in Islam to be a prophet. The festival of Eid al-Fitr, the festival that marks the end of the holy month of Ramadan, is sometimes called (by non-Muslims) the Muslim equivalent of Christmas in as far as it is a time spent with family and gifts are exchanged. The next time Eid al-Fitr and Christmas coincide is 2033.The phrase “Happy Holidays” has become commonplace as a catch-all for Christmas, Hanukkah (the Jewish festival which falls close to Christmas), and the non-religious. “Chrismukkah” interfaith greeting cards are available for those who want to mark both.And for those who simply don’t want any part of any festivities, there is always the tax return. More than 2,500 people filled in HMRC online self-assessment forms on Christmas Day last year.Not quite. There’s little real evidence of opposition to Christmas as a festival, but there have been many ill-founded media stories about the “war on Christmas”.The most famous centres on a promotional campaign run over three months by Birmingham city council in 1997-98, called Winterval. It covered Hallowe’en, Bonfire Night, Diwali, Ramadan, Eid, Hanukkah, Advent, Christmas, Boxing Day, New Year’s Eve and Chinese New Year.The council was accused of “political correctness gone mad”, even though it hoisted a “Merry Christmas” banner across the town hall, put up Christmas trees in city squares, hosted carol-singing sessions, and the Lord Mayor sent out a card depicting a traditional Christmas scene and wishing recipients a Merry Christmas.A few years later, Luton borough council was accused of “cancelling Christmas” in order not to offend Muslims. Critics wrongly claimed the council leader had tried to substitute a Harry Potter festival called Luminos for a proper Christian Christmas. In fact, the council’s Luminos festival had taken place over a November weekend three years before the row broke out.Not quite. After Christmas Day comes Boxing Day, a public holiday in the UK, also known as St Stephen’s Day. The name refers to a Christmas box traditionally given to servants and tradespeople, containing money, a gift and sometimes leftover food. It used to be a big fox-hunting day and is filled with top sporting fixtures, but mainly it signals the start of the post-Christmas sales for those with any money left over.And it doesn’t end there. In theory, the Christmas festival lasts 12 days, until 6 January, the day when the three wise men turned up in Bethlehem with gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh for baby Jesus. Traditionally, the celebrations continue and the decorations remain in place until 12th night, also known as Epiphany.The song The 12 Days of Christmas, which started life as an 18th century rhyme before being set to music by Frederic Austin in 1909, logs all the gifts given to the singer by his or her true love, ranging from a partridge in a pear tree to 12 drummers drumming. One financial services group estimates the cost of the gifts this year at more than £30,000.It’s not clear. You can’t call them maids any more, and most milking is done by machine.Easter! This is the Christian festival marking the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus. The gap between Christmas and Easter varies between three and four months, and this time it’s on the outer edge of that range with Easter falling on the third weekend of April. Or, for the resolutely non-Christian, there’s the spring equinox on 21 March. Until then, Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays …"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e12ab75f38831e66aa600644277c1feae15261f8/0_0_2559_1536/master/2559.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d0a687b3e86a499cde55aa5ef180a52b","title":"guardian most trusted newspaper in britain says industry report","story":"News outlet reaches more than 23m UK adults every month, helped by free website is the most trusted newspaper in Britain as well as being the most read quality news outlet, and the most popular quality news outlet among younger readers, according to industry figures released on Monday. is now reaching more than 23 million British adults every month, with the organisation’s articles being read by 12 million Britons in a typical week and 4.1 million on the average day, aided by the decision to keep the website free for all readers.Readers of the  website were also substantially more likely to say that they felt a close connection to the outlet, that it offered them something they could not get elsewhere, and that they trusted its reporting.

Here he recruits Waxweazle, the Dutch DJ whose hardcore productions redefine insistency, and goes back to back with the Justin Bieber of deconstructed club music, Kamixlo. Bladee, Yung Sherman and HVAD are the Scandi guests, playing fearsomely dystopian trap. A bracing start to the year that will either blow down the boundaries of taste or be a bit of a nightmare – most likely both. Oh, and the accompanying Wikipedia page for the event is quite something.This year the veteran night bid goodbye to its longtime home at the Bunatee in the Queen’s university student union, but continues to champion the best in off-kilter techno in their ongoing itinerant parties. For New Year they host Pangaea, who as one-third of Hessle Audio pointed a potential escape route for dubsteppers who didn’t want to drop comedy basslines on American teens. His dub-aware techno is brilliantly designed, and he released one of the biggest underground tracks of the year with the swinging, stupidly fun junglism of Bone Sucka.One of the weirder stories in dance music in recent times is that a wave of lo-fi DJ-producers with stupid names – DJ Boring, DJ Seinfeld et al – turned out not to be wacky chuckle-merchants but actually quite melancholic and deep. Chief among them was Ross from Friends, who may sound like an insufferably unfunny hipster but actually put out a solid album of melodic breakbeat-house jams this year (the clenched 44 of Project Cybersyn being the pick of the bunch). Here, he joins hedonistic queer party dons Horse Meat Disco, who also have parties up at Manchester’s Gorilla and HiFi Club in Leeds.As a complete snob I must inform you that anything involving ball ponds, holi paint, official hashtags and recognisable fun isn’t real clubbing – but it’s tough to resist the siren call of this fabulous-sounding event. Yes, there’s street food, neon face-painting, rollerskaters and prizes for the best 80s fancy dress, but even the most socially awkward muso will thrill to the selections of Bill Brewster, fabled as having some of the deepest, weirdest disco and funk crates in the business. Other rooms host B-boy hip-hop, 80s pop smashes and groove-driven world music of the era.With 8,500 records gleaned from about 30 years of collecting and living across Asia and Europe, Jane Fitz has amassed a formidable arsenal of deep house obscurities, tending towards the fugged, psychedelic end of the spectrum. She plays longform at this event, featuring a brand new custom visual environment from Matt Woodham – which, judging by his overwhelming previous efforts, might require a sit down with a camomile tea in a very dark room afterwards.Floating Points is just as adept at slinging globe-ning disco and techno as he is playing his own cosmic music live, and he will do the former at this excellently renovated warehouse space, alongside fellow disco beardstrokers Daphni (AKA Caribou) and Leon Vynehall plus Eclair Fifi, Djrum and more.One of the breakout stars of the brilliant Local Action label has been Finn, whose track Sometimes the Going Gets a Little Tough sampled classic girl-group soul to Ibiza-dominating effect this year. With an ear cocked to the high tempos of speed garage and rave classics, his sets can have you looking like a melted candle in minutes. He’s backed here by local heroes Conor Thomas, Anz, Tom Boogizm and India Jordan.A veritable Celebrations tub of variety, with the prized Malteser very much being Todd Edwards, the man who has done everything from win a Grammy with Daft Punk to essentially inventing UK garage by accident with his sublime chopped-sample house. Tech-houser Hannah Wants can tend towards the generic, but she’ll certainly keep energy levels up this being Bristol, there’s also brilliant drum’n’bass showing from Sub Focus, TC back to back with Annix, and the screwface-inducing supergroup of Jungle Warriors (that’s Kenny Ken, Remarc, Potential Badboy and the Ragga Twins). Auld Prang Syne, anyone?Thirteen hours of fun here, starting with a tasting menu from Middle Eastern fusion pop-up Torshi, with matched beers and cocktails, followed by a club night (with standalone tickets available) featuring an extended set from Maurice Fulton, whose bold, sensual productions for Róisín Murphy this year have furthered his legacy as one of the great journeymen of British dance culture.

Palms Trax, whose warmly disco-inflected productions and sets are always a pleasure, curates and plays alongside Shanti Celeste, who shares his affinity for crowdpleasing, emotionally rich analogue house. The real draw is the downstairs space, though, which reunites a pair of women – Avalon Emerson and Or:la – whose recent joint sets took in everything from menacing acid to Janet Jackson and coldwave obscurities.

And the key line was that the government is going to escalate planning for a no deal Brexit.Asked when this announcement would come, the prime minister’s spokesman told journalists “shortly”.Yes. We are leaving the EU on March 29.I will post a fuller summary shortly.Chancellor Philip Hammond has been dealt a £12bn blow after statistics officials changed the way student loans are accounted for in the public finances, the Press Association reports, The Office for National Statistics (ONS) will now split the loans into two parts - financial assets and government expenditure - as only part of the borrowings will ever be repaid. It marks a break with the current system whereby student loans do not count as government spending while interest payments are counted as income, despite the fact that many graduates will never pay all the interest back because they earn too little. However, the new approach will blow a £12bn hole in the public finances at a time when the economy is faltering as Brexit takes its toll, the Press Association reports.I’m off to the Number 10 lobby briefing now. I will post again after 11.30am. There are at least three obvious drawbacks with the idea, floated by Greg Clark and others (see 9.16am), that MPs could be given a free vote on a range of options, in the event of Theresa May’s Brexit plan being voted down, to establish if there is a majority for an alternative approach.1 - Labour and the opposition parties might not agree to the plan. The idea would be for parliament as a whole to have a free vote. But Theresa May only has the power to grant a free vote to Conservatives. Would Jeremy Corbyn respond by allowing Labour MPs a free vote? Perhaps. But Labour has its own Brexit agenda, and party leaders use votes in the House of Commons to push for the outcomes they want. They only tend to agree to free votes when there is no other way of resolving internal splits. Labour does have its Brexit splits, but they are not as deep or bitter as the Conservatives’, and so there is no guarantee that Corbyn would back a strategy essentially designed to rescue May.2 - If there were a free vote, there might be no majority of anything. Based on what we know of opinion in the Commons, it is likely that MPs could vote on a range of options (no deal, Canada, Norway plus, a referendum), only for them all to fail. There is precedent for this. In 2003 Tony Blair give MPs the chance to vote on seven alternative options for House of Lords reform. They were all rejected, in an outcome that was at the time deemed almost farcical.3 - MPs could choose an option unacceptable to the government. In his Today interview this morning Greg Clark claimed to be opposed to a second referendum on Brexit. He said:One of the many problems with a second referendum is it would continue that uncertainty for many more months, and would likely add to the isiveness that has characterised the last couple of years.May herself has effectively ruled out holding a second referendum. But it is quite possible that, under the proposal for MPs to have an indicative vote on what should happen next, a second referendum might emerge as the least unpopular way forward.Greg Clark, the business secretary, is only the latest minister to suggest the idea of MPs being given some sort of indicative vote on Brexit options if Theresa May’s deal is defeated. (See 8.54am.) Here are quotes from some others on this topic.Amber Rudd, the work and pensions secretary, proposed this idea, albeit in rather oblique terms, in an article in the Daily Mail on Saturday. She said:We need to try something different. Something that people do in the real world all the time, but which seems so alien in our political culture – to engage with others and be willing to forge a consensus.That requires politicians to be more prepared to work with anyone who – like me – is willing to accept you can’t always get what you want. It means taking a more practical, sensible and healing approach. These may not be words to make the heart beat faster, or fill the soul with excitement – but they are what’s needed in a country that has seen everything from families to political parties split down the middle and that now needs some Brexit certainty.It also requires everyone to abandon outrage and accusations. It’s not weak to create a safe environment for Parliament to find a solution – it’s strong.Damian Hinds, the education secretary, told Pienaar’s Politics on Sunday that he thought there was “a value in, sort of, flushing out, what these various different options are” in the House of Commons.Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, told the Andrew Marr Show on Sunday that the cabinet had not discussed the idea of having a free vote on what might happen next. But he would not be opposed, he said. He explained:Personally, I wouldn’t have a huge problem with parliament as a whole having a say on what the options were, because it wasn’t the government that was given an instruction by the referendum, it was parliament. Parliament said in that referendum we can’t make a decision. On this particular area we’re going to subcontract our sovereignty to the people and they gave us an instruction. It’s time parliament carried it out.And on the Westminster Hour last night Robert Buckland, the solicitor general, said that he could support MPs being given an indicative vote, if all parties made it a free vote. He said:I think if all the parties agreed to it then it’s something that might well work, but I think it would be imbalanced if one party did it and the other did not.Theresa May will be making a statement in the Commons this afternoon about last week’s near-disastrous EU summit. That was the one that was supposed to make progress towards the UK getting some legal assurances on the backstop that could help May get her Brexit deal through parliament, but that ended up with an unseemly row about whether or not Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European commission, had described May’s Brexit stance as “nebulous”. Given the adjectives that could quite reasonably be applied to the government’s Brexit strategy, “nebulous” is so mild it is hard to see what the fuss was about.May is certain to be asked what she will do if her deal gets voted down. In her numerous appearances at the despatch box recently, she has refused point-blank to engage with questions of this kind. But, in a sign of how collective discipline is breaking down, cabinet ministers are refusing to take this line. Although they pay lip service to wanting MPs to pass May’s deal, they are now happy to speculate in public about what “plan B” might be and some of them, like Amber Rudd, the work and pensions secretary, and Damian Hinds, the education secretary, are floating the idea of MPs being given the chance to vote from a menu of options to establish if there is a majority in parliament for an alternative approach. On the Today programme this morning Greg Clark, the business secretary, joined the campaign. He told the programme:I think, obviously, it’s important once the prime minister has finished her negotiations with other European leaders and the commission that parliament votes on that. If that were not to be successful, we do need to have agreement - we can’t just have continuing uncertainty and I think parliament should be invited to say what it would agree with, and that’s something that I think businesses up and down the country would expect elected members to take responsibility, rather than just be critics.There are more details in her our story here.Here is the agenda for the day.Morning: Theresa May holds an informal meeting with some cabinet meetings to discuss Brexit.3.30pm: May makes a statement to MPs about last week’s EU summit.4pm: Home Office officials and the Joint Council for Welfare of Immigrants questioned about the Windrush scandal by the Commons public accounts committee. As usual, I will also be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, although I will mostly be focusing on Brexit.

Nevertheless, it soon became evident that my relationship with him would not be the usual type of supervisor-student relationship. In those days, before he had his entourage of nurses and assistants, students would necessarily have to help him in various ways on account of his disability. This was not an arduous task, but it did mean that my relationship with him became quite intimate. Indeed, I shared an office with him, lived with his family for a while and accompanied him as he travelled around the world, giving talks and collecting medals.I soon discovered some of Stephen’s singular characteristics. The first, of course, was that he was very smart. Students are probably always in awe of their supervisors and with Stephen the awe was even greater. Indeed, on matters of physics, I always regarded him as an oracle, just a few words from him yielding insights that would have taken weeks to work out on my own. However, Stephen was only human and not all encounters led to illumination. Once I asked a question about something that was puzzling me. He thought about it silently for several minutes and I was quite impressed with myself for asking something that Stephen couldn’t answer immediately. His eyes then closed and I was even more impressed with myself because he was clearly having to think about it very deeply. Only after some time did it become clear that he had fallen asleep. Nowadays, I also sometimes fall asleep while talking to students, so I recall this incident with amusement.The other human side of Stephen is that he didn’t suffer fools gladly and sometimes got annoyed. One of the stories put around is that he would vent his frustration by running over students’ toes. I’m not sure about that – he once ran over the toes of the Prince of Wales, and I’m sure that was just an accident. On the other hand, I well recall one occasion when I made a remark in the departmental common room at tea time that showed I had misunderstood what he’d been saying. Stephen screamed “No!” so loudly that his wheelchair shot back halfway across the room under the recoil. I was most impressed that a single word from him could have such dramatic consequences.I also learned about Stephen’s stubbornness and determination to continue doing things for himself as long as possible, despite the relentless progress of his illness. For example, because he had an office in both the department of applied mathematics and theoretical physics and the Institute of Astronomy at Cambridge, I also had offices in both places. I recall that he sometimes gave me a lift (probably illegally!) between the two places in his three-wheeled invalid car. I found this rather scary because I thought he drove faster than was safe. Later, he had to discontinue the use of the car but he never lost his drive and the desire to travel as far and wide as possible. One regret is he didn’t live long enough to achieve his dream of going into space.I’m often asked where Stephen stands in the pantheon of great physicists. There are many ways of being a great physicist and they cannot be ranked like runners in an Olympic race. Stephen himself never claimed to have the status of Newton or Einstein, but I strongly disagree with people who suggest that his scientific contributions have been exaggerated because of his iconic status. His disability was clearly a factor in his becoming so famous, but I doubt any other contemporary physicist will achieve the accolade of being interred next to Isaac Newton in Westminster Abbey.Stephen died on Einstein’s birthday and was born on the date of Galileo’s death, so it’s odd that he should be connected to his two greatest heroes in this way. I doubt Stephen would have attributed much significance to this, but he would certainly acknowledge that we don’t understand the mystery of time. In any case, the synchronicity is fitting because his first major discovery was that spacetime trajectories can have singular endpoints where strange things may happen. Stephen was the most singular person I have ever known and I feel truly privileged that he was my friend."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1374239c05067123d7f398863e48aa3d6054b384/0_14_3663_2199/master/3663.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10d139d80973f9583f1c4ab5910e0090","title":"can you solve it do you speak twitter","story":"Test your knowledge of Tweet-speak, plus a social media maths puzzleThis week, two puzzles about social media.

Were I to write the column today, one of my first subjects would be Twitter slang. Tweet-speak is a form of constrained writing: necessarily brief, and with a distinctive holler.Twitter neologisms (Tweologisms?) are often witty, and are certainly baffling if you are not in the in-crowd. The following ten words and phrases, common among certain Twitter cliques, are crossing over into general usage. Under each word or phrase are two possible definitions. Which is the correct one?When I post the answers at 5pm I’ll explain where the words come from and give examples of proper usage.And now for the puzzle:A school composed of an equal number of boys and girls has its own social network. When two pupils are connected in this network they are said to be “pals”. Every pupil has at least one pal. Bernardo, who has 32 pals, discovers that all his fellow pupils have a different number of pals. (That is, no two of his fellow pupils have the same number of pals.)How many pupils attend the school?I’ll be back with the answers at 5pm UK time, and meanwhile NO SPOILERS!

In most cases they cannot access legal aid to carry out immigration work and rely heavily on charitable and philanthropic donations.“We thank all the  and Observer readers who have donated to the telethon yesterday and to the appeal so far,” said Nimrod Ben-Cnaan, director of policy at the Law Centres Network. “We are heartened by your support. It will allow Law Centres to help more people, whose lives are devastated by the hostile environment.“It also shows the scale of ongoing public outrage at this inhumane policy, and our shared determination to bring it to an end.”This year’s appeal was inspired by the ’s revelation that thousands of British citizens of Caribbean background, many of whom had been living in the UK for decades, were denied rights and basic services such as NHS treatment because they were unable to provide documentation to show they were legally resident. Some were wrongly deported, others were placed in detention centres. writer Amelia Gentleman worked closely with the charities to reveal the scandal, publishing a series of articles that culminated in the resignation last year of the then home secretary Amber Rudd. The government subsequently apologised and promised to reform the process but little has changed in practice and the charities are warning that many thousands more people, including EU and Commonwealth migrants, will face similar injustices.The 2018 appeal runs until 7 January 2019.

It is also known as myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME).Some studies into the condition have suggested the immune system could be involved, with viral infections one potential trigger for CFS.“The evidence is largely inconclusive – there are studies which have shown elevated levels of the inflammatory markers, but such abnormalities are quite inconsistent across studies,” said Alice Russell, first author of the research from King’s College London.Because it is not possible to predict who will get a virus, it is impossible to look at levels of biological molecules before, during and after a potential CFS “trigger” infection.Experts say they have used a group of people with a different condition as a model to explore how immune response might be linked to persistent fatigue.Writing in the journal Psychoneuroendocrinology, Russell and colleagues describe how they recruited 55 patients with a chronic hepatitis C infection. To treat the condition, all were given a six- to 12-month course of injections of interferon alpha, a protein that is produced naturally by the body and stimulates the white blood cells to provoke an immune response. The treatment has previously been linked to a side effect of ongoing fatigue in some patients.While most patients recovered from hepatitis C, there was also an increase in fatigue during treatment, which reduced when the injections ended. However, six months after treatment finished, 18 participants remained more fatigued than before treatment began. These patients had slightly higher levels of a protein linked to inflammation, called IL10, in their blood before treatment began, but, after four weeks of treatment, their levels of IL10 and another inflammatory protein called IL6 were twice as high as for those who recovered without persistent fatigue.However, six months after the injections of interferon alpha stopped, there were no differences in the levels of the inflammation proteins between those with and without persistent fatigue. There was also no difference in history of depression, experience of a recent stressful life event or early life trauma.For comparison, the team took one-off measurements of the same inflammation markers among 54 iniduals who have had CFS for years and 57 healthy participants, but they found no difference in their levels.Prof Carmine Pariante, a co-author of the study from King’s College London, said this showed that by the time ongoing fatigue was established, the immune activation was no longer present.“It helps explain why we cannot find clear evidence of immune activation in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome,” he said. Pariante added the heightened immune response might trigger changes in the brain, muscles or metabolism that resulted in ongoing fatigue – although this is not yet clear – while genetics or repeated childhood infections might explain why only some people had a heightened immune response.However, the study had a number of limitations: it is small, the hepatitis C patients were largely men and, by default, all had a serious condition which itself is more common in iniduals with particular risk factors. In addition, the levels of interferon alpha given to participants was much higher than would naturally be produced in the body – and those with persistent fatigue were not diagnosed with CFS.Sharpe acknowledged the study did not shed light on how to treat established cases of CFS. “it may give us some clue down the line,” he said. “If the thing is triggered by an abnormal or excessive immune response, if we could find a way to reduce that immune response, we might stop incident cases.”Dr Charles Shepherd, medical advisor at the ME Association, welcomed the study. “It adds to the growing weight of scientific evidence which indicates that the body’s immune system is playing an important role in the causation of CFS.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d453cd54fdd6099260c9e261a4dd31c0cb056217/0_176_3214_1929/master/3214.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ec486ce530eedb22182636021d703f76","title":"australia sense victory in second test after brutal day in perth","story":"Australia are on track to level the four-Test series after dismissing Virat Kohli and reducing India to 112-5 in a chase for 287 on a testy fourth day in Perth. Kohli led an inspired fightback in India’s first innings of the second Test but the world’s best batsman had no answers to Tim Paine’s barbs and Nathan Lyon’s bounce on Monday.Lyon dismissed Kohli for a seventh time in Tests, drawing him forward with a well-flighted delivery that was edged to Usman Khawaja at first slip, then Murali Vijay as India slumped to 55-4. Ajinkya Rahane’s needless dismissal then left Australia perfectly placed to complete their first Test win since the Cape Town cheating scandal, with one more wicket needed to expose the visitors’ long tail at Perth Stadium.Paine and Usman Khawaja’s 72-run stand enhanced the hosts’ advantage during Monday’s wicket-less morning session, while Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood both struck on the demonic pitch during a brutal six-over burst before tea.A slanging match between Paine and Kohli, ignited late on day three, briefly turned physical to provide broadcasters with more fodder than any tactical showdown between the captains. A fired-up Kohli, who had been a relative picture of composure in the match until his first-innings knock of 123 ended with a contentious catch on Sunday, needled Paine and agitated in search of an early breakthrough.Kohli stationed himself in the path of Paine at one point when the batsman was running between the wickets, with the pair making slight contact when they were chest to chest.Australia were relatively quiet during the superstar’s 40-ball stint at the crease and there was no send-off, although Paine made his thoughts about Kohli clear soon after the superstar’s dismissal. “I know he’s your captain but you can’t seriously like him as a bloke,” Paine quipped to Vijay.Paine, earlier dismissed when Kohli snaffled a slips catch, had turned and looked back at his counterpart as he walked off. It was unclear whether Kohli’s cackling attracted Paine’s attention or something was said.Mohammed Shami fired out Paine and Aaron Finch, resuming after he retired hurt on day three because of a finger injury caused by the same bowler, with consecutive short balls then removed Khawaja and Lyon.Pat Cummins’ dismissal, bowled by an unplayable ball from Jasprit Bumrah that hit a crack and hardly bounced, highlighted the uneven bounce on offer. Shami’s career-best haul of 6-56 gave India’s fans hope but there was no hiding the imposing nature of their target."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c870659c11e3a847efdef3b04e76ed77b00b4215/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2ad64cdaf581984276e3ab11745fcda3","title":"european champions cup pool saracens leinster gloucester","story":"Gloucester dogged by inconsistency, Edinburgh and Glasgow head for the last eight and Leinster have look of championsThe pool of champions has polarised. Leinster, for all Toulouse’s attempts to recapture past glories, are the team in control, even if they trail the French club by two points. Their victory over Bath was imperious, and Toulouse, who rode their luck anyway in round one in Bath, must travel to Dublin next. Leinster’s trip to Wasps in the final round does not look the challenge it might once have been. For two of England’s greatest clubs to be mathematically out of it after only four rounds is a sobering reflection on the Premiership, which looks worryingly short of the sort of teams who might lay claim to being of champion quality. There’s just the one of those. Michael AylwinIf there was one result that felt wearily familiar, it was Gloucester’s defeat at home by Exeter, a week after a fine win at Sandy Park had put them right in the mix. Inconsistency still dogs them. No sooner do they address their away form than they lose at home. Absolutely bloody typical, you could almost hear the Shed chanting. Instead of challenging Munster at the top of the pool, Gloucester are bottom. But this pool is very much alive, Castres’ home win over Munster keeping it so – bad tempered and brutal. Two home wins for the English clubs in round five (sizeable ifs in the current climate), when Gloucester host Munster and Exeter face Castres, would leave it poised deliciously. MAOne more win for Saracens should do it – and it will surely come next round at the home of Lyon, who have flopped horribly in their first campaign, the only side without a point after four rounds. Saracens, on the other hand, are the only side without a defeat and look the likeliest challengers to Leinster. Their win at Cardiff was not pretty but highly impressive, a yellow card in the second half merely their cue to turn up the pressure. Glasgow look well-placed to take their place in the quarter-final too. A home win against Cardiff next time ought to be enough. Should Edinburgh join them then new ground would be broken in Scottish rugby: two quarter-finalists for the first time. MAUlster face Racing in Paris next month in a match which is crucial for Dan McFarland’s side if they are to prevent the French side topping the pool. Racing are five points clear after securing victory with a try bonus point to heap misery on Leicester. Still, putting four tries past Leicester is not the achievement it once was, given it was the eighth time it has happened this season. In any case, Ulster matched Racing in scoring their second consecutive bonus-point win when they defeated the Scarlets at the King Stadium. Jacob Stockdale scored his fifth try in six games and while other high-profile players such as Rory Best and Iain Henderson also stood out, so did the less heralded, in the form of the fly-half, Billy Burns. Claire TolleySunday’s Premiership visit of Gloucester has taken on added importance for Newcastle. Down but not yet out of Europe after a second successive defeat to Edinburgh, Dean Richards’ men now face an uphill task to reach the knockout stages. Of greater importance is preserving their league status during a season which could see the tightest relegation scrap for many years. Newcastle lie bottom of the Premiership but only four points separate them and sixth-placed Bath. Last season saw them reach the play-off semi-finals in their best season for 16 years. They need to rediscover that form quickly to avoid the indignity of relegation. Ross HeppenstallA classic Leinster score in every sense. An alert quick tap from a penalty on Bath’s 10-metre line, Johnny Sexton’s wraparound with a hard-running Garry Ringrose, a scything break from the electric Jordan Larmour and perfect support from a supposed bit-part player.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspJust three sides – Toulouse, Racing 92 and Saracens – remain unbeaten in Europe after four rounds of the Champions Cup. Toulouse’s five-try 42-27 demolition of Wasps was also notable for an entertaining exchange of views between the referee, Nigel Owens, and the flanker Jerome Kaino. It went as follows: Kaino: “Slap-down, sir!” Owens: “Not that I saw.” Kaino: “Even Superman misses stuff, eh?” Wayne Barnes explaining decisions in French to Castres’ forwards during the win over Munster should also be highly commended.The prize for the weekend’s longest rugby trip without actually playing any rugby went to Northampton, whose Challenge Cup pool game in Romania against Timisoara Saracens was called off because of a snowbound pitch. The Saints players were also stranded overnight when their scheduled flight home was cancelled despite efforts of players and officials to clear snow from around their aircraft.\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2023de63811aee4a9d67e5f9b10f3e4797ff3b14/0_54_1445_867/master/1445.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=04d8faa07753c074dcaf2e59778857ab","title":"send us a tip on a uk winter walk for the chance to win a 200 hotel voucher","story":"A good walk and fresh air are perfect for blowing away the Christmas cobwebs.

The channel has since aired investigations by Dooley into everything from Mexico’s drug war to the sexualisation of Japanese girls. Cohen, who went on to be the BBC’s director of television, had advised her to eschew a conventional journalistic persona in favour of her own natural empathy.Fast forward 10 years to exposure of a very different kind in the form of her victory in this year’s Strictly Come Dancing on BBC One and it’s clear Dooley’s ability to connect with as big an audience as it gets on terrestrial television makes her a force to be reckoned with. At a time when young, female faces from working-class backgrounds are at a premium in television, not least at the BBC, the broadcasting world is her oyster after years of building up a dedicated fanbase among younger viewers.“She is just very warm and creates a very human connection with interviewees,” said David Fuller, a journalist and film-maker who has worked with Dooley on productions including 2016’s investigation into the Russian sex trade. “She was already a kind of celebrity at that point. I haven’t watched Strictly so I don’t know if she has shown this, but she is also very self-aware and very amusing. She would joke from time to time and point at herself, saying: ‘Face of a generation, Dave, face of a generation’.”Dooley’s own wry self-deprecation about her marketability aside, casting this year’s winner of the BBC’s flagship entertainment show as a breakout star is somewhat off the mark. But while some ask: “Where has she come from?” the BBC Three controller, Damian Kavanagh, speaks glowingly of a talent that he says has been “developing and growing for some time”.Strictly Come Dancing attracted a peak of 12.7 million viewers for Saturday night’s final as Dooley and her professional partner, Kevin Clifton, emerged as the people’s champions in a vote following three months of competition. Despite scoring lower among the judges than fellow finalists Ashley Roberts and Faye Tozer – both of whom have music backgrounds – Dooley had been widely tipped as favourite alongside the fourth finalist, YouTube star Joe Sugg.Her reply to to the question of how she planned to celebrate was classic Dooley: “Go to McDonald’s. I’m starving,” as was a subsequent tweet that made light of a so-called “wardrobe malfunction”.“I’ve won Strictly and flashed my knickers. A perfect Sat night,” she told her more than 234,000 followers.To fans, it’s the type of language that reflects her down to earth Luton roots, a town to which she returned in 2013 to make a documentary about extremism, at one point interviewing the far right figure Stephen Yaxley-Lennon – who calls himself Tommy Robinson – whom she spoke of knowing when growing up.Dooley, who left school at 16, is spoken of by broadcasting colleagues as being instinctively “streetwise”, an asset also seemingly married with steely determination.“She is tenacious and she is charming,” said one, who spoke of Dooley catching malaria while shooting in the early days of her career in the Ivory Coast, returning again after recovering in the UK.“She can charm her way out of trouble or into wherever she needs to be, whether it’s with the driver of the jeep, a shy 12-year-old interviewee or a menacing government official.”Dooley spoke of her own candid style during an interview with the Observer: “You have to be brave and ask the questions on the tip of your tongue. Sometimes, you’re cringeing inside. But you can’t have people screaming at the screen the question you didn’t have the balls to ask.”A more cynical reading among some industry watchers has, meanwhile, viewed this year’s Strictly, and previous episodes of ITV’s I’m a Celebrity… as a classic tactic to introduce potential future stars into the mainstream.It’s a view at odds with the reality of Dooley’s appeal as told by Kavanagh, who said she has “a whole tranche of fans who are literally waiting for a new documentary by her to drop on iPlayer”.“I went to one in London a few months ago and it was basically packed to the rafters with young men and women who were in thrall to her as she spoke, and when there were questions afterwards, every one of them started off by telling her how much she had changed their lives.”While Dooley’s next steps will be closely watched, Kavanagh pointed out that she has already worked on a number of films for BBC One and has further titles on the way with BBC Three. Her appeal has been clear for some time. Last year’s documentary on young DUP members – suddenly relevant again to UK politics – was one of the most-watched programmes for a period last year on iPlayer, as visible a gauge of popularity as one might find.Will success change her? The bets are very much against that happening. “She is basically extremely down to earth and decent,” added Fuller.“In fact, the only difficulty we had in Russia with her was that she didn’t like using the lift. You could read into that what you will, but the truth is that she is claustrophobic.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94cbe30b011a748d27110b9148f6f3cd254fb622/0_137_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c3fbde15c8d7d654fdf864b60cf4221","title":"beto orourke 2020 presidential race","story":"Polls show Texas congressman among voters’ favorites to take on Donald Trump but critics warn he is untestedRarely has a candidate lost a statewide election in America and immediately been declared a major contender for the next presidential race.Beto O’Rourke, the congressman who fell just shy of defeating the Texas senator Ted Cruz, appears to be the exception and his 2020 prospects are already sending ripples through what promises to be a remarkable and intense contest.The dust had barely settled from the November midterm elections when the conversation took a swift turn toward who will lead Democrats in their bid to make Donald Trump a one-term president.In the five weeks since, O’Rourke’s political ambitions have been the subject of intense chatter: the media has likened him to Barack Obama, polling has shown him in the top tier of a potentially crowded field, and some Democratic operatives are privately declaring “I’m in” if he chooses to run. The 46-year-old native of El Paso, Texas, has even been trailed by the celebrity gossip site TMZ.A meeting between O’Rourke and Obama, held last month at the former president’s Washington office, intensified speculation over the prospects of a Beto 2020 campaign.Some activists said the Texan was winning over voters and activists in key battleground states long before he became a serious threat to any likely Democratic opponents.“Since this summer, we were seeing yard signs for Beto in Iowa, which is not something you usually see for a Senate candidate from Texas,” said Sean Bagniewski, the chairman of the Polk County Democrats, an area that covers Iowa’s capital city of Des Moines.O’Rourke has maintained a relatively low profile since his underdog bid to unseat Cruz fell short. But the three-term congressman signaled last month he was open to running for president and had made a decision along with his wife “not to rule anything out”.His comments were a departure from earlier statements that he did not wish to seek the presidency, in the event that he lost the Texas Senate race.O’Rourke amassed a record-breaking $38m in the third quarter of his race against Cruz and quickly developed a national following – drawing an eleventh-hour endorsement from Beyoncé, herself a Texas native. While O’Rourke ultimately failed to topple Cruz, he defied expectations for any Democrat by falling within three percentage points of the Republican senator in the deeply red state of Texas.“I think he has real potential and real talent. He’s raised more money than any congressional candidate in the history of the United States. You simply can’t count him out.”Recent polls have provided O’Rourke an opening as he ponders his next move.A CNN survey ranked him third in a list of 2020 Democratic hopefuls, behind the former vice-president Joe Biden and Vermont senator Bernie Sanders. A straw poll conducted by MoveOn, a progressive group that backed Sanders over Hillary Clinton in 2016, found O’Rourke narrowly ahead of the pack.The Democratic party is nonetheless bracing for a sprawling field of possible presidential contenders, and there is no clear frontrunner.O’Rourke may also face some competition in his home state of Texas from Julián Castro, the former mayor of San Antonio and housing secretary under Obama. He plans to make a final decision in mid-January about whether he will run for president.The presence of two Texans in the race would ide loyalties in the state, said Gilberto Hinojosa, the chair of the Texas Democratic party.“That’s not an easy decision, but it’s a healthy thing for the Democratic party,” he said.Skeptics argue O’Rourke is still largely untested and has yet to face the intense spotlight that comes with a presidential campaign. And although his star rose as his long-shot campaign against Cruz gained steam, the latter has been a uniquely unpopular figure since he first arrived in Washington nearly six years ago.Some on the left have also questioned his liberal bona fides and called on the outgoing congressman to adopt more “bold, unapologetic progressive stances” on issues such as climate change, healthcare and trade.lliana Holguin, the El Paso Democratic party chair, said O’Rouke’s Senate campaign demonstrated his ability to galvanize important Democratic constituencies, including young voters and Latinos.“Beto was born and raised in a border community. He understands the issues facing the Latino community better than most people,” she said. “The border is not something he has to learn about. He can speak from the heart.”“Here in El Paso everyone is just patiently waiting to see what he decides to do.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f553d0301e7ab0796b4a174e9ca0d75371c8851/0_129_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7b0a538afb4ad3cb9c8ba908ee63b519","title":"ortega condemned for raids on ngos and media in nicaragua","story":"Human Rights Watch criticises president after he took action against NGOs and mediaActivists and prominent members of Latin America’s left have condemned Nicaragua’s increasingly authoritarian regime under President Daniel Ortega after the former revolutionary hero stepped up his attack on political opponents by raiding some the country’s most important non-governmental organisations and media.Since Thursday armed police have seized the headquarters of one of Nicaragua’s top independent media outlets, Confidencial, and its leading human rights group, CENIDH, in the latest phase of a crackdown designed to cement Ortega’s grip on power after months of protests.Pro-Ortega lawmakers last week stripped nine NGOs of their legal status, with the government claiming the groups had “actively participated” in terrorist acts, hate crimes and a failed coup attempt against Ortega’s Sandinista regime.José Miguel Vivanco, Human Rights Watch’s Americas director, said that by attacking such well-known organisations Nicaragua’s president was making clear his intention “to rule by terror and intimidation”.He said: “This is a deliberate decision by Ortega to stay in power through brutal repression. There is no more facade of negotiation, or of a democratic regime … The policy being imposed … is zero tolerance to criticism.” Shutting down such groups was “something we haven’t even seen in Venezuela under Nicolás Maduro”.Nicaraguan human rights defender Bianca Jagger rejected claims the targeted groups were part of a rightwing US-backed conspiracy to topple Ortega as “a complete and total fallacy”.“He wants to eliminate any voice of dissent,” Jagger said of Nicaragua’s president, who became a flag-bearer for the global left thanks to his role in toppling the Somoza dictatorship in 1979.“As someone who supported the revolution in the beginning I feel betrayed.”There was censure too from prominent Latin American leftists including Colombia’s Gustavo Petro. “Daniel Ortega is not leading a democratic revolution,” tweeted the former guerrilla and mayor of Bogotá. “On the contrary, by imposing neoliberal and conservative measures on his people, he is building a tyranny.”The political turbulence rocking what had been considered one of Central America’s most stable countries erupted in April with the outbreak of student-led protests in Managua.Those demonstrations swelled into a nationwide revolt after attempts to put them down with deadly force. Protesters seized control of key highways and towns including the longtime Sandinista stronghold of Masaya.For a while the uprising looked set to dethrone Ortega, 73, whose cold war tussle with Washington made him a revolutionary icon but who is now increasingly seen as an autocrat. But a counter-attack by security forces and armed paramilitary gangs in July helped Ortega reclaim control of the streets and force thousands of dissidents into exile.Since then, he has continued to turn up the heat on opponents, banning street protests and, most recently, targeting NGOs and media outlets who were documenting the turmoil. Journalists have been subjected to a campaign of intimidation and violence intended to snuff out coverage of the crisis, which activists blame for upwards of 325 deaths.As this week’s crackdown unfolded, Ortega made what was reportedly his first overseas trip since the crisis began, traveling to a “Bolivarian” summit in Cuba where he met Maduro and Bolivia’s president, Evo Morales, and railed against “the tyranny of global capitalism”.In an editorial, the opposition newspaper La Prensa slammed Ortega’s “massacre” of civil society. “Deep down what this is all about is that the dictatorship does not tolerate the existence of civil groups who nourish and strengthen democracy and denounce the abuse of power. That is why it is trying to liquidate them.”The ratcheting up of repression has been accompanied by growing pushback from the US.In November the US national security adviser, John Bolton, branded Nicaragua part of a Latin American “troika of terror” alongside Venezuela and Cuba. The Trump administration would “no longer appease dictators and despots near our shores”, Bolton vowed.Jagger, the president of an eponymous human rights foundation, said she was encouraged by US efforts to hasten Ortega’s exit but said other countries needed to step up.“This cannot be only the sanctions from the US. It needs to be sanctions for the European Union, from Canada, from Latin American countries, in order for this to work. The people of Nicaragua are totally vulnerable and at the mercy of a brutal and murderous dictator,” she said.Some on the left also needed to abandon their illusions about Ortega, Jagger added. “This should not be an issue of left or right. This should be an issue of human rights. This should be an issue of morality.”Carlos Fernando Chamorro, the editor of Confidencial, said his journalists would continue to cover the upheaval despite Ortega’s bid to silence them.“We feel persecuted and threatened but our morale is intact,” said Chamorro, whose father’s 1978 assassination helped set in motion the downfall of the Somoza dictatorship.“The people of Nicaragua have been massacred and incarcerated. The very least we can do is stay true to the principles of working for truth, justice and democracy in this country.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d9feb8a81ee12aef02b20485992ba54313a2f31/472_482_4790_2874/master/4790.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=33a015878d9f766fb4cdd9705865ffa3","title":"leila ali elmi somali born mp sweden swing right","story":"Leila Ali Elmi has promised to be a voice for those targeted by hostility to immigrationSwedes will this week be treated to a new sight: a Swedish MP giving a speech in a hijab.Leila Ali Elmi, who arrived in the country aged two after her family fled civil war in Somalia, will make her parliamentary debut after winning a surprise victory in this autumn’s polls, promising a voice for people targeted by the groundswell of hostility to immigration.“My getting elected has caused a lot of reactions from the racists,” she says in the Green party offices in Stockholm. “They weren’t really ready for it, but here I am.”Ali Elmi, 30, represents the other side of an election that was dominated by the issue of immigration and had an increase in the far-right vote. She fought on the issues closest to residents of Angered, the disadvantaged, immigrant suburb that has been her home for the past 28 years – unemployment, overcrowding, exclusion and segregation. News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@the“The only people who were not surprised at my election victory are those who know that the suburb needs a voice. I speak for the suburb, not about it or to it,” she says. “If you have not lived there or spent a day in those people’s shoes, you cannot represent them.”Ethnic segregation in Sweden’s suburbs drew international attention in early 2013 when young people rioted in northern Stockholm, torching cars and schools and fighting with police. They said they were angry at police racism and felt like second-class citizens despite having been born in the country.There have been flare-ups since, most recently when masked youths armed with molotov cocktails set 80 cars ablaze in a Gothenburg suburb. Problems with gangs, shootings and even grenade attacks have led some politicians to claim the suburbs are ungovernable no-go zones.The party has also shifted the political mainstream to the right. Sweden has moved a long way from the years leading up to 2016 when it welcomed 370,000 asylum seekers – by far the largest number relative to population of any European country.For Ali Elmi, the issue is not immigration but rather the conditions in which most people with immigrant backgrounds live. “The Sweden Democrats say everything that is going wrong here is because of the immigrants, because Sweden is bringing too many people into the country, but this is a fiction. It is not true,” she says.“I am trying to say instead that this is a national issue. People don’t have jobs and they live in segregated areas, which puts them even further from becoming part of the society. People feel dignity when they feel part of something bigger. Criminality is due to social exclusion … we need more equality in this country, harder laws against discrimination and racism.”It is too soon to say precisely who voted for Ali Elmi, according to Jonas Hinnfors, a professor of politics at Gothenburg University. But the election of a young, liberal Muslim points to fundamental changes. “There is something stirring out there, a new trend,” he says.“She did not play the immigrant card. It was not: ‘We Muslims must stick together.’ Instead it was schools, segregation, jobs – all the issues that are important to people who live in the suburbs. And because she comes from there, Ali Elmi also embodies what she is talking about. That is unusual.”Ali Elmi worked as an interpreter, helping newly arrived immigrants and refugees to navigate the administrative process. Before her election to parliament, she was a city councillor for the Greens, campaigning on the party’s broad agenda of social and sexual equality, feminism and climate change.Her political inspiration is Shirley Chisholm, the first black woman elected to the US Congress. Ali Elmi’s speech comes in the week that Sweden marks 100 years since its parliament voted for women’s suffrage.“I addressed all Gothenburgers who share my values and those of the Green party,” she says. “My election gives hope to people who recognise themselves in me, whether they are black, female, Jewish, Muslims or young people.”This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

It was February – in the midst of Italy’s general election campaign – and Della Barbara was the latest follower to like the most posts by Matteo Salvini in the shortest amount of time.“I knew it was linked to building engagement through social media,” said Della Barbara, a 22-year-old university student from Milan.The prize was a 10-minute one-on-one call with Salvini, which Della Barbara used to talk about his studies, his family’s business and his hope to see reduced taxes on electronic cigarettes. “It was interesting, as doing politics in this way had never been done in Italy before.”“Who will win? Salvini will,” the party leader said in one Facebook video promoting the contest. “The others have newspapers, television, banks and corporate cash … we have you, we have the network … so long as it remains free.”Salvini is not the only populist, on the left or right, to prove adept at innovating with social media. Silicon Valley has given politicians of all stripes the ability to bypass traditional media outlets, communicate directly with voters and sculpt their own image without interference from journalists.Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil’s president-elect, benefited from viral WhatsApp messaging, while Facebook was turned into a weapon against opponents of the Philippines president, Rodrigo Duterte. And after reaching the White House on the back of a tweet-fuelled campaign, Donald Trump famously said: “Maybe I wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for Twitter.”But it is another nationalist, populist leader – India’s Narendra Modi – who has the largest combined following on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram of any politician in the world, at more than 100 million. The prime minister’s approach to social media contrasts sharply with Salvini’s homespun Facebook updates and Trump’s typo-ridden tweets.Modi combines a steady stream of upbeat announcements with occasional, gentle jabs at his his opponents. It is a restrained approach that suits Modi, and has helped him rebrand his persona, from hardline nationalist to populist champion of India’s technologically connected middle-class.Benjamin Moffitt, a senior lecturer at Australian Catholic University, said there was no uniform use of social media among populists. But there was a new generation of populist leaders who were using digital communication tools with “more skill and efficacy” than their rivals. “Their Twitter feeds, Facebook pages and so forth often have more shares, likes and fans than their opponents, and are often far more entertaining and engaging.”Salvini’s use of social media has intensified in the six months since he became deputy prime minister in June, a period in which his profile and popularity has steadily increased. That can be attributed in part to his use of Facebook and Instagram, which he uses to cultivate his public persona.In one recent five-day period, Salvini’s Facebook page included a post defending crucifixes and nativity scenes as symbols of Italian culture, a live video in which he donned a hard hat onboard a digger that was about to demolish a villa in Rome owned by a mafia clan, and several selfies savouring “Italian only” products: a Nutella pancake, a tiramisu, and a pint of Moretti beer.His Instagram account was similarly replete with selfies and other images depicting a down-to-earth Italian: cooking fried eggs (“an energetic lunch!”), eating a burger and rustling up chicken cutlets for his two children. He also posted photos of cats sent to him by supporters alongside the caption: “It’s good to have a few pussycats on the page to bring some tranquillity to an evening.” Apart from cats, there was Salvini on a horse, with a donkey and petting a budgie. There were also images of him posing bare-chested on a beach, jogging while wearing a police officer’s cap and holding a statue of the Madonna.Mixed with the soft selfies, however, is a near-constant barrage of far-right propaganda, much of it directed at scapegoating immigrants. Salvini’s most popular video during the election campaign, according to a  analysis of data acquired by academics at the University of Pisa, is a clip less than three minutes long. It shows two videos side-by-side: footage of elderly people rummaging through discarded bin bags for scraps of food, and another of African migrants complaining about the bad food they receive at a reception centre.“This is what the left has reduced us to,” Salvini says in the post, “you never see this on the television news, who knows why.”Salvini’s communication skills were first nurtured at La Padania, a now-closed newspaper that acted as press organ during the League’s days as a northern secessionist movement. He joined the paper, working on the letters page, in 1997, four years after his election as a councillor in Milan.“I remember him going to the squares or markets, never missing an opportunity to hand out fliers,” said Stefania Piazzo, a former director of La Padania. But after becoming leader of the party in 2013, Salvini had the foresight to embrace the digital era, closing the party’s newspaper and erting resources into an online news site, Il Populista.These days, his highly choreographed social media operation is overseen by the strategist Luca Morisi, whose Sistema Intranet company created a mysterious piece of social media software known as “the Beast”. Morisi used an interview with YouTrend in October to dismiss rumours about the software, saying there was no “automated listening”, and that his boss’s success on social media was largely down to intuition.Morisi, his business partner, Andrea Paganella, and four social media managers are official staff members of the interior ministry, costing taxpayers €314,000 a year. Together they produce a constant diet of social media content, much of it fuelling animosity toward migrants.Salvini’s appetite for controversy contrasts sharply with Modi’s avoidance of it. When a Muslim girl was murdered this year and eight Hindu men were charged with the crime, India convulsed with rage and recrimination. For days, both online and off, Modi said nothing about the case.His more than 44 million Twitters followers saw only the Indian prime minister’s tribute to India’s Commonwealth Games athletes, his celebration of various festivals, cartoons of himself doing yoga and his plans to meet the Queen.It was standard fare for Modi, whose office has a dedicated staff member who carefully coordinates the output from his personal and prime ministerial accounts. According to a 2015 freedom of information request, Modi handles his own Twitter account, @NarendraModi, indicating at least some of his tweets are personally penned on his secure tablet.Joyojeet Pal, an associate professor in information technology at the University of Michigan, said Modi had used social media to soften his image, helping to offset concern India’s middle classes may have had about voting for a firebrand, socially conservative sectarian.In the early 2000s, Modi was best known as the chief minister of Gujarat whose heated rhetoric inflamed tensions that resulted in mobs attacking Muslim homes and shops across Gujarat, killing at least 1,000 people. Online, however, another Modi has emerged.One of the earliest adopters of technology among Indian legislators, Modi set up an official website in 2003 when many other party offices were still using typewriters, and joined Twitter in 2009. A Stanford University study published  this year examining Modi’s tweets noticed their content evolved around January 2013, when he became the party’s frontrunner to contest national elections.To his Twitter audience of mostly young, urban Indians, clamouring for jobs in a competitive market, Modi emphasises his roots as an outsider and self-made man — someone who has risen up from a childhood as a chai-wallah (tea-seller) at train stations.It draws a contrast with his main opponent, Rahul Gandhi, a scion of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty who embodies the Indian establishment. “They looted the nation in the name of the poor but now it is the son of a poor man who is challenging them,” Modi tweeted during the 2014 election campaign.Modi also began posting selfies, sporting an Apple Watch and using digital holograms to beam himself to rallies across India. In a country where millions of lives have been transformed by the IT revolution, the embrace of technology had a loud populist resonance, said Pal.“In millennial India, we accept technology as the means to transformation,” he said. “The middle-class person gets a degree in technology and transforms their future … Why for instance would Modi have a well-maintained page on LinkedIn? Clearly it’s not what will get him his next job. The point is, it shows that he stands on his credentials, like every other Indian jobseeker.”An active social media presence also gives Modi an excuse to bypass traditional media. He is the first prime minister in India’s history never to have given a press conference inside the country. While Trump and Salvini take it upon themselves to stoke fiery messaging, Modi leaves that to allies. One former party activist, Sadhavi Khosla, claimed in a 2016 book she was part of a network of hundreds who would receive daily instructions from the party on whom to target.“Our value is that since we are not official, we do not go through that much vetting,” said Vikas Pandey, a volunteer with Modi’s Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) and founder of “I Support Narendra Modi”, the most popular political fan page on Facebook, with more than 15 million followers. “We can be spicier than the official BJP accounts, which are more or less very boring.”"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed how italy populists used facebook win election matteo salvini luigi di maio","story":"Matteo Salvini and Luigi Di Maio eclipsed rivals in online election battle, data showsThe domination of Facebook by Italy’s two populist political leaders, Matteo Salvini and Luigi Di Maio, is revealed in previously unseen data that shows how they exploited video and live broadcasts to bypass the mainstream media and foment discord during the country’s general election.The data, reviewed by the , reveals how the leaders massively expanded their reach with inflammatory and visually arresting posts earlier this year, eclipsing their main rival, the centre-left former prime minister Matteo Renzi, on Facebook.The Facebook data, which captured the engagement metrics on thousands of posts by the six major party leaders in the two months leading up to the election, was collected by academics at the University of Pisa’s MediaLab.It reveals all of the 25 most shared Facebook posts in the two months leading up to the election were videos, live broadcasts or photos from either Salvini, who runs the far-right League, or Di Maio, the leader of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S).The pair, who were rivals during the election but have since become deputy prime ministers in a power-sharing coalition, dominated Facebook traffic with viral videos and personal, off-the-cuff live broadcasts. Salvini and Di Maio also secured about 7.8m Facebook likes and shares each during the two-month campaign.Their nearest rival on Facebook was Giorgia Meloni, the leader of the small populist far-right party Brothers of Italy, whose posts secured 2.6m Facebook likes and shares. Renzi, who posted more text-based updates than any other politician, secured just 1.5m likes and shares.The least effective on Facebook were the former prime minster Silvio Berlusconi and the leftwing politician Pietro Grasso.Prof Gianpietro Mazzoleni, of the University of Milan, who was involved in the Facebook research, said it was common for populist politicians to exploit social media, particularly during the “insurgent phase” of their rise, when they may struggle to get the attention of TV broadcasters and newspapers. “You can speak to the people’s guts on social media much better than on big media,” he said.Salvini, whose Facebook audience of 3.4 million is larger than for any other politician in Europe, amassed the largest total of likes and shares for videos and live broadcasts. The far-right leader has intensified his use of social media since becoming Italy’s interior minister, using the platform to exploit tensions over immigration, publish reported “hate lists” of his enemies and provide Italians with a running commentary on his personal and family life.Salvini’s most popular election video, according to the analysis, was a clip from a European parliamentary speech he incorrectly claimed had been “censored” by the mainstream media. “Be warned,” he says in the clip, “over the last few years Italy has taken in 600,000 fake refugees, not escaping war but bringing war here.”Di Maio’s videos, by comparison, strike a different tone, railing against negative media coverage or political corruption, and they appear to have been widely disseminated by M5S’s young, loyal and digitally active voter base.Only one Facebook post in the top 25 in the dataset was posted by Renzi. It stands apart from his typical updates on Facebook: posted after a long day on the campaign trail, it is an amateurish photo of a birthday cake that his family had baked him and left on a table. Renzi’s caption said: “How nice: life is bigger than politics!” It gained more than 63,000 likes and shares.In an interview with the  in October, Renzi said social media had transformed politics, inflaming passions while simultaneously making voters demand a more responsive kind of politics. “Everything is different,” he said. “The citizens are angry, but social media makes you think: ‘OK the prime minister is exactly at my table.’” He added: “At the same time nothing changes, so there is frustration.”Salvini in particular proved adept at exploiting that frustration through Facebook live videos such as one broadcast from a wall opposite a migrant holding centre. “They want to eat well and be at peace, and who pays for them?” he says. “We do.” In another, broadcast from inside a moving car, Salvini complains about a national song contest that featured lyrics about political refugees over “those who were born here”.Dr Paolo Gerbaudo, from King’s College London, said of Salvini’s use of live video: “He does live streams almost every day, on the roofs of apartment blocks or on the streets in urban areas where he is himself holding the camera – as anyone would do – and that gives a sense of authenticity,” he said.He said Di Maio’s focus on Facebook tallied with the strategic approach of the M5S, which was founded by the comedian and blogger Beppe Grillo and “defined itself from the start as an internet party”.There is growing academic interest in the relationship between social media and populist movements on both the left and right. Facebook and Twitter have transformed western democracies, enabling politicians to bypass traditional gatekeepers and communicate directly with their base.Some political scientists argue they systematically encourage the kind of simplified, isive and caustic rhetoric populists often employ. There is particular concern in Brazil and India about the Facebook-owned messaging service WhatsApp, which has enabled the dissemination of viral fake news stories behind an encrypted firewall.In France, the anti-establishment gilets jaunes movement that has rocked the presidency of Emmanuel Macron has been orchestrated via Facebook. Some researchers claim an algorithmic change enacted by the social media company last January to combat fake news and downgrade news content had the unintended consequence of fuelling protests.Olivier Ertzscheid, a researcher at the University of Nantes, said Facebook’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, hoped the algorithmic change would create “a new social infrastructure to bring people closer to their elected politicians and to allow people to become more involved in the political decisions of their country. The way the gilets jaunes movement was built in France shows that on this point of his strategy, he was absolutely right – it has fuelled the fire.”Additional reporting by Patrick Wintour"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5022fb5ad697e158e8cf4c90666ed8288beb0c7e/16_0_5251_3152/master/5251.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f356789a1173f7af1a29c92f6779d40","title":"saudi arabia reject us senate interference khashoggi yemen","story":"Senate resolution ‘contained blatant interferences’ in the kingdom’s internal affairs, lengthy statement saysSaudi Arabia has issued an unusually strong rebuke of the US Senate, rejecting a bipartisan resolution that put the blame for the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi squarely on the Saudi crown prince and describing it as interference in the kingdom’s affairs.It was the latest sign of how the relationship between the royal court and Congress has deteriorated, more than two months after Khashoggi was killed and dismembered by Saudi agents inside the kingdom’s consulate in Istanbul. The assassins have been linked to Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman.On Thursday US senators passed the measure that blamed the prince for Khashoggi’s killing and called on Riyadh to “ensure appropriate accountability”. Senators also passed a separate measure calling for the end of US aid to the Saudi-led war in Yemen.In a lengthy statement early on Monday, Saudi Arabia said the Senate’s resolution “contained blatant interferences” in the kingdom’s internal affairs and undermines its regional and international role. The resolution was based on “unsubstantiated claims and allegations,” the statement also said.“The kingdom categorically rejects any interference in its internal affairs, any and all accusations, in any manner, that disrespect its leadership ... and any attempts to undermine its sovereignty or diminish its stature,” it said.Such language is usually reserved for those who criticise the kingdom’s human rights record, such as Sweden in 2015 after the public flogging of a blogger, and Canada this year over the arrests of women’s rights activists.Bu the statement was also tempered in saying the kingdom “reaffirms” its commitment to relations with the United States and describing the Senate as “an esteemed legislative body of an allied and friendly government”. Donald Trump has been reluctant to condemn the crown prince, despite US intelligence officials concluding that Prince Mohammed must have at least had knowledge of the plot. Trump instead has touted Saudi arms deals worth billions of dollars and has thanked the Saudis for lower oil prices.Saudi Arabia denies Prince Mohammed was involved in the 2 October killing of Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist who wrote critically of the crown prince. Under intense international pressure, the kingdom recently acknowledged that the plot was masterminded by top Saudi agents close to Prince Mohammed.After shifting accounts about what happened to Khashoggi, Saudi Arabia said its investigations concluded that the crown prince’s aides had plotted to bring Khashoggi by force back to Saudi Arabia and that the agents on the ground exceeded their authority and killed him.The Saudi statement said the Senate’s position will not affects the kingdom’s “leading role in the region” and the stability of international energy markets, its counterterrorism cooperation and its stand with the US in confronting Iran.It “sends the wrong messages to all those who want to cause a rift in Saudi-US relationship,” the statement added."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5d0946484363a0057c304fc4220a53da195396b/0_0_3444_2067/master/3444.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e3bb3932c75ef8faae3e83450fcb058f","title":"vladimir putin calendar sells out in japan","story":"Chain with exclusive rights to Russian president’s 2019 offering says it is more popular than those featuring homegrown celebritiesWhether he’s nonchalantly lowering himself into the icy waters of Lake Seliger or making short work of weights in the gym, Vladimir Putin is setting pulses racing in Japan, where his latest calendar is outselling those featuring homegrown celebrities.The Loft chainstore, which has exclusive rights over sales of the calendar, reported that those featuring Russia’s 66-year-old president were dominating sales at its outlets across Japan.With just two weeks of the year left, Putin’s calendars were more popular than those of Japanese actor Kei Tanaka and, in third place, Yuzuru Hanyu, the reigning Olympic men’s figure skating champion.SoraNews24 speculated that while some people were snapping up the Putin calendars as a “sort of practical joke,” others were genuinely interested in the his life and persona away from the Kremlin.This isn’t the first time Putin’s testosterone-drenched calendars have proved a hit with Japanese consumers in the run-up to the New Year.His 2017 calendar featured photos of playing in the snow with his dogs, including an Akita Inu puppy – a gift from the governor of Akita prefecture in northern Japan to thank Russia for its help after the March 2011 triple disaster.In 2016, the first year the officially sanctioned calendars went on sale in Japan, Putin was shown fishing – again shirtless – and practicing judo.Media reports in Japan suggested many of the people buying the calendars, including a large number of women, were drawn to Putin’s unconventional style and unashamed machismo.It wasn’t clear how Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, feels about his Russian counterpart’s celebrity.

Photograph: Bryan O’BrienThe pressure of the Leaving Cert is causing stress, burnout and mental health problems among students, according to an official review of senior cycle education in secondary schools.The findings are contained in an Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) report based on consultations by the State’s advisory body on the school curriculum with students, teachers and parents across more than 40 post-primary schools.Students interviewed expressed frustration and concern about the squeeze on their time during the senior cycle when they were trying to complete homework, study, take part in sport and do part-time work.Others said it had “crushed their creativity” because the exams rewarded rote learning and suited those who could “ learn and regurgitate things on a page”.Many said they were forced to give up sport, while some complained of sleep disruption and not having time to meet friends.The report’s findings will inform the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment’s (NCCA) review of senior cycle education.The first cycle of process has looked at teacher, parent and student perspectives on the purpose of senior cycle.Among teachers, the main themes to emerge were how time pressure was leading to rote learning, “teaching to the test” and a negative impact on student motivation and stress levels.This time pressure, coupled with the high stakes nature of the exams, was seen as fuelling “teaching to the test” as teachers aimed to ensure that students were prepared for the exam.Staff in girls’ schools were more likely to emphasise the effects of the current system on rote learning, most likely reflecting the greater prevalence of exam-related stress found among girls.“The large number of students who undertake grinds in multiple subjects is giving rise to ‘burnout’ and mental health problems,” one teacher said.“The need for such grinds stems from fear of underachieving on the day and a pressure from friends to do more and more. What a student does in school is never seen as enough.”On the question of how the system could be changed, many students said they should have fewer subjects and greater subject choice that suited their abilities.Irish was the subject most often mentioned during the discussion of whether any subjects should be compulsory. They also supported a change from the high-stakes model of exams to broader forms of assessment, in line with junior cycle reforms.Career guidance was viewed both as a positive and as a challenge in the system. Many suggested more support may be needed and routes other than higher education should be given greater emphasis.Despite the challenges of the current system, students and teachers found there were also positives.The objective, fair and highly regarded nature of the exam system was mentioned, as was the high quality of teaching staff, mature relationships with teachers and motivational teachers.Transition year, in particular, was a source of positive comment such as work experience opportunities and links with the local community and businesses.The review of the senior cycle is due to continue in the coming year when schools reflect on the extent to which the system provides pathways for further learning such as higher education, further education and apprenticeships.There will be further national seminars and an overview report making suggestions drawn from findings to date will be made.Students, teachers and parents are being invited to join the conversation on the future of the Leaving Cert by visiting the NCCA’s website or by emailing (seniorcycle@ncca.ie)."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3733412.1544998616!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"limited progress after two weeks of katowice climate talks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tStaff workers take  stands apart before the end of the final session of the COP24 summit on climate change in Katowice, Poland, on December 15th. Photograph: Janek Skarzynski The backdrop coming into the UN annual climate summit was dire from where the world is at in responding to global warming to scientific indications of how climate breakdown looms on the horizon.Three years after the optimism of Paris, the world was in a darker place having reached a point where most of its 7.6 billion people are probably aware by now of the risks they face from climate change due to more severe and more frequent floods, droughts and wildfires. Global carbon emissions are on the rise, especially in the US and China, the world’s largest economies – with evidence of other countries backsliding on their commitments under the historic 2015 Paris Agreement. All that did not help the mood. As politicians and diplomats met in Katowice, Poland, seeking to sign off on a guidebook to bring the deal into effect from 2020, the days of commitments under the agreement being only as good as the willingness of national leaders to keep their word were due to come to an end. If that is delivered on in the next two short years based on what was agreed, COP24 can then be considered a success.The end of the first week was a low point marked by a political stalemate when big oil and gas producer countries led by the US and Saudi Arabia refused to “welcome” the latest findings of the UN’s climate science body, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate change. IPCC chair Hoesung Lee was to later to underline its significance that the temperature goal (containing global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees) is achievable “but that this can only happen if governments take urgent and far-reaching action in all aspects of society, with many implications for policymaking”.UN general-secretary António Guterres attempted to reset the agenda going into the final days: “To waste this opportunity in Katowice would compromise our last best chance to stop runaway climate change. It would not only be immoral, it would be suicidal.”Coming into the final stretch, Xie Zhenhua, China’s senior climate official, warned negotiations were “deadlocked” in critical areas, and urged the US to return to the process and “use its leadership”. By the last official day of negotiations, there was still no resolution in sight for critical issues such as financing for developing countries’ climate efforts – though some progress on this was achieved by close of business. But an obvious alliance between the EU and China (especially on having a common rulebook) was coming good in getting a deal of significance over the line. While an earlier side meeting with US officials delivering the usual pro-coal line from Trump-generated headlines, concerns that the US would be hostile in the negotiation rooms proved mostly unfounded – the state department was a constructive force. Beside China, the US oversaw the drafting of the rules governing transparency, a central aspect of the rulebook. An absence of the heavyweight political presence of France, Germany and the UK due to domestic factors was evident throughout the two weeks. It was a row over carbon credits awarded to countries for their emissions-cutting efforts and their carbon sinks, such as carbon-absorbing forests, that was the big stumbling block, forcing talks into the weekend. Credits count towards countries’ emissions-cutting targets. Brazil, hoping to benefit from its large rainforest cover, repeatedly sought a new wording, which environmental NGOs insisted would allow double counting of credits, undermining the integrity of the system. A package of rules on trading carbon credits across borders was deferred to 2019, after a standoff between Brazil and a coalition of European and climate-vulnerable countries. Ireland consistently supported EU moves to ensure greater transparency and better reporting mechanisms for accounting of national greenhouse gas commitments. It helped strengthen “capacity building”, an essential climate action in developing countries. The Republic did not join the 27 countries who have formed the Coalition for Higher Ambition, who committed to scaling up commitments in line to Paris targets during the COP. Minister for Climate Action Richard Bruton flagged to NGOs he met in Katowice that Irish climate commitments would be made when he was sure they could be delivered on.Ireland did, however, join an initiative with eight other EU countries to work together on establishing a carbon floor price. The signatories believe carbon pricing, with supporting policies and measures to send a clear long-term signal to markets by incentivising cost-effect reductions in carbon emissions – and in turn disincentivising new investments in carbon-intensive technologies. They have endorsed the need for a just transition and the creation of high-value jobs in low-carbon sectors.Lead negotiator Patricia Espinosa, executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, believes the rulebook is the basis for a transformative process which will require strengthened ambition from the international community. “Science has clearly shown that we need enhanced ambition to defeat climate change.”Whether the response matches what the science says the world needs to do over the next decade is already being widely challenged by climatologists, environmental economists and NGOS.There is clearly insufficient progress on persuading countries to make firm commitments to cut their emissions further than they have already promised. COP24, none the less, has produced a common rulebook with most elements underpinned by clarity after achieving consensus among 195 states. The greater ambition and urgency desperately sought by so many outside the talks remains elusive.

Photograph: Karolina JonderkoThe New York TimesScientists have warned that a new plan to implement the Paris Agreement on climate change and cutting carbon emissions across the world is not sufficient given the challenges facing the planet.A UN summit in Katowice, Poland, signed off on a new rulebook that will come into force in 2020. How inidual governments should scale up their efforts to reduce emissions was left unresolved.Johan Rockstrom, director of Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, said his biggest concern was that “the UN talks failed to align ambitions with science”.“We continue to follow a path that will take us to a very dangerous 3-4 degrees warmer world within this century. Extreme weather events hit people across the planet already, at only 1 degree of warming.”Prof John Sweeney, an Irish climatologist who was an observer at the talks, said the outcome lacked urgency given the findings of the recent UN report.While elements of the rulebook were welcome, he said there was an overall lack of ambition which “set back the process by a few years in terms of co-operation”.Minister for Climate Action Richard Bruton said progress would have to reported across the board in a consistent manner.“Of particular importance is the agreement of the rulebook which will ensure that all countries are reporting progress in a consistent and transparent manner,” he said.The gavel came down late on Saturday after two weeks of negotiations.Xie Zhenhua, China’s climate chief, welcomed the deal. “Climate change is the greatest challenge of mankind, in front of it no country is spared, and destinies are shared.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3733209.1544984478!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"what is in paris agreement rulebook forged at katowice","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA delicate balance was struck at the summit between concerns of the smallest, poorest and most vulnerable countries and  the developed nations most responsible for global warming. Photograph: EPAShahzaib AkberThe Katowice summit has yielded a common rulebook that will apply across the world on implementing the historic Paris Agreement on climate change, including greater transparency on efforts to reduce carbon emissions contributing to global warming.Parties agreed to revise and enhance their commitments in the form of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) before 2020, according to the 156-page rulebook. They must outline mitigation and adaptation measures as well as details of financial support for climate action in developing countries. Parties agree how to undertake a “global stocktake” of the effectiveness of climate action in 2023, and how to assess progress. Discussions on robust measures to ensure that countries are held to proper standards and find it harder to wriggle out of commitments dominated the final stages.As current pledges are not enough to limit warming to a 1.5 degrees and to achieve the pact’s goals, countries must commit to greater levels of climate action and support and follow through on those commitments.The main issues to be resolved concern the use of cooperative approaches contained in the agreement’s Article 6. In short, it hinges around carbon trading. Countries were expected to agree rules to ensure they do not double count emissions reductions when one country is allowed to pay another to lower emissions but count those lower emissions towards their own emissions. Resistance, by Brazil in particular, meant sign-off proved impossible. The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change “1.5 degree” report was the scientific backdrop to much of the negotiations but its stark findings led to a political standoff. Alarmed by efforts to include it in the final text, some oil-exporting countries blocked an endorsement. That prompted uproar from vulnerable countries and environmental groups.The final text omits a previous reference to specific reductions in emissions by 2030, and merely welcomes the “timely completion” of the IPCC report not its conclusions. A delicate balance was struck between concerns of the smallest, poorest and most vulnerable countries the developed nations most responsible for global warming and the emerging economies wary of being saddled with a bigger burden to act. A process for establishing new targets on finance from 2025 onwards to follow-on from the current target of mobilising $100 billion per year from 2020 to support developing countries was agreed. The text urges developed country parties to channel more grant-based resources for adaptation to climate change as against loans.There is some acknowledgment of the long-standing “loss and damage” issue notably how to provide financial support to countries whose economies are too vulnerable to cope with the impact of climate change.

Photograph: Philip ToscanoAFPGetty The Government will spell out for the first time this week some of the “uncomfortable” realities the State will have to address in the event of a no-deal Brexit in March. The latest Government contingency plan, to be released on Thursday, will focus for the first time on the possibility of a “no deal” Brexit instead of the UK having a managed EU departure, which had previously been expected. The document will be published as part of a sequence co-ordinated with the European Commission, which will issue an updated Brexit contingency bulletin on Wednesday. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, Tánaiste Simon Coveney and general secretary to the Government Martin Fraser were finalising the document over the weekend and it will come before the Cabinet for approval on Tuesday. While neither the Government nor the commission document will outline in any huge detail the nature of the “fixes” to be put in place in the event of a no-deal Brexit, Government sources said there would be “new information and it’s going to be uncomfortable”. The Government document is expected to focus on expanded checks in Irish ports, as well as an increase in veterinary checks. The rationale underlying this approach, sources said, is that despite the continuing impasse over the Northern Ireland backstop, a deal is still possible. Setting out “fixes” for a no-deal scenario would not be considered helpful to the discussions, as it would create “hostages to fortunes” to be seized upon by those unhappy with the withdrawal agreement, one source said. The commission has been holding seminars on key sectors for all 27 member states since the middle of November on issues such as financial services, intellectual property, company law and consumer protection, transportation and customs. Once the round of briefings has concluded in mid-January, the commission is expected to publish a large tranche of papers outlining the full scope of its response to the post-Brexit situation. At its Cabinet meeting last Tuesday, the Government moved its default planning mode from a “central case” scenario – where the UK left with a deal – to a no-deal case. Departments will have to move more quickly to put their contingencies in place because in that scenario there will be no transition or buffer period after March 29th. Fianna Fáil Brexit spokeswoman Lisa Chambers criticised the lack of information disclosed by the Government on a no-deal situation and suggested its planning could be lagging behind. “We need to fast-track our responses. I have been asking the Tánaiste for weeks to come before the possibilities but he has not done so,” she said. “What is ‘Plan B’? What are we going to do if there’s a hard Brexit?”A Government spokesman said most focus would be on Brussels over the coming week, revolving on talks about clarification on the “backstop” between EU and UK officials. “Irish officials will of course be consulted but the discussions are between the EU and London,” said the spokesman. A General Affairs Council meeting of foreign ministers has been scheduled for Wednesday with a view to discussing article 50, which provides the mechanism to give legal effect to the Brexit decision. However, the meeting looked less likely to happen as of Sunday night because of the political impasse. Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

They even show fine details of pigment granules, which may have given the fluffy feathers a ginger colour.”According to Dr McNamara, “this discovery has amazing implications for our understanding of the origin of feathers, but also for a major time of revolution of life on land. When feathers arose, about 250 million years ago, life was recovering from the devastating end-Permian mass extinction.”Independent evidence shows that land vertebrates, including the ancestors of mammals and dinosaurs, were beginning to walk upright, had acquired different degrees of warm-bloodedness, and were generally living life at a faster pace.The mammal ancestors by then had hair, so likely the pterosaurs, dinosaurs and relatives had also acquired feathers to help insulate them.Independent evidence shows that land vertebrates, including the ancestors of mammals and dinosaurs, were beginning to walk upright, had acquired different degrees of warm-bloodedness, and were generally living life at a faster pace.The mammal ancestors by then had hair, so likely the pterosaurs, dinosaurs and relatives had also acquired feathers to help insulate them, she explained.Dr McNamara says the hunt for feathers in fossils is heating up and deciphering their functions in such early animals forms a critical part of the puzzle.“It could rewrite our understanding of a major revolution in life on Earth during the Triassic, and our understanding of the genomic regulation of feathers, scales, and hairs in the skin. ”Zixiao Yang and Baoyu Jiang, of Nanjing University, studied the rocks from the Daohugou fossil localities and the pterosaurs.They said they were able to explore every corner of the specimens using high-powered microscopes, and found many examples of all four feathers.UCD’s professor Patrick Orr and professor Mike Benton from the University of Bristol were also involved in the study.“We ran some evolutionary analyses, and they showed clearly that the pterosaur pycnofibres are feathers, just like those seen in modern birds and across various dinosaur groups,” said professor Benton.“Because the structures in the pterosaurs have the same anatomy as the feathers of birds and dinosaurs, they must share an evolutionary origin about 250 million years ago, long before the origin of birds.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3733389.1544996539!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit second referendum would further divide uk may to tell commons","story":"UK trade minister Liam Fox says talks with the EU to secure assurances for parliament on Theresa May\u0027s Brexit deal will take time, with a decision expected in the New Year.\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTheresa May is to say on Monday: ‘Let us not break faith with the British people by trying to stage another referendum.’ Photographer: Jasper JuinenBloombergA second referendum on Brexit would ide Britain further and damage beyond repair the integrity of its politics, Theresa May will tell the House of Commons on Tuesday. But with no majority for the prime minister’s Brexit deal, a number of cabinet ministers have suggested that MPs should have an “indicative vote” on alternative options.Downing Street on Sunday dismissed reports that some of Mrs May’s most senior aides were consulting with opposition MPs on the prospect of a second referendum. And in a statement on Monday about last week’s EU summit, the prime minister will argue that a second vote would betray the 2016 referendum.“Let us not break faith with the British people by trying to stage another referendum. Another vote which would do irreparable damage to the integrity of our politics, because it would say to millions who trusted in democracy, that our democracy does not deliver. Another vote which would likely leave us no further forward than the last. And another vote which would further ide our country at the very moment we should be working to unite it,” she will say.EU leaders last week rejected Mrs May’s request for a legally binding assurance about the temporary nature of the Northern Ireland backstop. They said the legally binding withdrawal agreement, which includes the backstop, cannot be renegotiated but left open the option of a further clarification of its meaning.The prime minister last week postponed a vote on the Brexit deal because it faced certain defeat as Conservative Brexiteers and the DUP have said they will join opposition MPs to vote against it. International trade secretary Liam Fox on Sunday became the first Brexiteer in Mrs May’s cabinet to endorse an indicative vote by MPs on a range of Brexit options.“Personally I wouldn’t have a huge problem with parliament as a whole having a say on what the options were. When you look at the options that we have, we have got to recognise that there are a limited number of real world options here,” he told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show.Education secretary Damian Hinds said he was open to “flushing out” different options in Parliament, a proposal that has the support of a number of Remainer cabinet ministers. The alternatives to Mrs May’s deal most discussed at Westminster are “Norway-plus”, which would keep Britain in the single market and the customs union a second referendum or leaving the EU without a deal.Foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt, who campaigned against Brexit in the 2016 referendum, said on Sunday that Britain would flourish even if it left with no deal. In an interview with the Sunday , he said he would like to succeed Mrs May as prime minister after she has navigated Brexit through the next few months.“I think every MP has a corner of their heart that says they would like to have a crack at the top job. I’m no different. But I think the first thing is to get us through this challenging next few months and I passionately believe Theresa May is the right person to do that,” he said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination.

The bin is lifted onto the vehicle and given a thorough shake in order to get all of the rubbish out.If the resident has compacted their rubbish to such an extent that some has become wedged in, or put something in that has prevented other rubbish from coming out, it is their responsibility to resolve this so that the collection can take place on the next occasion.The bin crews have rounds to complete and it is not practical for them to take a stick and prod away at someone\u0027s rubbish to try and loosen it up each time it has been compacted in so tightly at the bottom of the bin.Please review our commenting policyBrexit latest news: Greg Clark refuses to rule out a second referendum as Amber Rudd says that \u0026#39nothing should be off the table\u0026#39What is the Brexit backstop, and why has it delayed the vote in Parliament?Greek PM condemns Athens bomb on TV station as \u0026#39attack on democracy\u0026#39Netanyahu\u0026#39s son suspended from Facebook after suggesting all Muslims should leave IsraelFront Bench Analysis: The four options open to the Prime Minister and why none really workCanada gains consular access to men detained by China as Trudeau criticises arrestsComment: The failure to train teachers how to keep control puts the future of our schools at riskBritain\u0026#39s asylum dispersal system at risk as councils threaten to quit, warn MPsDid my bride have a porn past?

Flight attendants told them that under aviation laws, the entire flight would have to disembark and go through security screening once again, which would delay the flight significantly.Members of South Korean music band Wanna One pose for photos on the red carpet of the Mnet Asian Music Awards (MAMA) in Hong KongThe fans were adamant, however, and rubbed salt into the airline’s wound by demanding full refunds of their tickets, to which they were entitled under Korean Air’s refund policies as they had paid the full purchase prices. The 360 passengers aboard the flight were required to leave the aircraft with their luggage and complete security screening procedures once again, which delayed the flight by more than one hour. As a result of the delay, Korea Air was also obliged to compensate the remaining passengers.Korean Air could not be contacted for a comment on the incident, although media have reported that the airline asked Hong Kong police to investigate the matter.The authorities declined to open an investigation, however, as they have not received any complaints from other passengers that the three fans caused any material damage. Please review our commenting policyBrexit latest news: Greg Clark refuses to rule out a second referendum as Amber Rudd says that \u0026#39nothing should be off the table\u0026#39What is the Brexit backstop, and why has it delayed the vote in Parliament?Greek PM condemns Athens bomb on TV station as \u0026#39attack on democracy\u0026#39Netanyahu\u0026#39s son suspended from Facebook after suggesting all Muslims should leave IsraelFront Bench Analysis: The four options open to the Prime Minister and why none really workCanada gains consular access to men detained by China as Trudeau criticises arrestsComment: The failure to train teachers how to keep control puts the future of our schools at riskBritain\u0026#39s asylum dispersal system at risk as councils threaten to quit, warn MPsDid my bride have a porn past?

That Mike Ashley. Has the FT taken leave of its senses? The same title that exposed the scandal of the macho bad behaviour surrounding the Presidents Club dinner now praising the business boss who vomited into a fireplace after consuming 12 pints in a pub during a management meeting?Actually, the FT is right. The source of the applause was the memo Ashley sent to the Debenhams board, expressing anger at their refusal of a £40m interest-free loan and equity injection from his Sports Direct chain, the department store group’s biggest shareholder. In no uncertain terms, Ashley maps out the lie of the land for the Debenhams directors. It’s not pretty: “November was the worst November for retailers in living memory the market is saying Debenhams has no credit insurance advisers and banks are telling suppliers they should not trade with the firm at a level above which they can afford to lose suppliers are managing themselves out of stores product is being discounted to try and realise some cash.” And, says Ashley, with a final flourish: “Additionally, it is speculated that the company currently has a zero chance of survival.”Sports Direct boss issues warning to Debenhams in leaked letterCan Mike Ashley turn around the high street when no one else is tryingMike Ashley tells MPs: ‘The internet is killing the high street’Mike Ashley ‘demands’ meeting with MPs to discuss high street crisisPhew. That’s telling them. And that’s the point. Because too few senior business people tell it how it is, for fear of provoking upset and spoiling relationships. Too many of their advisers seek to please, not help. The result is that they carry on existing in a bubble. Decisions that should be taken aren’t, boards do not confront reality, and instead, carry on their sweet way. Opportunities to act, to do something, are lost, with the result that when the C-suite does decide to move it’s often too late. For injecting a dose of reality into proceedings, and, hopefully, making the Debenhams top brass sit up and see sense, Ashley deserves much credit. At the very least, they cannot maintain they were not made aware. His straight-talking is commendable and authoritative – Ashley, don’t forget, is immersed in retail, and is grappling on a daily basis with the same landscape that is confronting Debenhams.It would be disastrous if the time-honoured establishment reaction to the likes of Ashley, of labelling him as an upstart, as someone not to be taken seriously, was pursuedIt’s Ashley as well, as the head of an empire that along with Sports Direct includes lingerie firm Agent Provocateur, Evans Cycles, luxury fashion chain Flannels, the House of Fraser department stores, and major holdings in Debenhams and French Connection, who is warning loudly about the dire future facing the high street. Rising rents and growing popularity of online shopping paint a bleak prospect, one that he says could be improved by a tax on firms who generate 20 per cent of their revenues from the internet.As with Debenhams, Ashley does not pull his punches, telling MPs, the high street is heading for extinction\u0026nbspunless radical action was taken and warning them: “I’m not Father Christmas.”I never imagined I’d write this: we need more Mike Ashleys. Not the bad boy Ashley, but the one who is prepared to speak out, to stand up and to be counted.What’s striking is just how few major retailers are prepared to voice their fears and frustrations. We’re entering a season of renewed woe in the industry, of yet more dismal sets of results and closures – but the silence, the sense of inertia, will be resounding.In private, they’re all complaining and moaning like mad. But, hidebound by conservatism, afraid of rocking the boat, of drawing attention to themselves and somehow being seen as in trouble, they’re saying very little in public.The result is that it’s not just the directors of Debenhams who are able to kid themselves, but trade associations, industry organisations, MPs, media, councils, landlords, trade unions. They, along with the retailers, should all be campaigning to save our high streets, highlighting the imbalance between digital and bricks and mortar, pointing up the ridiculous nature of the business rates system, stating categorically that thousands of jobs are going to perish – not to mention the knock-on effects to communities.There’s a bit of noise, but it’s scattergun, and nowhere near concerted or loud enough. The fact it’s fallen to Ashley to say something, speaks volumes.All credit to him, though. Of course he’s got a vested interest, as he has in Debenhams. But if he does not protest, who will? Hopefully, the directors of Debenhams will wake up, along with the MPs he was addressing.It would be disastrous if the time-honoured establishment reaction to the likes of Ashley, of labelling him as an upstart, as someone not to be taken seriously, was pursued. The time for retreating into the bunker, and hoping the danger will pass, has gone. The Debenhams board must act, and act now.

It’s named after the Gemini constellationThe\u0026nbspGeminids’ name is no accident: once it enters Earth’s atmosphere, the meteor shower seems to be coming from the Gemini constellation.In order to spot the\u0026nbspGeminid\u0026nbspmeteor shower, you should thus be looking towards the Gemini constellation, which is well positioned from\u0026nbsp10pm, the American Meteor Society explained.This gives the\u0026nbspGeminids\u0026nbspa rare status as a major shower experiencing significant activity before midnight.4. It’s also linked to a Greek godSo what exactly causes the\u0026nbspGeminid meteor shower? A celestial object called 3200\u0026nbspPhatheon\u0026nbsp– which is also the son of the solar deity Helios in Greek mythology.It belongs to the Apollo asteroid group, an ensemble of near-Earth asteroids.As 3200\u0026nbspPhatheon, it is followed by a trail of debris. Earth passes through its trail each year, resulting in the display.5. As many as 100 shooting stars are expected to light up the skyThe\u0026nbspGeminids\u0026nbsphave an hourly rate of 120, the highest listed on the American Meteor Society’s calendar for meteor showers.This means more than 100 shooting stars should appear – though\u0026nbspNASA\u0026nbspcalls the figure a “theoretical maximum” and warns that it represents the experience of a “perfect observer” gifted with “perfect skies”.People residing in suburbs can still expect to see about 30 or 40 meteors per hour, and those living in darker areas on the countryside will be able to spot a bit more than one shooting star per minute.Bad news for people in large cities such as New York or San Francisco: they will see “practically nothing” due to light pollution, the agency warned.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Or is it an unworkable left-wing fantasy? Ben Chu investigatesClick to followThe IndependentShadow chancellor John McDonnell (right) has suggested Labour could include a pledge to reduce the working week in its next manifestoAs a society we can’t seem to make up our minds about work. Do we want more of it? Or less?There’s a chilling fog of fear over what technological advances will mean for our jobs, with an endless supply of alarming forecasts about how robots and algorithms are set to displace human workers.But there’s also a furnace of angst about low productivity and under-investment by firms in just the kind of innovations that induce those nightmares of a “jobs apocalypse”.Boss wants to make four-day working week trial permanentSome lament the supposed proliferation of pointless, soul-dismantling, “bullshit jobs”. Yet no one gets out the bunting when a struggling company announces redundancies.The UK’s official labour market surveys suggest\u0026nbspmany of us want fewer hours at work, presumably driven by a desire for a healthier “work-life balance”.Yet those same surveys also show that many people also want more hours, that the post-financial crisis curse of “underemployment” has not yet been lifted.Some complain about the raising of the state retirement age and the depressing prospect of being forced to work longer than they planned. But for others the big problem is ageism, the risk of being pressured out of jobs they enjoy prematurely.When it comes to work, we’re rather like those two diners in the Catskill mountains: “Boy, the food at this place is really terrible... Yeah, I know and such small portions.”Yet onto this terrain of confusion and apparent contradiction some stride confidently.To Alex Williams, a Corbynite academic, automation should be embraced by the left as the emancipation of labour, provided the gains are comprehensively redistributed.The Trades Union Congress seems to have been influenced by this cocktail of technological optimism and socialist assertion. Its general secretary\u0026nbspFrances O’Grady\u0026nbsprecently demanded a four-day week by the end of the century, declaring: “Bosses and shareholders must not be allowed to hoover up all the gains from new tech for themselves.”The Labour Party is keen too. The shadow chancellor John McDonnell has made favourable noises about the four-day week and is reported to be asking the crossbench peer, Robert Skidelsky, to head an inquiry into the subject.Yet this isn’t just a British story. There are tectonic rumblings from abroad too. The IG Metall union in Germany earlier this year won the right to a four-day week for its almost 900,000 members. One technology start-up, founded by former Google employees, has a “Free Friday” policy. Even a think tank close to the authorities in China has called for the most populous nation on the planet to have a four-day working week as soon as 2030.Any project that can unite German metal bashers, Silicon Valley coders and Chinese Communist apparatchiks clearly has an unusually wide appeal.So is the four-day week a big idea whose time has come? Or is it an unworkable left-wing fantasy? And even if a four-day week is economically feasible, should we really desire it? Or is it a case of being careful what you wish for?When Marei Wollersberger and her colleagues established an east London-based data design agency, Normally, as a four-day week operation in 2014, the motivation was largely personal.“We wanted to lead happier lives basically – enjoy ourselves more, not just to defer our enjoyment to retirement age,” she told me.But there was another goal: “There was also a motivation to be more productive.”The economics of the four-day week revolve around the concept of productivity, the amount we produce per hour worked.The size of the economy – the size of our national income – is derived from the value of all the goods and services produced by businesses and households.On the face of it, if we all worked one less day a week, our personal output would drop by around fifth. Multiply that fall across the overall economy and you’ve got an economy that is considerably smaller, implying lower income and lower living standards for all, one way or another.Yet what if working fewer hours were to stimulate our productivity? What if we produced more per hour working four days than we did per hour working five?In that case there might be no overall drop in total output, and therefore no decrease in living standards. If our productivity rose enough we might even have a higher income than we did before.Wollersberger says the model has worked in stimulating performance at her company. “You’re more productive – you achieve exactly the same or more in four days as you would in five,” she says. “And I honestly believe it’s better work.”\u0026nbspA New Zealand financial firm called Perpetual  found similarly gratifying results when it trialled a four-day week recently.“There was broadly no change in company outputs pre and during the trial,” said its boss. “No reduction in job performance and the survey data showed a marginal increase across most teams.”Created with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

Flybe said it cancelled 994 flights in the three months to 31 March, compared to 372 in the same period last year.Bear in mind that no change in output despite a fifth less time at work implies a stunning increase in productivity.But beware cherry-picking. The results of a Swedish trial involving 70 nurses working a six-hour day were more mixed. While there was some boost to worker productivity, the city of Gothenburg also had to hire more nurses to cover the hours lost.Intuitively, this seems much more likely to be the result of moving to a four-day week in services sectors that are, currently at least, heavily reliant on face-to-face human interactions such as healthcare or teaching.That’s not to imply the shift in working patterns should be ruled out as impractical. There are benefits in terms of lower stress and happiness to set against those financial costs. But it’s probably unrealistic to expect the move to always pay for itself, at least in the short-term.And some experiments have flopped. Treehouse, an online educational firm in Oregon, was one of those companies which got media publicity for its four-day week in 2015. But Treehouse’s founder recently lamented that the working practice killed the work ethic in his company and called the experiment a “terrible thing”.The only way is down?Inidual “micro” trials are certainly useful, but they aren’t necessarily a reliable guide to “macro” economic impacts.The closest thing that we have to a state-mandated four-day week is France’s 35-hour week, introduced in 2000 under the Jacques Chirac-Lionel Jospin cohabitation.Jospin\u0026nbsp(left) and president Jaques Chirac (right) (AFPGetty)The first thing to bear in mind is that this does not mean all French people work a four-day week. The regulation simply means overtime kicks in after a worker has completed 35 hours and they accrue the right to holiday lieu days. Yet it does establish a social norm of fewer hours and a financial incentive for firms to limit them.Opinions are mixed about its results. France has a high unemployment rate relative to the UK and other developed countries and it’s notable that Emmanuel Macron campaigned for president promising to increase the flexibility of the system.And though the level of French productivity stands comparison with the most productive nations in the world, there’s no evidence that its growth rate has risen since it introduced the 35-hour week.This might incline us to scepticism about the value of the the state having any role in limiting working hours.\u0026nbspYet that could be the wrong conclusion. For the historic trend is clear. In the late 1900s, UK workers put in more than 2,500 hours a year on average. That’s down to 1,680 hours in 2017. There’s been a similar steep fall in other developed countries over the past century and a half.That reflects the fact that the five-day working week, as opposed to six days with only Sunday off, only become standard practice in the 20th century.It was the industrialist Henry Ford who was the pioneer in the US, giving his factory workers a five-day shift in 1926 while keeping their wages steady. This prefigured legislation and Congress’ 1938 Fair Labor Standards Act, which mandated a maximum 40-hour working week (effectively five working days).We primarily think of John Maynard Keynes as the great promoter of employment for his pioneering theories on the economic benefits of government-funded job creation during the Great Depression.\u0026nbspBut it was this secular decline in hours worked, despite the agonising surge in unemployment in the 1930s, that led Keynes to look forward to a 15-hour working week in The Economic Possibilities for our Grandchildren by the year 2000.The question is whether the recent flattening out is the end of the decline in hours worked,\u0026nbspor merely a pause.\u0026nbspAnd is a government nudge necessary to get history moving again?There’s also the question of consumption. One of the reasons Henry Ford instituted a five-day working week was revealed in a 1926 interview: “Leisure is an indispensable ingredient in a growing consumer market because working people need to have enough free time to find uses for consumer products, including automobiles.”In other words, it was less a paternalistic concern for his workers’ well-being\u0026nbspthan a recognition that it would create help create more customers for Ford.There’s an echo of this macroeconomic concern today, with government-linked Beijing researchers suggesting a four-day week could boost the domestic tourism and entertainment sectors and help rebalance the overall Chinese economy to consumption and away from excessive investment.But perhaps the major economic question about moving towards a four-day week is whether it\u0026nbspcould somehow boost our long-term productivity growth rate (perhaps by inducing more investment in automation by firms) or whether a shorter working week could only ever be the fruits of productivity growth with an origin elsewhere.The truth is that we don’t know the answer. Yet it’s vital to recognise that countries and societies have autonomy too, even now.\u0026nbspThe US has a considerably larger GDP per capita than any developed country in Europe. But the bulk of this gap is due not to a vastly higher level of productivity but the fact that Americans, on average, work many more hours than the French, Germans or Swiss or British and so on.The trade-off between work and leisure is different between our two continents. Both Europeans and Americans, by global and historical comparisons, have very comfortable standards of living. Choosing more leisure over extra working hours is not, whatever some might employers might argue, necessarily a route to penury and decline.Doing nothing for ever and everThe Victorian historian and essayist Thomas Carlyle believed in the redemptive power of work.“A man perfects himself by working,” he enthused. “Foul jungles are cleared away, fair seed-fields rise instead, and stately cities ... Even in the meanest sorts of labour, the whole soul of a man is composed into a kind of real harmony the instant he sets himself to work.”The (possibly apocryphal) epitaph on a Hertfordshire gravestone took a different view of the intrinsic value of hard labour.“Here lies a poor woman who always was tired​”One does not need to be a Carlyle-style work zealot to appreciate that there is some intrinsic psychological value to labour. Work is where many of us find not just an income, but friends, stimulation and status. But we can also see where that Hertfordshire washerwoman was coming from.This dichotomy underlines that not all jobs are the same, or are experienced the same by the worker. For every occupation that that does help to clear away someone’s jungles of mental disorder there will be one that is felt as detestable drudgery.One of the deficiencies of the debate over the four-day week, as with discussions of the appropriate retirement age, is a failure to acknowledge the vast ersity of both jobs and workers. Labour is not homogeneous.Working until 70 might seem entirely reasonable, even desirable, to the university professor, the politician or the TV presenter. But to the cleaner, the firefighter or shop assistant – especially jobs with a physically arduous component – it may have considerably less appeal.\u0026nbspAnd so views erge too on the desirability of the four-day week.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Chester Zoo after a fire broke out in the Monsoon Forest habitat area.Fracking has been halted at the Preston Road site in Lancashire after a series of tremors peaking at 0.9 magnitudeIrish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar today told Theresa May that he expects assurances that there will be no hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of IrelandTheresa May announces that she is to face a vote of no confidence todayArmed police restrain a man inside the grounds of the Houses of Parliament in LondonA demonstrator dressed as Theresa May sells Brexit Fudge in Old Palace Yard, WestminsterA pro-brexit demonstrator speaks into a megaphone at the Brexit betrayal march in London.

It was confirmed late on Sunday evening that the charismatic Thai chairman died alongside four other people in the crashGlenn Hoddle is taken to hospital after falling ill at the BT Sport studioOne of the most significant developments in the UK and broader Western economy over the past decade is the rise of the gig economy and self-employment. Around a sixth of the British workforce is now self-employed.This was brought home to me recently when I met the Romanian father of one of the friends of my young son. The father had been a chauffeur for a wealthy family in Chelsea. But he’d resigned after his son had started school and had signed on with Uber so he could pick his lad up directly from school and shift his driving work to airport shuttle-runs at night instead. “I wanted the flexibility and my previous employer couldn’t provide that,” he told me, as we watched our boys career around the playground.His work-life balance was not to be found in limiting the hours he worked (indeed he wanted to keep those the same or even increase them) but in the flexibility of his arrangements.Survey evidence suggests this is a common story. The majority of Uber drivers like the personal control over their working hours made possible by the platform. Drivers who valued flexible working reported higher levels of life satisfaction, as well as lower levels of anxiety.However, there was also a minority of Uber drivers who would prefer to work fixed hours in a more conventional work setting. And these workers reported lower levels of life satisfaction and higher levels of anxiety.A question of representationThis brings us back to the apparent paradox of many people in the UK workforce wanting fewer hours but many others wanting more.\u0026nbspDavid Bell, a labour market economist from the University of Stirling\u0026nbspwhose work, along with Danny Blanchflower of Dartmouth College in the US, has highlighted this ergence, says that the groups who want fewer hours tend to be older, while those who are underemployed seem to be younger.One of the implications is that younger people in the workforce may need the money from more hours because they are under greater financial pressure, perhaps because they have families, or perhaps because they have suffered a greater real wage squeeze since the financial crisis.\u0026nbspThis suggests that Corbynite left is correct in stressing that to consider the economic and social case for a four-day in isolation is a mistake. Incomes plainly matter too, as well as the level of inequality.\u0026nbspOne has to consider the role of income redistribution and employment policies. Give people higher incomes and more “outside options” for employment, perhaps through a jobs guarantee or even a universal basic income, and the desire for extra hours in their current job may well melt away. They may begin to make different work-leisure trade-offs than they do now.Perhaps one of the reasons why we some people languish in ultra-flexible gig economy jobs they don’t appreciate – like those disgruntled Uber drivers – is that, despite what most economic analysts say, there is actually hidden slack in our economy – and that if the slack was eradicated they could find the kind of regular job they wanted elsewhere.But that still leaves a circle to be squared, presuming that different people, all else equal, are still likely to put different weights on work and leisure. How do we give those who would prefer a four-day week more freedom to choose it, while protecting the interests of those who don’t?The empowerment of ordinary workers is Professor Bell’s answer. Let inidual employees have substantive input into determining the trade-off, rather than leaving it up to politicians or employers.This is how I know the NHS won’t survive without EU staffOver a million young women say they’re paid less than male colleaguesDJ jailed for raping boy, 3, in toilet at working men’s clubTrailblazing images of early 20th-century working conditions“One of the things that might help is a strengthening of worker representation, which has declined so dramatically,” he says. “Rather than jumping in to impose a four-day week you want to think first about whether workers’ interests are being properly represented.”This would be going with the historical grain, given the driving role of new trade unions in the achievement of an eight-hour working day in the 19th century and early 20th century.It’s notable not only that IG Metall workers in Germany this year were able to achieve a four-day working week through negotiation with bosses – but that they also had sufficient bargaining power to protect their overall levels of weekly pay.A fundamental question that underpins this broad discussion about the future of working hours is a philosophical one: what makes us happy and fulfilled as human beings?Modern psychological studies do partially back up Carlyle’s Victorian pompous sermonising: formal work can be as positive for human happiness as leisure, sometimes more so.\u0026nbspA job does seem to bring a valuable sense of social usefulness. Involuntary unemployment is clearly harmful for people’s mental health.But how much work do we want or need? Keynes in the 1930s called this desire for work “old Adam” and predicted that three hours a day in the future would be “quite enough to satisfy” this inherited instinct.Perhaps the right thing to do is not to dictate to people, or engage in speculation on what the future of work will look like, but rather to help them decide for themselves.Four day working weekShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

As a new book points out, it’s an essentially selfish state of being, and society should stop chasing this illusion because it’ll only make us miserable. Even if you do own an orgasmatron...Click to followThe IndependentSurfing is similar to happiness: it’s all about feeling good within yourself. It’s an internal, physiological and emotional state. Which means it is devoid of any moralityThomas Jefferson made it a constitutional right in the US. “The pursuit of happiness.”\u0026nbspYou have the right to pursue wellbeing. No one is stopping you. Go ahead and pursue it. But when did a right morph into an obligation, a duty?The founding fathers were influenced by the great voyages of discovery. Thanks to Captain Cook and his French counterpart Bougainville, the idea got about that everyone in the southern hemisphere was happier than in the cold and dismal north. We had the technology, we had the “civilisation”, but why didn’t we feel good about it? They had something we were lacking. Surfing was a case in point. According to European observers, the men and women riding waves had found a way to “allay all perturbation of mind”. The American constitution was, in effect, suggesting we ought to try living our lives on the crest of a wave.I personally put the utopian theory to the test by following in Cook’s footsteps and going to the Sandwich Islands, aka Hawaii, aka “the Happy Isles of Oceania” (according to Paul Theroux). By a strange quirk of fate one of the first people I met there was a clinical psychologist. “Where are you from?”, she said. “England,” I replied. “You’re so lucky!” she said. I had just travelled several thousand miles to get away from England and here was someone telling me I was better off saving my money and staying put. “How do you work that out?” I asked. “The great thing about England,” she replied, “is that you can be miserable and nobody minds. In fact you’re expected to be miserable.”It turned out that she was a specialist in treating people with depression. “In Hawaii?” I said with genuine scepticism. They have palm trees, sultry breezes, and big waves, what was the problem? “People get depressed in Hawaii the same as anywhere else,” she said. “The problem is that here you’re expected to be happy. So you feel guilty about it on top. And then considering Hawaii is also technically the 50th state of America, if you’re broke too, when you’re supposed to be prosperous, then you’re really screwed.”You don’t have to be miserable, but it’s your constitutional right to be downhearted if you want to be. What he demonstrates so convincingly is how feeling good can really be bad for youDr Depression surely had a point. But she represents the opposition to what has become increasingly a vast and powerful and highly profitable industry, as Carl Cederström sets out in his wise and witty new book, The Happiness Fantasy. He might equally well have called it the “happiness conspiracy”, because we are being ganged up on, bullied and battered and bruised by the imperative of happiness. Can’t we just be unhappy if we feel like it? What’s so bad about that?I know I’m going to come over as the biggest party pooper, grouch or grinch in the history of the world here, but I can never really sing “Happy Birthday” to anyone with any degree of conviction or enthusiasm. I do still occasionally send birthday cards, but I’m not going to write the words “happy birthday” in black and white. It always seems too coercive to me. My attitude is OK, be happy if you like, but if you want to be unhappy that’s good too, you shouldn’t have to feel like you have to be happy. Happiness ought to be voluntary and accidental and spontaneous and strictly optional. (So what do I write? “Be awesome”? It’s tricky. Suggestions on a postcard, please.)TherouxCederström comes from Stockholm. He is more of an exponent of Nordic noir. No palm trees in Scandi-land, so far as I know. Only bracing, even lacerating minimalism. Don’t get me wrong. Cederström is not advocating despair. Maybe he is even trying to save you from Hawaiian-style depression. You don’t have to be miserable, but it’s your constitutional right to be downhearted if you want to be. What he demonstrates so convincingly is how feeling good can really be bad for you.According to Philip Larkin, sex was invented – or at least re-invented – sometime between the publication of Lady Chatterley’s Lover and the Beatles’ first LP, around 1963. “Happiness,” as Freud said, “comes from the satisfaction of needs that have been dammed up to a high degree.” But what if they are not dammed up? Then we are looking at futile or self-destructive overexertion. Instead of being an episodic phenomenon, sex turned into our lodestar, our archetype of mood-management. Thanks in part to Wilhelm Reich, the orgasm was no longer an exceptional high, it became the model of how we were ought to be feeling generally. Way up there on Cloud 9. Average was no longer good enough. But the idea that everyone should really be feeling well beyond average all the time – having constant “peak experiences” (in Abraham Maslow’s phrase) meant that there was always going to be lot of disappointed customers.Reich was an Austrian, originally a disciple of Freud’s, who broke with him over Freud’s notion of sublimation. Civilisation, said Freud, depends on you bottling up all that libinidal energy of yours, and channelling it into doing something creative, like writing novels, composing symphonies or building bridges and tall buildings. Rubbish, said Reich. The orgasm (no ordinary orgasm moreover, it has to be “full”) – that rapturous release of endorphins and assorted chemicals – is good for you. What we need is more actual orgasms. Thus was the Age of Aquarius born, ie the Sixties, marking an end to the long, grim era of repression. Reich invented the “orgone accumulator”, which became the “orgasmatron” in Woody Allen’s Sleeper. He was eventually arrested for fraud, locked up, and died in prison in the US, aged 60, a martyr to sexual liberationBut this was only the beginning of the happiness industry, branching out into “human potential”, “self-help”, “positive thinking”, and New Age gurus, even Scientology, all of them packaged and purveyed and pharmaceutically-inflected. If you’re feeling blue, why not pop a pill? It’s your constitutional right. Especially if it might make you more productive or more “authentic”. We have ended up in a situation where no one feels they are really getting enough, of just about anything. And we are “depraved on account of being deprived” as they say in West Side Story.Cederström is the co-author, with André Spicer, of The Wellness Syndrome, and together they wrote Desperately Seeking Self-Improvement. He puts me in mind of that bloke in Boswell’s Life of Johnson who says, “I tried to be a philosopher, but cheerfulness kept breaking through.” I couldn’t resist asking Cederström if he considered himself a happy sort of guy. He said that he thought the word itself was now effectively meaningless, as per the passage from Beckett’s Waiting for Godot:Godot, Alfred Lynch plays\u0026nbspEstragon (left) and Nicol Williamson is Vladimir (Rex)Vladimir: Say you are, even if it’s not true.\u0026nbspEstragon: ​What am I to say?Vladimir: Say, I am happy.\u0026nbspEstragon: ​We are happy. (Silence.) What do we do now, now that we are happy?\u0026nbspCederström reckons that “the whole self-actualisation craze had a purpose when it kicked off, in the Sixties, as a reaction against the hyper-patriarchal image of the happy family life with the ‘happy’ housewife and all the rest”. But he clearly thinks that the concept has long outlived its usefulness and is now being sold as a contemporary form of snake oil.The thing about happiness is that it should happen to you accidentally. You can only be happy until the moment where you start asking yourself the killer question, “Am I really happy?” And then it all falls apart. Hence all the hype and hysteria and desperation around happiness is entirely self-defeating. Happiness underwent a period of massive inflation in the 20th century. Maybe we have reached the point where the bottom has fallen out of the market finally and we need to rethink happiness from the ground up.I think the Greeks had a good idea in “ataraxia”. They didn’t think of the orgasm as the be-all and end-all. The point about ataraxia is that you are neither feeling particularly good nor particularly bad, but have attained a neutral state – a kind of degree zero – in which your desires give you a break for a time. Rather than maximum gratification we are looking at the minimisation of regret.As someone suggested to me the other day, happiness equals reality minus expectations. I think stoicism is superior to mere happiness because it allows that there is and there will be suffering in the world and the best you can hope for is to be able to adjust your attitude towards it. As Epicurus says, when you drop your favourite vase and it smashes into a thousand pieces no one expects you be jumping for joy. But you might be able (with a truly heroic effort) be able to say to yourself, “The vase has been restored.”The other problem with happiness is, oddly enough, the same problem that affects surfing. It’s an essentially selfish state of being. It’s all about feeling good within yourself. It’s an internal, physiological and emotional state. Which means, in effect, that it is devoid of any morality. Harvey Weinstein was just trying to be happy too. Pursuing his democratic rights.We tend to think of other people as being or at least looking happy. And definitely happier than ourselves. The fact is they\u0026nbsparen’t, we just think they are. All those blissfully smiling beautiful people – they’re just as screwed up as everyone elseCarl Cederström sees Donald Trump as the ultimate flowering of the human potential movement. Even the president speaks of “tapping human potential”. Just as, at the same time, he speaks of “grabbing pussy” or celebrating the NRA. Happiness, as John Lennon said, “is a warm gun”. That’s my constitutional right too. Which has become practically synonymous with a lack of impulse control. I enjoy having a drink, don’t I? Or a big fat cheeseburger. So isn’t it my right to go on eating and drinking myself to death? I want to feel good, even if that way perdition lies (not to mention diabetes and cirrhosis of the liver). As the actor Philip Seymour Hoffman once said (before OD’ing on heroin), “There is no pleasure I haven’t actually made myself sick on.” Cederström himself recalls anything but fondly a week of limitless hedonistic excess in the Canary Islands, leading to an all-time hangover.Happiness, in any case, is largely an illusion. We tend to think of other people as being or at least looking happy. And definitely happier than ourselves. The fact is they aren’t, we just think they are. All those blissfully smiling beautiful people – they’re just as screwed up as everyone else. Social media only serves to spread the delusion. I once asked my son, who was supposed to be studying at university at the time, if his life was constant partying. “Why would you think that?” He asked. “Because all I see of you on Facebook is pictures of you dancing or getting drunk at parties.” He scoffed at my naivety. “That’s only because no one ever posts pictures of themselves sitting at the library and reading a book or writing an essay.”Happiness is a myth that only serves the interests of the happiness-conjurors and the manufacturers of birthday cards. I think happiness has now entered its twilight zone. I can’t see feeling good being of any intrinsic value unless it is also coupled to doing good. Aristotle had something like this in mind when he defined happiness (or eudaimonia) as leading a virtuous life. I think this is what Cederström is hoping for in the future when he speaks of “collective happiness”.But there is another issue here: just as happiness can dissolve into a kind of self-satisfaction, having one’s fellow humans in mind is only another kind of narcissism at the level of the species. One of the most ecstatic non-anthropocentric moments I can recall is when I was cycling through a park and a small bird – a sparrow, I think – came flying out of a bush straight out at me, but seeing me in the way, turned at right angles so that – for the space of a second or two – the bird was flying at exactly the height of my head and at the same speed I was cycling. With the effect that we (if I can speak of “we”, the bird and me) briefly flew along together. That was years ago and I can still feel something of what it must feel like to be a bird. It was exceptional and aleatory and probably unrepeatable. But perhaps the oceanic feeling that Freud was so sceptical of – the sense of there being “an indissoluble bond” with the universe – needs to make a comeback.Andy Martin is the author of ‘Reacher Said Nothing: Lee Child and the Making of Make Me’Carl Cederström’s book, ‘The Happiness Fantasy’, is published by PolityShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

As much as 95 per cent of marine species, and 70 per cent of life on the land, perished as a result.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialIn an interview with The Independent in their offices at the University of Washington, associate professor Curtis Deutsch and co-author Justin Penn, said the reaction to their paper in Science had been a mixture of excitement and fear - excitement at the discovery and fear of the prescient dangers if people did not act.“I think this work has identified the leading factor in what led to the largest crisis in the history of life on earth,” said Mr Penn, a doctoral student, asked how he hoped policy makers would respond to the discovery.“The hopeful message is that despite doing do, it also identifies the solution to that problem - which is the emission of CO2 into the atmosphere. So my hope is we decide to do something about it.”The scientists based their discovery about the Permian period on computer modelling and calculations that took months. They also made use of information provided by chemical changes in the fossils of eel-like creatures more than 250m years old to show the extent of temperature change.It had previously been known the mass extinction was triggered after a succession of huge volcanic eruptions in what is now Siberia. While loss of life was linked to a surge in the release of greenhouse gases, it was not previously understood what made the oceans so inimical to life.“This is the first time that we have made a mechanistic prediction about what caused the extinction that can be directly tested with the fossil record, which then allows us to make predictions about the causes of extinction in the future,” Mr Penn wrote of their discovery, pointing out that the situation they examined 250m years ago, with the presence of increased levels of greenhouse gases and warming oceans, was similar to today.“Under a business-as-usual emissions scenarios, by 2100 warming in the upper ocean will have approached 20 percent of warming in the late Permian, and by the year 2300 it will reach between 35 and 50 per cent.

Instead, his speech was a promise to resistThe scientists’ discovery comes as a succession of experts raise warning sounds about the imminent threat presented by climate change, something Donald Trump has called a hoax.Earlier this year, the UN’s climate science body, the the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), said there was barely a dozen years to make massive changes to global energy infrastructure to limit global warming to moderate levels. “There is no documented historic precedent,” the IPPC said.A report by the US government issued last month said climate change is already having devastating effects, and could cost\u0026nbspthe economy 10 per cent of GDP by the end of the century. Mr Trump, who withdrew the US from the Paris Accord in one of his first actions as president, said he did not believe the report’s conclusions.Climate talks extended as US and other polluters hold up agreementTeenage activist inspires school strikes to protest climate changeMore than 1000 institutions pledge to withdraw fossil fuel investmentsBest-dressed at Vanity Fair’s climate change galaTax fossil fuel companies to fix climate change damage, experts sayMilan to plant 3 million trees to fight climate changeMr Deutsch said the similarities between today and the period when the mass extinction took place were striking, but said society could decide how to act.\u0026nbsp“The response to marine ecosystems to climate change can only by countered by slowing the warming,” he said.“There is no way we can really pull the heat out the ocean or put the oxygen back in...Once that\u0026nbspgenie is out of the bottle, that\u0027s it.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Earlier this year a Waymo test driver reported a man in shorts aiming a gun at his car when it passed the man’s driveway.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialPolice reports also show that rocks were thrown at Waymo’s fleet on at least four separate occasions, according to\u0026nbspThe Arizona Republic,\u0026nbspwhile other incidents include people yelling at the vehicles, chasing them and forcing them off the road.Many other incidents may have gone unreported, the newspaper suggested, with Waymo reportedly keen to minimise police interaction.Created with Sketch. Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The underlying motivation behind such harassment appears to be frustration with Waymo’s parent company Alphabet, combined with fears the technology poses a threat to both jobs and road safety.“Everybody hates Waymo drivers,” one resident told\u0026nbspThe Arizona Republic. “They are dangerous.”Earlier this year, an autonomous vehicle being tested by Uber hit and killed a woman on a darkened street\u0026nbspin Tempe, which borders Chandler.Such frustrations led one man to block the path of a Waymo vehicle by standing in front of\u0026nbspit.\u0026nbspThe police report for the incident stated the man was “sick and tired of the Waymo vehicles driving in his neighbourhood, and apparently thought the best idea to resolve this was to stand in front of one of these vehicles.”The company recently launched the first ever commercial self-driving taxi service in nearby Phoenix, with the hope of a much broader roll out in the coming years.A Waymo\u0026nbspspokesperson said drivers of its self-driving vehicles are trained to deal with threats from the public.“Safety is at the core of everything we do, which means that keeping our drivers, our riders and the public safe is our top priority,” the spokesperson said.“Over the past two years, we’ve found Arizonans to be welcoming and excited by the potential of this technology to make our roads safer. We believe a key element of local engagement has been ongoing work with the communities in which we drive, including Arizona law enforcement and first responders.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Those in the North East were by far the most likely to feel this way, with 24 per cent expecting to get into debt.Young mothers were more likely to be in a difficult financial situation than young fathers, at 40 per cent compared to 29 per cent. The Trust said this could be\u0026nbspbecause women are more likely than young men to be jobless or trapped in low-paid or insecure work.The two sets of research come\u0026nbspafter the\u0026nbspUnited Nations condemned\u0026nbspthe government’s “punitive, mean-spirited and often callous” treatment of the country’s poorest and most vulnerable.The UN poverty rapporteur Philip\u0026nbspAlston\u0026nbspsaid he had been concerned to see families dependent on food banks, and children who were “growing up in poverty unsure of their future”.UN condemns ‘callous’ UK government in damning poverty reportResponding to the new findings, shadow education secretary Angela Rayner\u0026nbspsaid: “These figures paint a shocking picture of the impact of the Tories’ austerity programme on a generation of children, who are impoverished through no fault of their own.“Growing up in such hardship has a major influence on education, health and welfare, and quite simply it is harder to learn if you are hungry or homeless.”Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the NEU, said the figures painted a “Dickensian picture of the poverty that far too many children and their families are having to endure”.\u0026nbspShe added: “The government is out of touch with the distressing new reality of children’s daily lives: with what it means to live without enough money for basics, such as food, shoes and adequate clothing.\u0026nbsp“The government has failed to recognise the human cost of its cuts to schools and other children’s services and to the social security system, and its failure to address the in-work poverty faced by one in five workers.“The government must stop hiding from the facts. Children can’t escape the poverty trap without an urgent change to national policies.”Young Women’s Trust chief executive Dr Carole Easton said: “Christmas is a particularly hard time for those on low pay who want to provide for their families.“Young women are more likely to be stuck on low pay and on zero hours contracts. Often they don’t know how many hours they will work each month and whether they will earn enough to pay their bills.\u0026nbsp“Much more needs to be done to improve young people’s prospects. This means giving them the right skills and support to find jobs, ensuring decent and flexible jobs are available and paying a proper living wage that doesn’t discriminate against age. This would benefit businesses and the economy too.”\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Theresa May has hit out at Mr Blair, accusing him of insultingthe British people and the office of prime minister by undermining Brexit talks with calls in Brussels for a second referendum.Chester Zoo after a fire broke out in the Monsoon Forest habitat area.Fracking has been halted at the Preston Road site in Lancashire after a series of tremors peaking at 0.9 magnitudeIrish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar today told Theresa May that he expects assurances that there will be no hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of IrelandTheresa May announces that she is to face a vote of no confidence todayArmed police restrain a man inside the grounds of the Houses of Parliament in LondonA demonstrator dressed as Theresa May sells Brexit Fudge in Old Palace Yard, WestminsterA pro-brexit demonstrator speaks into a megaphone at the Brexit betrayal march in London.

People were against no deal by 44 per cent to 37 per cent, for a new referendum by 46 per cent to 30 per cent and for Norway by 41 per cent to 39 per cent.A sign of just how difficult it will be to secure any deal that enjoys broad support came from another question, which asked respondents to say what it is that is most important for a Brexit deal to secure.The equal top answers were “controlling immigration” and “maintaining smooth trading links with the EU” – two things which, to an extent, are mutually exclusive because of the red lines set out by the EU and UK in negotiations.Ensuring that there is no border erected between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland – the matter at the heart of opposition to Ms May’s plan – was rated as the key issue by just six per cent of people.EU ‘will renegotiate with Theresa May’ Brexit deal is voted down’Ms May is likely to play for time if the vote does go against her next week, and travel to Brussels for a summit of the European Council where she may ask for further concessions to try and make her deal more palatable to MPs.Despite a string of European figures saying there could be no further talks, ex-commission president Mr Prodi appeared to throw Ms May a lifeline on Saturday. Asked how he expected the commission to respond after the vote, he said: “Negotiate. We must keep free trade between us because it is in the British interests and European interest.”On Saturday, Ms Rudd hit out at Brexiteers who she said “flounce out quite a lot” instead of trying to get things done, an attack coming after Boris Johnson\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspDavid Davis\u0026nbspquit the cabinet over Ms May’s deal.\u0026nbspAll have leadership ambitions and have been jockeying for position ahead of a potential future contest in the coming weeks.In an interview, Ms Rudd also took the unusual step of revealing details of a private conversation with the prime minister, even critiquing her leadership style by saying “she is not always forthcoming” about what she wants.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspMs Rudd is seen as a leading candidate from the moderate wing of the party and even said in her interview that she hoped it chooses a “centrist” figure for its next leader, though she said a contest at this point would be “too indulgent”.Source Note: BMG Research interviewed a representative sample of 1,508 GB adults online between 4 and 7\u0026nbspDecember.

While this motion is non-binding on the government, its a way of testing support among MPs for such a plan.He said: The public has a right to know how the House of Commons would vote on the different Brexit choices facing our country.I am trying to ensure we have an opportunity as soon as possible to register our vote on a range of options, including a reformed Northern Irish ‘backstop’, leaving the European Union without a deal, extending Article 50, entering into a future Norway- or Canada-style relationship with the EU, and holding a new referendum.The results of voting on each scenario wouldn’t be binding on the government.But they will test opinion to see if any way forward commands a majority amongst MPs. This could act as a powerful guide to the government during its ongoing discussions with the EU.Former cabinet minister Justine Greening\u0026nbspsays a second referendum is the only way for Theresa May to break the deadlock on Brexit.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspA blocking group of MPs exists for every proposal, she said in a piece for the Financial Times,\u0026nbspadding that 80-100 Tory MPs would be happy to pursue a no-deal scenario.\u0026nbspMs Greening said there was no point in the PM flogging her Brexit dead-horse deal any longer and it was time to act. The delay was damaging the reputation of the UK and the Tory party, she said.Theresa May is due to give a Commons statement today at around 3.30pm, where MPs will be able to grill her over her trip to Brussels for the European Council summit on Thursday and Friday.Expect a fairly fraught session, after Ms May\u0027s efforts to gain concessions were rebuffed. She was also captured on camera confronting Jean-Claude Juncker, the EU Commission chief, after he described the British Brexit position as nebulous and imprecise.Significantly, the words briefed overnight by Downing Street show the PM attempting to quash the prospect of a second referendum.She is expected to say:\u0026nbsp“Let us not break faith with the British people by trying to stage another referendum.“Another vote which would do irreparable damage to the integrity our politics, because it would say to millions who trusted in democracy, that our democracy does not deliver.“Another vote which would likely leave us no further forward than the last.“And another vote which would further ide our country at the very moment we should be working to unite it.”Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd\u0026nbsphas said it was important to think about how we test the will of parliament over the Brexit deal.\u0026nbspShe told Sky News: My first point is that we need to get the withdrawal agreement through parliament. That has my full support and I\u0026nbsphope that the PM will get the amendments, the changes that some of my colleagues seek.\u0026nbspAfter\u0026nbspthat we need to find out where the will of parliament is, where the majority of MPs will vote in parliament and nothing should be\u0026nbspoff the table.

To call them rudderless is the understatement of the century.”The controversy will come to a head at a cabinet meeting, when a separate group of Brexiteer ministers will urge the prime minister to step up preparations for crashing out of the EU instead.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Parliament has taken it. We know the options for Brexit. Parliament will have to decide on one of them. If parliament can’t then it should decide to go back to the people.“Now should be the time of preparation – parliament to make sure it can canvas the options in sensible manner, one by one, to reach agreement on an option or a referendum Europe to ensure that if Britain is ready to think again, Europe is ready also to think again.“All that is necessary is for leadership: in parliament if not in government, and in Europe where despite all the myriad of challenges European leaders have, they should understand that changing Brexit would be the greatest boost to Europe’s economy and politics and that therefore, they need to focus on the part they can play and play it.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

And another vote which would further ide our country at the very moment we should be working to unite it.”Her words will likely be seen as an attempt to end growing speculation about the prospect of another referendum.With Labour still mulling whether to table a motion of no confidence in the prime minister this week, she will be desperate to avoid further alienating her\u0026nbspEurosceptic backbenchers.Former Labour foreign secretary Dame Margaret Beckett, a supporter of the campaign for a People\u0027s Vote, said of Ms May\u0027s remarks:\u0026nbspIt is highly significant that Downing Street felt it had to issue these advance extracts of her statement to the House of Commons on Sunday night, because officials know the prospect of a People\u0027s Vote is being discussed not just in Westminster but in the corridors of Whitehall too.Today\u0026nbspLiam Fox, the international trade secretary, appeared to back calls for MPs to vote on whether to hold a fresh referendum as he suggested parliament could be given a say on a range of Brexit outcomes.The leading Brexiteer\u0026nbspsaid he was not opposed to the idea of\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspbeing given a free vote on “what the options were” if, as expected, Ms May’s deal is rejected by MPs.With the proposed withdrawal agreement “unlikely” to be approved by parliament, ministers needed to accept that there are only a\u0026nbsp“limited number of real-world options” available to them, he added.Five Remain-supporting cabinet ministers are reported to be urging Ms May\u0026nbspto hold a series of “indicative votes” in the Commons\u0026nbspon what the government’s next step should be,\u0026nbspbut Mr\u0026nbspFox is the first Leave-backing minister\u0026nbspto endorse the calls.\u0026nbspHis intervention came as Ms May’s deputy and her chief of staff were forced to deny reports that they are secretly preparing for a Final Say referendum.And as\u0026nbsptensions spilled over and No 10 tried to distract attention from deepening Tory isions, Ms May become embroiled in a bitter public spat with Tony Blair on the issue of\u0026nbspanother public vote.The cabinet will meet on Tuesday with ministers expected to clash over how they should respond to widespread Commons opposition to the proposed withdrawal agreement.Mr\u0026nbspFox said he would did not want a second referendum, which he claimed would “perpetuate the isions in the country”.“It wasn’t the government that was given an instruction by the referendum, it was parliament.”“Parliament said in that referendum, ‘We can’t make a decision – in this particular area we are going to subcontract our sovereignty to the people.’\u0026nbspAnd they gave us an instruction.\u0026nbspIt’s time parliament carried it out.”And in a\u0026nbspsign of growing support for\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspbeing given more say over Brexit, he suggested it would be parliament, not ministers, that “will have to decide on the alternatives” if Ms May is unable to secure the changes needed to get her deal through the Commons.Damian\u0026nbspHinds, the education secretary, also said on Sunday that he was open to the idea of flushing out the different options, while Penny Mordaunt, the international development secretary, has for weeks been calling\u0026nbspfor Tory MPs to be given a free vote on the proposed Brexit deal.Created with Sketch.Newspapers react to Theresa May pulling the vote on her Brexit deal Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.It comes amid\u0026nbspreports that David\u0026nbspLidington, Ms May’s deputy,\u0026nbspmet with Labour\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbsplast week to discuss a cross-party consensus\u0026nbspfor another referendum, while Gavin\u0026nbspBarwell, her chief of staff, reportedly told ministers that a public vote is “the only way out of this”.The pair took to Twitter to pour cold water on the claims.Mr\u0026nbspBarwell\u0026nbspwrote: “Happy to confirm I am *not* planning a 2nd\u0026nbspreferendum with political opponents (or anyone else to anticipate the next question).”Mr\u0026nbspLidington\u0026nbspposted a link to a statement he made in the Commons last week in which he said another public vote “would certainly be isive but could not guarantee to be decisive in ending this debate” and said its proponents “should not underestimate the damage that would be done to what is already fragile public confidence in our democratic\u0026nbspinstitutions.”He added: “As throughout my time in government I listen to views of\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspon all sides of the EU debate.”Dividing lines were drawn\u0026nbspand potential candidates to succeed Ms May jostled for position ahead of Tuesday’s key cabinet meeting. Foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt, who admitted he fancied “a crack” at being prime minister, said\u0026nbspthe UK could “flourish and prosper” if it leaves the EU without an agreement, while Ms Mordaunt put forward a plan for using technology to\u0026nbspkeep\u0026nbspthe Northern Ireland border open if there is\u0026nbspa no-deal Brexit,Sajid\u0026nbspJavid, the home secretary, and Andrea\u0026nbspLeadsom, the leader of the Commons, are also likely to push for a managed no-deal exit if Ms May’s deal is rejected.But Remain-supporting ministers\u0026nbspincluding Mr\u0026nbspLidington, Philip Hammond, the chancellor, and Amber Rudd, the work and pensions\u0026nbspsecretary, are understood to be pushing Ms May to hold a series of “indicative votes”, including the option of a second referendum. It is\u0026nbspbelieved they are\u0026nbspbacked by David Gauke, the justice secretary, and Greg Clark, the business secretary.On Saturday, Ms Rudd called on Ms May to “try something different” and attempt\u0026nbspto build cross-party support\u0026nbspfor an alternative Brexit plan.As the campaign for a Final Say vote gathered pace, Tony Blair hit back at Ms May after she launched a blistering attack on him.The war of words escalated when\u0026nbspthe former prime minister called Ms May “irresponsible” and claimed she was trying to “steamroller” her deal through parliament.Hours earlier, she had accused the former Labour leader of “undermining” her during negotiations with the EU, and she said his lobbying for another referendum was “an insult to the office he once held and the people he once served”.In response, Mr\u0026nbspBlair said it was clear that “neither the British people nor their parliament will unite behind the prime minister’s deal”.He said: “In these circumstances it is not irresponsible or insulting to put forward an alternative way to achieve resolution. The sensible thing is now to allow parliament to vote on each of the forms of Brexit canvassed including the prime minister’s deal.“If they can’t reach agreement then the logical thing is to go back to the people. To describe such a course as an insult is a strange description of what would be the opportunity for them to instruct parliament as to how to proceed. Far from being anti-democratic it would be the opposite, as indeed many senior figures in her party from past and present have been saying.”Criticising Ms May’s approach, he added: “What is irresponsible however is to try to steamroller MPs into accepting a deal they genuinely think is a bad one with the threat that if they do not fall into line, the government will have the country crash out without a deal.”\u0026nbspThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

It was an ‘undercutters’ charter’.“But these reforms as a whole won’t shift the balance of power in the gig economy.“Unless unions get the right to organise and bargain for workers in places like Uber and Amazon, too many working people will continue to be treated like disposable labour.queuing up for free food because they can’t afford to eatAnd Labour said the reforms would “do nothing” to help people on zero hours contracts.The party’s shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey, said: “This Conservative government has failed to support workers. Instead it has increased tribunal fees, attacked the health and safety of workers, introduced the draconian Trade Union Act and presided over the lowest wage growth in a decade.“These proposals do nothing to tackle the growing number of people on precarious zero hours contracts and with their botched Brexit deal threatening jobs and rights they’ll have to do a lot more than this to reassure workers.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

More than 600 people have paid or put down deposits to fly aboard Virgin\u0027s suborbital missions, including actor Leonardo DiCaprio and pop star Justin Bieber. A 90-minute flight costs $250,000.Short sightseeing trips to space aboard Blue Origin\u0027s New Shepard rocket are likely to cost around $200,000 to $300,000, at least to start, Reuters reported in July. Tickets will be offered ahead of the first commercial launch, and test flights with Blue Origin employees are expected to begin in 2019.Other firms planning a variety of passenger spacecraft include Boeing Co, Elon Musk\u0027s SpaceX and late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen\u0027s Stratolaunch.In September, SpaceX said Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa, founder and chief executive of online fashion retailer Zozo, would be the company\u0027s first passenger on a voyage around the moon on its forthcoming Big Falcon Rocket spaceship, tentatively scheduled for 2023.Musk, the billionaire CEO of electric carmaker Tesla , said the Big Falcon Rocket could conduct its first orbital flights in two to three years as part of his grand plan to shuttle passengers to the moon and eventually fly humans and cargo to Mars.According to Virgin, SpaceShipTwo is hauled to an altitude of about 45,000 feet (13.7 kms) by the WhiteKnightTwo carrier airplane and released. The spaceship then fires its rocket motor to catapult it to at least 50 miles (80.47 km) above Earth, high enough for passengers to experience weightlessness and see the curvature of the planet.Bezos\u0027 New Shepard has already flown to that altitude - an internationally recognized boundary between Earth\u0027s atmosphere and outer space known as the Karman line - though the Blue Origin trip did not carry humans.Virgin\u0027s Thursday launch likely will not go as high as the Karman line. Virgin\u0027s pilots are aiming to soar 50 miles into the sky - the U.S. military and NASA\u0027s definition of the edge of space and high enough to earn commercial astronaut wings by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration.Thursday\u0027s test flight carried two pilots, four NASA research payloads, and a mannequin named Annie as a stand-in passenger.Additional reporting by agenciesShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

So while you do see a few more people speaking out, there is a lot of logic in the minds of people who are concerned about speaking out, because they’re concerned about their family members inside China.”She said there was also the issue that it was harder for those who had been detained to leave China, adding: “When you see a government denying people the right to leave, it generally means they’ve got something to hide.”\u0026nbspUighur\u0026nbspminority abroad to spy on compatriotsWhile Chinese officials initially issued blanket denials the country ran mass internment camps, they later defended them by saying they were used for citizens who were guilty of minor offences as vocational centres to provide employment opportunities.Dabancheng in Xinjiang (ReutersThomas Peter)The international reaction has also been somewhat muted, though criticism of Beijing’s treatment of its Muslim minority is\u0026nbspincreasing.“If any other government in the world was locking up a million Muslims I think we can reasonably expect to have seen demands for a debate at the UN Security Council or an international investigation,” Ms Richardson said. “That’s generally unlikely to happen with China.”Last week, the United Nations’ most senior human rights official recently requested direct access to the Xinjiang region to verify the “worrying reports” of re-education camps.“We have been asking for direct access to the region to be able to check and verify the worrying reports we are receiving,” Michelle Bachelet, the high commissioner for human rights, told a news conference in Geneva.Her request came a day after Germany’s human rights commissioner, Barbel Kofler, said China had blocked her from travelling to the region.“I am shocked by reports of the treatment of the Turkic Uighur minority,” Ms Kofler said in a statement last Tuesday. “I would have liked to have gained a first-hand impression of the situation there and will continue to push for permission to visit Xinjiang soon.”\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspXinjiang, where up to one million Uighur Muslims are held for ‘re-education’ (Reuters)But Ms Richardson said it was encouraging that the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, which states it is\u0026nbsp“the collective voice of the Muslim world”, has issued increasingly strong statements about China and the arbitrary detention of Uighur and Muslim minorities.“One of the threads of those debates all along has been ‘why isn’t the Muslim community of the world speaking up for Muslims in China?’ Well, it looks like they are now,” Ms Richardson said.\u0026nbspUighur man looks on as a truck carrying paramilitary policemen travels along a street during an anti-terrorism oath-taking rally in Urumqi, Xinjiang (Reuters)It comes amid reports more than one million Han Chinese people have moved into the homes of Uighur Muslim families to report on whether they display Islamic or unpatriotic beliefs.American anthropologist Darren Byler said they were tasked with looking for signs their hosts’ attachment to Islam might be “extreme”, such as by looking to see if they had a Quran in the house or fasted at Ramadan.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

It has done so without providing any explanation, and left many of those remaining fearing they could be next.Diplomats and charity bosses spoken to by The Independent described the ejection of the 18 international non-governmental organisations (INGOs) not as a knee-jerk decision, but as the culmination of years of hostility from the state towards such bodies.The charities were told at the end of September that they had exhausted all options to appeal their wrapping-up orders, and given 60 days to cease all operations and withdraw from Pakistan.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialAll the INGOs, including the UK charities ActionAid, International Alert and Plan International, have been told they can “re-apply” for registration in Pakistan in six months’ time.But their prospects do not look good, given they have not been told the reasons for their\u0026nbspexpulsion – and therefore what they must rectify. They, like the Western governments that have been lobbying on their behalf for years without success, are left second-guessing the true reason they have been kicked out.Pakistan to expel 18 foreign charities in aid crackdownMany reports have linked Pakistan’s hostility towards foreign charities with the 2011 US military operation that ended in the death of Osama bin Laden. Then, a fake vaccination programme run by the CIA was used to pinpoint the hideout of the 911 mastermind.Few would dispute that this set back genuine vaccination programmes years if not decades – Pakistan remains one of only two countries in the world where polio is endemic – and contributed to a sense of distrust towards INGOs.Few people will actually be leaving Pakistan as a result of the crackdown on international charities. That’s because even before it began the new NGO registration process, the state had been denying visas to foreign workers. Both ActionAid and Plan International confirmed their teams in the\u0026nbspcountry already consisted of Pakistani nationals.Nonetheless, the public image of INGOs as malevolent agents of foreign powers has persisted:\u0026nbspthe media narrative seems to have worked.Created with Sketch.Forgotten Women: The sisters fighting for human rights in Pakistan Show all 5Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Human rights activist Gulalai Ismail was apprehended by Pakistan officials upon landing in Islamabad after a flight from LondonHuman rights activist Gulalai Ismail was apprehended by Pakistan officials upon landing in Islamabad after a flight from LondonOn the streets of Islamabad, people generally seemed to support a move away from reliance on INGOs. Naeem Awan, a shopkeeper, said foreign charities were “involved in destabilising Pakistan, they are destroying Pakistan’s culture and society”.Raja Moshin, a government employee, said he believed Pakistan “doesn’t need INGOs’ services”.It is\u0026nbspa perception that many believe has been fuelled by Pakistan’s powerful military establishment, which backed the former cricketer Imran Khan in his successful bid to become prime minister and maintains an effective apparatus for quelling dissenting voices in civil society.Independent journalists might criticise a government decision once, but they won’t push it too far, and domestic NGOs are tightly controlled.Foreign charities operating in Pakistan were the last piece in the puzzle – frequently speaking\u0026nbspout about what they were seeing on the ground.Chinese consulate in Pakistan attacked by gunmenClamour grows for Asia Bibi to be granted asylumPakistan’s Imran Khan flies into political storm in Saudi Arabia“The decision by the government of Pakistan to close down these charities is a huge disappointment,” one western diplomat told The Independent. “Sadly it comes as no surprise and is the latest step in several years of disruption of charities, journalists and social activists.“We expect more to come. Each time it is the poor people in Pakistan that suffer the most.”Of around 140 INGOs that applied for registration, 80 were granted permission to continue their operations. The fate of the 40 or so who still haven’t heard is not looking good, with sources close to the process suggesting that another raft of 20 could be told to pack up in the coming weeks.The government of Pakistan has defended its moves to regulate the charity sector – up until 2015, there were no stringent mechanisms to ensure that NGOs, whether foreign or domestic, were well governed.Pakistan would hardly be the first country to seek to move from an aid-based model of crisis intervention to direct action as its economy develops. India has been through a similar process, repeatedly cracking down on foreign funding for NGOs and just this year refusing offers of millions of pounds for victims of flooding in Kerala.Shireen Mazari, Pakistan’s minister for human rights, said the 18 were “denied for non-compliance viz what they had defined as their work”. “They must leave. They need to work within their stated intent, which these 18 didn’t do.”In other words, the charities were not being charged explicitly with spying, or furthering the agenda of a foreign power. None, in fact, was accused of anything specific at all.The Pakistani branch of George Soros’s Open Society Foundations was one of two among the 18 which has fought the decision in court, and is awaiting a decision.Its Pakistan head Dr Saba Khattak told The Independent the charity will argue in court that the government cannot prove any misconduct on their part.“We received notice to stop working, but in that notice we were never told what charge is being brought against us. We are not involved in any illegal work,” she said.Collectively, according to the Pakistan Humanitarian Forum, the 18 charities employed more than 1,100 people in country.“They employed local resources, working with local partners to forge a link with communities which the government cannot,” a spokesperson for the forum told The Independent.“From health to water sanitation to the construction of shelters, they were working on the welfare and development of hard-to-reach communities. Eleven million were benefiting every year from these organisations, and at the moment it seems there’s nothing in place to replace them.”Not everyone The Independent spoke to took a dim view of INGOs. Naseba Bibi, a widow and mother of three, said she had first-hand experience of the work charities do in the country.“My husband passed away seven years ago, and afterwards me and my children were facing serious financial issues. My parents and in-laws were not in a position to support us,” she said.Naseba was introduced through a friend to an NGO offering women training in sewing and embroidery. She said it was something she never would have considered before the death of her husband, a taxi driver and the only bread-winner in the family.Naseba said she did not know what to do now the NGO was winding up. She urged the government to reconsider its decision.Plan International said it alone had supported 26m people during two decades of projects in Pakistan. In a statement, the charity said it was “deeply saddened” to announce it was being forced to close in the country on government orders. “No reason was provided” for the decision, it added.“We are extremely concerned about the impact this will have on communities, particularly hundreds of thousands of children, that Plan International supported through its development work,” the statement read.ActionAid’s general secretary Adriano Campolina said the charity would be “honoured to return” if the government changed its mind. “Our dedicated team of Pakistani nationals supported more than 1.4 million people over the past decade,” he said.“The end of their vital work with marginalised groups is a worrying development for civil society in a country where a fifth of the population is still living in poverty.”International Alert said it had ceased operations after being denied registration and was “waiting to hear from the government on the reapplication process”.“In the meantime, we are trying to minimise negative impact on our partners and beneficiaries in this process,” a spokesperson said.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

But there’s still more to do.I welcome The Sun’s campaign for more help for Universal Credit and urge ministers to do more to aid those in society who need it the most.He said the extra money pumped in from the Budget was “helping an enormous amount” but there’s still further to go to ensure the system works for everyone.And he called on ministers to make sure that help for vulnerable Brits when moving over onto Universal Credit is properly funded.Now that stage one of the rollout is complete, ministers must make sure Universal Support programme to help Brits with their applications and debt problems is properly funded so we can identy people who have problems and get them help as soon as possible.And ex-DWP boss Damian Green said that reducing the taper rate further would help Brits.He told The Sun: Universal Credit is a great system which helps people into work, and allows them to increase their hours of work without benefit problems. A few important changes would make it an even better system, and I hope we can make them in the coming years. I was delighted to reduce the taper rate in , and would like this taken further.Frank Field MP, Chair of the Work and Pensions Select Committee, also congratulated The Sun on its campaign.He said: My constituents, and hard-up families across the country, need the government to change its position quickly.There is a whole series of problems the government must fix to make Universal Credit work.Closing the yawning gap of five weeks for the first payment, making it pay to get a job and put in more hours, and offering proper support for childcare so parents can get in to work are three important places to start.And Tory rising star Johnny Mercer, MP for Plymouth Moor View, said the party had to make sure they were there for people in their time of need.He told The Sun: “The British people support and understand the need for welfare reform, of that I have no doubt.Butthere are too many stories, too many people being seriously disadvantaged or not looked after in their hour of need, we will not win this argument, and the country will be the poorer for it.I urge the Treasury and the Prime Minister to reinvest the money originally committed for universal credit and make it the defining policy of a modern compassionate Conservative party it deserves to be.While charities including Child Poverty Action Group, Save the Children, Joseph Rowntree Foundation and TurnUs also backed our calls.Kevin Watkins, chief executive of Save the Children, said: “Three cheers for The Sun’s brilliant campaign to stand up for hard-working families.“The Government must change the system before even more families are pushed into the red as they wait for support.”Universal Credit replaces six benefits with a single monthly payment. One million people are already receiving it and by the time the system is fully rolled out in , nearly  million will be on it.But there are big problems with the flagship new system - it takes  weeks to get the first payment and it could leave some families worse off by thousands of pounds a year.And while working families can claim back up to % of their childcare costs, they must find the money to pay for childcare upfront - we’ve heard of families waiting up to  months for the money.Working parents across the country told us they’ve been unable to take on more hours - or have even turned down better paid jobs or more hours because of the amount they get their benefits cut.It’s time to Make Universal Credit work. We want the government to:Together, these changes will help Make Universal Credit Work.Labour’s Shadow Treasury Minister Anneliese Dodds said more changes to Universal Credit were vital.She said: “This Christmas many people are facing insecurity and hardship as a result of the Government’s failed roll out of Universal Credit.“The Sun is absolutely right to campaign for changes to Universal Credit, including cutting the waiting time for payment, but the roll out must be stopped first.“Universal Credit was meant to lt people out of poverty, but all too often it is pushing people into debt, rent arrears and leaving them at risk of destitution.“Labour will stop the roll out of Universal Credit and ensure that we have a social security system that is there for any of us when we need it.”The Liberal Democrats and the SNP also backed our call.Ex Lib Dem boss Tim Farron said: “Instead of fixing the many obvious problems with Universal Credit, the Conservatives have put ideology ahead of evidence and allowed the benefit to become a new poll tax.“The Liberal Democrats strongly support The Sun’s campaign to salvage Universal Credit by cutting its unnecessarily long waiting times and enabling people to keep more of what they earn.”Ruth George MP for High Peak : “None of us want to live in a country where children go hungry, families have to visit food banks, and more people homeless on our streets - just some of the consequences of the disastrous cuts to Universal Credit. Well done The Sun for this campaign. I hope that by all coming together, we can change this cruel policy before another  million households are affected.”Stephen Lloyd MP for Eastbournesaid: I am delighted The Sun are launching this campaign to bring fairness into the governments flagship Universal Credit program. With over ,, people, many of whom in employment, being moved onto Universal Credit over the next couple of years it is vital the government pull out all the stops to ensure it succeeds. Speeding up payments to recipients and making sure those in low-income jobs earn more than they wouldthey were unemployed and on benefit, would make a signicant and positive dference. Common sense from our soaraway Sun. Robert Halfon, Tory MP for Harlowsaid: I am backing the Suns campaign because the Department for Work and Pensions must stand up for making work pay. The defining mission of our Government has to be to help hard working and lower income people who are doing the right thing. They deserve a fair days pay for a fair days work, without needing to worry that the benefits they rely on will be taken away, keeping them in the poverty trap and making it affordable to work. I welcome the extra funding that the Government gave to Universal Credit in the Budget but they need to do more and fast.  Lord John Birdsaid: “By processing Universal Credit payments faster, and by making families childcare payments upfront, the Government has an opportunity to show that its listening to the concerns of struggling people and that it wants to make its flagship welfare programme work.”Ronnie Campbell, MP for Blyth Valley,said: “I support the campaign”.Geraint Davies, MP for Swansea West,said: “In Swansea families wait cold and hungry for their first universal credit payment only to find its been hammered by tax because of a punitive earning threshold. Job Centres are so tied up with claimants needing help with applications that they aren’t able to help people find a job. So more people are using foodbanks and run up debts. That’s why I support the Sun’s campaign to make payments faster and fairer for those most in need.”Liam Byrne, MP for Birmingham, Hodge Hill,said: “Universal credit has turned into a punishment beating for thousands of our neighbours whose only crime is to be low-paid, poor or disabled. We are the fth richest country on earth. It is simply inexcusable for an arm of government to be forcing people to go without and so I fully support The Suns campaign to get these changes made before this careless policy hurts even more families.”Bob Blackman MP for Harrow East,said: “I support the policy that is Universal Credit and its reformist core: replacing six complex benefits with a single unied system.What I am concerned about is ensuring it is properly funded and I have lobbied ministers on this point.Another concern of mine, and one which is covered by this campaign, is ensuring claimants are paid in good time.I am pleased to be supporting this campaign.Nik Dakin, MP for Scunthorpe,said: “I support the campaign to make Universal Credit work for people and families.  That means cutting the time people have to wait to get their money so they don’t have to rely on foodbanks to feed their families.  Parents should get more of their money upfront instead of being paid in arrears.”Rushanara Ali, MP for Bethnal Green and Bow,said: “The Government is in complete denial over the problems with Universal Credit. This programme is pushing millions of families into poverty, causing a rise in homelessness, debt and a % increase in foodbank use.  “This policy disproportionately hurts women, people with disabilities and those from ethnic minorities. It is sickening that the government will limit and delay funds for those who need it most.“A particularly cruel part of the Universal Credit welfare reform is the ‘two-child limit’ policy, which limits the level of financial support to low-income families with more than two children, which, ultimately punishes children.”Yvonne Fogue, MP for Makerfield,said:  A social security system that increases poverty rather than alleviating it isn’t worthy of the name. Which is why I support the need to make vital changes to Universal Credit.  Late payments and underpayments are propelling our most vulnerable citizens into the arms of unscrupulous payday lenders and must end.Steve McCabe, MP for Birmingham Selly Oak,said: “Universal Credit was meant to simply the benefits system, help people find employment and make work pay. Unsurprisingly this government has made a shambles of it and what we are actually seeing is millions of people pushed into debt and into the arms of loan sharks because they are forced to wait over a month to receive their first payment. Government cuts mean that working people are actually worse off under Universal Credit than they were before and families are telling me there are facing late payment fees from their nursery because of problems with the Universal credit childcare payments. How is this fair I am calling on the new Secretary of State to urgently review the system and make the necessary changes so my constituents aren’t faced between the prospect of heating or eating this Christmas.SNP Work and Pensions spokesperson Neil Gray added: “The UK government’s appalling Universal Credit system is pushing households into hardship, debt and a reliance on emergency support including foodbanks as the welfare system is just not there for them when they need it.“The SNP have demanded the UK Government make these changes since the early stages of rollout and any campaign to put these wrongs right deserves support from political parties across the spectrum.The Government must listen to the calls of the public, charities, parliaments, and newspapers - including this campaign by The Sun - to fix Universal Credit once and for all.”And charities helping struggling Brits on Universal Credit also demanded ministers sit up and take notice of The Suns campaign.Chief executive of Child Poverty Action Group Alison Garnham said: “Universal credit isn’t fit for families or ready for further roll-out.“The Sun’s ideas for fixing Universal Credit are spot on - they’re based in the real world where people don’t have money to tide them over for five weeks before their first payment or extra cash for paying childcare fees upfront.“We hope that ministers will act on The Sun’s campaign and take steps to put things right.Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd said she welcomed the input of Sun readers to the debate on Universal Credit.She said: Universal Credit has helped people into work, giving them the confidence of a pay packet and boosting their self-esteem.In my first few weeks at the Department I’ve seen what a force for good Universal Credit can be.However I know that there are problems, and I am committed to tackling those issues.We need to build on what Universal Credit already delivers, ensuring that we do even more to look after families and claimants who need us.And I very much welcome the input of Sun readers as I do this.Campbell Robb, chief executive of the independent Joseph Rowntree Foundation , said: “The government should listen to The Sun’s campaign and make changes to Universal Credit. “Low pay and high costs like rent and childcare are locking families into impossible situations - and the wait to receive support can leave many on the brink.”Alison Taylor, from TurnUs, said: “We fully support the Sun’s campaign to improve Universal Credit.“We have seen people who have been pushed into housing and fuel arrears and struggling to cover everyday essentials by having to wait a minimum of five weeks for their entitlement.“Reducing this to two weeks could drastically improve the financial and emotional wellbeing of iniduals and families.”Brendan Sarsfield, chief executive of housing association Peabody, said: “Universal Credit isn’t working yet. The principle is right, but in practice it’s causing real hardship for people on low incomes. “We know that faster payments, upfront support with childcare costs, and letting people keep more of their wages before losing benefits would transform lives and offer a route out of poverty. “That’s why Peabody is backing the Sun’s campaign to Make Universal Credit Work.”Lucie Russell, Director, Fair By Design, and co-founder of the Big Issue: “The bottom line is that Universal Credit is just not up to scratch. This is causing hardship and distress to millions of people around the country. We support the Sun’s calls for an urgent change in the Universal Credit system, so that being poor stops costing more.” Rosie Fergusson, Chief Executive, Gingerbread: “Universal Credit isn’t working for single parents like Jess, who is on a zero-hours contract and finding it dficult to pay the nursery fees upfront. It doesn’t need to be this way. We will continue to press for change to make Universal Credit work for people like Jess.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT000424156981.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"eu choosing not to give pm what she needs","story":"This is not just The Sun’s view. Former EU leaders are imploring their successors to see sense.Ex-Commission President José Manuel Barroso says: “If there’s political will the excellent lawyers of the EU can find a creative solution for the backstop.“It is crucial to avoid resentment. I hope the EU council understands it. There will be no third country more important than the UK.”His predecessor Romano Prodi has also said the EU could give ground.But it will take more than vague promises. Our power to exit the Irish backstop has to be legally binding — and approved by Attorney General Geoffrey Cox.It seems vanishingly unlikely. But it’s the one thing that could yet see Mrs May’s deal rise like Lazarus from the dead.PHILIP Hammond’s “extremists” jibe at Brexit-supporting Tory backbenchers was reckless and stupid.If anything is likely to hasten a catastrophic split in the Tories it’s the Chancellor of a minority Government declaring war on scores of his own MPs. But it also displayed staggering ­contempt for politicians committed to honouring the referendum and the election manesto on which they stood.Politics has been debased by charlatans making promises they dump as soon as it’s convenient. It is in a critical stateNOT doing so is “extreme”.If there are extremists in Parliament besides the obvious, Corbyn and McDonnell, it is those playing roulette with national stability by attempting to stage a second referendum before the verdict of the first is carried out.It is incredible that it is considered mainstream, noble even, of these MPs to renege on promises they made and votes they cast — and to refuse to honour the majority’s will because the losing minority must have their “final say”.All while performing intellectual ­contortions to justy what, deep down, they know is unjustiable: imposing their will over the public’s. That is a far more extreme position than anything on the Tory backbenches.“Everyone knows who won,” says ­Benedict Cumberbatch in the trailer for Channel ’s upcoming Brexit movie.We do. Some MPs have forgotten.FOR  years The Sun has cheered on Britain’s forces at our Millies spectacular.We hope we did them proud again last night. It’s an honour for us to lead the nation’s salute to our troops.They are the best of British.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They need to do far more when it comes to outreach, actually visiting isolated and deprived areas and talking to children years before they start thinking about university.Otherwise, a child growing up in a community where very few people have a degree will believe university just isn’t for them.The top universities all have their own outreach policies, and don’t work together to reach particularly under-represented parts of the country, which means entire towns can often end up being ignored.The political world doesn’t help, either. A young, white, working-class boy might not think he fits into the current Parliament, and so a vicious cycle of the same sort of people from the same sort of backgrounds going into politics continues. We know all the figures about the percentage of MPs who went to private schools , or that  prime ministers were schooled at Eton.But what we are less likely to realise is that there are entire towns in this country that have never, ever had an MP who was born and schooled locally.Or that the cost of getting into politics means thatyou are from a working-class background, your only hope of becoming an MP is landing a well-paid job first. And that tends to be easieryou’ve been to university.MPs tend to recruit their researchers straight from university. Researchers go on to become special advisers or take other political jobs before becoming MPs, so the political gene pool is articially shallow from the beginning.It’s handy to have MPs who hail from all kinds of backgrounds, but especially useful to have people who grew up in tough circumstances.When governments make mistakes, it is usually the most vulnerable people who suffer first. A Parliament of old Etonians can’t always instinctively realise when a policy is going to cause trouble.I don’t need to tell you that the current Parliament isn’t working very well.From those at the top of government who have failed to take big decisions on Brexit, to the backbenchers who have been busy plotting away, a lot of people in Westminster seem to be lacking a sense of perspective.This week the drama has all been about Brexit, but the infighting means that serious policy problems on social care, domestic abuse and, yes, education are largely ignored.If we made it easier for any bright kid from any background to get to university, perhaps we would have more competition for Parliamentary seats — and end up with better politicians.SoDamian Hinds got his way with universities, he’d be putting the future mediocre politicians out of a job.There might even be entire weeks in politics when you’d have a chance of noticing comments made by the Education Secretary, rather than being distracted by the self-indulgent way in which politicians of all persuasions have ended up conducting themselves.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Tory MPs won’t risk it and the Ulster Unionists know they will never be more powerful.Anyway, Jeremy told Labour MPs to trigger Article  and set the clock ticking down to departure in March. There isn’t time for an election, the public expect MPs to sort it out and there’s no guarantee it would solve the problem.I asked Jeremy this week what his policy would bethere was an election: would he campaign to stay in, promise another referendum or, after campaigning against the EU for decades, uphold the referendum - but he refused to give any answer at all.And who can be certain he’d win  He should be miles ahead in the polls, but when asked who would make the best Prime Minister, the public still back Theresa May.

Who thinks we could get all the benefits without paying a penny Imagine asking to use a gym but refusing to join or even pay – and wanting a say in how it’s run!Let’s face facts: the EU isn’t waiting to give a dferent Prime Minister a better deal. Whether it’s Boris Johnson or Jeremy Corbyn, they won’t roll over and give us everything we want.It’s not only Theresa May who says it. Nor even just Juncker. Merkel says the deal can’t be changed.Macron and Ireland’s Taoiseach say so too. Not one EU leader said they are open to renegotiating it.In , % of Labour constituencies voted for Brexit. Labour heartlands like Sunderland, Hartlepool, Bolsover, Wakefield or Doncaster all voted leave. Here in the West Midlands, people voted to leave in some of the highest numbers of all.In , our manesto promised to uphold the referendum – no s, no buts, no second referendum.Ordinary, decent people who voted leave believed us. Lots of people voted leave to make politicians sit up and listen.With trust in politics at an all-time low, we can’t discount that lightly. Another referendum would take months and there’s no agreement on what the questions would be.I’ve listened to lots of people in Dudley and there’s not much evidence people have changed their minds. Eventhey had, who thinks a narrow remain vote would settle it That’s why I think our choice is between Theresa May’s deal or leaving with no deal at all. I joined the Labour Party to fight for ordinary people and their jobs must come first.This week I met Jaguar Land Rover, a world-beating British company employing , British workers.Like manufacturers up and down the country they believe a no deal Brexit would threaten their business and the jobs of people who depend on it.Delays at ports will cost jobs. Thousands of parts go into every car – some cross the channel several times before the car is complete.They all have to arrive at plants in the Midlands or on Merseyside at exactly the right moment and in the right order. Half the parts for cars made in Britain typically come from Europe.It would be greatthey were made here, but that can’t happen quickly. Worse, the supply chain that has grown up here in the last decade could decide to leavewe get the wrong deal.Leaving on WTO terms would also put people out of work too because tarfs would increase the price of cars built in Britain and sold in Europe by ten per cent.Theresa May’s deal isn’t perfect but is still our best option in front of us to protect jobs, keep employment and environmental standards, deliver a fair immigration system and safeguard border arrangements in Ireland.For all its flaws, the Brexit deal meets these priorities.It commits to maintain ‘high standards of free and fair trade and workers’ rights, consumer and environmental protection’, and a level playing-field on regulations.And it ensures that there is no hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.There will never be a perfect deal. Butwe want to avoid trust in politics being damaged even more, andwe want to protect jobs and standards, we must think long and hard before rejecting the only deal on offer.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Taxpayers funnelled over £ billion to Transport for London last year, only to see it frittered away on these stratospheric wages and benefits.Increasingly, the role of a Tube driver is getting easier, with more sophisticated rolling stock requiring less human input. And the deranged trade unions need to be called out for making commuters lives misery and committing daylight robbery against hard-working families.The Tube has this year been shut down by strikes over claims of unfair treatment.The Central Line walkout is expected to to run from from Friday  to Saturday December , while the Bakerloo Line will close on Boxing Day and Monday January .Announcing the strikes, RMT general secretary Mick Cash said: RMT members are rightly angry that staffing levels on the Bakerloo Line have been hacked back to the bone, presenting a serious danger to staff and passengers alike.Transport for London said the approximate three per cent of drivers who earned more than £, a year were highly skilled test drivers and instructors who have additionally responsibilities to train the drivers safely.A spokesperson added: The average base pay of a Tube driver is £,. The overwhelming majority earned total remuneration – including base pay, overtime, employer pension contributions and certain allowances - of £, or considerably less.Just over three per cent of drivers earned total remuneration over this, largely because they are highly skilled test drivers and instructors who have additional responsibilities to train drivers in the safe operation of trains using new, advanced signalling systems.“These terms and conditions were agreed with trade unions in . As with all other agreements made between London Underground and our unions, we have adhered to these terms and conditions since.

We’ve faced much bigger challenges in our history.”It was a shrewd move by the ambitious Foreign Secretary.  Leaving the EU without a deal has suddenly become a hot favourite with Brexit leadership rivals. It is also the outcome feared most in the capitals of Europe.The German official’s response is shocking proof that Theresa May’s mantra: “No Deal is better than a Bad Deal” was always seen as an empty bluff.It also refutes the claim that her widely-loathed withdrawal plan is the only option available from Brussels. Mr Hunt brushed aside Project Fear’s portrayal of a “Car Crash” Brexit and insisted Britain can cope with all challenges.“We shouldn’t pretend there won’t be disruption,” he admitted. “That’s why as a responsible government we have to make all the preparations necessary.”Far from the clf-edge, car-crash nightmare painted by the Treasury, BBC and CBI, a clean Brexit is entirely manageable. It would set us free to trade on terms set by the Government in the interests of the British people.We would save the £billion ransom to Brussels — and use some of the cash to buy time from the EU for more detailed planning. And it would see off slippery Tony Blair’s treacherous call for a second referendum.Yes, there would be turbulence as the UK adjusted to ending  years of EU membership.  But experts such as ex-Bank of England governor Mervyn King predict we will look back on this moment and barely see a blip on our economic growth chart.Indeed, economists believe Britain will thrive and prosper once free from EU shackles. So why are Remainer MPs so implacably determined to stop it  Why are they reneging on their own manesto pledges and threatening to overturn the legislation which set the March deadline Simple. Once we are out, we are out for ever. We can prove we are a great world economy, trading to every corner of the globe — Europe included. We would never rejoin the cosy exclusive club beloved of the political elite, unelected bigwigs and business fat cats who ride the Brussels gravy train.Only  per cent of UK goods — one eighth — goes to Europe, with the rest heading for the wider world or home markets.The EU share of world trade is on the slide. Game-changing technology is alien to its socialist outlook. Where, for instance, is the EU equivalent of Apple, Microsoft, Amazon or Google Brussels turns its face against progress — allegedly because it threatens jobs. Yet Eurozone unemployment is double Britain’s and criminally high among young people.Remainers claim under-s are fans of the EU and would vote Remain in a second referendum. Labour is trying to cash in by cutting the voting age from  to . Yet a revealing new poll suggests the youth of Britain and Europe sees right through the EU drive for a political and economic superstate.Given the choice, they pick free markets, low tax and low regulation over the suffocatingly interventionist Grand Project. These tech-savvy youngsters can see Europe is trailing behind while unimaginable opportunities from robot technology and Articial Intelligence unfold.Britain would miss out too, barred by EU regulation,we tied ourselves indefinitely to this inward-looking protectionist bloc. A Full Brexit might cause a few short- term hiccups for just-in-time deliveries, but they will be quickly forgotten as decades of opportunity are opened up by Brexit.UKplc has nothing to fear but Project Fear itself. Warnings of economic chaos, mass unemployment and house price crashes have repeatedly proved to be .The same scare stories were peddled by the same people who  years ago predicted Britain would sink unless we joined the European single currency. We never looked back. It is the Eurozone that is now sinking, with Greece already under water. Britain’s jobs miracle is the envy of EuropeThe Eurozone is mired in a crisis inflicted by uncontrolled mass immigration and youth alienation.  The most patriotic Frenchman couldn’t claim Paris is nice at this time of the year. By contrast Britain is a hive of activity, with steady growth, booming exports and a jobs miracle which is the envy of Europe.The UK is a magnet to the EU’s unemployed and to foreign investment worth billions from tech giants such as Apple, Amazon and Google — despite Brexit.Leaving without a deal on March  is our best chance of implementing the  referendum and escaping from a teetering, corrupt and arrogant political fantasy before it implodes.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I hope she reaches out to him.Another added: You had to really feel for him, he looks and sounds so lost without her.A third pointed out: However many visits, handshakes and hugs Meghan may give and have given all over the world it means nothingyou cannot resolve the issues and upset with her own father.

Parliament has a democratic duty to deliver what the British people voted for.Mrs May’s patience snapped after an exhausting week of clashes with MPs and Eurocrats blocking her departure deal.Mr Blair hit back by saying that Mrs Mays stance was irresponsible.He wants to ask for an extension of Article  to have the time for another vote, or re-open talks with the EU.But the bloc has said time and time again that more talks are NOT an option.It was his decision to unleash a vast, uncontrolled influx of migrants on a country ill-equipped for it... all, as his adviser later admitted, to “rub the Right’s nose in ersity”.It was his lust for wealth after leaving office that saw him torch what was left of his reputation and line his pockets with dictators’ millions.Now Blair is hell-bent on setting a match to our democracy itself as he heads the campaign to reverse the biggest mandate in its history, sabotaging our Brexit negotiating position in the process.And so the trail of destruction he has left for  years goes on.

The Britpop legend and Gorillaz star today backed a citizens assembly to break the deadlock over leaving the EU. The idea would see a randomly chosen group of  members of the public recommend to MPs what they should do next. Its claimed such a mini-parliament could be organised in eight weeks to start the process of listening to the public. The idea is backed in a letter also signed by former Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams and prizewinning authors Ian McEwan and Jonathan Coe. Together they wrote to : Anger and resentment are growing, splitting families, communities and our country.  Without a new intervention, the toxic culture which has infected public le will irrevocably damage democracy and the future for us all. Albarn shot to fame with Blur in the early s before fronting animated band Gorillaz and launching solo projects. Blur is on long-term hiatus. The singer said last month Brexit doesn’t make any sense to me whatsoever. He told an interviewer: Brexit has revealed terrible truths about the mental health of the English. Something that was so painful for so many years was eventually resolved, and now we’re going back. Todays letter is also backed by the campaign group Unlock Democracy, Dr Jess Garland of the Electoral Reform Society, Neal Lawson of the think tank Compass and Labour peer Ruth Lister. They wrote: Citizens’ assemblies operate around the world to create a neutral forum for evidence-based, participative decision-making. In recent years, they have been used in Ireland, British Columbia and Iceland, and in national and local government in the UK, as democratic “circuit-breakers” on contentious and complex issues.Taking eight weeks to organise, such assemblies are constructed of a randomly chosen representative group of up to  members of the public.They hear a broad range of evidence and arguments on a subject, which they discuss and weigh up before making considered recommendations to their political representatives. It comes as the nation, MPs and the Tory Cabinet remain deadlocked about where to go next with Brexit.  Theresa May has almost hope of getting the UKs Brexit deal through Parliament, and a bid to improve it with the EU ended in disaster last week. Now a string of top ministers have publicly called on the PM to let MPs take control of Brexit by voting on what happens next. Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd said: Nothing should be off the table, we should consider all options. Business Secretary Greg Clark said: I think Parliament should be invited to say what it would agree with.

She will claim a Peoples Vote would break faith with the British people and do irreparable damage to democracy in an address to Parliament. Yet the Prime Minister has been forced into this unprecedented attack - after facing pressure from within her own Cabinet. She has almost hope of getting the UKs Brexit deal through Parliament, and a bid to improve it with the EU ended in disaster last week. So a string of top ministers have publicly called on her to let MPs take control of Brexit. They urged her to let Parliament vote on a range of options for what happens next.  That could lead to the question being thrown back to the British people almost three years after the  EU referendum. Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd, whose brother Roland is chairman of the Peoples Vote campaign, today declared nothing should be off the table.

She will back Theresa Mays deal in a vote in the Commons, but told Sky News: After that we need to find out where the will of parliament is, where the majority of MPs will vote in Parliament. And nothing should be off the table, we should consider all options.  Business Secretary Greg Clark said MPs should pass Mrs Mays Brexit deal when it eventually comes to a vote next month. But he told the BBC: If that were not to be successful, we do need to have an agreement, we cant just have continuing uncertainty. And I think Parliament should be invited to say what it would agree with. Thats something I think businesses up and down the country will expect, elected members to take responsibility rather than just be critics.  Solicitor General Robert Buckland said a free vote on the next steps might well work. He told the BBCs Westminster Hour: I thinkall the parties agreed to it then it’s something that might well work, but I think it would be imbalancedone party did it and the other did not.” International Trade Secretary Liam Fox indicated he could support MPs being given a free vote on Brexit options. He said: I wouldn’t have a huge problem with parliament as a whole having a say on what the options were, because it wasn’t the government that was given an instruction by the referendum it was parliament.  And Education Secretary Damian Hinds said: I think there is a value in, sort of, flushing out what these ious dferent options are. The Prime Minister will use an address to the Commons to say a new national poll would do irreparable damage to the integrity of British politics. It comes after close allies of Mrs May distanced themselves from reports that they were manoeuvring to bring about a fresh referendum. The PM will say: Let us not break faith with the British people by trying to stage another referendum.  Another vote which would do irreparable damage to the integrity of our politics, because it would say to millions who trusted in democracy, that our democracy does not deliver. Another vote which would likely leave us no further forward than the last. And another vote which would further ide our country at the very moment we should be working to unite it. But Labour MP Chuka Umunna said: We only formally launched Peoples Vote back in April. The fact that now, after , marched for it and over  million signed [a] petition, the PM should make this campaign the centre piece of her attack today illustrates that our campaign is working. The appearance follows Mrs Mays de facto deputy, Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington, and the PMs chief of staff, Gavin Barwell, both dismissing reports they are planning for a new referendum.  And Mrs May faces a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday following a frantic few days when key ministers have jockeyed for attention and staked out strong Brexit positions. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said Britain would prosper evenit quit the EU with no deal, while Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd argued firmly against leaving the bloc without an agreement. Prominent Brexiteers like International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt also look set to make their views known. And former foreign secretary Boris Johnson railed against the idea of a second referendum.  Writing in the Daily , he said: A second referendum would provoke instant, deep and ineradicable feelings of betrayal. Mr Johnson said the idea that the Government would hold a fresh Brexit poll was sickening. Labour is insisting that Mrs May puts her Brexit deal to a vote in the Commons before Parliament rises for Christmas on Thursday. However, the party has made it clear it will not table a motion of no confidence in the Government until such a vote has been held.

The international development secretary has been holding secret talks with key members of the hardline European Research Group in a bid to win their support for a rumoured leadership bid. She is expected to unveil detailed plans for a managed no deal to cut the UKs Brexit bill tomorrow nightin a move which will fuel speculation she wants the top job. The Mirror understands that she worked on the proposals with ERG members including Michael Tomlinson, a former deputy chair of the group who has been tipped as a future campaign manager. Ms Mordaunt, who is the only cabinet minister to fail to publicly back the PMs Brexit deal, is expected to set out more detail of her own plan to pursue a free trade agreement. Theresa May’s authority, already weakened by her ing virtually empty-handed from Brussels last week, was in shreds tonight as ministers lined up to set out their own Brexit stalls.  Remainer Amber Rudd said she should “forge a consensus” across party lines, reaching a soft Brexit consensus, while foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt claimed the UK would “flourish and prosper” after a no deal Brexit. However, Mordaunt’s engagement with leading members of the ERG will raise eyebrows as the Brexiteer group was the force behind last week’s attempts to oust Mrs May as Tory leader. One senior Tory source said: Obviously people talk to one another but theres a pretty big leap between having a chat with Jacob [Rees-Mogg] or Steve [Baker] and working with key figures in the ERG to pull together a plan that is ultimately your plan for government. These are the people who are literally trying to get rid of her boss.

An ERG insider added: “Penny is the most ERG person left in the Cabinet so it’s hardly surprising that she’s fishing in the pool. Mrs May has come under growing pressure from her ministers to give MPs a free “indicative” vote on all the Brexit options this side of Christmas. They will attempt to persuade her at Cabinet tomorrow [Tuesday] that the votes would show that none of the alternatives, including a Norway-style deal or a Canada-style free trade agreement, would get majority support in parliament. The ministers have been buoyed by their success in getting the PM to cancel last week’s meaningful vote.  Education secretary Damian Hinds said it was the only way to flush out levels of parliamentary support for the dferent plans, while Trade secretary Liam Fox suggested it could break the political deadlock. Other ministers thought to back the plan include Ms Rudd, Chancellor Philip Hammond, Justice Secretary David Gauke and Business Secretary Greg Clark. Downing Street has rejected the proposal. One No  insider said: “The idea that this solves anything or is a path to anywhere is wishful thinking.” Mrs May will tomorrow hit out at calls for a new Brexit referendum after her chief of staff Gavin Barwell and de facto deputy PM David Lidington were accused of preparing for one behind her back. But the chances of a second referendum appeared to have increased in the wake of the PM’s decision to pull the vote on her deal and herfrom the EU summit without any legally binding assurances on the unpopular Irish border backstop. But she will tell MPs: “Let us not break faith with the British people by trying to stage another referendum. Another vote which would do irreparable damage to the integrity of our politics, because it would say to millions who trusted in democracy, that our democracy does not deliver. Another vote which would likely leave us no further forward than the last. And another vote which would further ide our country at the very moment we should be working to unite it.  The PM’s closest aides denied they were either planning for, or wanted, a second referendum. But both men are understood to believe that is where the country will end up. Mr Barwell tweeted: Happy to confirm I am *not* planning a nd referendum with political opponents .” Sources close to Mr Lidington also strongly denied that he had suggested to Labour MPs at a meeting last week that he was interested in pursuing the option. A wave of no deal planning is expected to be unleashed by Whitehall departments this week with preparations for a range of doomsday scenarios set into motion. Downing Street today dismissed reports that people will be advised not to book holidays after March next year according to no deal contingency plans. Home secretary Sajid Javid is also finally expected to publish the Governments immigration plans on Wednesday, with a row brewing over low-skilled workers. Meanwhile, Labour’s top team was split over the timing of holding a no confidence vote in the government. The party’s elections guru Andrew Gwynne MP said it would try to force a Brexit vote before Christmas but said Labour would not try to oust the PM until this had had taken place. But Labour’s chief whip, Nick Brown, told the BBC it was “certainly a possibility” that the party could table a no confidence vote in the Government as early as Monday. He said the fact that  of her own MPs had voted against her had given “pause for thought” on the timing of the vote. “Clearly we would have itwe had a prospect of winning,” he added. Deputy leader Tom Watson and shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer are among those backing swt action, while those backing Jeremy Corbyns more cautious approach include shadow chancellor John McDonnell and shadow education secretary Angela Rayner.

A poll of , teachers in England highlighted how austerity is blighting the lives of poorer families...with their shychildren bearing the brunt. One said: “Kids come in without winter coats even in the coldest weather.” Another added: “Struggling families get food packages, clothing and Christmas presents. We are starting a breakfast for every child.” Dr Mary Bousted, Joint General Secretary of the National Education Union, which carried out the survey, said: “This is a Dickensian picture of the poverty that far too many children and their families are having to endure.” Charles Dickens’ famous  novel Oliver Twist exposed the grinding poverty faced by many children in Victorian England. And now the spectre of want is ing to modern Britain.   Dr Bousted added: “The Government is out of touch with the new reality of children’s daily lives: with what it means to live without enough money for basics, such as food, shoes and adequate clothing. “The Government has failed to recognise the cost of cuts to schools, [to] children’s services and the social security system.” She urged “an urgent change to national policies”s and went on to blast the Tories for a “failure to address the in-work poverty faced by one in five.” More than six out  teachers said more families could not afford adequate winter clothes or shoes than three years ago. Nearly half said “holiday hunger” and housing issues, such as children living in shyovercrowded or temporary accommodation, were also worse than three years ago. And a shocking % said schools provide extra items for children and their hard-up families. One teacher said: “Good shoes are too expensive so students are coming in cheap shoes that last a few weeks at most. “I often have students asking meI can glue their shoes shyback together because the sole has fallen off.”   While one revealed that school attendance dropped to % after heavy rain “because shoes [were] damaged and many had no extra pair.” The survey said poverty was also contributing to more absences from school, behavioural issues, lack of concentration and pupils turning up late. North Denes Primary in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, have even started its own foodbank after noticing pupils were turning up hungry. Last night Angela Rayner, Labour’s Shadow Education Secretary, said: ”These figures paint a shocking picture of the impact of the Tories’ austerity on a generation of children. “Schools are being left to fend for themselves and deal with the consequences.” However the Government insisted: “Since  there are , fewer children living in absolute poverty, employment is at a record and we’re committed to ensuring every child gets the very best chances. “We spend pound billion a year on welfare to support those who need it most. On top of this, we’ve introduced funding to support disadvantaged shyfamilies in the holidays.” TIME TO END THIS MONSTROUS INJUSTICE By Louisa McGeehan, Director of Policy, Child Poverty Action Group “There is no denying the prevalence of child poverty in our schools and some teachers’ experiences are absolutely heart breaking. We know that in a class of  children, on average  are growing up in poverty. This means missing out on opportunities to fulfil their potential and enjoy childhood, it also means sometimes going hungry or missing out on trips and other activities. Schools can’t address this alone - as a compassionate nation we need to re-invest in children and tackle child poverty urgently by restoring the value of child benefit, ending the freeze on social security benefits and abolishing the  child policy that discriminates unfairly against some children. The growth in in-work poverty is a particularly worrying trend. Because of zero-hour or short-hour contracts and increasingly insecure minimum wage work, many children are growing up in poverty when at least one of their parents work. Our recent research on the cost of a child in  found that  parents with  children working full-time on the national minimum wage still can’t earn enough to meet their family’s needs even at a minimum no-frills standard. A lone parent in the same position would need to work in a job paying at least an average wage to meet the family’s needs. This growth in in-work poverty means thatfamilies earn just above the threshold, their children miss out on free school meals. “It’s not just teachers who see first hand the impact of increasing child poverty. Our work with paediatricians found that children are sick as a direct result of being poor and the impact of this is lelong. Sometimes families can’t visit sick children in hospital because they can’t afford travel costs or to miss a day of work and some children couldn’t be sent home from hospital when medically fit because the family’s housing conditions are so bad. For instance, a child needing electrical medical equipment but there is only one socket available for the fridge, cooking and everything . “ “Le is getting tougher for low-income families and poverty has an effect on all parts of a child’s le. It doesn’t have to be this way - poverty isn’t inevitable. We have tackled it before and can do this againthere is the political will to do it. Today’s children deserve no less.” "},{"url":null,"title":"theresa plays only card left","story":"NewsopinionTheresa May plays the only card she has left and its a joker - Mirror Politics morning briefingThe Prime Ministers ruling out of a second is a desperate move designed to deflect attention from her own failures and a ided CabinetShareCommentsByJason BeattieHead of politics:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsopinionThe Prime Minister is desperate to deflect attention \"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTheresa May will make yet another statement on Brexit to MPs this afternoon. After a weekend of reports that senior figures in No  and the Cabinet are exploring the option of a second referendum, the Prime Minister will insist that it is not happening . One of the more pitul aspects of Mrs May’s premiership is she has broken her word so often that when she categorically denies something the odds on it happening immediately shorten. Setting aside for the moment her nonsensical argument that additional democracy is somehow a betrayal of democracy, the Prime Minister’s rejection of a people’s vote reeks of desperation. She has been forced into this position because she needs to reassure Brexiteers that her Downing Street team is not colluding with MPs on the possibility of a second vote and she needs to deflect attention from the serious discussions under way about putting a range of Brexit options to Parliament in a bid to break the impasse and she needs cover for her own failure to wring any further concessions from the EU last week. Mrs May is also desperate to find a holding line that erts attention from the fact most of her Cabinet are plotting for a dferent Brexit while positioning for the now inevitable leadership contest. The Tory MP Sam Gyimah explained the PM’s tactics in a tweet this morning: “Downing St has stopped selling the PMs flawed deal. Instead we have displacement activity designed to distract from last weeks failed renegotiation. And a concerted attempt to discredit every plausible alternative as they run down the clock. This is not in the national interest.” In an especially clunky sentence, Mrs May will also claim another vote would “further ide our country at the very moment we should be working to unite it.” Given the polls show a majority now want a second referendum, her appeal for unity looks particularly forlorn.  You would have thought that Chris Grayling had this year’s competition to be the most disappointing Cabinet minister sewn up. Then along comes Jeremy Hunt with a late challenge in the form of his embracing of a “managed no deal Brexit.” It takes a special political gt to jump on the Leave bandwagon at the moment when most of other occupants are trying to bail out and the rest are summoning the wheelwrights before the whole charabanc completely topples over. There is also no such thing as a “managed no deal”, it is an oxymoron – and you do not have to been an expert at Scrabble to work out which word you can make from oxymoron to describe Mr Hunt. Surely he would have learnt by now from Mrs May’s experiences that there are no benefits which come from trying to ingratiate yourself with the Tory right  Even the Brexiteers are savvy enough to see through his blatant attempt to curry favour ahead of any leadership contest. And were he to win, how long do you think it would take before he realised their demands can never be satisfied  Todays agenda: .pm – Damian Hinds takes Education questions in the Commons. .pm – Theresa May statement on Brexit and last week’s EU summit. .pm – Representatives from Amazon, John Lewis and Debenhams give evidence to Housing, Communities and Local Government committee on the state of the high street. pm – Sir Philip Rutman, permanent secretary at the Home Office, is grilled by the Home Affairs select committee on the Windrush scandal.

Callum Sainsbury died after a battle against a rare form of epilepsy on Tuesday. Now his family are preparing for Christmas without the cheeky and charming lad. Tributes have been pouring in for the huge rugby fan, Wales Online reported. Callum, from Brynmawr, south Wales, was diagnosed with Ohtahara syndrome as a baby after he began having up to  seizures a day. Those with the condition are particularly susceptible to repeated chest infections. His family have described how he defied the odds, and was supported by his sisters Katelyn and Kelcea. Callums mum Aime said: Callum was so cheeky, he had me wrapped around his little fingerhe wanted something, He was just so charming - theres so much to say about him. He loved rugby and he loved Jurassic World, his favourite was the raptor Blue. Throughout this year, friends and family had been raising money for Callum to have the perfect Christmas after he had spent December  in hospital for the last three years. In November, family friend Sasha Wilks also organised for the Pen-Y-Cwm pupil to meet the Wales rugby squad during their autumn campaign. Since Callums death, fundraising has now begun to support his family with the cost of his funeral.  Amie, , said: For the last five and a half weeks, Callum didnt have one fit. He went to Ty Hafan last Thursday evening and he was fine. On the night he was on oxygen and we couldnt get him off it. On the Sunday he slept all the day through and didnt wake up at all. We wanted to make him comfortable. He was in a place that was calm and they really respected our wishes. I told all the staff they could come and say their goodbyes and they did.  Since Callums death on Tuesday, his family have been overwhelmed by messages of love and support from across the UK - including from Diversity star Ashley Banjo. Aime said: We got hold of Diversity, as we had met them before, to tell them and Ashley Banjo said we were a lovely family and that he was glad he had met Callum. I cant say enough to thank people for what they have done for me and my daughters and Paul. The support has been immense. The girls are holding it together but deep down I know its bothering them really badly. They were always by his side and loved him so much.  In a video thanking friends for their support, Amie added: Our boy is really going to be missed. Callum touched everyones heart. We will never ever forget him, we will talk of him every day and we love him to bits. We are having to deal with this just before Christmas but he is safe, he is not in pain anymore, he is not suffering any more.  Its so hard to know that hes gone and he will never be there with us but he is with us - hes in our hearts. I cant thank everyone enough for what you are doing right now. Its helping us so much.

But fear not - because there are ways of getting served ahead of the mob. Of course, you might think you already have it down. You might reckon you’re good at getting the staff’s attention  Or you may believe a cash tip is the way to go  Now, forget all that. A former employee at one of Cardfs busiest pubs told Wales Online how you can make the bar staff your new BFFs - and get served quickly as a result. And on New Years Eve, these tips might be even more important: . Don’t annoy the bar staff  Full stop. Do all you can to keep them in a happy mood. They might be paid the minimum wage to serve you drinks - but they can still make choices about who they serve first and who they serve at all. . Mind your manners This is common courtesy. We may look a little abnormal while sweating our heads off after hours behind a cramped bar, but please don’t forget we are still human. No manners equals no preferential treatment when you come back for more. . Have your wallet or purse in your hand when the staff member has finished serving your round Don’t act surprised when they ask you to pay for the booze you are about to guzzle while they have to settle for iced tap water. Get your money out, and stop time wasting. . Pay in cash If you watch closely enough, you may be able to see a barmaid die a little bit inside every time a punter pulls a Visa out of their wallet. It wastes so much valuable serving time. That said, it’s not as annoyingyou’ve made a humongous order or, say, added a drink on for said barmaid to have at the end of her sht.  We’re not allowed to accept them. We know it’s inconvenient and unhelpful, but there’s nothing we can do about it. Apologies. . Don’t wave cash in our faces to get attention  We know you’re there, even though we may avoid eye contact with all the staring faces who are mentally screaming ‘Can’t you go any faster !’ . Think about what you want to drink BEFORE it’s your turn to order  If you haven’t decided what drink you want to order by the time you move your way through a three-deep queue, then you’ve failed. We’ll move on to the decisive people before you can blink.  If you’re ft and a fag butt like me, reaching for glasses that are kept overhead is not easy. All the sympathetic drinkers who responded to my comment “If I can’t reach the glasses, you’re not getting served” and handed me clean glasses while ordering got extra kudos. Same goes for dirty glasses and punters complaining when we’ve run out. The faster we get them back, the faster we can clean them and get them back out again. . Try not to forget a drink when ordering a major round Please don’t come back to the bar five minutes later and demand one more drink. That said,you are going to do it, be polite. staff are well within their rights to tell you to queue again for being such a numpty. . Trust in the system  It may look like they haven’t got a clue who to serve next but there is usually an invisible system going on. Mine was usually to serve everyone from the Erdinger pump across to the Brains SA pump. Everyone out of that remit was on their own. . Have your own pecking order Although we do have a general idea of who’s been there a while and who’s just elbowed in, please have your own system. We can’t always swear on the Bible who was there first, andyou’re too busy bickering with the guy who may or may not have cut in front of you, we’ll move on. . Try not to get annoyed at family members of bar staff who get preferential treatment We know it’s hard, but you’d expect special treatmentyou were in their position too . If you’re going to delve into the minefield of small talk, make it worth our while Jokes  Great. Who do I think is going to win  Yes, that makes me feel like my limited rugby knowledge is valued. Why did the chicken cross the road  Just stop right there. How to stop nuisance calls and text messages . Don’t you dare have the audacity to complain about how long you’ve been waiting for a drink Technically, the ones behind the bar are the ones who’ve been waiting the longest for a drink. So zip it. If anyone has the right to complain about how hot it is, how loud it is, how claustrophobic it is because there are about a million people between you and the exit, it’s definitely not you. .

Employees encouraged them to safety by calling them and using the strong bonds they had developed with the apes. Once all of the orangutans had been accounted for, staff ensured the door back inside was closed.The animals then wrapped themselves in blankets as a comfort mechanism. Today, devastated staff confirmed all animals who survived are fine and attempts are being made to give them one-to-one health checks.Zoo bosses have also hailed the heroic staff after the fire broke out just before Saturday lunchtime in the Monsoon Forest complex. It quickly engulfed the building, with the whole park evacuated shortly afterwards, reports North Wales Live.   The dome-roofed centre is home to thousands of animals, including primates, crocodiles, snakes and fish. As the inferno raged, zoo staff went into the burning rainforest and brought the creatures - some of which are critically endangered - out to safety. At a press conference, the zoos animal and plant director Mike Jordan said while the larger animals had been rescued, some of the other species - including birds and fish - had died. He said: We know some animals have died. The house contained everything from spiders to stick insects, fish, frogs - it was an incredibly complex forest environment. “Where the fire broke out, we know it was in the vicinity of some fish and insects, and that area has been completely destroyed by fire.   We cannot confirm the exact numbers [of animals that have died] and in some cases it will be uncertain numbers of very small animals. “A very small number of bird carcasses have been recovered but most of the others recovered are alive and healthy. “We lost none of the mammals, none of the primates. We lost none of the gibbons, none of the macaques, none of the orangutans. All of these as of today are safe and being looked after. We were able with our keepers and the relationships they have with the animals, the strong bond between them, to call the animals out. “It allowed us to lead the animals out into their outdoor area and with the help of the fire brigade we were able to get into the enclosure and close the hatches to lock them outside. So eventhey were a little bit chilly at least they were safe.   “Lots of the orangutans have sacking or blankets they like to cuddle and carry around with them. Any that did that during the evacuation, it was self controlled. We didn’t wrap them up in blankets, they did it themselves. I think it was a comfort issue.” At the height of the blaze there were  fire engines tackling it, and high winds from Storm Deirdre sent into the air a large plume of smoke that could be seen for miles around.Eyewitnesses described seeing animals that had been in the building when it went up attempting to make their escape. Antony Johnstone, who was visiting the zoo with his we, daughter and two friends, described seeing orangutans and gibbons leaving the building.   He said: “We were about to literally step foot into the building when another visiting family, who were stood in the entrance, said there was a fire starting and it was closed. “As we walked around the side of the building on the footpath, we could see all the animals were released outside the fire had spread and lots of black smoke came out of the building. “We walked to another area of the zoo and then were told the zoo was closing. “The staff reacted very well and moved the public away, the zoo also issued refunds to our friends with no problems. “We are members of the zoo and it was such a shame to see this happening.” Antony said he saw staff letting the animals into the outside part of their enclosure. He added: “We saw the orangutans coming out and the gibbons swinging around the netting on the enclosure.” By mid-afternoon, the Monsoon Forest had lost its entire polymer roof. Photographs released by Cheshire Fire and Rescue Service revealed the dense, lush rainforest enclosure was now a bare, charred, ash-filled shell.   The Islands complex only opened in , and cost around poundm. By late afternoon on Sunday a fundraising campaign had seen more than pound, donated towards rebuilding the habitat. The zoo was open as normal on Sunday and its popular Christmas lantern parade was set to go ahead as normal. But zoo bosses said it had one of the toughest days in our long history. Chief operating officer Jamie Christon added: The remarkable efforts from the zoo team and the emergency services meant the fire was extinguished as quickly as possible. Visitors were evacuated immediately and we would like to thank them for their understanding and cooperation. Thankfully, no staff or public were harmed in the incident. Keepers were able to encourage all mammal species away from the fire and to safety - including the zoo’s group of critically endangered Sumatran orangutans, Sulawesi macaques, endangered silvery gibbons and birds such as rhinoceros hornbills.   We are though, devastated to say that we were unable to save some of our insects, frogs, fish and small birds who were located near to the outbreak of the fire.It’s absolutely heartbreaking to lose any animal, especially when conservationists have worked so hard to breed these wonderful species. New homes have been found within the zoo for all of the animals that were led to safety and our teams are working around the clock to relocate them as soon as possible. The strength and support from the public has been incredibly overwhelming and the messages of goodwill have been of great comfort to our teams. We will support each other in rebuilding this part of the zoo and continue our mission of preventing extinction. The cause of the fire is currently unknown, but we will be helping the relevant authorities with the investigation that will take place over the coming days and weeks. We would again, like to thank the emergency services for their swt response. One person was treated for smoke inhalation at the scene, but there were no reports of any other injuries. An investigation into how the fire started is ongoing, Cheshire Fire and Rescue Service said.

The new snap shows the Duke and Duchess of Sussex standing with their backs to the camera watching the fireworks over Frogmore Lake in Windsor. Meghan has her arm around Harry, and his arm is around her over the top of hers.

Writing in the Mail on Sunday, royal screenwriter Margaret Holder highlighted the similarities. She wrote: I find it fascinating that Meghan has picked a photo so reminiscent of the save the date card for her first wedding. Surely its something she would want to forget  She seems to like this rear view. The Sussexes card is an interesting picture which shows a happy moment. But its an insight into a celebration which doesnt tell us much about the couple. It actually misses out more than it shows.

Many speculated why the GIF of the Duchess of Sussex posing with Givenchys Clare Waight Keller and actress Rosamund Pike had been removed from Instagram. It was even taken off photographer Yvan Fabings profile, sparking rumours the instruction had come from Meghan or the Firm itself. But now it has been revealed why the Boomerang, taken backstage at the Royal Albert Hall, vanished and it may have had something to do with her nail polish.  A royal source told the Mail on Sunday: There was something ostentatious in the way she was posed holding her bump, plus she was wearing dark nail nish that the Queen hates. It wouldn’t be surprising , aware of that, the duchess herself asked for it to be taken down. After the down-to-earth GIF was removed, a picture of Meghan addressing the crowd was posted to the awards account. The same image was posted to the Kensington Palace account. Meanwhile, it has since emerged that Meghan and Prince Harry have nicknamed ‘’Monica and Chandler’ by royal insiders because of the contrast between the LA-born actress’s control-freak personality and the Prince’s easygoing nature. In the long-running sitcom Friends, romantic opposites Monica Geller and Chandler Bing eventually get together despite the fact that she’s obsessive about every detail and he’s just interested in a quiet le. According to The Sun , the royal family’s staff have given the couple the affectionate nicknames because Meghan is seen as ‘wearing the trousers’ in their relationship.  Examples include the recent news that Harry will not take part in the Firms Christmas shoot, at Meghans request. Royal fans have also noticed big dferences in Harrys appearance since he met Meghan. The playboy prince slimmed down ahead of the Royal Wedding, and and many believe he might now be following his wes healthy diet. Meghan used to blog about her love for food, speaking about how she was vegan in the week but enjoyed her favourite treats at the weekend. Keen royal-watchers have also noticed changes in Harry’s dress sense and even his social circle - changes which have been ascribed to his eagerness to please his new we. Conversely, though, a new paper by academics Laura Clancy and Hannah Yelin claims that Meghan’s social conscience has been muted by her new family. Their report says: “While the monarchy appears to be celebrating her ersity and modernising influence, then, this is only permitted within prescribed boundaries.  Markle’s activist voice has been either silenced or appropriated by the monarchy. She has quit her acting career, closed down her popular blog and social media accounts for all her online activity to be ciphered through Kensington Palace. “Meanwhile, Markle is said to be receiving ‘duchess lessons’ from the Queen’s advisers, to be brought up to speed with protocol and expectations of le with the monarchy.” "},{"url":null,"title":"uproar hotel cancels charitys christmas","story":"NewsHotel cancels Christmas booking for  homeless people sparking uproarCarl Simpson fears his ambition to give nearly  rough sleepers a safe place to stay is now in jeopardy, after the Royal Hotel allegedly cancelled his £, bookingShareByAlex GroveLuke Kenton:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsCarl Simpsons intiative to get nearly  homeless people off the streets for Christmas has been put in jeopardy, he says \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA charity has criticised a hotel after it allegedly cancelled a booking which would have given  homeless people a safe place to sleep for Christmas. Coming as part of the Raise the Roof Homeless project, Carl Simpson paid pound, for  twin rooms at the Britannia Royal Hotel, inHull, for Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. The fundraiser says he informed the hotel of the bookings details and who would be staying in the rooms over the two nights, but he was left shocked when he received a call on Saturday where he was allegedly told the booking had been cancelled. The hotel has said no one is available to comment on the matter.   Mr Simpson, , took to the charity’s Facebook page to upload images of receipts and invoices from the hotel and emails confirming the booking. He said he was “absolutely gutted” by the decision and said his goal to get Hulls rough sleepers off the streets for Christmas is now in jeopardy. Mr Simpson said: “We approached the Royal Hotel and told them exactly what we were doing. They were quite happy with it and even got us a  per cent discount. “They knew homeless people were coming to the hotel and I even went in and paid by card but then yesterday out of the blue I got a phone call to say that they had cancelled the booking and that they would refund us. “I asked them what the reason was and they said that they weren’t sure and that they would get back to us. The phone went on hold and then they said they couldn’t tell me – they didn’t seem bothered at all.” The pound,, which has been amassed with the help of generous members of the public, will now be paid back to Mr Simpson but he says it could take a few days for the money to be ed. Last year, Mr Simpson was able to get  rough sleepers inside the Ibis hotel in Ferensway for December  and , and he was keen to repeat the feat this year.   However, with Christmas Eve just a week away, he is now worried that he will not be able to fulfil his ambition. “We got the receipt for it so on Thursday at our soup kitchen we told them all that they were sorted for Christmas,” Mr Simpson said. “They were over the moon and we wanted to tell them that to give them something to look forward to instead of dreading Christmas like they usually do by reflecting on what they’ve lost. “Now, we are going to have to break this news to them and it’s heartbreaking. “Having somewhere to sleep at Christmas can be the dference between le and death. Christmas is the lowest time of the year and suicide in the homeless section is higher than any other time of year. “It gives them safety and a chance to get in a bed which for some is something they haven’t been able to do in years. “These people don’t have a great deal to look forward to but this would have given them a little bit of a lt so to have it taken away from them at the last minute is devastating for them.”  Mr Simpson wants other hotels to help his charitythey can. He said: “We are not surewe will get anywhere  because everywhere is booked up and the longer we wait the more expensive the rooms get. “If the Royal Hotel could rethink what they are doing oranyone  could come forward then at the end of the day they could be saving a le.” Britannia Hotels, which runs the Ferensway hotel, has been contacted for a comment by Hull Live in relation to the cancellation.

Amanda Hawkins, , left toddlers Addyson Overgard-Eddy, two, and Brynn Hawkins, one, inside the sweltering car for  hours without food or water. Ignoring their cries for help, she spent the night at a friends house in Kerr County, Texas. When someone heard the girls crying and asked Hawkinsthey should be brought inside, she responded No, theyll cry themselves to sleep, according to reports. By the time she went back to the car to get her children the following afternoon on June , , they had collapsed unconscious in C heat.  But instead of taking them to hospital straight away, the mum gave them a bath and dressed them in a dferent set of clothes. They were eventually taken to hospital on June  but tragically died on June  last year, according to Fox . In September, Hawkins pleaded guilty to two counts of reckless injury to a child and two counts of abandoning or endangering a child.  She initially tried to cover up her neglect by telling doctors they passed out after smelling flowers at a local park. Witnesses testied that shed said theyd become stumbly and red after snfing the flowers. But it was later found that the mum had left her girls in a vehicle while she smoked marijuana in a shed.  A judge handed Hawkins four  year sentences, with two sets of them running concurrently. Hill County Breaking News reports that before sentencing, Hawkins made a statement saying: “I will accept whatever the punishment may be,” and that “there are no excuses for what I did.” Kerr County Sherf Hierholzer previously said in a statement: “This is by far the most horric case of child endangerment that I have seen in the  years that I have been in law enforcement.  Kevin Franke,  at the time, slept in the car with the girls because he didnt want to sleep in the shed, but said he was unaware they were there, the Daily Mail reports. The now--year-old pleaded not guilty in April to two counts of manslaughter, two counts of injury to a child and two counts of child endangerment. He will go on trial in January.

Astonishing revelations about the debilitating powder – which can be spread across an area the size of six football pitches in just  seconds – highlights the increasing desperation of President Emmanuel Macrons administration as it faces up to a law and order crisis. Paris has been hit by five straight weeks of violence by the Yellow Vests protest movement that has seen national monuments including the Arc de Triomphe ransacked. There were  arrests in the city on Saturday alone as the demonstrators – who are named after their high visibility jackets – fought running battles with police, who responded with water cannon, baton charges and teargas.  Now senior officers have confirmed that some of the  armoured cars deployed by gendarmes contained a radical device that was only to be used as a last resort against their own citizens. A gun-like distributor on the vehicles turrets can spray the powder over , square meters in  seconds, Marianne magazine reports. The high-density noxious product contains the same power as  teargas grenades, and is designed to knock people out indiscriminately in an emergency. If a large crowd forced barriers through the security perimeter, then the powder would be used as a last resort in order to stop them, said a source at the Paris police prefecture.  But it is sure to raise concerned questions among civic rights groups, as well as monitoring organisations, including the Hague-based Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, of which France is a member. Colonel Richard Carminache, of the Gendarmerie, confirmed that the controversial devices had never been used in cities to my knowledge. Each distribution would result in a highly concentrated teargas cloud, the equivalent of  grenades in one go, said Col. Carminache, who added: It’s best to run to get out.  Teargas is classed as a chemical weapon, and is actually banned from warzones, in line with international agreements. Yet French gendarmes and police – who have been criticised during the latest law and order crisis for acts of extreme violence against civilians – use it constantly. In Britain, teargas use is heavily restricted, and never used indiscriminately against large crowds containing men, women and children, as happens in France.

thumping of then-league leaders Killie last weekend.Despite that beating, McGowan expects a massive challenge at Rugby Park from Steve Clarke’s side.McGowan said: “It’ll be a tough week being away to Kilmarnock, Aberdeen and then Celtic.“That’s as hard as it comes at the moment.“Kilmarnock have been flying until the Celtic defeat, Aberdeen is a hard place to go and I can’t remember the last time Dundee won up there and then Celtic away doesn’t get any harder.“It’ll be dficult for us but we got a result against Rangers to keep the confidence going.“If we take each game at a time then who knows ”After that, the Dark Blues bring  to a close with two home games, firstly welcoming Livingston to the Kilmac Stadium at Dens Park on Boxing Day before St Johnstone make the short trip up the A on December .Despite being mired in a relegation battle heading into these fixtures, the feeling around the ground is upbeat after Dundee’s upturn in form.After a slow start under manager Jim McIntyre, the work done behind the scenes has begun to pay idends on the pitch as they look much more solid defensively and potent in attack.That’s been helped by the scoring form of striker Kenny Miller, though McGowan says he and the rest of his team-mates need to start adding to the goal tally to get themselves out of trouble.He added: “As a unit we’ve been hard to beat but we also look dangerous in attack.“We’re going down the flanks, attacking with numbers and getting numbers in the box so you can see the work is starting to pay off for us.“We’ve started to score goals – Kenny has been banging them in and others are chipping in.“Jesse Curran got his first goal, I was delighted for him against Hamilton but we all need to chip in.“You can see the boys are buying into what we are trying to do and you can see how hard we are working on the pitch.”Dundee were impressive in defence to hold a Rangers side with a man advantage last Sunday and McGowan knows they’ll have to repeat that type of performance throughout the games this week.The midfielder, though, rejects any idea of Dundee becoming a counter-attacking side.He said: “I don’t think we are necessarily a counter-attacking team, I think when we win the ball we attack at pace and we are being relentless.“We can keep the ball as wellwe need to and we can mix our game up well.“We did that well against Hamilton, knowing when to go and when not to go. I think we have a good mix just now.“Confidence is massive and, when you get that, you start trying things.

It is never going to go.People say racism is taught.At a certain age it is taught.If you are three, four, five, six, seven, eight and you come out with something that you have obviously heard around the home and people you are around, I get that.That stuff withSterling and Scotty Sinclair, the stuff with me. You are not taught that.That one who did that against Sterling. He has chosen to say those things, to try to say the most hateful and hurtful things to somebody.The person in the Scott Sinclair video.That guy is taking a penalty against Aberdeen and he doesn’t want him to score against his team.But why would you ever bring up somebody’s race  I have arguments with loads of people and it doesn’t once cross my mind to bring in what colour I am looking at. Because when I am looking at someone I am looking at a human being.It doesn’t matter what colour they are. So to say something like that, it is your choice.When you are an adult and you get past  to  anything you then come out with or your actions, it’s all down to choice from you.Anything that comes out of your mouth no one can make you say that, unless you choose to say it.It is never going to be gone.I’m not going to say it might be the next game or the next game but there will be a time in a game when somebody feels they want to choose to say something like that.For me you can stand and say it in my face, it doesn’t bother me.I just highlight it because I just want people to know that people like that are still out there.Whether it is an Aberdeen fan saying it against a Celtic player, Rangers player, Hibs player or Dundee player. It is irrelevant who is saying it because I will never be on their side whether they are an Aberdeen fan or not.In this day, it is  and I just think it is despicable.You have to choose your words correctly.If you want to say it, say it – but you will be judged on it.This guy who did it against Sterling had a nice job but he chose to say a word against a player who is playing against his football team.Now he has lost it. Is it really worth it  No.No. It is not just in football, you get it in all forms of le. Football is a job. You are going to get it in a factory, get it in a swimming pool, a library.Racism happens all over and it is a choice. It is sad that it is still going on nowadays but poverty and unemployment are happening now. Things can be done to help prevent itand try to make it better but it is always going to be there.Bullying, poverty, racism you will never get a world when that isn’t there.For me personally I bring up my kiddies and I want them to respect everybody.I always say, show respect to anybody who shows you respect.Andthey don’t show respect walk away from them.You don’t have to be around people like that. If everyone had that idea, I don’t think everyone does, then it would be a better place. That sort of thing might not happen so much, but I guarantee it will happen again.Yes, loads of times.Even now people say about the Tonev thing, there was no proof. But there was proof.They didn’t see the video recordings of the game in the room that we were all in. So they don’t know what has gone on.I would never try to say anyone did anything to me racist to ruin anyone’s career.I am not that person.So when I go and get a ball and people are shouting at me I don’t report it. It is irrelevant to me.You can say whatever you like about me, I’m playing a game of football and you are trying to hurt me.We are probably winning the game and that is why you are upset.Becauseyour team are winning you are not going to say anything.It is only when the chips are down, you are frustrated, that those sort of things come out. Loads of times people have said things.And you know what  It hasn’t been the bigger games and it seems to be against the same sort of teams.I don’t ever bring it up.You can say it to my face and I walk away. It doesn’t bother me.That is what I put up with – it is water off a duck’s back.I am black, I get that.My kiddies are black. I have a white mum, my dad’s black.I have a white nan, I have a white brother.It doesn’t matter to me what colour you are.I love all sorts of people and I show anybody respect who shows me respect.Tonev did not show me respect so I showed him no respect in terms of I reported that. Because he is a professional footballer and at the time there were four or five black people on his team.So you have just said that to me.It was a lack of respect.It is what it is, you don’t cry about spilt milk and that stuff is in the past.I am sure there will be, maybe not towards me, but there will be racism in the game.You just have to deal with it.I think there are bigger issues as well such as the situation with Leigh Grfiths who is struggling with depression or habits.He needs help.Someone shouting things at me, I am of the mindset that it is not affecting my le or my career.Leigh is in a position where the stuff is affecting his le so the focus needs to go on that.Things where people feel in a position where they are really struggling with le.With just getting out of bed.People see him driving a flash car, playing football for a big club but they don’t see behind it when he is at home.When in his head he is thinking all these things.They are the sort of people who need help and I hope he can get all the help he needs."},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/12/ee-cr-111218-01-003.jpg-789x564.jpg ","title":"adopt a pet can you give one of

“This is fantastic news, with money and investment coming into Aberdeen.“Considering we are coming out of a downturn, it should be welcomed.“There are a lot of car businesses already on Wellington Road at the moment so this means the area will become a focal point for business.”Concerns had been raised about the proposals for the new showroom detailing plans for a washing bay facility, due to it being close to the rail line.However, a condition was added to the development being granted – that it must include a spray screen to save rail infrastructure from detergent and water from the car-washing facility.A decision notice said: “The applicant must erect a suitable spray screen adjacent to the proposed wash bay along the existing boundary fence.“Details of the proposed screen shall be submitted to the planning authority for approval before development is commenced and the wash bay shall not be brought into use unless the spray screen has been implemented in accordance with the approved details.#The screen shall remain place in perpetuity unless the written consent of the planning authority has been given for its removal.”Lidl has since moved into a new store after vacating the Torry store on Wellington Road.The supermarket opened at the old Peter Vardy Land Rover site on the nearby Greenwell Road, East Tullos, in October.A total of  new jobs have been created and new facilities in the store includes a bakery.The move was part of a £. billion nationwide investment to change the discount chain’s image so that it can appeal to a wider range of customers.Arnold Clark

We have ended up with the worst of all possible outcomes, with England and Wales voting to leave and leaving, Northern Ireland voting to remain and retaining a foothold into the EU and Scotland who voted to remain being completely dragged out against its will.No one should fall for this  choice being desperately spun by this isolated Tory Prime Minister, that seeks to force us to choose between a #bad deal# or a #no deal# at all.Brendan O#Hara MP, Argyll and ButeSir,We expect over  schools to be represented at next year’s Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships, based on the number of school pupils being taught in programmes run by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust .The trust now has projects going in  council areas supporting lessons to over , young people.We are getting a large number of enquiries from schools wanting to come along to the event on March  in Livingston.SSPDT aims to safeguard our wonderful musical traditions and to help young people develop skills for le, learning and work, with a focus on deprived and remote areas, by helping to introduce piping and drumming tuition to state schools on a par with orchestral instruments.We established the championships in  to offer a positive and friendly experience for players who are new to competition, and as a forum for bands at the very top of their game.The trust has resources to support more state schools in Scotland to introduce piping and drumming tuition, and we invite local education authorities, teachers and parents to contact us.All enquiries can be made via our website sspdt.org.ukAlexandra Duncan, chief executive, Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums TrustSir,Having campaigned extensively for the re-opening of the A after a landslide in October, I welcome Cabinet Secretary Michael Matheson’s commitment to identying a permanent solution to disruption on the road, whilst continuing to invest in shorter term mitigation measures.Closures to the A lead to untenable ersions and re-routing of traffic onto other roads, which is why is absolutely essential for permanent measures to be put in place to end these closures.The safety of the people who use this road has always been the top priority for the Scottish Government, and I am grateful to all those who have been involved in working towards a practical solution to make this road accessible for local people, visitors and businesses in my constituency.Michael Russell MSP, Argyll and ButeSir,The withdrawal agreement with the European Union has now been published.Our industry has consistently called for clarity over what that UK’s new relationship with the EU will look like in practice, particularly on the continued protection of geographical indications, customs procedures and future trade policy.The provisions set out in the withdrawal agreement provide us with a credible foundation on which to build in the next phase of the negotiations, during which a number of critical issues remain to be resolved.A no-deal Brexit would cause the Scotch whisky industry considerable dficulties and would force cost and complexity into production, distribution and exporting.  The withdrawal agreement is a compromise, but it is a positive step towards much needed business certainty.Karen Betts, chief executive, Scotch Whisky AssociationSir,I am struck by the comments of Theresa May that her Brexit plan will stop EU migrants #jumping the queue# when it comes to working in the UK.How low the UK has sunk that its Brexiteer government is now resorting to spreading resentment towards European citizens, classing them as #queue jumpers#. These iniduals took no part in this mess and work here legally and contribute to the country in so many dferent ways.They have the same general right of freedom of movement that allows British people the opportunity to work in Berlin and Paris, or retire in Spain.Even so, their reward seems to be an increasingly hostile atmosphere. Ms May makes no mention of those British #queue jumpers# in other EU countries, symptomatic no doubt of the same attitude that classes those Brits abroad as #expats#, while those from the other EU countries who come to work here are #immigrants#, an increasingly negative term.Since the referendum in  there has been an alarming increase in both veiled and more explicit verbal abuse to EU nationals, and this will no doubt increase as the negative impacts of Brexit become clearer and scapegoats will be required. Step forward those innocent EU nationals in our midst.The UK has taken a wrong turn, as exhibited by the dog-whistle politics of Theresa May and her Tory government.As the UK enters full panic mode, the victim of a bitter and corrupted Etonian gamble gone very wrong, we must do all that we can to support those EU nationals in our midst and defy this vile populist rhetoric.Alex Orr,  Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"luke naisby named red stars new manager","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowAccomplished defender Luke Naisby is Lochgilphead Red Star AFC#s new manager.The new manager#s first challenge was to take charge of Red Star against Ferguslie Star AFC on Saturday November  in Paisley.The Red Star Facebook page said: #The committee is delighted to welcome him to his new role with the club.

No wonder he looked nervous.The boys got to grips with the dferent handling characteristics of Willie Senior#s car and started to up the pace in the afternoon bringing the car home in a respectable th overall and third in class three. This result was enough to secure second position in the overall championship in class.Jamie Miller continued the learning process with the little Citroen C-RMax with Ian McCulloch pointing him in the right direction. A very neat rally from Jamie with very few mistakes saw him finish a creditable th overall and second in class two, only beaten by the Scottish Tarmac Champion for  Michael Harbour in his similar Citroen, who was only one place above him after seven stages.Innes Mochrie was once again out on the stages in the Mightyand this time he had someone whom he might listen to in the co-driver#s seat. His daughter, Kirsty, had elected to fill the silly seat for this event and they, after a few first stage detours, managed to keep speaking right to the end and brought the class one pocket rocket home in th overall and a brilliant second in class. The mind boggles as to what the result could have been , as Kirsty was heard to remark, she had #someone who would listen to her#.Jonothan MacDonald and Chris Wareham were out in the beautully prepared Mull of Kintyre Cheese sponsored Peugeot . Their pace was good enough for th overall and fourth in class three.Mull pair Malcolm MacDougall and Stuart MacLean were out in the class one Vauxhall Nova and were getting visibly quicker as the day went on, a trend that had repeated itself over the course of the year with confidence and technique increasing with every stage mile covered. They finished th overall and a commendable fourth in class one.There were three Argyll co-drivers directing their pilots around the airfield. Ian Parker, recently announced as one of seven # and the only Scot # co-drivers to be selected to join the MSA Academy for , was back in the Honda Civic of Fraser Smith. The Civic screamed its way round the stages with minimal fuss, other than perhaps a lucky trip on two wheels after clipping a tyre, to finish in nd overall and fourth in class two.The final Argyll man out was Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan who was shouting left and right for Greg Inglis of Montrose in his quick and agile Lotus Exige. Eoghan had been co-driver for Alan Kirkaldy in the earlier Granite Stages Rally, also held at Leuchars, and they had been first overall that day, so no pressure there, then.Greg found the Lotus was almost perfect for the stages on the day with a great balance of handling, braking and pace when needed. They were surprised, perhaps unjustly, to find out they were sitting well up the leader board after the first few stages. They got the hammer down over the last three and were to finish fth overall and first in class three.They were beaten only by the Kirkaldy brothers, both in Escort MkII#s of the highest calibre, and two WRC cars driven by Brian Watson and Reay Mackay.Last but not least, Oban#s Angus MacNeil was out with Sam MacFadyen in Brian Watson#s Mitsubishi Evo  binging it home unscathed in th overall.The event was won by Alan Kirkaldy in a freshly built Escort MkII, followed by his circuit racer brother Andrew in secondand Reay Mackay taking the last podium place in his WRC Fiesta. This was a fitting finish to the Championship at Leuchars with very fast stages and a good test of manand machine in equal measures.Photographs by West Coast Photos."},{"url":null,"title":"speedy kirsty points the way ahead for dad","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowAt the age of , Kirsty Mochrie made her first outing as navigator for Innes Mochrie at the  Kingdom Stages rally.Seasoned campaigner Innes, who happens to be Kirsty#s dad, was well guided around the course in their Kilmory Coachworks .Kirsty#s gran Libby told the Advertiser: #She just loved it.

These are Argyll and Bute Youth Forum, Heart of Argyll Wildle Organisation and Lochgilphead Phoenix Project, which wants to build an information point on the front green in Lochgilphead.This is the latest round of payouts from the fund generated by more than  , Co-op members in Argyll and Bute and means the Co-op has invested £, in nine groups in Argyll since the membership scheme launched in September .Co-op members, who receive a five per cent reward for themselves with a further one per cent going to local causes when they buy own-brand products, have a say in how the money is allocated, and are encouraged to select the organisations they wish to support online.Since the launch of the local community fund Co-op members have helped , organisations make a positive dference in their neighbourhoods and in the last  months alone £m has been invested in local causes.The fund is now supporting a wide iety of local organisations, from village halls and support groups to education providers and neighbourhood watch schemes, all of which are helping to make Argyll a better, happier, and healthier place to live.Rebecca Birkbeck, Co-op director of community engagement.Sir,I was pleased to attend the latest Argyll Islands Strategic Group meeting in Kilmory recently.I was able to speak to Scottish Government and Argyll and Bute Council representatives about the challenges facing our island communities.While we on the islands of Islay, Jura, Colonsay and Gigha are rightfully enjoying strong local economic growth, future growth will be stled by poor local infrastructure, at times unreliable ferry links and the never-ending troubles with the A.Regardless of what political stripe the leadership of the Scottish and UK parliaments have, all should be united in getting our vital links to the mainland and wider the UK economy back up to scratch.Without large scale investment from central government to fix Argyll and Bute#s roads and Transport Scotland#s trunk roads, our future prosperity is at risk and, as ever, it will be islanders that suffer the most.While political bun fights in the local press letters pages are entertaining,  what we really need is action from our MSPs and MPs.If we were talking about road and transport links between Scotland#s cities, it is highly likely these problems would already be fixed. The Scottish Government must in the future not be so urban-centric in its allocation of resources.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward.Sir,I write following the release of the latest figures on alcohol use by the Office for National Statistics .The more you drink, the greater the long-term risk to your health and these ONS figures show a worrying increase in the number of alcohol-specic deaths in the UK, particularly amongst women and  to -year olds.From time to time, we are contacted by the families of people who have died as a result of alcohol and are only too aware of the heartbreak and utter sense of helplessness people feel when trying to lead someone to seek help for alcohol misuse.We must all do more to address the stigma that people feel in reaching out for support. For many of us, there are simple and effective ways for people to cut back on alcohol.Taking more drink-free days each week for example can reduce the overall amount of alcohol you drink and reduce the risk of developing serious illnesses. The Drinkaware website also provides information and resources for people concerned about their drinking or that of someone close to them and our DrinkChat online advisors can direct people, in complete confidence, to local treatment agencies.Elaine Hindal, Drinkaware chief executive."},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll flower club hosts christmas special","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowMid Argyll Flower Club members welcomed Sandra Robertson from Dumfries to their annual open evening on Monday December .A packed house watched with interest as Sandra created amazing Christmas-themed displays.Lucky raffle winners left with beautul arrangements that, with care and attention, could see them through Christmas.Sandra, who won Best in Show  at Gardening Scotland with a James Bond inspired arrangement, was an excellent demonstrator and told many humorous stories of her #flower le# to an enthralled and appreciative audience."},{"url":null,"title":"the adventures of mr toad a ribbitting performance","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowBy Anne BeckittThe Mid Argyll Musical Society recently showcased their production of The Adventures of Mr Toad in Ardrishaig Hall to great acclaim.The praise was well-justied for the whole production was a shining example of what real teamwork can make from good material.The cast included primary and secondary students as well as adults, covering very ied levels of stage experience, yet they all worked together with a smoothness that appeared effortless but was, in fact, the result of much care and expert guidance.The chorus was as well rehearsed as the principal characters, and the evident enjoyment of every actor and singer meant the audience could relax totally and enjoy it all.Even lost lines, and the problems of dealing bravely with injuries were easily managed with good humour that won all hearts. That kind of team confidence comes from having the care and understanding of first class management.The staging was deceptively simple and the backstage staff produced a delightful cart and car for Mr Toad, plus his horse, and the costumes were not elaborate while most effective.All were well-rehearsed, and the singing was clearly the result of very careful expert teaching. It was a great pleasure to see how some of the young voices have been developing since their last appearance in #The Wizard of Oz#.We would have liked a couple of the characters to project spoken parts more audibly but overall the clarity of words should be complimented.The energy of Mr Toad himself carried all before him, just as it is written in the script and the original Wind in the Willows.No inidual names are here mentioned, quite deliberately, as the outstanding impression of this show was the seamless blending of the entire team involved, with each and every participant a star in their own right."},{"url":null,"title":"camanachd association agm reports income rise","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowThe Camanachd Association#s annual general meeting took place in the Muthu West End Hotel, Fort William, on Friday November .The  accounts showed a £, increase in turnover and a surplus of £,, increasing the association#s reserves to £, at December .Having fulfilled its obligations and met its related targets, the association did not suffer any reduction in its £, funding from Sportscotland, its largest single contributor.

The sheep killed in the March attack were breeding ewe hoggs.#Brian Walker continued: #They were going to be on the farm for the next five or six years and during that time they would have produced offspring for me to sell which is what creates our income.#He stressed that . per cent of dog walkers are fine, adding: #Most of my land is round about the town of Inveraray and I meet a lot of dog walkers. I know a lot of them and there#s no problem.#It#s a minority of people who allow their dogs to run out of control who cause problems. But it#s becoming a bigger minority as more and more people get pet dogs.#It#s a problem that#s escalating and, one way or another, there have to be proper controls put in place.#"},{"url":null,"title":"lochgair comes to inveraray history society","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowInveraray History Society members were pleased to welcome a group from Lochgair for an interesting talk on their Long Memories Project.Marion Lacey gave a presentation of old photographs and some of the group#s carefully researched historical background on the area, including changes to Asknish House, the Lochgair Hotel, the original Tin Hut and other well known landmarks.Marion explained how successful their two exhibitions had been when they were held in Lochgair during the year and the amount of interest shown in finding out more about the history of the area.  They hope more people will come forward with any background information or photographs to help them develop their research further.January#s meeting of the Inveraray History Society will be held on Tuesday January  when Ken MacTaggart will give a talk entitled, Inveraray: People and Places.A representative said: #The history society wishes everyone a very happy Christmas and a blessed new year.#"},{"url":null,"title":"ardrishaig maritime hub almost here","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowPlans to build an Ardrishaig #maritime hub# at a former oil depot are coming to fruition.Since work began on the disused Gleaner site in April , the redevelopment of a derelict building known locally as #the Egg Shed# has been progressing, with work due to be finished soon.In a report by the site#s owner Scottish Canals to Argyll and Bute Council#s Mid Argyll, Kintyre and Islands area committee, the work to turn the area around Ardrishaig Pier into a maritime hub was laid out, outlining plans to encourage people to stop and take in Ardrishaig#s scenery and history. The first step of this plan, to redevelop the Egg Shed, is nearing completion.The area around the building has been levelled and the building has been made wind and water tight.With the target completion date of February  nearing, nothing has yet been decided about the building#s use once it has been refurbished and extended. Options include an interpretation centre a local heritage centre an exhibition space community use a training and education centre small scale retail and an external public space.Scottish Canal#s plans go further, with a community pontoon also proposed.There are also plans for Pier Square, with a grand relaunch of The Steamer Terminal in the pipeline. Scottish Canals might also look to move from its office on Pier Square and convert the building to holiday accommodation. The poposals also involve a new pavement for Chalmers Street and creating a space for coaches to park in the current car park, and even plans to get a hold of the famous mini-Kelpies to display in Pier Square.Councillor Donald MacMillan said: #The plans are moving ahead.

When in a state of excitement and aggression, a dog may then choose to attack a human being, and we are into another ball game entirely.The solution seems simple # keep control of your dog at all times and have it on a lead around livestock. As Brian Walker himself said, it is a very small minority of people who disregard these basic precautions, but that minority is growing in number.People love to moan about the dark days, wet weather and lack of entertainment.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.

And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13713656.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_CP43067514.jpg","title":"ayr united players pose inbetweeners","story":"NewsAyr United players pose as Inbetweeners stars on hilarious Christmas party nightHigh flying Ayr United hit the town with some of their squad bearing a resemblance to the cast of the Inbetweeners.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsAyr playersJames Hilton, Liam Smith, Daniel Harvie and Michael Rose\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTheyre flying high in the Scottish Championship.

Elliott Summers, , of Bellesleyhill Road, Ayr, was found guilty after trial of the rape of a -year-old woman on July , last year. Judge Lord Kinclaven told first offender Summers: “You have been found guilty of a serious sexual offence and there is no alternative to a custodial sentence.” Summers, who was placed on the sex offenders register, worked at Glasgow Prestwick Airport as general manager for air traffic control and then in  became managing director at Norwich Airport in England. Recently he was working as a practice manager at a GP surgery in Glasgow. Solicitor advocate Murray Macara QC said: “He maintains he did not rape this woman and maintains that whatever sexual conduct took place was of a limited nature and was consensual. Mr Macara handed over a dozen testimonials from work colleagues of Summers. The QC said that his client objected to some of the comments in the background report compiled on him which referred to him a displaying toxic masculinity” and described him as a misogynist. Mr Macara said that Summers was highly thought of at work. He went on: “He worked as an air traffic controller and had senior managerial roles at two airports. During the trial Summers victim told of how they met online and then she visited his cottage. She took a bottle of wine for him and bottled water for herself. The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said she arrived around .pm to pm and Summers, who was drunk, grabbed her and forcefully kissed her at the door. He told her that he had been drinking at the pub since .pm and she said he was so drunk he was unable to work the remote control for the television. Summers, then put his hand inside her bra, made a disparaging comment about her nipples and suggested that she looked older than . She said took her hand and took her into the bedroom which was pitch black and added: “I tried to push him away with both hands. I repeatedly said No, this is not happening.” When Summers fell asleep his terried victim managed to get out of the bed and get dressed. The womans daughter said her mother was distressed and crying and told her she had been raped and police were called. When quizzed by police Summers denied all responsibility for any rape and said that there was consensual sexual intercourse that evening. The GP practice in Glasgow where Summers was employed as a practice manager said: His employment was terminated at the end of last month after his conviction for rape.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnPrestwick AirportSex crimeAyrCourtsAyr News"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"straiton primary headteacher commended impressive","story":"NewsStraiton Primary and headteacher commended with impressive reportLiz Candlish leads the strong staff team to achieve the best quality educational experiences in a learning environment which is nurturing and encouraging.ShareByLochlin Highet:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsStraiton Primary Head teacher Liz Candlish \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA primary school and nursery has been commended by HM Inspectors for the high quality of education they provide. A positive inspection report from Education Scotland found consistently “good” performance across the board at Stration Primary School and Eary Years Centre. The inspectors came to their conclusions after a recent visit to the school that included discussions with parents, children and staff. The inspection team found the following strengths in the school’s work: • Headteacher Liz Candlish leads the strong staff team to achieve the best quality educational experiences in a learning environment which is nurturing and encouraging. • The motivated children who are engaged in their learning. Their exemplary behaviour is respectful and caring of adults and each other. • The strong links and involvement with members of the community. They feel valued by staff and enhance children’s outdoor experiences and enterprise activities. The following areas for improvement were identied: • The school should take steps to increase the pace and progression of children’s learning to raise attainment. • Assessment data collected from a range of sources should now be acted on more consistently to ensure maximum impact on the attainment of a few learners. • A structured approach to develop more independent learners, who can talk about their learning and be clear about their next steps. Councillor William Grant said: “I’m pleased to see such a positive report for Straiton, with staff delivering high quality learning for all children, something that should come as welcome news to families. “Headteacher, Liz Candlish, was singled out for providing strong leadership, with the school thriving and providing a nurturing environment that is inspiring children to embrace learning and to care for each other. “I would like to thank everyone involved for working hard to maintain the high standards at Straiton.” Inspectors are confident that the school has the capacity to continue to improve and so they will make no more visits in connection with this inspection.

In fact shersquos really quite unique in that shersquos furry, has four legs, a tail, and is the schoolrsquos very own puppy.So how did this adorable pooch make its way into the lives and hearts of the pupils and staff at Priorsford  Did the pupils ask for a puppy on their Christmas list this year I discovered that Peggy was actually on the wish list of teacher Caroline Sharpe, who approached headteacher Sandra Macgregor a year ago with the idea of a therapy dog for the school.Caroline explained: ldquoWe heard about therapy dogs and the benefits they bring to pupils, we wanted to tie it into our health and wellbeing in the school.ldquoI attended the SSPCA conference and there were people there from universities who had taken therapy dogs into final exams for students.ldquoEvidence shows that therapy dogs lower peoplersquos heart rate, gives a general sense of well-being and improves childrenrsquos socialisation skills. We visited a school in Midlothian who had a Cockapoo puppy and we knew we could make it work for us. She has changed the dynamic of the school.Peggy will live with Caroline, but will be in school full-time.Having settled into her new home at Priorsford Primary this week, Peggy is already the most popular pupil in school.Despite skipping five primary year-groups to join the P class, Peggy is at the very start of her journey to becoming a certied school dog.ldquoShe has settled in well and has already met the pupils at assemblies. My daughter is a vet and told me to expose her to everything straight away. The time between eight and  weeks is really important for stamping the personality and the secureness of the puppy, added Caroline.Peggy is learning how to become a listening dog, who will help children read aloud more confidently. She will put her head in their lap and listen without judgement, prompting them to turn a page with her paw.Caroline explained: ldquoNot only will she improve the pupilrsquos literacy skills, Peggy will be there for any children who are feeling anxious or worried, they can take some time out to talk to her.I joined the P class in the library as they read the tale of Greyfriars Bobby to Peggy. But she was worn out after a busy morning and childrenrsquos soothing reading put her to sleep!As I wander through the school with Peggy, pupils eyes widen at the sight of the furry bundle and instantly a smile lights up their faces. ldquoI love her Mrs Sharp, she is soooo cute, cooed one girl.When it came to naming the puppy, it was decided not to ask the children, who, Caroline said, would have come up with wonderfully unique suggestions.Before leaving the school, I am given Peggy to cuddle, and for a split second I consider slipping her into my handbag and making a run for it. But a vision of an angry mob in blue chasing me through the playground fills me with fear and I decide she is exactly where she should be.It is said that dog is a manrsquos best friend.

That science has or will find solutions to all our manmade problems. The issue with this approach has always been that, experiments carried out in controlled environments like laboratories and then replicated in nature have always been unexpected and sometimes catastrophic.These scientic methods involved limited assessments and tests and mainly conducted for profit by big pharma!Having covered Making Scotland GMOFree in my previous column I will focus on our next vision, which is to make Scotland a  per cent organic country.The green revolution introduced in the s, sprayed fertilisers and pesticides on farm land all over the planet to increase crop yields. This in turn led to many forests being cut down to grow what was then called lsquocash cropsrsquo and small-scale farming was replaced by industrial farming on a massive scale supported by government subsidies.Big corporations acquired land across the globe, food was added as a commodity to be traded for profits on the stock market and this in turn has led to inequalities in health and access to food especially in developing and third world countries.The unforeseen impact of chemicals for growing over the last few decades, has led to the fall of nutrients in the soil, as this was being depleted by over use and irregular crop rotation. Profits were maximised and are even today. For example, soya beans are now grown in many countries as cattle feed for the West! This then leaves no arable land for the local population to grow food leading to widespread hunger and impoverished conditions.We need to go back to our roots and grow food at local levels on a small scale and bring back farming as a lucrative job for people to invest their time and energies. This will be a sustainable long-term approach and remove the need for farming subsidies that are the biggest scandal of our times as most go to big landowners in this country. Can you imagine governments are currently paying farmers in some cases not to grow Organic farming will not only bring back the health of the soil but also stop corporations making money through selling chemicals and hybrid seeds. This will have a positive impact on the lives of all people as lsquoorganic produce will no longer be the domain of the rich and middle class who can afford to feed themselves and their children with good food. This choice should be available to all.So! Whatrsquos happening globally where organic farming is concerned  Denmark is on its way to becoming the worldrsquos first  per cent organic country, followed by Bhutan and Estonia. India has the North-eastern state of Sikkim designated as the first fully organic state anywhere in the world and was awarded the UN lsquoOscar for the Best Policy that is inclusive and comprehensive of all socioeconomic aspects.Can Scotland be  per cent organic  Yes! It can."},{"url":null,"title":"borders-factory-announces-50-redundancies","story":"ONE of the regions major manufacturers has announced that it is looking to pay off more than  members of staff.Jedburgh-based Mainetti UK is looking for voluntary redundancies following a second year of reported losses.Bosses at the Oxnam Road coat-hanger manufacturer are blaming recycling and a reduction in high street retailers as well as an increase in the minimum wage for combined losses over the past  months of more than pound million.Mainettis Regional MD Jim Hutchison stated: \"The last two years have been dficult for the business.\"In  Mainetti UK Limited made a loss of pound, and this year we are forecast to lose a further pound,.\"The business is faced with an ever increasing cost base with increases in the National Minimum Wage, higher electricity costs and higher business rates.\"To add to these cost pressures the business is seeing local UK demand for hangers reducing.\"Many retailers are closing down shops or reducing their selling space and this means there are less hangers required.\"In addition, an increased emphasis on recycling means more hangers are being ed from stores for resorting, which further reduces manufacturing demand.\"Mainetti UK currently employs around  staff.Talks have already started with unions over the planned  redundancies.Mr Hutchison added: \"These changes will only impact the Jedburgh hanger manufacturing unit.\"All other products made in Jedburgh ndash flower buckets, polythene bags, Glastic and The Seatcase will not be impacted and in fact the company will continue to invest in all these areas during , in order to grow those parts of our Jedburgh manufacturing business.\"Local MP John Lamont has been in talks with the company over the past few days.He told us: ldquoThis is disappointing news from a long standing employer in Jedburgh.ldquoClearly their market is changing and Mainetti are having to adapt to that.

their Burnham on Sea microwave joke was worth the admission fee alone.These four crazy characters swayed towards slapstick, flirted with farce and brought down the house with a bombardment of belly-laughs.Despite all the fun and frivolity, though, Sleeping Beauty was still a sensational piece of stage theatre.Julia Noble and Steve Hartley-Oliver were authoritative and appealing as Queen Marigold and King Cactus.And the regular arrival of sinister Witch Hazel, played by both Tracey Borthwick and Julie Smith, in a cloud of customary green smoke made sure the young audience were kept on their toes.The couplet duels between the villainous Witch and Fairy Lilac, played exquisitely by Amanda Blacklock, were both clever and entertaining.Couplets aside, music was at the heart of Sleeping Beauty, from the opening Lazy Hazy Crazy Days of Summer all the way through the seasonal finale, and many of the most memorable numbers came from Fairy Lilac and her supporting coloured fairies of Shannon Mack, Ruby Everett, Caitlin Green and Katie Wilson.From You Can Do Magic and Dream a Little Dream of Me to the luscious Hushabye Mountain, Amanda and her young apprentices were wonderful.A beautul rendition of Born with a Smile on My Face was the highlight of Aimee Richardsons all-to-short appearance as Young Rose.And the childrens fun-filled version of Wake Up You Sleepy Head was also among the many highlights of a fantastic night of musical theatre.The songs came thick and fast - as did the jokes.Hawick, Melrose and Tweedbank were ridiculed regularly, as were Theresa May, the Ladhope Vale one-way system and the residents of Abbotsford Court.The laughs were loud and the cheers, especially when Braw Lad and Braw Lass Greg Kelly and Kimberley OMay turned up for Roses Christening, were even louder.The choreography was both imaginative and eye-catching with dancers Emma Wilson, Jess Thomson, Rachel Falconer and Sara Facchini having obviously put in the rehearsal hours.The score was foot-tappingly good, the scene changes were swt and the stage was picture perfect.But ultimately its the actors, dancers and singers who take a production to new heights.And when the cast is enjoying themselves as much as the audience, the people behind the Right Angle Theatre Company can go to sleep this Christmas with a smile on their faces.CASTFairy Lilac: Amanda BlacklockWitch Hazel: Julie Smith Tracey BorthwickMuddles: Billy RooneyKing Cactus: Steve Hartley-OliverQueen Marigold: Julia NobleNurse Hettie Harpic: Jodie MillarFetch: Antony WilsonCarrie: Katie GordonFairy Red: Shannon MackFairy Yellow: Ruby EverettFairy Green: Caitlin GreenFairy Blue: Katie WilsonYoung Rose: Aimee RichardsonPrince Alexis: Stuart MitchellRose: Amy ThomsonDancers: Sara Facchini, Rachel falconer, Jess Thomson and Emma Wilson.Chorus: Ruaridh Anderson, Charli Black, Tracy Borthwick, Callum Crooks, Erin Gallagher, Nicole Hughes, Mya Lamb, Molly McFarlane, Lee-Anne Robinson, Millie Robinson, Ally Turnbull, Eilidh Walker.Children : Abigail Burns, Ellie Cockburn, Grace Decoteau, Rhianna Devlin, Faith Heriot, Fraser Scott Hermiston, Chloe Noble, Ceijay Robinson, Rebecca Scott, Max Turnbull and Ellie Welsh.: Simona Andom, Sophia Blaen, Georgie Everett, Skye Machara Henderson, Sky Hume, Chloe Johnston, Emily Johnstone, Lucy Johnstone, Ellie mcLaren, Molly McLaren, Carrie Smith and Isla Train.PRODUCTIONStage Crew: Billy Easson, Steven Headspeath, Craig Monks, Adam Nichol and Malcolm Wilson.Prompter: Sheila WilsonMake Up  Hair: Team from Millars Hair SalonMake Up Co-ordinator: Yvonne KeddieProps: Gordon Keddie and Sarah PhilipsChildrens Co-ordinator: Amanda BlacklockChildrens Organizer: Michelle DevlinPhotographs: Jade PringleGroup Bookings: Morag KeddieRaffle: Susan FalconerScenery: Border StudiosFront of House: Lana ThomsonKeyboards: Chris AchenbachPercussion: Graham Borthwick"},{"url":null,"title":"new-housing-estate-for-lauder-given-go-ahead","story":"SCOTTISH Borders Council has given the go-ahead to a brand new housing estate in Lauder.Members of the councilrsquos planning and building standards body voted unanimously to approve an application from Persimmon Homes to build  new homes just north of Thirlestane Drive.Seven people have objected to the development, with a further four expressing concerns, including Kimberly Shaw-Walker, of Thirlestane Drive.She wrote: ldquoThe site is not suitable for the volume of houses proposed.

place which is safe for children and supports the active participation of parents in sport, sustaining lelong participation and encouraging family cohesion through sharing of activity.#The uniqueness

However, when the fall of communism led to the break-up of Yugoslavia, war came to Bosnia in , driven in part by Serbiarsquos desire to create a lsquoGreater Serbiarsquo, including large parts of Bosnia, from which they planned to remove Croats and Muslims in what became known as lsquoethnic cleansingrsquo.Our delegation leader Resad Trbonja was , living in Sarajevo. On April , , he woke to find his city under siege, surrounded by Serbian artillery and snipers on the mountains overlooking the city. The siege would last four years, the longest in modern warfare, longer than Stalingrad. An average of  mortars landed in the city every day, , on the worst day.Resad, who lived through, and fought in, the siege, explained that Sarajevo regressed two centuries overnight ndash no water, no electricity, no phones. The Serbian army allowed minimal UN aid into the city sporadically but nothing .The survival of the siege is a story of human courage, spirit and defiance.Our first visit was to the remnants of a tunnel, dug under Sarajevo airport to reach Bosnian-held territory on the other side. This tiny tunnel was the only way in or out for four years.Through this tunnel extra aid came, for example from Edinburgh Direct Aid, who drove lorries of supplies from Edinburgh to help Sarajevans. My own predecessor, John Home Robertson, then MPfor East Lothian, spent several Parliamentary recesses as a volunteer lorry driver. It was dangerous work and one of his colleagues died on the notorious road known as lsquoSnipers Alleyrsquo.Perhaps the most affecting visit in Sarajevo was to the War Childhood Museum, where those who grew up in the siege display the things they kept to remind them of what it was like, and tell their story.A homemade cardboard knightrsquos breastplate made by a brother who later died a cuddly toy from a UN delivery, cuddled threadbare because it was the only toy a homemade lsquounormrsquo for a childrenrsquos choir which rehearsed and performed in defiance of bombs and bullets the remains of a playpark lsquojungle gymrsquo kept to remember the day a mortar tore it apart and killed your friend ndash no one who visits this museum will forget it.That is true too of Srebrenica. This was supposedly a lsquosafe havenrsquo protected by UN troops. Yet on July , Serbian paramilitary units overran it. Thousands of Bosnian Muslims sought refuge in the UN base at a disused factory.When we visited the museum now sited there, survivor Hasan Hasanovic explained to us how UN soldiers stood by as women and children were herded onto buses and deported, while their men were separated and removed in lorries. They were systematically murdered nearby. Thousands more who tried to escape through the forest were hunted down, shepherded into a meadow, and shot. In all, , Bosnian Muslim men and boys were slaughtered at Srebrenica.Finally, the international community acted. In a matter of days, air strikes lted the siege of Sarajevo, drove Serbian paramilitaries out of much of the territory they had occupied, and forced agreement to a peace deal signed in Dayton, Ohio.Srebrenica was not the only genocide in this war, but it is emblematic because it happened under the noses of the UN and because of the bravery of the Mothers of Srebrenica, who ed home to find out what happened to their husbands and sons, refused to be silenced, and demanded justice.This led to the International Commission on Missing Persons and the forensic anthropology unit in Tuzla, where we saw the incredible work done to identy remains using DNA. More than , victims of genocide have now been identied, allowing their families to grieve and to bury them at the final stop of our visit.We arrive at the cemetery at Potaceri, outside Srebrenica, as the sun sets. On the hillside, , stark white tombstones bring home the enormity of what was done over only a few days a mere  years or so ago.More than , died at Srebrenica , perished in Sarajevo , women suffered rape as an act of war millions fled their homes, some even finding their way to the refugee reception centre at Cheylesmore Lodge in North Berwick.All the survivors I met asked the same question: why did so much suffering have to happen before the international community acted to stop it  In telling us their story, they relived their own pain. They did so in the hope that we learn the lessons of Bosnia. We need only look at Syria or Yemen to know that we have not.That is why we must remember Srebrenica.If any local groups would like to hear more about the work of Remembering Srebrenica, please contact my office on  ."},{"url":null,"title":"the-best-fortnite-gifts-for-christmas-2018","story":"Fortnite is the most popular video game of the year and has taken over not just everyonersquos console, but Christmas lists up and down the country too.If you have family members, big or small, who are mad for Fortnite but find yourself utterly clueless as to what itrsquos all about or what to get someone who loves it for Christmas, we can help out with this guide to everything Fortnite from the game itself to presents you should buy this year.*On some occasions, we earn revenue from content.

Mayrsquos approval ratings outstrip Corbynrsquos terrible numbers.The Tories have a plausible excuse for their disarray. The UKrsquos relationship with the European Union has obsessed the Conservatives for over thirty years. A sizeable number of Mayrsquos colleagues got into politics because they wanted the country to withdraw from the EU. It is the one issue on which some Tory MPs will never compromise.Labour is not encumbered by this historical baggage and is unashamedly pro-European. The partyrsquos members and parliamentarians overwhelmingly want to stay in the EU and would breathe a collective sigh of reliefCorbyn moved onto this ground.Labourrsquos sliding scale of priorities for Brexit - get a better deal than May, force a general election or, as an absolute last resort, campaign for a second referendum - reflects the ide between the membership and the leadership.Party sources say the obstacle to Labour adopting an anti-Brexit position is Corbyn and his loyal aides, Seamus Milne and Karie Murphy. Corbyn is a lelong Eurosceptic whose ill-feeling towards the EU is stronger than the mild distaste for the project displayed by members of the Prime Ministers Cabinet. Deep in his gut, he feels that Brexit is an opportunity.In lsquoAll Out Warrsquo, a book by journalist Tim Shipman on the craziness of Westminster politics after the referendum, the author recounted one of the hustings during the  Labour leadership contest that led to Corbynrsquos victory. Askedthey would rule out voting No or campaigning for Brexit ahead of a referendum on the EU, every candidate did so, apart from Corbyn. ldquoNo I wouldnrsquot rule it out, he said.Part of the blame for the paralysis at Westminster can be laid at Corbynrsquos door. Given that May will not get her draft deal past her own party, and given that she is unlikely to be the person tasked with producing a radically dferent option, it seems obvious that any solution must involve Labour.And yet, despite Brexit being the most important issue in UK politics since the second world war, Labourrsquos position appears to be to sit on the sidelines and wait for a Tory implosion to lead to a general election. It is a strategy based on the hope that some Conservative MPs are stupid enough to want to bring down their own Government.The alternative, which left-wingers like shadow chancellor John McDonnell appear to realise, is clear. Corbyn could point to the fact that a clear majority of his voters want to remain in the UK. Labour could contrast the  promises made during the referendum with the shambles that has ensued. They could conclude, just as the SNP did eventually, that a final referendum is required.Whatever happens over the next three weeks, the parliamentary arithmetic dictates that Brexit is no longer an inevitability. Once Mayrsquos deal dies, only two options could carry a majority in the House of Commons: a softer Brexit that would mean retaining freedom of movement or another referendum. The first would be unpalatable to voters, while the second,offered as a choice between a harder Brexit or remaining in the UK, would be an easier sell.Labourrsquos choice is between sitting passively in the back seat, or grabbing hold of the steering wheel and, to use a well worn phrase, taking back control. Otherwise Corbyn, like May, could become another casualty of history."},{"url":null,"title":"westminster-leaders-urge-corbyn-to-join-united-front-against-may","story":"Ian Blackford, Vince Cable, Liz Saville Roberts and Caroline Lucas, who represent the SNP, Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru and the Greens, urged Corbyn to attend a summit tomorrow on opposing the Conservatives.Theresa May pulled a vote last week on her draft withdrawal agreement on leaving the EU after it became clear MPs in her own party would help defeat the proposal.Her decision, which angered euro-sceptics on her own benches, triggered an internal confidence vote, which she won despite over a third of her own MPs voting to bring her down.Subsequent talks with EU negotiators, based on her wish to clary the Northern Irish lsquobackstoprsquo proposal in the agreement, collapsed after May and her counterparts failed to reach an agreement.The Government has now said there will be a vote on whichever deal she presents to Parliament in January.However, despite the disarray, the Opposition parties at Westminster have failed to agree on a cross-party strategy to put maximum pressure on the Prime Minister.Both the SNP and Labour support a no confidence vote in the Government, but cannot agree on the timing.The Nationalists and the Liberal Democrats also back a referendum on the final deal, while Labour has said a second vote is an option.In a joint letter, Blackford, Cable, Saville Roberts and Lucas have asked Corbyn to attend a meeting in Westminster tomorrow to discuss the UK governmentrsquos current position on Brexit.They wrote: ldquoIt is absolutely clear that the Government now is unwilling to give Parliament a say on the meaningful vote before the Christmas period. With recess fast approaching, the Prime Minister is running down the clock in a hope to offer a binary choice of her deal or no deal.ldquoWhile each of us hold many dferent positions, we share the common view that the Prime Ministers deal should be defeated and that a no deal should be removed from the table. There are other options and we must ensure that as opposition parties we put that challenge to the Prime Minister.ldquoNo party can achieve a result that will deliver in the countrys interests working alone. At this critical time, we must work together.Meanwhile, one of Corbynrsquos own MPs has urged his leader to \"come off the fence\" and back another vote on EU membership.Speaking to the BBC, Ian Murray, the MP for Edinburgh South, said he believed a call for a second referendum - or Peoples Vote - could command a majority in the House of Commonssupported by the Labour frontbench.Other parties have been pressing Corbyn to call a motion of no confidence in Mays Government. Labour, as the official opposition at Westminster, is the only party able to do so.However, the Labour leader has ruled out the move, which could trigger a general election, until he can be sure of winning the vote.Murray said: \"The Labour Party will have to come off the fence on that at some point pretty soon because I think what theyre trying to do might be incompatible with whats available.\"Theres a majority of MPs that would stop a no-deal scenario from happening so that could be taken off the table.\"I think we can get a majority around a Peoples Vote because we need to try and break the impasse between now and the th of March.\"Murray said cross-party talks in Parliament are ongoing to try and push for another EU vote.\"Theres a growing number of Conservative backbenchers, and its not just the usual people that are doing this in terms of supporting a Peoples Vote - weve got Guto Bebb whos supporting it, Jo Johnsons come on board recently. Theres a growing number of Conservative MPs.\"So we do need to get the Labour frontbench into a position of a Peoples Vote andwe can do that, I think we can command a majority in the House and I think thats the best way to go.\"Weve got to ask ourselves why we came into politics. I didnt come into politics to make my constituents and the country poorer.\"And therefore, given whats on the table is the worst of all worlds and given theres an impasse in Parliament, the public should be brought back into this process democratically.\"Jeremy Corbyn said on Friday: ldquoThe last twenty four hours have confirmed that Theresa Mayrsquos Brexit deal is dead in the water.ldquoThe Prime Minister has utterly failed in her attempts to deliver any meaningful changes to her botched deal.ldquoRather than ploughing ahead and dangerously running down the clock, the Prime Minister needs to put her deal to a vote next week so Parliament can take back control."},{"url":null,"title":"council-staff-to-be-offered-95-pay-rise-in-multi-year-offer","story":"The Convention of Scottish Local Authorities , which represents councils, backed a multi-year offer on Friday despite concerns about affordability.However, although the rise would also apply to teachers, council sources believe a summit tomorrow could result in teachers getting a better offer than other staff employed across local government.A COSLA spokesman said: ldquoThis was a private item and we will make no media comment ahead of speaking to our trade union colleagues.Talks between trade unions and employer representatives have so far failed to lead to an agreement on pay for  , which has led to warnings about potential industrial action.Unions deal directly with COSLA over pay for nearly all council staff, but teachers have a dferent mechanism. The Scottish Negotiating Committee for Teachersincludes the unions, COSLA and the SNP Government.As of early last week, council-employed staff who earn up to pound, a year were offered a one year rise of %.However, teachers want a % increase and the unions that represent other council workers have also rejected the % offer.At a meeting of COSLA leaders on Friday, it was agreed they would table a three year offer: .% for  , followed by successive rises of %.The move was narrowly agreed even though senior local authority figures believed last weekrsquos Scottish Government Budget was poor for councils and money is tight.It is understood the fresh offer could be further complicated by a meeting tomorrow of the SNCT.Teaching unions would almost certainly dismiss the three year proposal agreed by COSLA and sources expect the Government to bump up the offer to teachers.The insider said: ldquoIt is likely that the Scottish Government will offer more money on Monday so that all teachers get % rather than .%.However,teachers are offered a special deal over and above the sums offered to other council staff, the source said the non-teaching unions will demand the same.In a joint letter to COSLA recently, the GMB, Unison and Unite trade unions warned that ldquoparity with teachers on any rise was a ldquoprinciple area of concern for our members.The letter stated: ldquoThe situation where one bargaining group is given preferential treatment above all others can no longer continue.ldquoThe principle of parity across local government is long held and the justications for finding additional monies for teachers apply equally to other areas of the local government workforce.The letter concluded: ldquoThere is now a very real possibility of widespread industrial action across the local government workforce unless you take measures to improve the current offer. We would urge you to do so.Larry Flanagan, the general secretary of the Educational Institute of Scotland, which represents teachers, said: \"We anticipate an improved offer, butit does not address our claim in a serious way, it is likely we will move to a statutory ballot in the new year.\"GMB Scotland Secretary Gary Smith said: \"While we have concerns about how this latest proposal will be weighted across the local government pay scales and this isnrsquot a done deal by any stretch, it looks like there as been some movement from the employers and itrsquos certainly better than the settlement in the NHS.\"As ever, whatever COSLA formally tables will be subject to a full consultative ballot of our , local government members, with our position determined by our Shop Stewards\"It is vitally important we get this deal right so the working class of our local services have some much needed security on pay as the country heads into Brexit uncertainty.\""},{"url":null,"title":"neil-mackay-what-christmas-means-in-2018","story":"With just over a week to go until Christmas, Writer at Large Neil Mackay, speaks to some of the nationrsquos best minds to discover the secrets of the festive season and why it matters so much to us as human beings.THE HISTORY OF CHRISTMASSCOTLAND has a unique relationship with Christmas. Up until the s, when the holiday was focussed on religion and the birth of Christ, we hardly bothered with it as a nation - but once Christmas started to become much more secular we fell under its spell.lsquoAs far as Scotland is concerned,rsquo says Professor Sir Tom Devine, one of the nationrsquos leading historians and public intellectuals, \"Christmas is a recent event.rsquo In Scotland, after the Protestant reformation in the s, he says, Catholic holidays like Christmas and Saintsrsquo Days were abolished, and hostility to do with anything seen as lsquoPoperyrsquo intensied in the s during the Convenanting period.Scotland lsquowas much more hardline and uncompromisingrsquo in its Protestantism than England - and so while Christmas grew south of the border, it barely existed here.lsquoThe Scottish festival was New Year unambiguously,rsquo Devine says. It wasnrsquot until  that Christmas was made a public holiday in Scotland. Devine, a schoolboy in the s, recalls going to class on Christmas Day.It was the Victorians who created the idea of the modern Christmas - with trees, holly, a big family meal and present giving. lsquoImmediately before the Victorian era, Scotland had experienced five successive Jacobite risings,rsquo says Devine. These th century rebellions created a lsquoferocity of hatredrsquo and intensied the anti-Catholic sentiment in Scotland, helping keep Christmas in abeyance.The path to  when Christmas was finally welcomed in from the cold was laid by the tragedy of two world wars, Devine explains. The conflicts were lsquoa very good mixing processrsquo for Scots, Devine says, and gave young men away at war their first experience of the traditions of Christmas. The influence of ex-soldiers lsquoprepared the way for that watershed date in rsquo.Devine says that from the s onwards the story of Christmas in Scotland has been one of lsquoconquest over all other festivalsrsquo, however, he adds: lsquoThere is a very considerable irony in that Christmas has become so core as a national festival while at the same time losing much of its religious meaning.rsquoDevine, a practising Catholic, despairs at lsquothe taking out of Christ from Christmasrsquo. He sees this as a lsquoreflection of the horrible hedonistic materialism of modern lersquo.For Devine and his family, the holiday season has been tinged with more than a little sadness for many years since one of his children, John, took his own le during the Christmas period in the s. Just a week ago, though, a newly adopted grandchild came along. There will be  people over for dinner at the Devine house - all the children and grandchildren - and this year Christmas will be lsquoa magical experiencersquo, he says.CHRISTMAS AND RELIGION IN For Rev Sally Foster Fulton Christmas is revolutionary. Fulton, one of the most influential voices in the Church of Scotland and head of Christian Aid Scotland, sees Christmas as about the poorest and the weakest lsquospeaking truth to powerrsquo.Whether someone is an atheist or a believer, the Nativity story has a strongly subversive message. In the story, says Fulton, lsquothe angels bring the good news first to the shepherds who were on the edge of society, they were the poorest of the poorrsquo. The Nativity, she says, lsquois a huge challenge to power, and it poses a huge challenge to us to come together and stand up for a dferent worldrsquo.lsquoThe central heart of the story,rsquo she says, lsquois that vulnerable love is more powerful than those we deem powerful. There is a subversive wisdom that turns what we think on its head - that might makes right, than money creates happiness. The Nativity story flips that, and says no hellip the story is about Godrsquos love for humanity and our love for each other - the potential for us to embrace each other in a way that transforms the world.rsquoFulton explains thatwe study the Nativity story we will find the revolutionary message hidden in the text. She points out that Jesus is described as lsquothe Son of Godrsquo and lsquothe Prince of Peacersquo - but these were also terms used to describe Caesar when Judea was occupied by imperial Rome. She says the story is asking the reader lsquowhere are you going to put your belief  Behind power and might  Or are you going to put your belief in love and forgiveness and vulnerability and equalityrsquo.But the story didnrsquot just speak to Jewish people  years ago, she says. It asks questions of people today as well. lsquoWhat does Caesar look like today rsquo Fulton asks. lsquoWhere are you going to put your love and effort rsquoFulton is not a dogmatic preacher, and she believes secular Scotland can embrace the central message of the Nativity without having to worship God. lsquoThe Christmas story has so many deep truths which are not dependent on historical fact,rsquo she says. lsquoThe power of the story is not dependent on whether you believe it is factually correct.rsquoFor Fulton, Christmas should also be about old-fashioned fun as well. However, what she doesnrsquot want lsquois the power and opportunity to live dferently to be covered over by all the crackers and wrapping paperrsquo.WHY WE TELL STORIES AT CHRISTMASCHRISTMAS is a time of make-believe, of story-telling. To some extent, says Dominic Hill the artistic director of the Citizens Theatre in Glasgow, Christmas itself is one great fiction. lsquoTherersquos a guy who comes down your chimney,rsquo says Hill, who is currently directing A Christmas Carol, lsquoand we buy into it, we buy into a complete fiction, just the same as we buy into a piece of theatre. Christmas is like a collective theatre in our collective unconscious - we are all sharing in something which we know is an act of ritual and fiction.rsquoA Christmas Carol is one of the founding texts of Christmas - itrsquos the blueprint not just of what we should do on Christmas Day, but how we should feel, it taps directly into the heart and soul of Christmas. Itrsquos perfect for adaption into a Christmas play. Most pantos have nothing to do with Christmasyou look at their plot.Christmas is also a time when people who wouldnrsquot usually go to the theatre pay to see a show - as theatre-going has become part of the ritual of Christmas along with the turkey and the carols. At its heart Dickensrsquo story is about kindness winning through in a dark world, about the unbeatable goodness in human beings, and about the magical alchemy of Christmas which can turn even the worst person into a decent soul.lsquoAt Christmas,rsquo says Hill, lsquoI want people to go away from the theatre feeling Christmassy - warm and fuzzy and loving their fellow man.rsquo A Christmas Carol, he says, lsquois a cry for sympathy, generosity and understanding of our fellow human beings. Irsquom afraid that the fundamental issues it deals with - of a world driven not by understanding and sympathy but by money - is as relevant as ever before.rsquoDickens originally intended to write a political pamphlet, says Hill, but realised he could make his point better with fiction. lsquoHis aim was to get to the mind and engage with a problem by engaging with peoplersquos hearts and that is both the power and role of theatre and fiction and art.rsquoLike Christmas itself, Dickensrsquo novel presents this time of year as an alternative world - as a time when anything can happen. Just as in the movie Itrsquos a Wonderful Le, Hill points out, Scrooge like George Bailey is shown an alternative world and an alternative version of himself. It is about change, and peoplersquos ability to change for the better. lsquoWith fiction we can make right the wrongs of the world,rsquo says Hill - which is what Christmas is all about.THE PSYCHOLOGY OF CHRISTMASHUMANS need Christmas - or at least a festival like it, an event at the end of the year, when we try to be better people, when we connect to each other, an occasion which quite literally brings a little light into the dark.Scottish clinical psychologist Dr Simon Stuart says: lsquoAll humans have an innate desire for things to make sense, and there is a huge amount of evidence that we need to be part of a group. Christmas is the key part of our end of year ritual, and we humans are very good at thinking symbolically, so when the end of the year rolls around we want to mark that, and there is something very comforting in the narrative that we tell ourselves of things feeling alright, that things make sense, evenit is just for one day.lsquoChristmas allows us to feel the safety and warmth that,we were lucky, we felt as children. It is an excuse to let go of grim daily responsibilities and to enjoy simple pleasures like just being with people we love.rsquoPerhaps the key to Christmas is that it lets adults feel childlike, to play even - think of all those board games brought out on Boxing Day. lsquoChristmas,rsquo says Stuart, lsquoallows us to get in touch with the good things in childhood we are no longer in touch with. Play is something we let go terribly as adults and Christmas is a playful time.rsquoPlay connects us to other people, it helps us deal with the dficult parts of le, and play, like so much about Christmas, mostly centres on spending time with those we love.lsquoChristmas is predictable and secure and has rituals which go with it - it allows us to feel at peace and safe,rsquo says Stuart. Yet for all the psychological benefits it gives us,we do Christmas wrong -we feel everything has to be perfect - it will cause us more pain and upset than joy and happiness.People who think their child will only be happythey spend a fortune on presents, or those who fret about the perfect lunch, are missing the point. A racist uncle or spoiled brat nephew are part of the deal, as they are part of your le.lsquoWe cling to this idea that we must be happy,rsquo says Stuart, lsquoand to be happy we have to push away all the sadness, but what is most psychologically healthy is being able to make room for all things - good and bad - in recognition of what the human condition involves. If we accept that Christmas is never going to be perfect, that imperfection is part of the ritual, that might be a more psychologically flexible way to go into the festive season.rsquoGratitude, family and simplicity are what Christmas is about for Stuart. lsquoItrsquos a time when we are able to get in touch with what matters,rsquo he says. The sad thing is, he feels, that when Christmas ends we let go of this uncomplicated lesson.lsquoThis time of year reminds us of what it is to be a contented human being living out our values and that for me is the real magic of Christmas,rsquo he adds.THE ROOTS OF CHRISTMASAS an anthropologist who studies what makes humans human, Christmas and its rituals are especially revealing to Professor Richard Baxstrom of Edinburgh University. A culture becomes real when it shares rituals, he says, and all of us participating in a ritual like Christmas binds us together.It is like a cultural anchor, buried in the past. Nostalgia is at the heart of Christmas. The holiday takes old traditions that our great grandparents had and recreates them anew every year. Where your grandparents attended a Christmas Eve church service to hear a message of hope, you maybe watch Itrsquos a Wonderful Le with your children to hear the same message of hope.lsquoChristmas is an address to our ancestors,rsquo says Baxstrom, lsquothe coherence of a group depends on its ability to make that address together -you donrsquot do that then the claim to be alike, to be part of the same group, starts to suffer as you lose understanding of what you really share.lsquoAn address to the dead, to the ancestors - whether a generation ago or a millennia ago - is an important part of any cultural group. I donrsquot know of any group that wouldnrsquot in some way address themselves to those who existed before as a way of dealing with the present.rsquoWithout rituals like Christmas, he says, lsquowhat will you be left with rsquoTHE HIDDEN CHRISTIAN MEANINGS IN CHRISTMASMany symbols of Christmas are obvious - like the star on top of your tree representing the star over Bethlehem at the birth of Christ. But others are not so clear.Take the tradition of candy canes, often hung from the tree. Have you ever asked yourself - why is the sweet shaped like a cane  Well, it is to commemorate the shepherds who were first told of the nativity. The cane represents a shepherdrsquos crook.The giving of gts at Christmas is often linked to the Three Wise Men who brought gold, frankincense and myrrh for Christ - but what about the bows we put on presents  The bow is meant to represent that all of humanity should be lsquotiedrsquo together.Therersquos a lot of red and green at Christmas as well, isnrsquot there  The red symbolises the blood of Jesus spilt on the cross, and the green stands for the idea of everlasting le.What about holly - why do we bring the spiky plant inside over the holidays. Well, the holly and its jagged leaves represents the thorns worn by Christ on the cross.Bells tend to make an appearance at Christmas also - because bells represent the announcement of the birth of Christ by the angels.THE HIDDEN PAGAN MEANINGS IN CHRISTMASChristmas is as much about our pre-Christian past as it is about Christianity. Christmas Carols can trace their roots back to pagan fertility rites when men and women wandered through fields in mid-winter singing songs to drive away spirits that might harm the crops.Mistletoe comes straight from the Druids - it was one of their most magical plants. Roman fertility rites took place beneath mistletoe and thatrsquos translated into a kiss under the mistletoe at a Christmas party today.The Christmas tree goes right back to the Roman midwinter festival of Saturnalia when the king of the gods Saturn was honoured by bringing greenery into the home.The Yule log goes back to our ancient nordic and germanic roots when on the night of the winter solstice a giant log would be placed on the hearth to burn until the dawn, celebrating theof the sun to the earth each year.Father Christmas himself is about as pagan as you can get. That red coat  Well, thatrsquos an ancient shaman wearing the skin of slain animal inside out. Santa flying through the sky  Shamans also liked a little dose now and then of hallucinogenic mushrooms and one thing magic mushrooms will do is make you think yoursquore flying."},{"url":null,"title":"david-pratt-congos-elections-and-the-sinister-backdrop-of-a-nations-murky-contest","story":"Despots, dictators, warlords, over the years the Democratic Republic of Congohas had more than its fair share of what is derisively dubbed Africarsquos ldquobig men.It was one afternoon in  as the Congolese rainy season thundered down on a nondescript compound of shacks in the village of Kichanga when I met the then rebel leader General Laurent Nkunda.Tall, lanky and dressed in a green beret and camouflage fatigues, he was flanked by two menacing bodyguards carrying Kalashnikovs as we sat down to talk in a ramshackle hut that served as his command centre in North Kivu province.For some time Nkunda had been leading his rebel militia in the eastern DRC clashing with the Congolese army and threatening to topple the government of President Joseph Kabila.ldquoWe want security, we want to have an army, a national army. Not an army like what you saw in Goma, looting, raping and killing its own people, he told me, referring to recent events in the provincial capital from where I had just come and his forces were threatening to overrun.Nkunda himself, of course, was no Mr Nice Guy. As well as an alleged penchant for disposing of his rivals by having them tied inside sacks and thrown into Lake Kivu, he and his men were subsequently blamed for many other human rights abuses.That day throughout our chat he clenched the black, silver-topped cane that had become one of his trademarks. It struck me that he seemed fond of theatrical props like this, in much the same way as former Congolese president and strongman, Mobutu Sese Seko, was with his leopard skin hat and leather walking stick.In the end Nkunda, who was finally betrayed and arrested in neighbouring Rwanda, never did overthrow President Kabila, but the standoff between the two men typied the volatile nature of Congorsquos seemingly interminable power struggles.Kabila, who remains DRC president to this day, is currently seeing the country through yet another turbulent period as later this week it goes to the polls in what will be a crucial and controversial election.Having held power for almost  years ever since taking over from his father, Laurent-Desire Kabila, another authoritarian figure, Joseph Kabila is not allowed to run for a third consecutive term.Under the constitution, his two-term presidency was supposed to end in  but Kabila has managed to delay the coming election by two years.Should, however, the poll this time really mark his departure as president, he still hasnrsquot ruled out the possibility of running again in , a prospect that horries many Congolese.ldquoIt will be a catastrophe for the republic, because for  years his regime was characterised by corruption, impunity and the violation of human rights, said Georges Kapiamba, president of the rights group, Congolese Association for the Access to Justicespeaking last week to the New York Times.Ever since the previous electoral delays, Kabilarsquos political opponents have accused the Congolese leader of overstaying his welcome, and of using his security forces to violently repress protesters who demanded his departure two years ago.His continuation as a contested caretaker president has only fuelled feverish speculation that he might still be plotting to tweak the constitution and seek a third consecutive term.Itrsquos perhaps not surprising then that despite Kabilarsquos assurances to the contrary, there remains some considerable unease as to what lies in store during this weekrsquos poll.That disquiet only grew over the past few days following a mysterious fire in the capital Kinshasa that destroyed , electronic voting machines ndash % of the citys stock ndash just  days ahead of the presidential election.The ruined machines were among , due to be used in the vote, according to DRC electoral commission chief, Corneille Nangaa.Made by a South Korean company and being used in DRC for the first time, the machines have raised concerns that they may be more vulnerable to vote rigging than paper ballots.Given the scarcity of electricity in many regions of a country two-thirds the size of Western Europe, there are worries also that swathes of the population could be disenfranchised.The unease over the election also comes as the country struggles to cope with other major problems. Not least among these is the spread of the deadly Ebola virus that is now the second-biggest outbreak ever, after the vast epidemic that swept through the West African countries of Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia between  and .ldquoThis is a milestone nobody wanted to hit, World Health Organisationspokesman Tarik Jasarevic said in statement recently, stressing that the risk of the outbreak spreading to other provinces in the DRC as well as to neighbouring countries, ldquoremains very high.The international humanitarian response to the growing Ebola outbreak has been stymied by the violence that for years now has gripped swathes of eastern Congo.Unlike during the West African Ebola epidemic, health workers in Congo are sometimes forced to don body armour and helmets so subjected are they to attack from armed groups while working to prevent the diseasersquos spread.ldquoArmed groups pose an enormous obstacle for our staff, says Michel Yao, the WHOrsquos response coordinator in the city of Beni in North Kivu provincethe epicentre of the outbreak.To reach at least  % of Ebola-affected areas, health workers need armed police or UN peacekeeping troop escorts, he confirmed.As has been the case for many years now, nothing about DRC either in terms of the countryrsquos physical scale or that of its myriad problems is anything short of complex and enormous.At least  million people are in need of humanitarian assistance according to the UN, a need up there on a par with Syria and Yemen that has doubled in the last year alone.As ever, conflict lies largely at the heart of the problem. In huge parts of DRC especially the east, civilians are confronted daily by massacres, persistent and recurring displacement, rape, kidnappings, human trafficking, house burning and a proleration of foreign and local armed groups.Ironically, itrsquos in great part precisely because so much of eastern Congo is so rich in natural resources that two million children are at risk of starvation and . million people have fled their homes because of recent fighting.Time and again while visiting the country I like so many other have been struck by the gulf between the nationrsquos prodigious mineral wealth and the grinding poverty and insecurity of most of DRCrsquos more than  million people.In the midst of such natural wealth there have always been those warlords like Laurent Nkunda and others before and since, who have been only too willing to fight for the spoils on behalf of themselves and others.In eastern Congo alone there are estimated to be more than  armed groups and many are heavily interconnected. In this labyrinthine conflict not only are ethnic and tribal dferences exploited, but shting allegiances and erse agendas are commonplace with many fighters crossing the border to and from neighbouring countries like Uganda and Rwanda.Both these regional neighbours and nations further afield have long had their sights on Congorsquos estimated  trillion in natural resources.As David Pilling, Africa editor of the Financial Times, recently observed: ldquoThe Westrsquos role is hardly edying. It has grown used to Congorsquos simmering tragedy. So long as mining companies can work with the next regime, it will be happy enough.Right now Congo has become the worldrsquos biggest producer of cobalt, a vital component of smartphones and electric car batteries, and Africarsquos biggest copper exporter. It is also awash with gold, diamonds, oil and coltan, the last another vital ingredient for components in our digital age.In the struggle for control over the resource-rich northeast of Congo, many areas have been effectively rendered ungovernable despite the presence of some , UN peacekeeping troops.In recent weeks and months armed groups have massacred many civilians in and around the Ebola-wracked area of Beni. In Ituri Province too, on the border with Uganda, there has been a wave of fighting, atrocities committed and mass graves discovered. While ethnic dferences often underpin some of this violence, experts say this new wave of violence especially in Ituri does not follow the usual pattern of ethnic killings and reprisals.According to survivors of the attacks on villages the attackers are men speaking languages from other regions and are often equipped with new weapons and expensive communications equipment, suggesting the fighters have powerful backers who may be looking to exploit the animosity between two ethnic groups the Lendu and Hema for their own purposes.Among the explanations for the violence increasingly touted by locals, civil society and political activists in both Ituri and North Kivu provinces is that president Joseph Kabila and his allies want to destabilise the east of the country in order to postpone this weekrsquos elections.Another explanation is that Kabilarsquos motives are shaped also by being part of a corrupt network involving both DRC and other countries mining, banking and telecommunications industries, and that prolonging instability is actually a means of keeping control over the areas.ldquoTherersquos no one narrative that explains it all, Ida Sawyer, the Central Africa director for Human Rights Watch was quoted as saying.This is a view shared by other major monitoring and analysis groups among them the UK based International Institute for Strategic Studies .In a report earlier this year in which what it describes as ldquocalculated destabilisation IISS says that the ldquoDRCrsquos large territory and the limitations of its security forces have impelled its leaders to employ the ide-and-rule tactics of manipulation, destabilisation and deal-making to establish and maintain relative control.The IISS analyses also points to how local and national politicians play ethnic groups against each other including in North Kivu and Ituri provinces and how the Congolese army provides weapons and equipment, and also conducts operations that are later blamed on rebel groups.As for Kabila himself, the UK think tank says he enjoys the support of his political party, controls all major Congolese institutions and has confidants in key positions, from the lucrative state-owned mining company Gecamines to the electoral commission.ldquoThrough multiple reshuffles of leadership, Kabila has tightened his grip on the security forces, making a coup very unlikely and providing him with an effective instrument to suppress mass protests and political opposition, IISS concluded.Which brings us back to this weekrsquos elections, where although Kabila appears to be willing to stand down he has nominated Emmanuel Shadary to keep his seat warm until he can run again in .Shadary a former interior minister whose name resonates little beyond political circles in DRC, is considered to be a hard liner. Shadary is also said to have been chosen because he is malleable and has weak ties to the Congolese army and security services, two forces deeply loyal to Kabila.As for the opposition standing in this weekrsquos ballot, Shadaryrsquos two main rivals Martin Fayulu and Felix Tshisekedi could on a level playing field give Kabilarsquos placeman a run for his money, but a level playing field is one thing the election will certainly not be.Already tensions are running high with the UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet, urging Kabilarsquos government on Friday to ldquosend a clear signal that threats and violence against political opponents will not be tolerated.Ten years ago sitting in that hut in Kichanga with rebel leader Laurent Nkunda he told me that, ldquoinstead of being ruled by those who would have us live in poverty forever, you have to suffer for freedom sometimes.Nkunda was never a legitimate voice for freedom or democracy nor did he care for impoverished Congolese. Joseph Kabila one suspects is much the same.As the FTrsquos David Pilling writing this week wryly put it ldquo two days before Christmas, voters in sub-Saharan Africarsquos largest country by area will attempt the impossible. They will try to put the ldquodemocratic in the Democratic Republic of Congo.After two decades under the Kabila family rule itrsquos hard to see this happening smoothly,indeed at all."},{"url":null,"title":"cool-list-festive-days-out","story":"SEC, GlasgowBilling itself as Europersquos largest indoor funfair, the Irn-Bru carnival opens on Thursday at Glasgowrsquos SEC ndash so only four more sleeps to go, kids ndash and offers a cornucopia of thrills and delights.Pluck up your courageyou want to take on rides such as the Top Flip, the Speed Buzz, the Midnight Express Matterhorn or new additions the Rotor and Airmaxx , or try some of the more sedate attractions.

It was the PM, after all, who came up with the ill-conceived and wrong-headed red lines of the deal without consulting Parliament or even trying to build consensus and bring MPs with her. She has ignored the Scottish Parliamentrsquos objections and resisted every attempt at Westminster to give MPs a say in the process.Mrs May is not a person any of us, the poor so-and-sos who will suffer economically, socially and culturallyshe goes through with this folly, should feel sympathy for.At this crucial point I believe we should extend the hand of Christmas friendship to another isive figure, however: Tony Blair.The former PM has been embracing the sort of leadership and pragmatism Mrs May continues to reject by quietly chinning EU leaders behind the scenes, trying to hammer out a solution to the terrible situation we all find ourselves in. And, since hersquos intelligent and sane as well as extremely well connected, Mr Blair has come up with a sensible and cogent way forward. The catch is, of course, it would require the sort of leap of imagination the current PM seems incapable of.Instead of trying to keep flogging her dead horse, Mrs May should, according to her predecessor, become a facilitator. If no consensus can be found in Parliament, he justiably backs a public vote to determine whether Brexit should go ahead.Crucially, he also says the EU should ndash and would - make concessions on some of the issues that led to Brexit in the first place, such as free movement, thus allowing some EU doubters to come back into the fold and vote to cancel Brexit. Being seen to listen to concerns over immigration, to offer some flexibility to nation states, would surely be welcomed more widely across the EU, too.Showing uncharacteristic emotion, perhaps sensing hersquos on to something, Mrs May has angrily accused Mr Blair of undermining her talks. Predictably, the Corbyn faithful has also blown a gasket at his intervention Labourrsquos former leader remains the anti-Christ in their eyes because of his decision to involve Britain in the Iraq war.To put it bluntly, the whole lot of them need to move on, Labour from Iraq and the Tories from their calamitous belief that Brexit can and should happen. Lest we forget Mr Blair, though undoubtedly flawed, was the last politician able to gain the broad support of most people in Britain, regardless of their background or ideology.Hersquos the sort of pragmatic centrist the country is crying out for right now, and over the festive season Irsquoll be praying Mrs May has a Christmas epiphany and follows his lead."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9181101.jpg?type=article-full","title":"marianne-taylor-dont-waste-your-energy-feeling-sorry-for-theresa-may","story":"Irsquom doing pretty well on the domestic front.

But that joke isnrsquot funny anymore, especially as Mrs May must bear much of the responsibility for the impossible situation she has found herself in over the last weeks and months.:Flag expert: lsquoThe use of the Union Jack has never been so positive in ScotlandrsquoMake no mistake, this is not only a perfect storm but also a crisis of her own making. It was the PM, after all, who came up with the ill-conceived and wrong-headed red lines of the deal without consulting Parliament or even trying to build consensus and bring MPs with her. She has ignored the Scottish Parliamentrsquos objections and resisted every attempt at Westminster to give MPs a say in the process.Mrs May is not a person any of us, the poor so-and-sos who will suffer economically, socially and culturallyshe goes through with this folly, should feel sympathy for.At this crucial point I believe we should extend the hand of Christmas friendship to another isive figure, however: Tony Blair.The former PM has been embracing the sort of leadership and pragmatism Mrs May continues to reject by quietly chinning EU leaders behind the scenes, trying to hammer out a solution to the terrible situation we all find ourselves in. And, since hersquos intelligent and sane as well as extremely well connected, Mr Blair has come up with a sensible and cogent way forward. The catch is, of course, it would require the sort of leap of imagination the current PM seems incapable of.Instead of trying to keep flogging her dead horse, Mrs May should, according to her predecessor, become a facilitator. If no consensus can be found in Parliament, he justiably backs a public vote to determine whether Brexit should go ahead.Crucially, he also says the EU should ndash and would - make concessions on some of the issues that led to Brexit in the first place, such as free movement, thus allowing some EU doubters to come back into the fold and vote to cancel Brexit. Being seen to listen to concerns over immigration, to offer some flexibility to nation states, would surely be welcomed more widely across the EU, too.Showing uncharacteristic emotion, perhaps sensing hersquos on to something, Mrs May has angrily accused Mr Blair of undermining her talks. Predictably, the Corbyn faithful has also blown a gasket at his intervention Labourrsquos former leader remains the anti-Christ in their eyes because of his decision to involve Britain in the Iraq war.To put it bluntly, the whole lot of them need to move on, Labour from Iraq and the Tories from their calamitous belief that Brexit can and should happen. Lest we forget Mr Blair, though undoubtedly flawed, was the last politician able to gain the broad support of most people in Britain, regardless of their background or ideology.Hersquos the sort of pragmatic centrist the country is crying out for right now, and over the festive season Irsquoll be praying Mrs May has a Christmas epiphany and follows his lead."},{"url":null,"title":"snp-call-on-labour-to-bring-down-theresa-mays-government","story":"The First Minister spoke out as she ramped up the pressure on Jeremy Corbyn to table a confidence motion and bring down Theresa Mayrsquos ldquoweak and unstable Government.Ms Sturgeon said the SNP was prepared to take matters into its own handsthe official opposition failed to act.It came as Labourrsquos shadow communities minister Andrew Gwynne said the party would not table a confidence motion until after MPs got a chance to vote on Mrs Mayrsquos Brexit orce deal.He told the BBCrsquos Andrew Marr Show: ldquoThe main thing we want next week is to have that meaningful vote on the Withdrawal Agreement.

This is a Government that is weak and unstable and becoming more weak and unstable with every day that passes.ldquoBut evenit didnrsquot pass and succeed at the first time of asking, there is another merit in having a confidence motion called just now, because it would help clary Labourrsquos position.ldquoLabourrsquos position right now is it wonrsquot back a second EU referendum until it has tried and failed to trigger a general election, butit wonrsquot try to trigger a general election then wersquore in this catch- position.ldquoIt seems to me right now that Labour is as much of a barrier to making progress on Brexit as the Tories are.Ms Sturgeon said the SNP would ldquocontinue to consider tabling a confidence vote itself, but added that as the official opposition, Labour is the only party that could guarantee the motion would be called for debate.She added: ldquoWe can table a motion and we may well do that, but we want to do more than just have a gesture around this ndash we actually want to bring this to a vote.ldquoLet me be very clear ndash the SNP will keep all options open, andLabour wonrsquot act then we are prepared to act.ldquoBut itrsquos Labour that can bring a motion that is guaranteed to be debated and voted on, and Irsquom sure most people would agree thatrsquos the most sensible way to proceed.Alongside other opposition leaders, the SNPrsquos Ian Blackford has invited Mr Corbyn to a meeting in Westminster today to discuss Brexit.Elsewhere, Mr Gwynne, who is also Labourrsquos election co-ordinator, suggested his party would back leaving the EU under a newly negotiated deal in any second referendum.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell previously insisted he would back Remain.Meanwhile, Tory grandee Lord Chris Patten branded hard line Brexiters in his own party ldquoMaoists and fanatics.He told the BBC: ldquoIt is impossible to get a deal on the European Union and our relationship with it which is both in the national interest and satisfies the Maoists in the Conservative Party."},{"url":null,"title":"review-apprentice-final-did-the-best-woman-win","story":"Yet this th series, which ended with an all-women final last night, has seen the show rejuvenated.

He shows me his wedding ring, which is designed to look like a chain .He also shows me the coat of arms hersquos created for his family featuring a phoenixas well as a flag that stands for idealism. Tibbetts says the flag is a jokey nod towards his love of Doctor Who. If yoursquore true to your ideals, he says, you will never die, you will always be regenerated.:Mark Smith: The danger of lsquocriminalrsquo flags and why Irsquove changed my mind about the Union JackDay to day, Tibbetts main responsibilities at the Court of the Lord Lyon are to help communities create their own flagshe also deals with inquiries from the public and organisations that are interested in creating a flag. The Court of the Lord Lyon, based just off Princes Street, is mainly responsible for recording and protecting coats of arms as well as Scotlandrsquos national symbols , but it is also there to help create new ones. And, according to Tibbetts, there is an increasing interest in doing so.The most obvious example has been communities like Caithness and Orkney creating flags, and Tibbetts thinks there are a number of reasons for this trend. ldquoPartly itrsquos the way the world is, he says. ldquoThe more global the world becomes, the more important it is to understand your place in it. He cites the example of the flag of Barra, which gained prominence after the death of -year-old Eilidh MacLeod in the bombing at the Ariana Grande concert in . The flag was draped over Eilidhrsquos coffin when her body was repatriated to the island for her funeral and there is a campaign to have it officially recognised.Tibbetts also believes there is something particular about Scotland that makes us value symbols of identity. ldquoThere are two things in Scotland, he says. ldquoYou have a clan-based sense of identity. Also, there are hundreds of tartans and that has encouraged a deep and healthy sense of identity - Scotland isnrsquot just one thing, it is so many things underneath that build up to make this rich picture. There are a number of places that have a really strong national identity but itrsquos almost like itrsquos built on sand ndash therersquos very little underneath it. Whereas in Scotland it really is built on these strong foundations.Tibbetts sees his job as building on these foundations further and clearly loves what hersquos doing. The -year-old admits to me early on that hersquos always had a geeky interest in heraldry. ldquoIrsquom a massive geek, he says, ldquoand the more I talk, the more like Sheldon Cooper Irsquom going to sound. Growing up in Halesowen near Dudley, he specically remembers falling in love with Doctor Who. ldquoMy parents introduced me to Doctor Who when I was eight hoping it would keep me away from sex, drugs and rock and roll, he says, ldquoBut by the time I was  they were desperately hoping I would start to develop an interest in sex, drugs and rock and roll!Eventually, he moved to Scotland to study philosophy at St Andrews University, where he established a Doctor Who society and met his future we. He also began to develop his interest in heraldry, working on the universityrsquos graphic design team and developing a Tibbetts tartan that he could wear when supporting his we whos a Scottish country dancer. ldquoThat triggered me on to thinking, how do you develop these symbols  he says, ldquoHow do you make them useful :Revealed: the police list of flags that could be criminal offence to fly in ScotlandTibbetts has worked on those questions for about ten years, developing symbols for local communities before he was appointed to his new post at the Lyon Court in August. Hersquos now the go-to man on flags in Scotland, a kind of human wikipedia that you can fire questions at. I give it a try. Which is correct: Union flag or Union Jack  Both are correct, he says. What about the lion rampant ndash whatrsquos the status of that flag  Officially, he says, itrsquos a royal symbol that should only be flown by a representative of the crown. But he says hersquos not about to try to enforce that rule at Hampden on match day.I have another question: how aware is he of the negative side of flags and how do we ensure the symbols he loves donrsquot become a bad influence  Has he ever reflected on the problematic side of flags Of course he has, he says. ldquoItrsquos like any tool ndash it can be mis-used and by making more of tools that can be used negatively, am I doing a bad thing  It comes down to the system of using flags. If you were to focus solely on one flag, thatrsquos when the most toxic, negative elements come out. Whereas Irsquove seen places that start putting up their county flag and the Scotland flag and thatrsquos where you get the more pluralistic approach.ldquoA lot of the flags that are negative are political in origin, he adds, ldquowhereas what Irsquom trying to do is work with communities that donrsquot necessarily have any formal symbols to encourage the positive side. It would be easy to walk away, and say lsquotherersquos the ability to use these things for evil so no flagsrsquo. But thatrsquos not going to happen so without encouraging the positive, there will always be a negative.So what are his impressions about the status of the Union flag in Scotland  For many Scottish nationalists, itrsquos a negative symbol, but Tibbetts has a dferent take. ldquoIrsquove found the Union Jack to be on the whole a fairly positive symbol, he says. ldquoAnd I thinkanything has done anything positive for the Union Jack, itrsquos the  Olympics. He is aware, of course, he says, that there are political connotations to the Union Jackyou are looking through a particular prism, but he believes the flag has never been so positively used as it is now, even in Scotland. ldquoThe Union Jack is alive and well, he says, ldquobecause it isnrsquot just a flag anymore - itrsquos a pop culture icon. If the United Kingdom stopped existing for political reasons, orit just sank into the sea, the rest of the world would continue using the flag.Tibbetts has a similar positive impression of the saltire, and he feels it personally as a man who was brought up in England but has many connections to Scotland and now lives and works here.ldquoI still find the saltire very positive, he says. ldquoItrsquos the symbol of Scotland and now I have a Scottish we and a Scottish daughter, so I think of myself as very tied to Scotland. I will use it and I do use it and I encourage everyone to use it.In fact, Tibbetts, the go-to man on flags in Scotland, has a kind of mantra about the saltire that he thinks we should all stick to. He canrsquot control who uses the flag, he says. But he can control how he uses it. ldquoIt almost doesnrsquot matter how other people abuse it, he says. ldquoItrsquos my flag. This is our symbol.Career highThe registration of the Caithness flag has been a key success. This was the first mainland community flag in Scotland.Career lowIn my very first flag campaign after promoting my own design, a flag that failed several flag design basicswas chosen. However, this was a good early lesson as it taught me that it was more useful to promote good design principles and to provide communities with the tools to develop their own symbols.Favourite musicThe Moody Blues - I love the progressive, symphonic sound and their themes of philosophy and child-like wonder.Last book readSince the birth of my daughter last year Irsquove struggled to finish any book and even read any fiction at all.

Prince Harry has taken part in the event for more than  years but, according to reports at the weekend, he will not attend this year.Harry also, you may remember, failed to appear at the summer grouse shoot at Balmoral this year, reportedly because he doesnrsquot want to upset Meghan, who opposes blood sports. This is quite a moment: suddenly, at the heart of the Royal Family we have someone who objects to one of the things they love doing most: killing animals.The obvious question is whether Meghanrsquos opposition will change anything and we should probably admit that, in the short term, it wonrsquot ndash the Royals arenrsquot about to put down their guns because of the new American member of the family.However, longer term, Meghanrsquos personal stand is part of a wider trend thatrsquos starting to put pressure on shooting, particularly driven grouse shooting. In the last few days, wersquove had a think-tank report that challenges some of the economic claims made for grouse moors. A Scottish Government inquiry is also going on into the environmental impact of grouse moor practices and whether they can be made sustainable. There is a long way to go, but maybe, at last, the first hawks are starting to circle above the shooters.The shooters themselves normally defend what they do by claiming that shooting provides jobs and is a good economic use of the land but the report from the Common Weal think-tank has exposed that as untrue. The report compares grouse shooting to forestry, renewable energy, horticulture and tourism and concludes grouse shooting is the least economically effective. It also tackles the job claims: it takes  hectares to provide one job on a grouse moor, it says, compared to just  for forestry and three for horticulture. When you consider grouse moors cover  per cent of Scotland, thatrsquos a lot of land not being used to its full potential.However, the economic arguments ndash powerful as they are ndash are only part of the story. As everyone knows, the ideal grouse moor from the point of view of landowners and gamekeepers is one that is pretty much devoid of any predator, which leads to predator control on a mass scale ndash legal and illegal.The them-and-us atmosphere in shooting is also unpleasant ndash for months now, Irsquove been speaking to people within shooting who are concerned about the cruel and brutal way that some gun dogs are trained, but they are too afraid to go public because they know they will be shunned and their careers will effectively be over.There is also a disturbing imbalance at the heart of shooting, which I saw for myself at the Scottish Game Fair in Scone. Everyone at the event kept saying how shooting was for everyone and I remember one gundog trainer telling me how he had trained a dog for a Russian oligarch and a postie from Dundee.However, my impression I have to say was that the shooters were made up of two distinct groups: the aristocrats, the wannabe aristocrats and the well-off at one end and, at the other end, the people who work for them: men, and itrsquos mostly men, who work as keepers or beaters for not very much money. This class-ridden problem with shooting is just another reason to dislike it ndash and I rather relish the idea that it could be a duchess who helps draw attention to it.Irsquom also hopeful that Meghan Marklersquos opposition to shooting may help to change the narrative in Scotland and in particular help the Scottish Government to stop waffling and actually do something about grouse moors. The Governmentrsquos inquiry into the moors, chaired by Professor Alan Werritty, is a good start, but itrsquos based on a flawed premise that the Glorious th can actually be glorious and that grouse shooting can be made acceptable. Professor Werritty is explicitly looking for ways in which grouse moors can continue to be a part of the rural economy instead of questioning the idea of the grouse moor itself and whether something that harms the countryside should be part of the countryside.Irsquom also not entirely convinced that the Scottish Government really gets the argument on animal welfare. A few weeks ago, I accused the Government of hypocrisy for condemning Larysa Switlyk, the American photographed with a goat shersquod killed on Islay, while also supporting the culling of goats, seals, hares and other animals and failing to act on grouse moors, and the response I got from Roseanna Cunningham, the minister in charge of animal welfare, was disappointing. Ms Cunningham cited the Werritty Group and said it would be examining how grouse moors could be made sustainable and compliant with the law, but she obviously isnrsquot willing to look at the issue at a deeper level and ask whether we should question the very existence of grouse moors.Which leaves us in a curious situation in which the Duchess of Sussex appears to be making a better stand on grouse shooting than the minister in charge of the issue in Scotland. I donrsquot want to exaggerate what Meghan Markle has done of course, but the Royal Family can, and often does, reflect wider social changes and the hope must be that it has started ndash in a very small way ndash to do the same on hunting. My advice to Harry would be to listen to what his we is saying ndash she talks a lot of sense. My advice to the Scottish Government is to listen to the growing unease about hunting ndash and do something about it."},{"url":null,"title":"sse-and-npower-call-off-merger-blaming-government-price-cap-and-challenging-market-conditions","story":"The companies said the deal has been affected by multiple factors, including the performance of their businesses, clarity on the final level of the Governments default tarf cap and changing energy market conditions.:SSE and Npower merger provisionally cleared by regulatorSSE said: \"These implications meant the new company would have faced very challenging market conditions, particularly during the period when it would have incurred the bulk of the integration costs.\"The two firms had been hoping to seal the merger of their retail operations in the first quarter of  after it was recently given the green light by the competition watchdog.But only last month, SSE admitted there was \"some uncertainty\" over whether the merger with npower would go ahead after the pair delayed the tie-up due to the incoming cap on default tarf prices.SSE will now consider a standalone demerger and listing, a sale or an alternative transaction for its household energy ision.Chief executive Alistair Phillips-Davies said: \"This was a complex transaction with many moving parts.

It isn’t intended to be a ‘straight’ narrative as you usually see, but as in a fairy tale there are strange detours, unexplained events, outcomes out of all proportion to what caused them – a kind of rough and dangerous magic working beneath the surface.Aside from that, each page of the book was crafted to be as inidually beautul as I could make it. Every page took at least a few days to create, and some pages took weeks, even months.Where did the inspiration for this book come from There are so many ideas that have fed into The Boy with Nails for Eyes that it’s very hard to pin it down to a single moment of inspiration. When I was at school, I was struck by a painting done by a previous student. It was a very unnerving picture — a spectral, jagged figure with crude smears of black where the eyes should be.Many years later I saw the music video for the Tool song Sober. There was a brief glimpse of a mechanical figure with a metal mask for a face, with one eye missing and the other pierced by this huge swivelling nail. I thought of Norse mythology — Odin, sacricing one of his eyes in the well of Mimir to gain wisdom. That second image married with the memory of the painting from school that same evening, I painted the first picture of The Boy with Nails for Eyes. A few weeks later, the story began to slowly take shape.It’s changed beyond recognition over the years, taking on influences such as the War on Terror of the early s. I was born in Bahrain and was there during the Gulf War. We were all issued with gas masks by the American military, and I remember waking up one night to find the rest of my family in my room, my mum holding the masks, my dad stuffing a towel under the door. It turned out Iraq had launched a Scud — we were all terried of the thought of chemical weapons. I recognised that same feeling of paranoia in the days after September the th, and Bush’s declaration of the War on Terror. That feeling pervades the story.How did the crowdfunding for this book come about I had been shopping the comic around to agents and publishers for a long time. I found it to be a frustrating process. I tended to receive positive responses, which were still rejections. I was running out of options, and was wondering where I’d go nextI wasn’t able to place it with anyone. I received a boost when the book was long-listed for the Myriad First Graphic Novel competition earlier this year.I was speaking to an editor at Unbound, the publisher, about an entirely dferent project — an illustrated poem. Almost as an aside I mentioned that I had this other graphic novel whose first volume was finished and ready to go. I showed her the first couple of chapters and she fell in love with it . We decided to temporarily shelve the other project and proceed with this.What would it mean to you to see this book published It would be fantastic. I’ve been working on the project over  years, since my early twenties. It’s been a labour of love — for myself and my we Anna as well, who had major input into the work. I honestly had no thought of publishing it properly, it was just important to me to allow it to be exactly the story it needed to be. I basically taught myself digital art by working on it, and honed my drawing and writing skills through it. It sounds strange, but I’m as much its product as it is mine. Having it out there as a book, something physical that can be picked up and read, would make it real in a way that it isn’t yet, for all that I’m satisfied that the story is what it should be – or near as I can make it.To find our more about The Boy with Nails for Eyes and support Shaun#s project visit: www.unbound books nails-for-eyes copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The company asked Ofgem to approve the project, under a condition that, by the end of , there would be MW of generation capacity on Orkney committed to use the link once it is built.However, Ofgem has made its approval subject to SSEN demonstrating that, by no later than December , at least MW of new generation on Orkney has either been awarded a Contract for Dferencein the government#s  CfD auction or has secured planning consent and finance to construct its project.Meeting this increased generation target could prove challenging. This summer saw planning applications two large-scale wind farms, which would have contributed to this generation total, refused by Orkney Islands Council#s planning committee, following signicant public opposition.SSEN has said it #strongly disagrees# with MW of new generation being required, saying their figure of MW is based on industry best practice, which has been used to assess similar transmission investments across GB. SSEN has also said it is unclear why Ofgem is proposing a dferent test for Orkney, which it says conflicts with Ofgem’s own guidance on these types of transmission investments.Ofgem also says it plans to reduce the cost to consumers of building the link by seeking to replicate the outcomes of competition by using the #Competition Proxy# model, where it will set the revenue that SSEN can earn from building and operating the Orkney link based on its experience in cutting the costs of connecting offshore wind farms to the grid by tendering the ownership of these links.SSEN has stated concerns that the Competition Proxy model has  still not been fully developed by Ofgem, rather than the well-established Strategic Wider Works model.Ofgem has said it will make a decision on the business case for the link in spring next year and will confirm whether it will use the Competition Proxy model at the same time.Speaking on Friday, following the publication of Ofgem#s Needs Case consultation publication, David Gardner, SSEN#s director of transmission, said the recognition that the connection is needed is #a crucial step forward#, adding: “Whilst there are still several obstacles to overcome, having got this far it is important we don’t miss this opportunity to unlock Orkney’s vast renewables potential.#We will therefore continue to work in close consultation with our generation customers and wider stakeholders to address the key points raised by Ofgem in its consultation.”Ofgem has separately published a consultation on SSEN’s #Alternative Approach for Orkney# policy proposal, designed to overcome the barriers to connection faced by SSEN’s generation customers on Orkney.Orkney MSP, Liam McArthur welcomed Ofgem#s consultation but said there is still work to do to ensure SSEN#s proposals meet the needs and reflect the concerns of the local community.Aside from a transmission subsea cable from Orkney to Caithness, SSEN#s transmission reinforcement project, which, in one form or another, would stretch around most of the Orkney mainland and some of the south isles, would consist of:More information on SSEN#s Orkney Transmission Reinforcement project can be found at company#s website, here.For more on this story, see next Thursday#s edition of The Orcadian.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The first £ payment will be made around the time a child starts nursery, to help with the costs of early learning and a further £ when they start school.Social security secretary, Shirley-Anne Somerville said: “I am delighted we will be delivering the Best Start Grant Pregnancy and Baby Payment earlier than originally planned, providing low income families with increased financial support. I am particularly pleased, that by not capping children, babies born in the last six months who already have a big brother or sister, and had no support from the UK Government because they were not the first child, will be eligible to get their payment.“With the Early Learning and School Age Payments, this means that for a two child family, the Best Start Grant will provide £, # £, more than they would get under the UK legacy benefit. That’s a substantial investment to ensure our under s get the best possible start in le and reflects this government’s emphasis on the early years.“Our focus on supporting people on low incomes, and the action we are taking stands in stark contrast to the UK Government, who last week was criticised by the UN Poverty Rapporteur for being in denial about the damage and misery that their welfare cuts were causing.”Connie is  and lives in Glasgow her baby is five months old.“I heard about the Pregnancy and Baby Payment through One Parent Families Scotland, who told me all about the grant and how to apply for it,” she said.“The payment will go toward clothes, nappies and shoes for my son, babies grow so quickly and he’s five months now.“This will make a real dference to me, it’s not a payment I was expecting. It will make le a bit easier, my income stays the same, but my outgoings are higher as this is my third child. My other children are four and five so the things I had for them I don’t have anymore, so I’m kinda starting again.“I got the baby box which is great, but you get size - month clothes in that, so the £ would be of benefit when he’s a wee bit bigger.” vw, px\"  copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The appeal ends at the end of the year.Donations forms have been published in The Orcadian over the appeal, with donations also accepted online at: www.gofundme longhope-leboat-museumThe trust can also be contacted via email: longhope@gmailcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

LoLThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.Based on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted.

So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"lerwick harbour traffic continues to rise ","story":"The downturn in offshore operations had an ongoing impact on overall freight handled in the first nine months, compared with the same period in .Statistics for January to September, released by Lerwick Port Authority, show that vessel arrivals jumped by . per cent to ,, with tonnage up . per cent at . million gross tonnes.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested. In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests. Hopefully he can make an eye-catching debut to match his name.: : : : : : : :Family, friends, work colleagues and a good number of former footballers gathered on Friday to say farewell to Alastair Johnston from Cunningsburgh.When I first met him in the early s he was still an excellent player. He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

What we haven’t heard is what exactly it will mean for Shetland.”But clarity remained out of reach over the next two and a half hours with a pivotal vote in the House of Commons scheduled for Tuesday.Presenting a view from Westminster Mr Carmichael said: “Every time you think we’ve got to peak madness in the House of Commons something  happens.”He added that Tuesday will likely to be on “another level” and said that he hesitates to “predict anything beyond the next hour at the moment”.Miss Budge said that farmers were particularly worried about the future of subsidy payments in the aftermath of leaving the EU.“The big concern is where the Scottish government or UK government will find that kind of money to put into farming.”The tourism industry was most concerned about maintaining visa free travel for citizens of the EU, said Mr Mathieson, while Mrs Hambleton said that businesses had to scenario plan in order to offset any potential negative side effects from Britain’s departure. which had highlighted government analysis which warned of potential delays of up to six months for pharmaceuticals.“Project fear is now project reality”, he said.Unsurprisingly, the biggest optimism came from Mr Collins, who viewed Brexit as an opportunity for fishermen. He noted that British fishermen caught less than half of fish in UK waters, compared with Norway catching around  per cent in theirs.He later criticised the EU as undemocratic but said he was a committed European and that he and his partner had four EU passports between them. His ideal scenario would involve dismantling the EU and for the project to be rebuilt with more accountability and less bureaucracy.Indeed the EU came in for criticism throughout the night. Mr Carmichael said that his view was not “massively dferent” from that of Mr Collins. But where the fishermen’s chief was keen to depart Mr Carmichael favoured remaining and reforming.A straw poll at the close of proceedings found an overwhelming support for this view. One person favoured Theresa May’s deal, two opted for leaving with no deal and  said their preference was to stay in the bloc.Isn#t the whole idea of Brexit, to do with the Conservatives wanting a trade deal with the USA, without the interference of the EU This will also, I think, be the beginning of the mass privatization of most government responsibilities and duties of care going to USA companies, where the Conservatives will benefit from such a deal  .The impact on Shetland, I fear, will be very damaging indeed, as economic circumstances will mean a vast reduction of Local Authority spending. This will also force the SIC to do huge cuts in budgets and very much streamline and prioritize what money goes where.This will force many other companies and people owning their own business to either reduce the workforce or shut up shop The general outlook does not look favourable for Shetland in the long term.I sincerely hope my outlook is proven wrong  finally Mr Carmichael should know that the only reform of the eu that they will be doing is ever closer integration. Starting with what his former leader called a DANGEROUS FANTASY dreamed up by brexiteers, an EU ARMY. Well that DANGEROUS FANTASY has been seen to be a DANGEROUS REALITY since the referendum with EU armoured personel carriers on the streets of Paris battling french protestors.Is this DANGEROUS REALITY stuff for real Someone may have been listening to Trump and Farage#s comments on the EU army without turning on their b.s. filter.Why shouldn#t EU nations cooperate in defence matters  Is Ali saying NATO is a bad thing Since  it has become politically correct for democratic European neighbours to cooperate. Why not get over it What is this DANGEROUS REALITY Ali fears  Does he imagine the purpose of a EU army would be to attack domestic protesters across frontiers like the Soviet army did in Hungary in   Does he see the EU as a fascist entity that must be stopped  Before you know it he will be advocating the citizen#s right to bear arms so as to protect itself against the government like they do in the good old US of A.

Why not celebrate what we have in common and not obsess about invented dferences resulting from random man made lines on a map  Scary scary stuff. and only a line on a map drawn by a king that separates Scotland and England.

However, on turning , she was required to move home and the family worked with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar#s social work department to put in place suitable arrangements.It took two years to find a solution and in May this year, Eilidh moved back to Stornoway, where she was housed in supervised accommodation with a young male who also suffers from autism.Four complaints by the family over that accommodation provision were upheld by the Care Commission and, following an incident, the male was removed from the house to another unit. However, that sudden change in circumstance sparked an escalation in Eilidh#s behaviour and the family were informed by social work management that they were seeking an order under mental health legislation.Eilidh had been housed on her own in the psychiatric ward in the Western Isles Hospital in Stornoway but was flown to the mainland on Tuesday of this week as that ward faces closure. She is also on a daily course of benzodiazepine # despite never previously requiring any medication. Catherine Ann MacLeod, Eilidh#s aunt, said there had been a #mishandling# of her situation from the moment she was required to come back to the island.#Eilidh is not psychotic,# said Ms MacLeod. #What she was displaying was traits of autism. The male was removed from the house all of a sudden and Eilidh is not able to process sudden changes without careful handling. That#s why she became more aggressive she#s not able to express herself properly. It would never have happened had a proper care plan been in place.#Whatever happens now, they#ve broken Eilidh # she#ll not be the same now. It#s broken my sister, too. I want the whole thing investigated by the proper authorities so this does not happen to another family.#Miss MacLeod, who said the case was #a clear abuse of Eilidh#s human rights#, was not interested in any apology from the council. The case has been raised with local MSP Alasdair Allan.He said: #I have met with Eilidh and her family. I am very concerned that they need to be reassured that there is accommodation for Eilidh long-term on the island, where she can be near her family.#There is no doubt that the family have had reason to be anxious about this question and I hope that we will now see dferent agencies working together in the islands to find a solution. I continue to work with the family to raise a number of complaints which they have about the way they feel they have been treated this far.#The islands currently face a major shortage of staff in the care sector, partly as a result of depopulation.The comhairle denied that decisions over Eilidh#s care were in any way motivated by budgetary constraints. A spokesman said they were #unable to comment on inidual cases#.#As a general principle,# the spokesman added, #we are committed to supporting people with complex needs in their own communities but for a small number of people there are circumstances in which outcomes will improvethey are supported in specialist centres of excellence on the mainland. This is not a matter of a lack of financial resources but rather not having the required levels of specialist care and expertise.#Whilst this is the case for many areas across Scotland it is clearly more acute in an island setting because it involves those requiring such care to live away from home for perhaps extended periods of time. It is also the case that implementing such measures and deciding when it is appropriate to repatriate service users is a matter of assessment and judgement.#The spokesman added that they were currently #in the process of developing a new strategy on learning disabilities and autism and this will consider whether we have the right balance between local support and specialist mainland provision#.By Murray MacLeod"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/web-ad-sales.jpg","title":"skye prepares for santa dash","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA record high number of runners have signed up for the third annual Skye Santa Dash taking place in Portree this Saturday .More than  people have signed up for the festive frolic which starts from Somerled Square in Portree and is organised by Skye Events.In , a erse field of participants including adults, children, and animals embraced the festive spirit and adorned the famous Santa suit to undertake the two-mile charitable run.Although the event organisers will be keen to see white beards swishing and red hats bobbing come Saturday, this year they have added a few twists to the proceedings to make the dash even more inclusive and environmentally friendly.

Ireland north or south was never a concern yet we will all pay the cost for generations to come.Brexit represents a huge threat to the social, economic and political le of this island. The outworking of Brexit could be the imposition of hard border.That is why the people of the north - from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27499  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonGUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers# rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.- Declan Kearney MLADimitrios Papadimoulis is a Greek MEP who represents the Syriza party in the European Parliament.He has spent a le time involved in left wing political activism in his native Greece and has been a member of the Syriza central leadership which brought the party from opposition into government in , while the country was still in the midst of its financial and economic crisis and subjected to extreme political and economic pressure by the European Unionestablishment.Dimitrios is ‘laconic and philosophical in the way of Sparta’ – to borrow a phrase he used during a contribution at a recent conference which we attended together in Brussels, organised by GUE-NGL the European Parliamentary group to which both Sinn Féin and Syriza are affiliated.This meeting brought together leadership representatives and MEPs from twenty of the most signicant political parties on the progressive Left in the EU to discuss the future direction of GUE-NGL and future political strategy and co-operation among left wing and progressive parties including the  European elections, and the next term of the EU parliament.During one of our conversations at the conference Dimitrios recalled a story from -

He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27500  ","story":"• John James Kelly, Jimmy Joe Reynolds and Charlie #Cathal# McCafferty Staff ReporterThe three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof.On  November , IRA Volunteers blew up six customs posts along the border in Counties Armagh and Fermanagh.

The exact cause of the premature explosion has never been discovered, though Patrick Kelly said later that the men realised that the proposed time of the Strabane explosion coincided with the coming home of Strabane people from the cinema in Lford. The Volunteers decided to change the time on the timing device and in doing so they caused the explosion.The three men who died were experienced Volunteers. John James Kellys father had been a Fenian and he himself was raised in the Fenian tradition. He was recruited into the IRB at an early age and formed a group of Irish Volunteers in Clady. He took part in many operations during the Tan War and was arrested and imprisoned in England.

He was the OC in that county and had been for a time OC of Britain. He had been sent to Donegal as the representative of the IRAs General Headquarters Staff and it was he who transported the bombs - three in all - to Stranamuck.Jimmy Joe had been active in the IRA for many years.

Seismic political events, including the Home Rule crisis, the World War, the  Rising and the Conscription threat had shaken the country since the last General Election in . Women had the vote for the first time, other restrictions on the universal right to vote had been removed and the widening of democracy helped to ensure a stunning victory for Sinn Féin on a Republican . Ireland elected  members to the House of Commons in the Westminster Parliament. They were elected in single-seat constituencies on the first-past-the-post voting system, as Westminster MPs are elected to this day. Since its foundation in  Sinn Féin had advocated the withdrawal of Irish MPs from Westminster and the establishment of an Irish constituent assembly. It was only in , in successive by-election victories, that Sinn Fein won Westminster seats and put its abstentionist policy into operation. The swing to Sinn Féin was not only because of the executions and mass imprisonments after the  Rising there was also growing opposition to Irelands involvement in the war and its cost in lives, the inclusion in the British Cabinet of Tory Unionists who vehemently opposed any form of Home Rule, the threat of Partition and the ineffectiveness of the Irish Party at Westminster, led by John Redmond, increasingly seen as collaborators with British imperialism, as well as ongoing repression and press censorship. Redmond died in March  and in April the British government introduced legislation to impose Conscription in Ireland. The Irish Party MPs withdrew from Westminster in protest, thus ending forever any signicant Irish nationalist presence in that Parliament. Sinn Féin, the Irish Volunteers and the trade union movement took the lead in the anti-Conscription campaign. The Irish Party was also involved and it had three by-election successes in  but the writing was on the wall. In East Cavan in June Sinn Féins Arthur Grfith won a decisive victory on the abstentionist  which Irish Party leader John Dillon had called a policy of lunatics. It was widely predicted that Dillons party faced heavy defeat whenever the General Election came. Well before the war ended, Sinn Féins election preparations were under way. The jailing of many of its leaders in the British governments concocted German Plot did not deter the movement. In August  General Secretaries Harry Boland and Tom Kelly reported to the Ard Chomhairle that there were over , cumainn throughout the country. The same meeting endorsed a motion to contest every seat in the General Election “in order to give every Irish voter the opportunity of voting for or against the establishment of an independent Irish Republic”. By the time of the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis in October , many candidates had already been selected, a process overseen by Harry Boland, based at the movement’s Head Office in  Harcourt Street, Dublin. That same month the electoral register was revised to take account of the widened franchise. Women over  could vote for the first time and remaining property qualications for men over  were removed. This meant that the number of people in Ireland entitled to vote in the General Election grew enormously from , in  to ,, in . On  October the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress announced its intention to stand in a number of constituencies. But there was opposition both internally and externally. Sinn Féin requested that Labour candidates take a pledge to abstain totally from Westminster, in which case Sinn Féin would stand aside in selected seats. But the Labour position was to abstain conditionally, retaining the option to attend in certain circumstances. A great many trade unionists were members or supporters of Sinn Féin and opposed Labour standing unless the full pledge was taken. A special conference of the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress was held in the Mansion House on  and  November, at which the decision was taken not to stand in the General Election. Debate has continued ever since about the reasons for this decision and its consequences. There was a wide iety of views within the Irish trade union movement ranging from socialist republicans to Home Rulers to Unionists, so the reasons for non-participation were ied. Historian Dorothy Macardle put it this way: \"The majority of the working men and women of Ireland were members of Sinn Féin or the Volunteers or Cumann na mBan, and, as the disciples of James Connolly, held that the freedom of the nation and the freedom of the working classes must be pursued as one unided aim.\" . The war ended on  November and the British Parliament was dissolved on  November. Polling days was set for  December. The Sinn Féin manesto reflected the republican position adopted by the Ard Fheis a year previously and stated that the party \"gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic\". It was committed to establishing the Irish Republic by withdrawing Irish representation from Westminster, using “any and every means available” to make British rule impossible, establishing a constituent assembly and appealing to the post-war Peace Conference to recognise Ireland as an independent nation. It roundly condemned the role of the Irish Party in collaborating with the British government and attempting to “harness the Irish people to England’s war chariot”. The Manesto endorsed the  Proclamation “guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens”. The manesto was censored by the British authorities when it appeared in the newspapers but the full version was widely circulated. Press censorship was only one of the many forms of repression that the British used during the election. Hundreds of republicans were in jails  – including  of Sinn Féin.s candidates. Raids and arrests were frequent, as were bans on public meetings and among those arrested during the campaign was Sinn Féin Director of Elections Robert Brennan. His two predecessors, Seán Milroy and Dan McCarthy, were already in prison. British soldiers and loyalists had attacked  Harcourt Street on  November and subsequent nights, leading to the death from a stroke of ‘Nationality’ editor Seumas O’Kelly.  On  November the office was raided by a large force of armed Dublin politan Police who arrested Brennan and seized manestos and other election material. Acting Director of Elections James O’Mara wrote to the press: “Each arrest has naturally caused some disorganisation, but the cause of Irish independence will not be stayed or broken by such tyranny. Men have been, and will be, found who will fill the vacant places.” Nominations were due to close on  December. In North-East Ulster the Catholic bishops suggested that Sinn Féin and the Irish Party should not split the nationalist vote in seats where this would allow a Unionist to win. Sinn Féin proposed that a plebiscite be held among nationalist voters in these constituencies. Dillon rejected this in talks with Sinn Féin representative Eoin Mac Néill. The latter acceded to a call for the Catholic Cardinal Logue to propose a four-four ision of eight seats between the two parties. Others in Sinn Féin criticised Mac Néill for not adhering to his instructions. Sinn Féin candidates remained in the race in three of the four Irish Party-allocated constituencies but did not campaign and their voters were urged to support the Irish Party to keep the Unionists out. In taking this position the need to oppose the British threat of Partition was very much to the fore. When nominations closed it was realised that  outgoing Irish Party MPs were not contesting the election and in  constituencies,  of them in Munster, the Sinn Féin candidates were unopposed. Sinn Féin contested  of the  constituencies . Harassment continued right up to polling day with raids and arrests, seizure of Sinn Féin election material and removal of posters by British crown forces. After the death in Usk Prison, Wales, on  December of republican prisoner Richard Coleman, Sinn Féin campaigners wore black crepe on candidate badges. In The Four Glorious Years Frank Gallagher says a final election rally filled Dublins OConnell Street with speakers on several s, each flying a Tricolour with a black cross for Richard Coleman. He describes how on polling day Dublin dockers marched to the polling station behind an advance guard of Citizen Army veterans and hundreds of workers at the new British aerodrome at Collinstown – now Dublin Airport – went to the polls in a fleet of lorries flying Tricolours. The only two women candidates were both suffragists and  Rising veterans - Countess Markeivicz in the St Patrick’s Ward in Dublin’s South Inner City and Winred Carney in the strongly Unionist Victoria ward in Belfast. Markievicz was in Holloway Prison in England and her election address to her constituents she said:“I have many friends in the constituency who will work all the harder for me. They know that I stand for the Irish Republic, to establish which our heroes died, and that my colleagues are firm in the belief that the freeing of Ireland is in the hands of the Irish people today.”There was a two-week gap between polling day and the announcement of the final results on  December. Sinn Féin had won an overwhelming victory, taking  of the  seats in Ireland. Unionists won  and the Irish Parliamentary Party six . The majority vote for Sinn Féin was  per cent:  of the  Counties ed only Sinn Féin TDs. Of Dublins  TDs, all but one were Sinn Féin. The myth of nine-county Ulster being Unionist was exposed. Unionists polled a majority in Antrim, Armagh, Derry and Down but there were nationalist majorities in Cavan, Donegal, Fermanagh, Monaghan and Tyrone. Constance Markievicz was the only woman elected in Ireland and Britain and would go on to be one of the first women government ministers in the world in the First Dáil Éireann. Preparations for that Dáil, the democratic assembly of the Irish Republic so strongly mandated by the electorate, began soon after the General Election that transformed Ireland  years ago. GENERAL ELECTION - MANIFESTO TO THE IRISH PEOPLETHE coming General Election is fraught with vital possibilities for the future of our nation. Ireland is faced with the question whether this generation wills it that she is to march out into the full sunlight of freedom, or is to remain in the shadow of a base imperialism that has brought and ever will bring in its train naught but evil for our race.Sinn Féin gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic.Sinn Féin aims at securing the establishment of that Republic.. By withdrawing the Irish Representation from the British Parliament and by denying the right and opposing the will of the British Government or any other foreign Government to legislate for Ireland.. By making use of any and every means available to render impotent the power of England to hold Ireland in subjection by military force or otherwise.. By the establishment of a constituent assembly comprising persons chosen by Irish constituencies as the supreme national authority to speak and act in the name of the Irish people, and to develop Irelands social, political and industrial le, for the welfare of the whole people of Ireland.. Irelands claim to the application of that principle in her favour is not based on any accidental situation arising from the war. It is older than manynot all of the present belligerents. It is based on our unbroken tradition of nationhood, on a unity in a national name which has never been challenged, on our possession of a distinctive national culture and social order, on the moral courage and dignity of our people in the face of alien aggression, on the fact that in nearly every generation, and five times within the past  years our people have challenged in arms the right of England to rule this country. On these incontrovertible facts is based the claim that our people have beyond question established the right to be accorded all the power of a free nation.Sinn Féin stands less for a political party than for the Nation it represents the old tradition of nationhood handed on from dead generations it stands by the Proclamation of the Provisional Government of Easter, , reasserting the inalienable right of the Irish Nation to sovereign independence, reaffirming the determination of the Irish people to achieve it, and guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens.Believing that the time has arrived when Irelands voice for the principle of untrammelled National self-determination should be heard above every interest of party or class, Sinn Féin will oppose at the Polls every inidual candidate who does not accept this principle.The policy of our opponents stands condemned on any test, whether of principle or expediency. The right of a nation to sovereign independence rests upon immutable natural law and cannot be made the subject of a compromise. Any attempt to barter away the sacred and inviolate rights of nationhood begins in dishonour and is bound to end in disaster. The enforced exodus of millions of our people, the decay of our industrial le, the ever-increasing financial plunder of our country, the whittling down of the demand for the Repeal of the Union, voiced by the first Irish Leader to plead in the Hall of the Conqueror to that of Home Rule on the Statute Book, and finally the contemplated mutilation of our country by partition, are some of the ghastly results of a policy that leads to national ruin.Those who have endeavoured to harness the people of Ireland to Englands war-chariot, ignoring the fact that only a freely-elected Government in a free Ireland has power to decide for Ireland the question of peace and war, have forfeited the right to speak for the Irish people. The green flag turned red in the hands of the Leaders, but that shame is not to be laid at the doors of the Irish people unless they continue a policy of sending their representatives to an alien and hostile assembly, whose powerful influence has been sufficient to destroy the integrity and sap the independence of their representatives. Ireland must repudiate the men who, in a supreme crisis for the nation, attempted to sell her birthright for the vague promises of English Ministers, and who showed their incompetence by failing to have even these promises fulfilled.The present Irish members of the English Parliament constitute an obstacle to be removed from the path that leads to the Peace Conference. By declaring their will to accept the status of a province instead of boldly taking their stand upon the right of the nation they supply England with the only subterfuge at her disposal for obscuring the issue in the eyes of the world. By their persistent endeavours to induce the young manhood of Ireland to don the unorm of our seven-century old oppressor, and place their lives at the disposal of the military machine that holds our Nation in bondage, they endeavour to barter away and even to use against itself the one great asset still left to our Nation after the havoc of the centuries.Sinn Féin goes to the polls handicapped by all the arts and contrivances that a powerful and unscrupulous enemy can use against us. Conscious of the power of Sinn Féin to secure the freedom of Ireland the British Government would destroy it. Sinn Féin, however, goes to the polls confident that the people of this ancient nation will be true to the old cause and will vote for the men who stand by the principles of Tone, Emmet, Mitchel, Pearse and Connolly, the men who disdain to whine to the enemy for favours, the men who hold that Ireland must be as free as England or Holland, Switzerland or France, and whose demand is that the only status befitting this ancient realm is the status of a free nation.ISSUED BY THE STANDING COMMITTEE OF SINN FÉINtest"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27506  ","story":" Aengus Ó SnodaighThe flu epidemic that swept across Britain and Ireland in  struck at the weak and elderly in society. Hundreds died and many more spent many weeks crippled in agony in their beds during the winter months.Richard Coleman was born in Dublin in , one of eleven Coleman children, most of whom were active in the Gaelic League. Brought up in Swords, County Dublin, Richard was a religious and a patriotic young man. He trained to be a Christian Brother, but left to begin a career with the Prudential Insurance Company.When Thomas MacDonagh came to Swords in April  to recruit members for the recently formed Irish Volunteers, Richard was among the first to join. When John Redmond forced a split in the Volunteers later that year, the remaining Volunteers elected Richard as their captain.On Easter Sunday , Richard mobilised his men, the Fingal Battalion, at Saucers Town, ensured that they were ready for what lay ahead and dismissed them till the following day. On Easter Monday they, along with other Volunteers from surrounding areas, came under the direction of Thomas Ashe, whose instructions were to prevent British reinforcements from reaching Dublin. They fulfilled that task heroically that week.On the Tuesday,  Volunteers were sent into the GPO in response to a request from the Commander-in-chief, James Connolly. On reaching the GPO, the group was split up. Six men became the tunnelling unit around the GPO - `the engineering corps - while the others under Richard were instructed to reinforce the garrison under Sean Heuston in the Mendicity Institute. Connollys parting words to them did not augur well for their mission: ``I dont think you will all get there, but get as far as you can.They got as far as the Mendicity Institute unscathed. A Volunteer at one of the barricades they passed through said of them: ``In the midst of the firing, men approached up Church Street towards our barricade. When they reached it, they passed briskly towards their objective - whatever it might have been. They were dressed and, I thought looked, like countrymen... I could not but admire very much they way they went into action.At the Mendicity Institute, the garrison was under severe pressure, with the British attack coming virtually from all directions. By Thursday, things were hopeless and Sean Heuston was forced to surrender to a much larger British force.They, similar to the other captured Volunteers, were corralled at the Rotunda Hospital for identication purposes. They were then court-martialled and sentenced. Richard was sentenced to death, though this was commuted to three years penal servitude.The sentenced prisoners were transported to Dartmoor Jail in England first and then ided up. Richard was sent to Lewis Jail in Kent. When they were released after a very successful campaign in Ireland and abroad for their freedom, each Volunteer was granted £ from the National Aid Fund in America to help them rebuild their lives. They all pooled their money and began the New Ireland Friendly Society, with Richard as a director and a trustee with a superintendents wage.Like many of the other released prisoners in June , Volunteer Richard Coleman of Swords travelled to Clare to help Sinn Féin and the Irish Volunteers in their efforts to get Eamonn de Valera elected in the by-election.While there he addressed the first unormed parade of Irish Volunteers to be held since . For this, he was arrested and jailed for six months. While in Mountjoy Jail, he and the other prisoners went on hunger-strike, led by Thomas Ashe. Ashes death led to such a public outcry that the remaining prisoners were first moved to Cork Jail and then Dundalk Jail before being finally released.Richard was not to remain `at large for long and he was again arrested, along with many of the other republican leaders whod been active in rebuilding the Movement, as part of the British authorities `German Plot conspiracy.The prisoners were assembled first in Dublin Castle on  May  and were then ided up and sent to Usk and Gloucester Jails in Britain. Conditions were harsh in the jail and attempts were made to criminalise them with the order to wear prison unorms. They resisted and at the direction of the Home Office the prison governor, Mr Young, capitulated. On their first night in Usk, the internees won the right to free association, the right to receive and send letters, to smoke and to wear their own clothes.Despite their victory, the prison regime and their confinement weakened the men and with the onset of a severe winter, many succumbed to the influenza virus which had reached epidemic proportions, killing hundreds outside the prison walls. Richard was among a group of POWs struck down by the virus - they were left in their damp and cold cells for three days after the flu struck them down. On  December, a new prison doctor, Dr. Morton took up his new duties in the prison and immediately he diagnosed that Richard had now suffering from pneumonia and he had him transferred to hospital. He died a few days later on  December .Remembering the result of Thomas Ashes inquest - that the prison authorities were culpable - no formal inquest was allowed and when Richards brother arrived he was prevented from getting an adjournment of the local inquest so as to instruct a solicitor. The local inquest heard Richards brother state that Richard was a strong healthy man at the time of his arrest, while three fellow POWs attested to the insanitary conditions in the jail and that improper nursing contributed to his death. These statements got good publicity in the Irish press and added to the campaign to get the POWs released.Richard Colemans remains were released to his brother and were taken to Dublin where they lay in state for a week in St Andrews Church, Westland Row. Over , people filed past the coffin to pay their last respects. Volunteers in unorm formed a guard of honour during that time. A public funeral procession in driving rain from Westland Row to Glasnevin was followed by over , people. Three volleys were fired over the grave in Glasnevin Cemetery by six Volunteers despite a huge police presence. The size of the crowd prevented the police from moving against the Volunteers.Volunteer Richard Colemans death in an English jail, aided Sinn Féin campaign against Britains occupation and their general election campaign which was in full swing at this stage, and two weeks later Sinn Féin won a landslide victory of parliamentary seats. A month later in January  Sinn Féin MPs met as Dáil Éireann for the first time. The escape from Usk Jailby four of Richards comrades on the same day saw that republican POWs were unbroken and unbowed by their comrades death.Volunteer Richard Coleman died of pneumonia in Usk Jail on  December ,  years ago this week.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27507  ","story":" Michael McMonagle“This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account. - Chris Hazzard MPThe proposal from a senior Tory MP that the threat of food shortages in Ireland should be used to put pressure on the Dublin government and the EU in the Brexit negotiation exposes the colonial attitude of Brexiteers, a Sinn Féin MP has said. South Down MP Chris Hazzard was speaking after senior Tory MP and former minister Priti Patel urged the British government to use the threat of food shortages which could arise from a no-deal Brexit as leverage in the Brexit negotiations. The Tory MP, who previously stepped down from her ministerial role after revelations of secret meetings with the Israeli government, asked why the threat of food shortages wasnt being \"pressed home\" during the Brexit negotiations. Her remarks have sparked outrage on social media, with comparisons to Charles Trevelyan, the notorious British civil servant known for his role during The Great Hunger. Chris Hazzard said the proposal from the Tory MP were \"crass and offensive.\" “This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account.“They know the history of the Irish famine and Britain’s role in it and the very fact that they would seek to inject that into the Brexit debate is crass and offensive.“The Tories couldn’t care less about the impact of their reckless Brexit agenda on the people and economy of Ireland. We are simply collateral damage,\" he said. The South Down MP also said these and other public statements from Tory MPs highlight the importance of the backstop. \"It is our only insurance policy against a hard border in Ireland and comments such as Priti Patel’s will only serve to reinforce the determination of those of us who are saying that the backstop is the bottom line.

We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.I was asked to speak at this event because I am a woman ex-PoW. To my mind there is nothing extraordinary in that, because I am only one of many.  There are hundreds of women throughout this country who have endured imprisonment because of their republicanism – and who carry that past with pride. There are women around us today who have shown bravery that would be considered well above the call of duty in any other walk of le. And, there are thousands who have quietly lived their lives and never told anybody of the things they did to further republicanism.And today we’re here to honour the memory of Constance Markievicz, one of the most famous republican women in recent Irish history a woman revered equally by historians and revisionists, and a woman who believed in, and participated in physical force republicanism.Constance Markievicz didn’t give a second thought to taking up arms and declaring war on the British Empire. Neither had she any misgivings about teaching young Fianna members to fight and bear arms. And she is rightly hailed a hero for taking that stand but the same people who revere her would, in a heartbeat, condemn me and others like me, and would pour scorn on those women on our republican role of honour, and claim that there is a dference.But I wonder could they tell me the dference between Constance Markievicz, who stated in  that:And the words of Volunteer Mairéad Farrell when she stated in :And I would love those revisionists, who laud Constance Markievicz and condemn Mairéad Farrell, to explain to me the dference between the circumstances that drove republicans in  to strike a blow against the British empire, and of republicans in  and  who took up arms to defend small communities like mine – trapped on the fringes of loyalist east Belfast, subjected to sectarian pogroms, ignored by a British government and forced into a state that neither wanted or accepted us.Marie Moore, a native of Clonard, a veteran of republican struggle and Belfast’s first Sinn Féin Deputy Mayor speaking of her le of republicanism rememberedWhere were the revisionists when thousands were being burned out of their homes when frightened mothers were dragging terried children onto buses and trains and being forced as refugees across the border, hoping for help and safety in another state that had abandoned us, and that also neither wanted nor accepted us When those who revere Constance Markievicz’s philanthropy and work among the poor of Dublin are celebrating her le, do you wonderthey ever give a thought to what she would have done had she been there when the hundreds of refugees from ‘the black north’ poured off buses with their meagre belongings in battered suitcases Do they think she would have stood idly by and did nothing I know none of us can speak for the dead none of us know what the other would have done, but we know enough about her to come to our own conclusions and I would like to think that she would have been as much a leader now as she was then.Her commitment and her legacy was an example to young women like me when I was growing up in a war-torn Belfast. She inspired us. She gave us aspirations to live up. She set an example. And part of that example was to never back down.We knew her history. We knew she took up arms. We knew she was a commander in the IRA. And we aspired to be just like her.She was also a POW, and when young women were imprisoned throughout the conflict, in this State, in Britain and in the six counties, they knew they were walking in the footsteps of the women of . We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.And no political opponent or revisionist will tell me, and all those thousands like me, that I should be ashamed of that.But the irony is, that the people who are so quick to condemn today’s republicans for taking the decisions we did, have never once considered what drove so many Irish men and women, young and old, to walk the hard roads we walked during these last  troubled years. We didn’t do for fame or fortune. We did it because it was the right thing to do.There are always reasons and circumstances behind people’s decisions and, we need as much today to consider those journeys, as we do the journeys of the men and women of . Circumstances and history shaped all of us. That’s undeniable.Throughout the decades republican women have been to the forefront of struggles in Ireland in the Suffragette movement, the Labour movements, the Gaelic League, and many other organisations – much as republican women today are deeply involved in every aspect of daily le and organisations working to better peoples’ lives.In every phase of the struggle, women have taken risks. From their involvement in the ’s border campaign, to those who broke the Falls Curfew and carried guns and ammunition out under their coats, in prams and in shopping bags. And, we know many too who lost their loved ones, and their own lives, to plastic, rubber and live bullets on active service for the IRA, and to loyalist and British State murder squads.We all know women who walked the streets wrapped in blankets, in bare feet, in rain and snow, to highlight the plight of the prisoners in the H-Blocks and Armagh who smuggled comms, love letters, and much more into and out of the prisons who marched in their hundreds to the steps of Stormont when Sinn Féin were locked out of talks, demanding their rights and representation.There are women who travelled every week, for years, to visit loved ones imprisoned in this state, in the six counties and in Britain, most times with young children in tow. The hardship of prisoners’ families is often forgotten, and imprisonment impacted on thousands upon thousands of people throughout this island, not just the prisoners themselves.Brave republican women stood as Sinn Féin candidates in the early ‘’s and ’s, when in councils throughout the six counties they were vilied and subjected to the vilest of sectarian abuse and threats of death.And I’m proud to say that the temerity of those who led the way has paid off in idends. Republican women were elected in their hundreds – councillors, MLAs, TDs, MEPs, Senators and including – dare I say it – three very proud and very capable women MPs are walking in the footsteps of the first female MP elected to sit in the British House of Commons the first abstentionist Sinn Féin MP, Countess Constance Markievicz.And still, there are people telling us today that our Sinn Féin MPs, elected by thousands of Irish citizens full in the knowledge that, like Markievicz they would not be taking seats or swearing an oath to a foreign government, should take seats in a British parliament, or better still, resign those seats and gt them to others who are more than willing to doff their caps and swear an oath to defend an English monarch. Do these people even listen to themselves These same people, who are lecturing us, will no doubt be lauding Constance Markievicz for her part in the birth of the nation, with all her history of abstentionism and of physical force republicanism.Do they genuinely not understand irony And do they think that our supporters, those who flock to the ballot boxes in their thousands toSinn Féin elected representatives, don’t aspire to the goal of Markievicz, of a democratic republic that cherishes all of the children of the nation equally Where is the equality for nationalists in the six counties  Where is the respect for the democratic mandate of thousands upon thousands of people who have yet to have their rights and entitlements respected in the British constructed and maintained sectarian six-county state  Where is the support for our democratic mandate  Where is the aspiration to cherish all of the children of the nation equally  Or do they not consider us part of that nation  They need to bear in mind that when the Proclamation was being written there was no border in Ireland – hard or soft.They also need to bear in mind that there is no single narrative to this conflict. Yes, people have been hurt, on both sides, and those who are trying to revise the history of the IRA of , are also trying to revise the history of the IRA of this phase of the struggle to present one side and one side only. As a republican woman I am proud of the rich history of Irish women that we can lay claim to, and many here today were part of that history. And I am proud and in awe of those women who lost their lives as part of that struggle.Unfortunately, throughout the decades of our troubled past people who know nothing about what we went through are writing and rewriting our history.We cannot allow the memories of our dead, the stories of nationalist and republican victims, and the history of repression and oppression that led to young people again taking up arms, in the same way Constance Markievicz and Tom Clarke and Pádraig Pearse and all those others in  took up arms, being airbrushed out of our history. And maybe one day we’ll be in a place where the circumstances that led to those decisions are acknowledged and accepted.Because, rest assured, not one of us woke up one morning and decided on a whim to take up arms, to put our lives on the line, to face imprisonment and death. There are always reasons why people make the decisions they do but some people just refuse to see or accept that.We know those reasons and we need no lectures from people who have not walked in our shoes. is something we should all aspire to.We have a duty to future generations to ensure that our revolution isn’t rewritten. We need to make sure that our young people know why and where our history of struggle comes from to remind, educate and to see that it never happens again to ensure that young women continue to be inspired by Constance Markievicz, by her bravery, her philanthropy and her work for those less well off. But we also need to ensure that the circumstances that led to her and future republican women seeing the need to take up arms, never happens again.test"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1307567.jpg--.jpg?1544691749000\n","title":"ballykeel youth centre now open after refurbishment","story":"Ballykeel Youth Centre re-opened last week after a major refurbishment.The youth centre, which has been serving the Ballykeel community for  years had many of its areas rejuvenated.

Hot Milk Forge is a Blacksmithing and Bladesmithing School based on the Lisnamanny Road in Ballymena.It runs evening, weekend and day classes in Basic to Advanced Artist Blacksmithing and Bladesmithing and people have been travelling to the courses from all over the world.Speaking to the Ballymena , Eamonn said he loves teaching his craft to keen and intrigued novices.I have been a professional artist and sculptor since .For  years Blacksmithing has formed an integral part of my practice with public works scattered across the UK and commercial works collected internationally, Eamonn explained.However I love taking the courses and teaching people a new skill, something they wouldnt ever experience.The -year-old said he recently had a lady travel all the way from Kerry to make her own unique creations.This woman drove a long way to do the course and she made a number of intricate brooches and pieces of art that she can treasure.I have many people that sign up to the course who are big fans of Game of Thrones and TV shows like that but a lot of people just want to try something dferent, Eamonn said.At the minute we are making mostly knives which seems to be the trendy item at the minute.“This has probably come from the huge interest in Game of Thrones.”Eamonn has been approached by the HBO series to make specic items for the show and has had many of the actors who appeared on the show taking his courses.Hot Milk Forge offers evening and Weekend Classes in Blacksmithing with an artistic twist. Evening classes are open to everyone above the age of .

My sacrice and dedication went to motorcycling and I’m very proud to be a Doctor of Letters because of that.“It’s a lelong sacrice. Since I was six-years-old I’ve travelled theand breadth of the UK racing. The injuries I’ve faced, the ups and downs, to actually win a world championship on top of all that is massive.“It’s nice that my family can see there was an endgame after all their sacrice in the beginning.Jonathan Rea shows off his new threads“It’s a very proud day for the whole family. Especially my two little boys , they realise that it’s not normal to be at an event like this. They know the ious race tracks inside out but this is dferent. I hope I can be a good role model for them.”The -year-old said it was the first time he had ever attended a graduation, adding: “I never imagined the first one would be my own.”Asked about his graduate attire for the ceremony, he said: “Of course I feel a lot more comfortable in leathers and a helmet but it’s really nice to be acknowledged outside the sport. It’s something that’s happening more and more recently.”The honorary degree follows the  award of an MBE on the New Year’s Honours list. Rea also finished runner up in the  BBC Sports Personality of the Year. Jonathan Rea with his honorary degree from the University of Ulster at Belfasts Waterfront Hall“These others awards and occasions are new to me. It’s good that I have the support at home and actually moving back here is great timing.”Underneath his gown he was wearing a suit made by Isle of Man-based tailor The Noble Suitor.

Jonathan Reas specially made suit for the ceremony“My grades at GCSE were A*s, As and Bs, but unfortunately I didn’t further that. I went travelling the world racing bikes.“After I left school I went to technical college and got an HNC in manufacturing engineering and then went on to work as an engineer.“It was hard to hold down a job as I was taking too much time off work to go racing.“I had what was nearly a career-ending injury. That was a dark time in my le because I didn’t know what was coming, I’d no great qualications behind me, I was working a minimum wage job. I wasn’t in a great state of mind.“I threw myself at bikes for a few years and then it worked out, my big break came.”He added: “Northern Ireland fans are very important to me. The travelling support has been immense these last few years. It just keeps getting bigger and bigger.“On my sighting laps and slow down laps I can see the Northern Ireland fans. I always try to throw out a leg to acknowledge I’ve seen them.”Rea is often claimed by both Larne and Ballyclare and sometimes referred to as a son of Ballymena. Asked where he came from, he said: “I’m a country boy. I grew up in Kilwaughter, then moved to Ballyboley. We were part of Larne Council with a Ballymena area code and a Ballyclare postcode. I’m happy to be claimed by whoever.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_auto,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8741643.1545039707!/image/image.jpg","title":"health  ","story":"Age NI says a recently launched Department of Health review of emergency health care # with a particular focus on pensioners # is #a bit late in the day# for this winter and #should have started months ago#.

Last winter’s figures for NI will be released on Wednesday.The comments from Age NI come three weeks after the Department of Healthannounced a ‘review of urgent and emergency care’ with a particular focus on the elderly in light of emergency departments experiencing “intensying pressures over recent years”. DoH acknowledged growing waiting times for hospital admissions and that “another dficult winter period” is anticipated.Age NI welcomed the review – but expressed concern about the timing. “It is good news but it seems late in the day to start this processwe want to see any benefits this winter,” a spokeswoman said. ldquoit seems late in the day ,,, this process should have started months agoAge NI“We all know that our healthcare system, particularly our hospitals, come under extreme pressure during these winter months and this process should have started months ago.” She noted the “added impact” a long wait in AE can have on the elderly and pressed for “safe and effective” alternatives that will be “just as beneficial or more so than an admission to hospital”.Rita Devlin, deputy director of the RCN in NI, said nurses are worried. “Our members are fearful that there will be a repeat of the problems experienced last year in emergency departments over the holiday period,” she said. “Staff would hope that trusts will have contingency plans in place to ensure that services will be maintained at normal levels.”Dr Grainne Doran, chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners NI, said GPs have “serious concerns about the increase in workload that will come this winter”. She added: “With services already struggling, doctors have voiced their concern about being able to manage with the additional workload during the winter season. “A review of emergency and urgent care, and the implementation of necessary changes, cannot come quickly enough.”Extra  staff to cope with local health care Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Dr Tom Black, BMA Northern Ireland Chair of Council, said a “long-term and meaningful plan” is needed to address winter pressures. While each trust will have a winter contingency plan, he said, staff face “additional workload and work-related stress” during the winter period which may see “the whole system begin to wobble”.Properly funded home care packages for discharged patients are needed, he said, along with “meaningful long-term workforce planning” to have enough doctors in place to meet the needs.Last winter saw Antrim Area Hospital call in St John Ambulance volunteers for basic ward cover on New Year’s Eve, while SDLP MLA Dolores Kelly said  people waited at Craigavon Area Hospital over two nights for assessment on January  and .In the first week of January, staff reported that Belfast’s Royal Victoria Hospital was “at breaking point” and a ‘major incident’ was declared because of the excessive backlog of patients.Londonderry’s Altnagelvin Hospital had to implement an emergency plan for its emergency department, and on Boxing Day the Southern Health Trust said patients were having to wait for up to  hours to speak to an out-of-hours GP.From December  to January  last year, some  NI patients waited more than  hours for admission, transfer or discharge, the BBC reported.However, the Department of Health said that its newly launched review of emergency care is not intended to address problems this winter.A spokeswoman said: “The review of urgent and emergency care is a long-term project and should not be conflated with initiatives to counter winter pressures in hospitals this year.”The review will aim to establish a new regional care model for the Province, with particular focus on the elderly, she said. “A range of measures have been put in place by trusts for this winter in expectation of another challenging period for health services across these islands.”The department has funded these initiatives, recognising the need for immediate mitigations and longer term review, she added.Age NI advises that by taking some simple steps, older people can stay warm, well and safe in the winter months-. By setting your heating to the right temperature , you can keep your home warm and your bills as low as possible.. Food is a vital source of energy, which helps to keep your body warm. Keep basic food items in the cupboard or freezer, and try to have hot meals and drinks throughout the day.. Try to avoid going outside on extremely cold days. If you do need to, wrap up warm and remember that several thin layers will keep you warmer than one thick layer.. Keeping active generates heat and helps to keep you warm, so when you’re indoors, try not to sit still for more than an hour. Get up and walk around, make yourself a warm drink, and spread any chores throughout the day.. If you’re over , be sure to have a seasonal flu jab. Seasonal flu viruses are always changing, so you need to have a jab every year, using the latest vaccine.. It’s not unusual to feel a bit down in winter. Try to keep to your usual routines and,you can’t visit friends, make sure you phone them regularly for a chat.. Call Age NI’s Advice Service on    for a free benefits check.

For after much soul searching and deliberating, Christina has decided to take her love for her community on to the next level by becoming a Sinn Féin City Hall rep. Christina has been co-opted on to Belfast City Council in place of the outgoing Councillor Mary McConville, who has stepped down for health reasons.“I’ve been involved in community work for twenty-three years now. One of my earliest memories is of me at five years old walking down the Grosvenor holding a sign that said, ‘We want heat not cold feet’ – my mummy had me involved in community work from no age, it’s in my blood,” Christina told the Andersonstown News, smiling at the memory.“I attended my first Belfast City Council meeting at the beginning of December. I was a bit nervous speaking, but I got through it. It was very interesting watching the dynamics of the Council.”Christina identied some of the issues that pushed her over the line when it came to making the decision to enter City Hall.“There are local issues that I want to make an impact on. I have given this a lot of thought and I discussed it with my husband before I made my decision, we both agreed that it’s the right path for me, I feel that it is a natural progression.“I want to make a dference and I want to carry on the good work of Mary McConville. I live in this area so I am well aware of the local issues and I find them as much a challenge as everyone .“I believe you should feel safe in your area, you should feel happy, you should benefit from generated investment. There are huge developments happening in the city centre, these should be impacting the areas around it to a greater extent, and I feel I can represent people fully in that respect.”Christina’s much-missed mother Belle was a renowned voluntary community worker –chairperson of the Roden Street Development Group at Grosvenor Community Centre.“My mother taught me that community is everything, she also taught me that a community worker is never off duty. She never feared going the extra mile to ensure that people got what they deserved.“I have been described as being parochial, which I don’t think is true, I am very open minded in my thinking. But I would agree I am there to represent local voters, so to a certain extent I must be parochial to genuinely bring that local voice forward.”Christina continued: “I’m the kind of person who works hard, but my mother, well, she worked tirelessly.Her door never stopped, people always turned to her.She gave everything andI can be half the woman she was I will be happy. I’m going to have to learn to manage my work-le balance, though.“Since my mummy passed away I have tried to continue her good work, she showed me the ropes and I think she would be delighted to see me take on this role. At the end of the day I work for this community and I promise to do all I can to ensure the people get what they are entitled to.“There’s a gap between the Grosvenor Road and the city centre that is crying out for investment. The Belfast Transport Hub is going in, which I believe will generate employment. I would love for our young people to be in a position to become engineers and the like. I would love to find a way to get them that training to elevate them to those amazing employment opportunities.“I really want better for our people, I am so proud of being from Roden Street and I will never leave the Grosvenor Community Centre, it’s been too many people’s le’s work. I want to do my Council work to the best of my abilities in my own time.“I’m going to try my hardest to do the best job possible for the people of this area and beyond.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"new report lays out bright future for west belfast","story":"A NEW report detailing the positive transformation that has taken place in West Belfast in recent years will be launched on tomorrow morning . ‘Vision : Transforming West Belfast’ will look to the future as well as outlining projects such as the James Connolly Interpretive Centre, Casement Park and the Roddy McCorley Society interactive museum and visitor centre.The report has been commissioned by Fáilte Feirste Thiar and the West Belfast Partnership Board and will highlight the amount of investment that has gone into the West of the city.Projects in the spotlight in the report include:•£m from Belfast City Council for the new Andersonstown Leisure Centre•m from the Department for Communities and Ciste for Áras na BhFál• £m for the Balmoral Hotel•£.m for the Blackmountain Shared Space Project•£m investment for Brook Leisure Centre•£m for the Falls Park City Cemetery MasterplanIn total, the report will list  projects in West Belfast that have benefited from investment.Speaking to the Andersonstown News ahead of the launch, Harry Connolly, Executive Director of Fáilte Feirste Thiar, said: “In recent years West Belfast has began to secure increased amounts of public sector investment.“Research undertaken for this publication has uncovered that this combined investment totals over £ million – a signicant figure.“Many people involved in our local private, public and community sectors will not be fully aware of the huge amount of work involved nor the scale of the investment secured. The Vision : Transforming West Belfast publication captures, articulates and plots out in a user-friendly format the depth of investment, the impact of this investment and, importantly, a timetable for delivery.“Only projects that have been secured are showcased.

He’s now been issued with a summons and was due to appear in court on Wednesday morning – but the hearing was adjourned for the second time.Speaking to the Andersonstown News, a gobsmacked Seamus said: “I’ve kept horses all my le, they are beautul creatures. I am in poor health and looking after these horses brings me a real sense of joy.”Seamus lives with COPD, is diabetic and has suffered multiple heart attacks.He continued: “I was giving bread to the horses, minding my own business, and these two characters approached me and demanded I stopped. This field belongs to my friend and I have permission to feed these horses. What harm was I doing  I don’t need the stress and strain of this.”Seamus described the encounter that led to the series of events that has left him baffled and angry.“I pulled my car up that morning and walked over to feed the horses, these two fellas shouted over at me and told me to stop. I told them to take themselves off, they said they were ringing the peelers and I told them to get whoever they wanted. One of the men said the birds were lting the bread I was feeding the horses and dropping it in his garden, absolute nonsense. I got into my car and drove off. Your man must have taken my car registration because I received a fixed penalty notice in the post.”Seamus added: “I turned up to court on the arranged date and the complainant never bothered turning up. I showed up again on Tuesday and the same thing, he never weighed in again. NowI didn’t bother turning up I’m sure they’d have something to say about that. This is a complete and utter waste of Belfast City Council time and money and I am urging them to drop it.”Local People Before Profit Councillor Matt Collins said: “This whole situation is ridiculous, whoever made the decision to issue a court summons to Seamus perhaps needs a basic crash course in what constitutes illegal or criminal behaviour.

But other people would likely be intimidated by this. Nobody wants brought up in front of a court and especially for something so absurd. I’d imagine the vast majority of people would agree with me that Belfast City Council and the powers-that-be in this city ought to put their time and energy into something more productive, instead of hauling a pensioner up in front of a court for feeding horses.”A spokesperson for Belfast City Council said that as this is an ongoing matter they would not be making any comment."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"pressure mounts for new school building for st josephs college","story":"EDUCATIONALISTS and local community leaders have called for a new school building for St Joseph’s College.Housed in the former St Monica’s Secondary School on the Ravenhill Road, local representatives believe stellar progress at the school is being hampered by its crumbling premises.The school, which opened in , is proud of its all-ability, Catholic ethos and its erse student body, but many believe it is time the school got the st century facilities it deserves to keep up with its growing pupil numbers.Speaking after addressing the school’s annual prize-givin, Lord Mayor Deirdre Hargey called on education chiefs to fast-track a long-promised rebuild for St Joseph’s.“St Joseph#s’ exemplary inclusive approach is a source of pride for all in Belfast who value excellence in education,” she said. #Under the leadership of principal Michele McCormick, the school is going from strength to strength but the commitment of governors, staff and indeed pupils is not matched by the resources it commands.#Physical education amenities at the school have come in for fierce criticism from parents who say the tarmacadam car park in front of the school which doubles as a play area is an indictment of the existing facilities. And the contrast with the spanking new facilities of its Catholic grammar school neighbour, Aquinas College, has raised questions about the priorities of education chiefs.Principal Michele McCormick says the school’s results, particularly in Maths and English, are the best in Belfast in the non-selective sector. In , the school also won the Aisling Award for ‘Oustanding Achievement in Education’. “St Joseph’s has a warm, welcoming ethos and they pride themselves on the care and compassion the staff have for pupils and their determination and passion to achieve the best possible success for every child,” added the Lord Mayor.#St Joseph’s College is delivering a first-class, st century education to our young people. It’s time, therefore, that it was given the st century resources it needs to fully realise its mission.”A spokesperson for the Department for Education said: “The Department does not maintain a prioritised list of schools in need of a new school build. When a major capital announcement is being planned, the education managing authorities are asked to providea list of schools that they consider most in need of a new build at that time. “Due to the many demands on the Department’s capital budget, when a call for proposals is made, all projects submitted by the Managing Authority are assessed under the Department’s protocol “Any school not announced must be selected through the formal ‘call for projects’ processit is to become eligible for a new build. Given the medium term budget uncertainty and the absence of a Minister, there are currently no plans for a further major capital investment announcement.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"the fureys uniting generations through music","story":"DESPITE its relatively small population, ours has never been a country with a shortage of musicians on the international stage, but few of them have had an impact as lasting as The Fureys.Formed in the , the iconic folk group has entertained audiences throughout the world for  years. While the band’s line-up has inevitably changed over the years, brothers George and Eddie Furey have continued to tour the globe, bringing the finest ballads to generations old and new.To celebrate their th anniversary they have released a new album, ‘The Fureys  Years On… to be continued’, and will play a headline gig at Belfast’s Waterfront this January.Ahead of the gig, the Andersonstown News met with George and Eddie, who had just ed from the Netherlands leg of their jubilee tour. While their music has touched thousands,not millions of people, George and Eddie are a pair without air and graces. Our chat was an informal one that took place in the Waterfront Hall’s lobby, with school kids, excited by their trip to the panto, providing an excitable background hum. As for the story of The Fureys – it’s one of famous faces, infamous sessions, and more years worth of craic than can be adequately depicted in a single newspaper article. However, with the release of their new album – which foregoes many of the obvious tracks and is jammed full of new material – our conversation almost immediately turned to things more current.“A lot of the songs we would’ve heard as kids and would’ve grown up singing them,” Eddie explained.“Streets of London is one of them, which was written by Ralph McTell, and we know Ralph going back many, many years.”George added: “The first track on the album was written by a Donegal man, Jordy Gallagher, and he wrote the song about eight years ago. “Joe, our manager knows him very well and he gave our manager the song to have a listen to because he thought it might suit on the album because it’s a protest song. A lot of those songs from years ago are all protest songs, from the s.“We grew up with all these protest years ago. There was a great song years ago called The Eve of Destruction, and it’s about what would happen to ussomeone dropped the big bomb – we grew up with those songs. So this song really suits the album.”“The Day’s Gonna come is a great song,” Eddie concurred. “The song tells you what’s happening to the world and those older songs tell you what was happening at that time. The words are ‘the day is gonna come when the water runs out and the wells run try, man’s so dumb, fish can’t swim and birds can’t fly’.”He continued: “There’s also peace songs, love songs, and drinking songs. “We’ve sang an awful lot of love songs over the years too. Songs that our mother used to sing and our father used to sing, Sweet Sixteen and that sort of stuff.”Although it’s an anniversary album, the new CD is new territory for The Fureys, who had not previously recorded much of its material. But much like their previous albums, The Fureys have continued to record songs from some of world’s best songwriters.“The songs are mostly from people we’ve met over the years on our tours,” Eddie said.“We’ve sang a lot of great ballads over the years.“We even recorded an album of Charlie Chaplin songs. Josie, Charlie Chaplin’s second youngest daughter, was cleaning out her father’s house and she found five songs that were never recorded before, written by Charlie Chaplin, and she asked uswe would do the songs. We had to do them, and we had to do them with an orchestra. We had a -piece orchestra in the studio with us recording these great songs.”George added: “We do a mix of stuff – not just Irish songs. If you listen to some of the bands now they’re going back on the old stuff. To me, you can’t beat the real thing.”Unlike some older musicians and music fans, The Fureys are not consumed with thoughts of past ‘glory days’. On the contrary, George admits that music is “probably more versatile now”. Instead the past only serves to make their current concerts more fulfilling as they bring together people who have followed them through the generations.“A lot of the kids that come to see us now, their grandparents or parents would’ve come to our concerts and bought our albums,” George said. “Now we have kids coming to concerts with their grandma and grandpa.”Eddie noted: “People grew up with our stuff and they love to see it live.”The Fureys have united generations and their music has been played everywhere from their hometown in Dublin to the International Space Station – where astronaut Chris Hadfield famously played their track ‘Steal Away’ – but of all other places outside of their hometown, it’s in Belfast where they feel most at home.“We’ve been up here so many times it’s like our second home,” George insisted.“We used to play in the Ulster Hall before this was built. We used to bring the wives up to do the Christmas shopping, because it was cheaper up here. Then we’d smuggle it across the border. If you got caught at customs they’d take it off you – drink and everything – party time. We had some parties like.”He continued: “This is our tenth gig here, which I never knew until this morning. It was only opened up when we first played here. They know what to expect – people are used to coming to see us. They always ask for some of the old songs, and we have to do them. People will ask for some dferent songs too, and we can do them no problem.”Eddie added: “We’ll be singing some songs off the new album too. You have to add them in here and there. If a request comes up for an old song we like to keep people happy.”The Furey’s play at the Waterfront Hall on January , .

Labour will try to force Brexit vote before Christmas  Bertie Ahern: Ireland cant give an inch on avoiding hard border  Blair: May is irresponsible to try and steamroller her deal through The routes are understood to include country lanes, private roads, rights of way across private lands and other unmarked access points leading into Northern Ireland that could be potential smuggling routes.The highly sensitive work was conducted by members of the Defence Forces, working with gardai. It involved physical mapping of the Border by army personnel along with desk-top work and was completed in recent months.Defence Forces are in continual mapping of Irelands Border for security purposes, such as during the Foot  Mouth disease outbreak  years ago The latest exercise is regarded as particularly signicant in light of the potential security risks posed by Brexit.The updated map of the frontier will form a key part of the security services contingency planning for a doomsday scenario that could follow Britain plunging out of the EU without a deal.The last official report on the Border identied  official crossing points. That report was published jointly in July by the Department of Transport, Tourism  Sport and the Department of Infrastructure in Northern Ireland.However, it highlighted only public roadways along the Border that stretches from Donegal to Antrim and did not include any private roads or laneways.The Defence Forces work has highlighted scores of private crossing points, some of which could be vulnerable to criminality in the event of a hard border. The Irish Armys Border mapping work can be viewed in the context of the security risks posed by Brexit, which were outlined in stark detail at a cross-border crime conference last month.Garda Commissioner Drew Harris told the conference that dissidents would \"undoubtedly\" attempt to exploit a hard border as \"something they wish to rally around\".\" title\"The Irish border which has proven a thorny issue in Brexit talks \" width\"\" \"\"  \" title\"The Irish border which has proven a thorny issue in Brexit talks \" width\"\" \"\"  The Irish border which has proven a thorny issue in Brexit talks But the conference was also warned that even a soft Brexit could lead to challenges with increases in cross-border smuggling of all kinds, including people trafficking, cigarette and alcohol smuggling and fuel laundering. The conference was told that pc of cross-border gangs are highly mobile and operate on both sides of the Border.Previous security assessments have identied  criminal gangs dominating cigarette smuggling on both sides of the Border. The Governments position is that there must be noto a hard border.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said earlier this month that the Government has no contingency plans in place for policing the Border in the event of a hard Brexit.However, he said the Government does \"have regard for the fact that we could see an increase in smuggling and other illegal cross-border activities\".In a statement to the Sunday Independent, the Defence Forces said: \"In the normal course, Oglaigh na hEireann carry out analysis and background research into contingencies. This would include viable border crossings. In the context of security, any research in relation to the border or otherwise is internal to Oglaigh na hEireann.\"A statement from An Garda Siochana this weekend said they \"have been and will continue to review the policing issues relating to Brexit. This has included regular liaison with our counterparts in Northern Ireland. However, without a final political settlement, it is not yet clear what the specic impacts on policing will be.\"\"Regardless of the final political settlement, our long-standing strong working relationship with the PSNI will continue in order to protect and support communities.\""},{"url":null,"title":"may promises further talks with eu to get assurances on backstop","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

They are contained in the conclusions of yesterday evening.“That is our position. That is what we have put on the table. And now we expect Great Britain to respond.”Belgium’s PM Charles Michel said: “The ball is now politically in the British court.”And Mr Tusk said he had “no mandate” to organise any further negotiations.Mrs May’s hopes of a legally binding commitment on the backstop from the EU were dashed on Thursday, when Mr Juncker said there could be “no real changes” to the Withdrawal Agreement negotiated over  months.It seems that the Prime Minister has failed in her bid to deliver meaningful changes to her Brexit deal. We cannot go on like this. The Prime Minister should reinstate the vote on her deal next week and let Parliament take back control.— Keir StarmerDecember , The Prime Minister addressed the EU leaders on Thursday about MPs’ concerns  about the backstop which had prevented her getting her Brexit deal through Parliament this week.Mr Tusk said the leaders had expressed a “firm determination” to work “speedily” to ensure there is an agreement on the future relationship in place by the time the transition period ends in December , so the backstop is not needed.But Mr Juncker criticised Britain’s lack of clarity over what it was seeking from the future relationship.“Our UK friends need to say what they want, instead of asking us to say what we want,” he said.“So we would like, within a few weeks, our UK friends to set out their expectations for us because this debate is sometimes nebulous and imprecise and I would like clarications.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker embraces council president Donald Tusk at the Brussels summit The EU hardball approach appears to leave Mrs May with limited room for manoeuvre during the countdown to the UK’s departure on March .The Prime Minister told the summit that a package of assurances around the backstop could “change the dynamic” at Westminster.At the same time, she made clear a failure by EU leaders to offer concessions risked the collapse of the whole agreement, with the UK leaving in March in a disorderly, no-deal Brexit.Mrs May managed a smile at her press conference when a reporter askedshe had had a “trying week”, jokingly replying: “Has something happened this week ”When asked whether the problems with her party at home and dealing with the EU had made her want to quit as leader, she said it is “our duty as a Government and as a Parliament” to see Brexit through.WATCH LIVE: PM @Theresa_May holds a press conference following EU Council https:t.co irtqNcSv— UK Prime MinisterDecember , She added: “I never said it was going to be easy.“Negotiations like this are always tough.

Mrs Hoey has campaigned strongly for Brexit, despite her constituency voting overwhelmingly to Remain in the EU.The Labour MP was heavily criticised in February when she said that the Good Friday Agreement was \"unsustainable\".Speaking at the Leave Means Leave rally Mrs Hoey said she was \"very proud to be pro-union\".\"We didnt spend  years in Northern Ireland stopping IRA terrorists killing soldiers, police, and civilians, in order to get a United Ireland to allow a few jumped-up EU bureaucrats and a complicit prime minister to try and do the same thing by the back door,\" she said.\"Even more ridiculous is that it would not even be in the economic interests of Northern Ireland who depend so much of their trade, to and from Britain.

We have become an irrelevancy. Because there are that many MPs against it we might as well sit at home,\" Mr Wilson said.Former UKIP boss Nigel Farage told the rally that he felt a second referendum was now inevitable and urged people to vote Leave in even greater numbers so there could be no doubting the will of the UK to leave the EU."},{"url":null,"title":"significant modernisation of irish electoral registration process proposed","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

access as well as better verication of identity to improve the security and accuracy of the electoral roll are among measures outlined for public consultation.Members of the public can have their say until March.Minister for Electoral Reform John Paul Phelan said: “These changes,implemented, would be the most signicant reform of the electoral registration process since .“As well as removing an excessive number of steps involved in applying to be included on the electoral register, the proposals would further increase the register’s ability to keep up to date with changing inidual circumstances and, therefore its integrity.”These changes reflect changes in how we live todayJohn Paul PhelanFacebookTwitterHe said reducing the number of dferent forms, allowing people to register online and introducing a process of continuous or rolling registration would make the process much more user-friendly and similar to the way people interact with other State services.He added: “These changes reflect changes in how we live today.“Having a registration process that recognises and facilitates more frequent changes of address is crucial in maintaining an accurate register.”The proposals include:– A more streamlined, simplied electoral registration process, with a single, simplied form.– Rolling, or continuous registration – rather than the current draft, live and supplement versions of the register – this will provide for a single, live register at all times.– The introduction of online registration as an optional alternative to paper-based registration – currently people must complete paper application forms and send them to their local authority.– Inidual registration only – currently the use of household forms could potentially result in people being included on the register or their registration details being amended without their explicit consent.– The establishment of a single, national electoral register database to be used by all local authorities to standardise data formats and processes help prevent and remove duplicate entries and ensure standardised data protection and management procedures.– Improvements to the system of identity verication to streamline the system by minimising the need to present documentation to a local Garda station and minimise the potential for duplicate entries or erroneous amendments.– The possibility of data sharing between public bodies and electoral registration authorities to maintain details."},{"url":null,"title":"emirates a380 to operate","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER

Battery-only cars have no combustion engine, while plug-in hybrids can operate in full electric mode, using conventional fuel or a combination of both.

He is also a member of Victoria Park and Tower Hamlets AC which won the South of England Athletic Association Fell Running Championships on the Isle of Wight in September, with Aaron winning the inidual title. These championships comprise three races in two days, with the first two races on Saturday and the third and longest, on Sunday.The races are not by any means easy inidually, or collectively, the first being .k, but with an ascent of  metres, the second k with an ascent of  metres and the third, on the following day, k with a m ascent.Aaron was first and second respectively in the first two of the races and he calculated that he could win overallhe finished in fourth place in the third race on Sunday morning.His eventual third place left him overall winner and as he said afterwards: ldquoIt was a beautul setting and some very hard racing, good mental preparation for the XC season coming up. How prophetic that was.To further emphasise his versatility, he ran the Amsterdam Half Marathon on October  and came home in ninth place, posting a superb .. which would have placed him fourth in the recent Belfast Half and sixth in the Waterside Half in Derry, so, he is a top quality runner over all terrains.Juniors at CookstownLauren Madine was the only female from the club juniors to take part in and duly won the U- girlsrsquo race at the Cookstown venue and ever-dependable Mackenzie Murray was the only boy from the club in the U- boysrsquo race, and while he found the going tough, hersquos learning by the week and I am confident that hersquoll develop into a top class runnerFirst points for ladiesEast Down ladies were much better represented than the men as they fielded a team of six and were more than pleased to place fth overall and to register their first place points of the current league campaign.The team scorers were Catherine OrsquoConnor , Niamh Kellett , Deirdre Weatheralland Clare Carsongiving a total of  points. Asto emphasise the importance of overtaking everyone possible, right to the very end, that total was matched by Acorns AC, but because their fourth scorer had finished higher than the East Down fourth-paced runner, Acorns get the better team position.In truth, the third-placed team had only six points less than either Acorns or EDAC, so with a few extra places it could so easily have been third place. But the EDAC squad are delighted with their achievement anyway. The other two participation point scorers were Janine Murray and Ella Carroll.Tough in LanzaroteRising star Gordy Graham headed for the sun in Lanzarote to make his latest marathon effort and with typical cussedness, the weather promptly stuck two fingers up at him by providing a strong headwind on the out and back course, the sting in the tail being that it was in the homeward half.

Jodi Foster and her sister Kari from Spa Primary School and Erin Moore from St Patrickrsquos Primary School, Saul, finished as the top  qualiers outside the qualying teams.Alex Robinson was not so fortunate for the boys and after a slow start, he could not find his way far enough through the traffic in a field of over  runners to take a qualying position.This weekend will see the EDAC Juniors on the road again as they travel to participate in the All-Ireland Uneven Age Group Cross-Country Championships at Navan Racecourse.The seniors have an equally dficult and y journey to participate in the North West Cross-Country in Gransha Park, Derry, but at least they only have to run k when they get there.To paraphrase an old First World War marching song: ldquoItrsquos a long trip to run in Derry.And itrsquos unique too in that everyone runs together, men, women, older men and women and junior men and women.

We just set about formalising a programme in earnest back in .ldquoOur programme works so well it is held up as a model for other schools across Northern Ireland to learn from and to embed its principles into their schools.Mr Moore says there is a fundamental dference between shared education and integration.ldquoThe main dference is that each school can hold on to their faith and culture but still be able to reach out in other aspects of the curriculum.ldquoOur parent teacher associations, for example, have been working together for some time. And on other levels we pull our resources too.Mr Moorersquos views were echoed by Mr Paul Coulter, his counterpart at St Patrickrsquos, who said the idea for shared education came from parents at both schools.Mr Coulter said that demand had grown over the years and that the schools were pulling their resources to fund shared experiences, such as educational trips.ldquoWhen you talk to the children you will see that they are really excited about coming together. Many strong friendships have been formed.Mrs Helen McEvoy, Shared Education co-ordinator at St Patrickrsquos, says the programme has given children the opportunity to come together and take part in learning together.She added: ldquoThe vision for the programme is to enhance the learning of all pupils in an environment where there is equal opportunity, good relations and mutual respect fostered, while at the same time acknowledging dferences and celebrating them.The Recorder met children from both schools last Thursday morning when they busy designing a new logo for their Shared Education Programme.Ten year-old Mya McCurry, who attends St Patrickrsquos Primary School, said she wasnrsquot able to see any dferences between pupils and teachers at both schools.ldquoWe started doing this programme when I was in P, she remarked. ldquoI am in P now. Itrsquos really fun and I look forward to having my friends from Ballynahinch Primary School coming here or visiting them at their school.ldquoTo be honest we were friends before we began getting together in school. I would have played with them on our street sometimes. Now we get together in school too and its terric fun.Leon Rose, a P pupil at Ballynahinch Primary School, revealed that taking part in the Shared Education Programme has helped him become less shy.He said: ldquoI enjoy it a lot and we maintain the friendships we make outside of school too.Also taking part in the programme is Patrick Pillitteri, a P pupil at St Patrickrsquos. Eager to reveal the best thing about shared education he said it was the trips they got to go on.He added: ldquoMy favourite trip was to the Kingspan Stadium at Ravenhill. Irsquom not big into rugby but this was something . It was a fabulous big stadium and it holds many thousands.ldquoIrsquom more of a soccer fan myself. I love Liverpool and I donrsquot ever see that changing any time soon. By the way, Liverpool beat Burnley - last night. That may not seem important to you, but it sure is to me.It came as no surprise then to learn that Patrick wants to be a Premier League footballer when he grows up.He said: ldquoIrsquom going to play for Liverpool when Irsquom older. I get lots of practice in with my friends from Ballynahinch Primary. Finlay and Leon are my best friends in this programme.Animal lover Becky Martin is in P at Ballynahinch Primary. She said the best thing about being part of the programme was organising and planing activities together.ldquoWe have been to Castleward, W and, as Patrick has said, we went to the Kingspan Stadium. There have been loads of trips.ldquoI love organising events. Together we agree on what we would like to do and see it through to the end.When asked what she hoped to do when she grew up, she said: ldquoI love animals but being a vet would make me sad. I would have to put animals to sleep and I wouldnrsquot like that. I think I would like to be a professional dog walker or groom dogs and cats when Irsquom older.Becky added: ldquoThe boys and girls from St Patrickrsquos Primary School bring lots of energy with them.

Barry wants to create something that feels a bit safer and is more bespoke, somewhere a person with a learning disability and their friends and family can all get together and have a good time.She said that she was able to tap into Barryrsquos natural love of disco and music by chance over a year ago.ldquoBarry has always loved discos and hersquos always held discos for us as a family.

It will be somewhere where we all can have a beer and a boogie and we hope it can run every month.Barry will be spinning the decks himself at the disco, while some of his friends and instructors from the Black Box will also attend so that he can hit the dance floor with his family and friends.A lover of dance floor classics from Abba, Katie Perry, Lady Gaga and Boyzone, he promises to create a festive atmosphere by playing lots of Christmas hits.ldquoI want to have a good social le. I just want to get out of the house more, said Barry. ldquoI started doing disco years and years ago. I just love music and this is going to be so great.Susan paid tribute to Alison Lyttle, Autisim Initiativersquos community engagement manager, who has been instrumental in helping to support the event, as well as Newry, Mourne and Down District Council who contributed to start-up costs.The Black Moon disco will be held at Diamond Pats in Central Promenade, Newcastle, tonight from -pm.

I would prefer that this matter was championed by Ulster GAA and the GAA nationally to improve the coverage of our games.

The images represented all that should not be about the GAA.ldquoPhysical violence has no place in our games or indeed at any level in our association. The fact that they might take place within the confines of GAA property is not excuse for acceptance of and turning a blind eye to such incidents.ldquoIf these incidents were happening on a public street after a Saturday night out they would be deemed to be assault and grievous bodily harm. They would lead to prosecutions and possible sentencing all of which can have a huge impact on the le of the victim and the transgressor. Someone will get badly hurt in some of these incidentsthey are to continue at our grounds.Mr McAteer adds: The one punch message has been part of a campaign by the GAA and the authorities in recent times and it is a very real message. Facts are that one punch could kill and that is in honesty something none of us would ever dare to dream of happening at a GAA game, but reality is that it could.

Last winter’s figures for NI will be released on Wednesday.The comments from Age NI come three weeks after the Department of Healthannounced a ‘review of urgent and emergency care’ with a particular focus on the elderly in light of emergency departments experiencing “intensying pressures over recent years”. DoH acknowledged growing waiting times for hospital admissions and that “another dficult winter period” is anticipated.Age NI welcomed the review – but expressed concern about the timing. “It is good news but it seems late in the day to start this processwe want to see any benefits this winter,” a spokeswoman said. ldquoit seems late in the day ,,, this process should have started months agoAge NI“We all know that our healthcare system, particularly our hospitals, come under extreme pressure during these winter months and this process should have started months ago.” She noted the “added impact” a long wait in AE can have on the elderly and pressed for “safe and effective” alternatives that will be “just as beneficial or more so than an admission to hospital”.Rita Devlin, deputy director of the RCN in NI, said nurses are worried. “Our members are fearful that there will be a repeat of the problems experienced last year in emergency departments over the holiday period,” she said. “Staff would hope that trusts will have contingency plans in place to ensure that services will be maintained at normal levels.”Dr Grainne Doran, chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners NI, said GPs have “serious concerns about the increase in workload that will come this winter”. She added: “With services already struggling, doctors have voiced their concern about being able to manage with the additional workload during the winter season. “A review of emergency and urgent care, and the implementation of necessary changes, cannot come quickly enough.”Concern for welfare of woman whose newborn baby found dead Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Dr Tom Black, BMA Northern Ireland Chair of Council, said a “long-term and meaningful plan” is needed to address winter pressures. While each trust will have a winter contingency plan, he said, staff face “additional workload and work-related stress” during the winter period which may see “the whole system begin to wobble”.Properly funded home care packages for discharged patients are needed, he said, along with “meaningful long-term workforce planning” to have enough doctors in place to meet the needs.Last winter saw Antrim Area Hospital call in St John Ambulance volunteers for basic ward cover on New Year’s Eve, while SDLP MLA Dolores Kelly said  people waited at Craigavon Area Hospital over two nights for assessment on January  and .In the first week of January, staff reported that Belfast’s Royal Victoria Hospital was “at breaking point” and a ‘major incident’ was declared because of the excessive backlog of patients.Londonderry’s Altnagelvin Hospital had to implement an emergency plan for its emergency department, and on Boxing Day the Southern Health Trust said patients were having to wait for up to  hours to speak to an out-of-hours GP.From December  to January  last year, some  NI patients waited more than  hours for admission, transfer or discharge, the BBC reported.However, the Department of Health said that its newly launched review of emergency care is not intended to address problems this winter.A spokeswoman said: “The review of urgent and emergency care is a long-term project and should not be conflated with initiatives to counter winter pressures in hospitals this year.”The review will aim to establish a new regional care model for the Province, with particular focus on the elderly, she said. “A range of measures have been put in place by trusts for this winter in expectation of another challenging period for health services across these islands.”The department has funded these initiatives, recognising the need for immediate mitigations and longer term review, she added.Age NI advises that by taking some simple steps, older people can stay warm, well and safe in the winter months-. By setting your heating to the right temperature , you can keep your home warm and your bills as low as possible.. Food is a vital source of energy, which helps to keep your body warm. Keep basic food items in the cupboard or freezer, and try to have hot meals and drinks throughout the day.. Try to avoid going outside on extremely cold days. If you do need to, wrap up warm and remember that several thin layers will keep you warmer than one thick layer.. Keeping active generates heat and helps to keep you warm, so when you’re indoors, try not to sit still for more than an hour. Get up and walk around, make yourself a warm drink, and spread any chores throughout the day.. If you’re over , be sure to have a seasonal flu jab. Seasonal flu viruses are always changing, so you need to have a jab every year, using the latest vaccine.. It’s not unusual to feel a bit down in winter. Try to keep to your usual routines and,you can’t visit friends, make sure you phone them regularly for a chat..

I have always been pretty self reliant.“I have found it just embarrassing. I felt very humbled approaching them because I just didn’t like myself for having to do it. But needs must I had no choice.”Ken Scott is manager of a food bank in Bangor which is run by the local Elim church.

nationalist outlook into a much broader socialist movement, mourners said.The former Workers Party president died from cancer on Thursday aged .Dozens of people gathered outside a social club off the Falls Road in West Belfast to pay their respects as his remains arrived for a wake.His Belfast-born widow Mary received the hugs and sympathy of well-wishers.Daughter Caoimhe was also present as the wicker coffin was wheeled from the hearse without ceremony, flowers or flags into a social club close to the Royal Victoria Hospital.Mr Garland took part in the IRAs border campaign in the s but after the cessation of violence was a leading proponent of the socialism which split the organisation and led to the rise of the Provisionals.A Workers Party spokesman, who did not want to be named, said: \"He was one of the people in the s who had completely re-thought and transformed the concept of what it was to be republican and moved that away from a very narrow, nationalist perspective, into a much broader political socialist, Marxist, communist analysis of society.\"He said himself many times that we have seen the consequence of what the narrow nationalism meant in subsequent years after that.\"He was involved in an attack on the Royal Ulster Constabulary barracks in Brookeborough in Co Fermanagh on January  , which led to the deaths of fellow IRA members Sean South and Fergal OHanlon, an event marked by song and lore in republican circles.Mr Garland was part of a group of senior republicans, including Cathal Goulding and Tomas Mac Giolla, influenced by internationalist communism during the s.The spokesman added: \"One of his quotes from that period subsequently has been that he realised that people like him were sitting in backrooms in conspiracies while working-class people were out on the streets, demanding change and improvements in their material conditions and it is possible that republicans were orced from that reality.\"Throughout the violence of the s and s, the Workers Party promoted dialogue about peaceful co-existence in Northern Ireland.The Official IRA split with the Belfast-led Provisionals in .

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community.

Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Last winter’s figures for NI will be released on Wednesday.The comments from Age NI come three weeks after the Department of Healthannounced a ‘review of urgent and emergency care’ with a particular focus on the elderly in light of emergency departments experiencing “intensying pressures over recent years”. DoH acknowledged growing waiting times for hospital admissions and that “another dficult winter period” is anticipated.Age NI welcomed the review – but expressed concern about the timing. “It is good news but it seems late in the day to start this processwe want to see any benefits this winter,” a spokeswoman said. ldquoit seems late in the day ,,, this process should have started months agoAge NI“We all know that our healthcare system, particularly our hospitals, come under extreme pressure during these winter months and this process should have started months ago.” She noted the “added impact” a long wait in AE can have on the elderly and pressed for “safe and effective” alternatives that will be “just as beneficial or more so than an admission to hospital”.Rita Devlin, deputy director of the RCN in NI, said nurses are worried. “Our members are fearful that there will be a repeat of the problems experienced last year in emergency departments over the holiday period,” she said. “Staff would hope that trusts will have contingency plans in place to ensure that services will be maintained at normal levels.”Dr Grainne Doran, chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners NI, said GPs have “serious concerns about the increase in workload that will come this winter”. She added: “With services already struggling, doctors have voiced their concern about being able to manage with the additional workload during the winter season. “A review of emergency and urgent care, and the implementation of necessary changes, cannot come quickly enough.”Extra  staff to cope with local health care Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Dr Tom Black, BMA Northern Ireland Chair of Council, said a “long-term and meaningful plan” is needed to address winter pressures. While each trust will have a winter contingency plan, he said, staff face “additional workload and work-related stress” during the winter period which may see “the whole system begin to wobble”.Properly funded home care packages for discharged patients are needed, he said, along with “meaningful long-term workforce planning” to have enough doctors in place to meet the needs.Last winter saw Antrim Area Hospital call in St John Ambulance volunteers for basic ward cover on New Year’s Eve, while SDLP MLA Dolores Kelly said  people waited at Craigavon Area Hospital over two nights for assessment on January  and .In the first week of January, staff reported that Belfast’s Royal Victoria Hospital was “at breaking point” and a ‘major incident’ was declared because of the excessive backlog of patients.Londonderry’s Altnagelvin Hospital had to implement an emergency plan for its emergency department, and on Boxing Day the Southern Health Trust said patients were having to wait for up to  hours to speak to an out-of-hours GP.From December  to January  last year, some  NI patients waited more than  hours for admission, transfer or discharge, the BBC reported.However, the Department of Health said that its newly launched review of emergency care is not intended to address problems this winter.A spokeswoman said: “The review of urgent and emergency care is a long-term project and should not be conflated with initiatives to counter winter pressures in hospitals this year.”The review will aim to establish a new regional care model for the Province, with particular focus on the elderly, she said. “A range of measures have been put in place by trusts for this winter in expectation of another challenging period for health services across these islands.”The department has funded these initiatives, recognising the need for immediate mitigations and longer term review, she added.Age NI advises that by taking some simple steps, older people can stay warm, well and safe in the winter months-. By setting your heating to the right temperature , you can keep your home warm and your bills as low as possible.. Food is a vital source of energy, which helps to keep your body warm. Keep basic food items in the cupboard or freezer, and try to have hot meals and drinks throughout the day.. Try to avoid going outside on extremely cold days. If you do need to, wrap up warm and remember that several thin layers will keep you warmer than one thick layer.. Keeping active generates heat and helps to keep you warm, so when you’re indoors, try not to sit still for more than an hour. Get up and walk around, make yourself a warm drink, and spread any chores throughout the day.. If you’re over , be sure to have a seasonal flu jab. Seasonal flu viruses are always changing, so you need to have a jab every year, using the latest vaccine.. It’s not unusual to feel a bit down in winter. Try to keep to your usual routines and,you can’t visit friends, make sure you phone them regularly for a chat..

Thinking about the design, I wanted something that symbolised security and protection, and also represented something my neighbours and I had in common. “So I thought of my dear old Alsatian, Clint, who used to guard our house when I was a kid. “Our neighbours were very fond of him, and used to help feed him, so I thought guard dogs would be the perfect theme. “I drew the gates in a Celtic style, with the elongated, elegant dogs’ bodies and sinuous lines of the tails also reflecting some of the style of Art Nouveau.This sculpture is called Master McGrath falls into the frozen River AltJonny works as Arts Assistant for Armagh City, Banbridge  Craigavon Borough Council, based at Moneypenny’s Blacksmith Workshop, in the beautul, historic location of Moneypenny’s Lock, on the Newry Canal outside Portadown. He reminisced: “When work had finished for the day, I would start work on my gates after hours. “Most of the gates are hand forged in the traditional manner, heating the steel in the forge then shaping it on the anvil, as it has been done for thousands of years. Mayor wishes all a very Merry Christmas Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"“The decorative finials , drop bolts, and most of the dogs’ swirling, interlaced bodies are forged this way. For the heads and lower legs, I used more modern techniques such as plasma cutting and grinding to shape the steel. “Then I joined everything together with the MiG welder. To accentuate the eyes, and the dog collars, I added some brass. One of the last details I added was the traditional latch, which is decorated with two matching hand-forged Celtic trisceles representing the dogs’ hearts.”Jonny first started blacksmithing at Tannaghmore Gardens Animal Farm and then at Moneypenny’s since . “As a member of Moneypenny’s Blacksmith Workshop, I have had the great privilege of learning from two of the best artist-blacksmiths in the country, Steve Murphy and Aaron Leach. “You can see some of the workshop’s work at Tannaghmore Animal Farm, where we made the entrance gates. We also made the sculptures within the Master McGrath Maze at Tannaghmore. “My piece in the maze – ‘Master McGrath Falling into the Frozen River’ is in a similar style to the ‘Guard Dog Gates’.”Jonny has always had an interest in sculpture since his Art College days in the late s.“I started off carving wood, then, inspired by seeing the Brancusi Museum in Paris, started to carve in stone. In  -  I carved the ‘Human Sundial’ at Oxford Island. “My lelong love of Nature has always inspired my work. Long walks in the country supply both materials and subject matter for my work, which features owls, herons, bulls, cats, dogs etc. “The joy I find in Nature, and in immersing myself in materials from granite and marble to oak and ash, all the way to steel, copper and brass, I try to communicate to the viewer, and to students,” he said.“In recent years, as well as blacksmithing, I have also been teaching Stone Carving in local centres, particularly letter carving. “If you are interested in trying blacksmithing, you can contact Moneypenny’s Blacksmith Workshop on Facebook, or call  .“If you would like to try letter carving in stone, look out for upcoming classes at community centres near you.”If you want to see the gates being made, you can see the whole process on YouTube just search for ‘Stomp Box Jonny guard dog gates’.try catch  TrendingDad leaves sickbed to deliver baby in laybyFatal car crash victim, , is namedRoad closed due to crashPolice angered as thieves target elderly woman in supermarketMumrsquos shock as schoolgirl knocked down in lsquohit and runrsquo incident          ..

Here Emma Deighan scours some of the top NI venues to see how they are catering to the corporate Christmas Arguably the most anticipated social event in the work diary, the Christmas ‘do’ has evolved over the years.And many of Northern Ireland’s top hosts agree and have widened their offering in response.Event managers and venue owners say everything from the format of the Christmas party to its timing have changed to accommodate the demands of employees today. How, when and where we celebrate are top priorities.Take the evening do, for example. For many, that age-old three-course setup doesn’t cut the convenience factor, prompting my employers end the work day early to take advantage of lunch dates. It’s a favourable move that delivers on two fronts – it offers time-poor workers the relief of a shorter day but doesn’t infringe on family obligations.Owner of Bishop’s Gate Hotel in Derry and former president of the Northern Ireland Hotel’s Federation, Ciaran O’Neill agrees. “Christmas has changed over the last number of years for our industry with more businesses looking for lunches, as opposed to the traditional party nights of old,” he said. “We do still have ‘big nights’, but these tend to occur on Fridays and Saturdays.”Ciaran says he has also noted an increase in smaller party sizes over the years.“We are seeing less private large events and more small groups dining with us. Employees are arranging ‘get togethers’ with colleagues or teams that they work directly with.”Bishop’s Gate, which has become Derry’s hospitality jewel attracting the AA Hotel of the Year- accolade, among many other awards, pairs an historic setting with parties for Christmas.The Bullitt Hotel in Belfast is setting the scene for the experience-savvy hipster workforce – and this Christmas Bullitt’s ‘experiences’ reflect the discernment of its guests.General manager at Bullitt, Michael Sullivan has seen a spike in ‘experience’ events, upgrading the turkey feast to a cooler, more casual event.“We have had a number of enquiries for informal gatherings in our Good Room event space, with a festive lunch to follow. The Good Room is the perfect space to blur the lines between work and play for intimate company get togethers ahead of a more traditional Christmas do,” he said.“We’ve also had enquiries for private gin and whiskey tastings and can also organise a number of unique events and team-building activities for groups, from candle-making to chunky knitting workshops for a truly memorable Christmas party.”This December Bullitt has a range of packages to suit private and shared s – from sit-down meals in its restaurant Taylor and Clay to VIP packages in its Baltic Bar or secluded enclaves above in Babel – its rooftop bar. And its ‘Tipsy Tea’ is geared towards the day-time revellers. Prices range from £. to £. a head.“Bullitt has brought something new and exciting to the traditional Christmas party market, with a range of novel spaces set within cool, contemporary surroundings. We like to think that we’re helping to shake up the scene somewhat by offering something a little dferent,” Michael said.If you want to push the boat out with your corporate squad, Titanic Belfast is ready for boarding. Its play on Belfast’s shipbuilding heritage and the fateful Titanic is always a crowd pleaser. Laura Cowan, head of sales at Titanic Belfast said: “We host bespoke private Christmas party nights, which are tailored to our clients’ needs across all of the Titanic venues – Titanic Belfast , SS Nomadic and the Titanic Exhibition Centre. “These can range from private dining, iconic tailored experiences, drinks receptions and gala dinners. We also host our traditional Christmas party nights – featuring a Christmas cocktail reception on arrival followed by a delicious four course banquet and live entertainment.”For sheer luxury, the more refined office workers take to the Cathedral Quarter in Belfast to sample the Merchant’s opulent offering.And Clare Mullin, meetings and events manager there, said the hotel’s renowned afternoon teas are bucking the turkey dinner trend but are every bit as fancul. “Over the years we have seen an increased demand for Christmas parties and festive events that offer something a little dferent, memorable or exciting. People increasingly seem to be looking for something out of the ordinary.“We have seen a trend for corporate bookings where companies are looking for alternatives to a traditional evening dinner. For example, our Festive Afternoon Tea is very popular – especially the Champagne iety. Festive drinks in our famous Cocktail Bar continue to be a popular option for the corporate market too, with bespoke offerings such as our Redbreast whiskey flight extremely popular. gtClient lunches in The Cloth Ear and Berts Jazz Bar are also growing in popularity.”Casual begins in its neighbouring Cloth Ear from £. a person, retro at Berts Jazz Bar will cost you £. for lunch or £ for dinner.For private s The Roof Garden Alpine Lodge at the Merchant can cater to  and for the more luxurious three-courses will be served in the Rita Duffy Suite for £ a person.The newly revamped and extended Ten Square is another setup that combines afternoon tea with tradition.Swapping caffeine for mulled wine and pastries for mince pies, Ten Square’s Loft, located on its top floor and flaunting some pretty impressive city centre views, plays the backdrop to this year’s festive afternoon teas at £ a head, from pm to pm.It also offers more familiar packages in its Linen Hall suite where tradition mingles with s DJs to live bands.And for those who really want to go that extra mile, Belfast’s newest Hastings sibling is ready and waiting.The Grand Central Hotel on Bedford Street boasts unrivalled views from sky-high Observatory, where afternoon tea takes on a Christmas theme or tradition can be celebrated at its Seahorse Restaurant and ground floor Grand Cafe. Allyson McKimm, events director of Hastings Hotels said expectations for hospitality environments to up their game get higher every year.She said Hastings Hotels had “reached new heights this year to keep the format fresh and exciting with new entertainment and new twists on the menus and lots of exciting extras including the traditional and limited edition Christmas ducks.”Allyson said a growing trend for lunch events inspired Europa’s ‘Christmas Caberet Lunches’ with Motown entertainment. The live tribute act theme travels across its entire portfolio. “Once again, our guests have asked usthey could continue the celebrations after Christmas once the party season is over, and to meet this demand, we have launched a whole range of tribute shows between Christmas and the New Year at all venues including ever popular All American Buffet with Elvis at the Europa, Jersey Guys, ABBA and our favourite George Michael and Robbie Williams Tribute Show at the Ballygally, Stormont and Everglades Hotels.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/john1.jpg","title":"majority of ni firms expanding workforce in ","story":"Posted on Friday  November  by John Mulgrew More Northern Ireland firms say they will take on new staff next year than compared to the UK as a whole, according to a new survey. Recruitment firm Hays says among NI-based employers, % said they expect to hire additional staff in the next year, compared to a UK average of %. That’s the highest percentage in the last five years. Meanwhile, % of firms polled said they had experienced some form of skills shortage within the past year, against a UK average of %. The survey also showed that some Northern Ireland employers are finding it harder to recruit staff, due to lower levels of unemployment leading to a rise in wages. John Moore, managing director of Hays in Northern Ireland, said: “Employers in Northern Ireland told us they are pressing ahead with business plans and are generally optimistic about the wider economic climate for the next two to five years. Recruitment expectations are at their highest levels for five years, for both temporary and permanent roles. “Increased competition for talent coupled with skills shortages has helped support above UK-average salary growth in Northern Ireland. While that is positive for those seeking new employment it also has downsides, including negative impacts on productivity, staff morale and the ability to deliver projects. “Given the intense competition and, at times, unrealistic salary requirements from candidates, it’s never been more important for employers to understand the complex factors that influence employee movement. “Salary is still a top consideration, but candidates are now influenced by other benefits, such as le balance and career progression opportunities. However, only % of employers surveyed saw work le balance as a priority, compared with % of employees.” The survey is based on responses from almost , employers and professionals working in a range of industries, including almost  in Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/chamber_1.jpg","title":"outline your alternative to brexit deal says ni chamber president","story":"Posted on Thursday  November  by John Mulgrew It’s now time for political leaders opposed to a draft withdrawal agreement on Brexit to “outline alternative proposals” as an overwhelming majority of Northern Ireland’s business community back the plans, an industry leader has said. Ellvena Graham, president of the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said Prime Minister Theresa Mays deal on the table is “definitely much better than a no-deal scenario”. “After a long period of negotiation we now have a draft Withdrawal Agreement which is undoubtedly a welcome step forward for the majority of businesses in Northern Ireland,” she said. “We want the outcome that’s best for businesses, for consumers, for the economy and for the future stability of Northern Ireland – and we’ll do everything we can to ensure that we get it. “We therefore encourage our political representatives who support the draft agreement to do everything in their power to influence political representatives in Britain to join them. “For those that are not in support of the draft agreement, it is now time to outline your alternative proposals. We are willing to listen.” Ms Graham was speaking at the NI Chamber’s President’s Banquet at ICC Belfast. And as Northern Ireland approaches two years without a devolved government, she said that while there is a “vibrant and innovative business community that wants to invest and grow” that it is “stymied because of the prolonged absence of a regional government and the endless Brexit bickering”.

Meanwhile, farming unions in Northern Ireland and throughout the UK have also issued their support for the deal.It would essentially provide a backstop, and create a deeper customs union between Northern Ireland the EU, along with a closer alignment in the single market.Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI says that the agreement is “the only show in town.”He said a poll of its members showed .% of those who replied were in support.“This is the only show in town. The rules are clear – in order for the UK to move to the most productive discussion on what the future relationship will be, we need a withdrawal agreement. The options are the agreement, or no deal,” he told Ulster Business.“Business in Northern Ireland and agri-business have made it clear that no deal is not an option.”Other business groups backing the proposed agreement include the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, Retail NI, Hospitality Ulster and the Freight Transport Association.Writing in the Belfast , Prime Minister Theresa May said Northern Ireland will thrive under the proposed Brexit deal, and its position as part of the UK “is guaranteed”.She said her agreement with Brussels “puts Northern Ireland in a fantastic position for the future”, and moved to reassure unionists that “Northern Ireland’s constitutional status as part of the United Kingdom is guaranteed.“Under this deal the future is certainly bright for Northern Ireland.”On the backstop, Ms May said three things made it “an acceptable insurance policy”.She said the transition period could be extended instead of entering the backstop, regulations would be the same across all of the UK, and Northern Ireland would not be treated dferently.Meanwhile, in a joint statement, the Ulster Farmers’ Union, NFU Scotland, NFU England and NFU Cymru, said:“The draft Brexit withdrawal agreement, while not perfect, will ensure that there are no hard barriers on the day we leave the European Union, and will allow trade in agricultural goods and UK food and drink to continue throughout the transition period largely as before.

The Belfast Region City Deal will see a series of projects and schemes taking place across, Belfast, Antrim and Newtownabbey, Mid and East Antrim, Ards and North Down, Lisburn and Castlereagh, and Newry, Mourne and Down. And with that, a series of major IT initiatives are being outlined, many in collaboration with Ulster University and Queen’s University, in a bid to grow and expand Northern Ireland’s credentials on a global scale. “Queen’s University Belfast and Ulster University have collaborated extensively to develop proposals for global centres of innovation excellence in key growth sectors in which world-leading expertise in our universities can be leveraged by businesses to create breakthrough technologies, products and services,” the City Deal proposal says. And it adds that a deal “requires a catalyst that will drive forward investment in research and development and help embed a culture of innovation to act as a driver for increased productivity”. The councils took their case to Westminster at the end of October, and following that, Chancellor Philip Hammond announced the Treasury’s commitment. The rest of the proposed funding will come from matched finance from Stormont, with the remaining from the councils. Andthey pull it off, they are predicting as many as , new jobs could be created. DIGITAL HEALTHCARE In a bid to further grow and develop Northern Ireland’s position on the international healthcare market, the City Deal proposes creating a branded cluster of medical device and technology companies that “through a supportive and collaborative eco system of co-location and working will build the size and value of the sector”. The centre aims to attract and develop businesses across a range of areas, especially in the areas of cardiology, diabetes, respiratory and stroke. It says that a key aspect of the proposed cluster is the partnership working with scientists and companies with the existing pilot clinical lab at the Royal Victoria Hospital. Also in the pipeline is the ‘i-Reach’ project. Led by Queen’s University, Ulster University and partners from the le and health sciences sector, those behind the City Deal say it sits within the umbrella of an “emerging health innovation NI concept which seeks to bring a unied ‘front door’ for external investment into the health and le sciences sector”. DIGITAL PARTNERSHIP It is proposing a “physical and digital environment” to allow the academic research community, tech entrepreneurs and industrial partners will come together to address key challenges in business and society through the application of the IoTand data science. Those behind it say it will support a common approach to big data sourcing and management, including early adoption of prevailing industry standards and codes of practice for secure and ethical use of data. There are also plans for a ‘global innovation institute’. The plans say it will draw together the skills of several areas of Queen’s University – which includes electronics, communications and information technology, health sciences and food security – to “anchor and support the creation of a Global Innovation Quarter in Belfast”. MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY According to those behind the City Deal, the will operate at the interface between academia and industry “accelerating new technology developments through the innovation phase and ensuring that real industrial challenges based on market need are solved through collaboration with the best university research”. Queen’s and Ulster University have developed an ‘advanced manufacturing innovation centre’ concept, that will “become the springboard for manufacturing innovation within the region”. CREATIVE INDUSTRIES Northern Ireland has already proven itself on the big and small screen, but there has been a strong move towards growing that further still. Aside from NI providing the facilities and backdrop for most of Game of Thrones, there’s also been the development of the Belfast Harbour Film Studios. Part of the City Deal plan involves boosting that position, with a ‘screen and media innovation lab’ bringing together “transformative production, studio and RD facilities”. SCIENCE PARK Elsewhere, in Mid and East Antrim, plans are under way for the transformation of the former St Patrick’s Barracks site in Ballymena into a new science park – Integrated Industrial Inspiration and Innovation Campus called iC. It’s being proposed that each council area will have some form of innovation hub, which will be directed towards business development. CONNECTIVITY Aside from specic schemes, infrastructure and connectivity improvements are part of the plans. That includes improvements in fibre-optic and mobiles broadband connectivity. It comes as mobile network EE, part of the BT Group, announced that Belfast is among six cities across the UK which have been chosen for the first phase of its G launch. “Our G trials are going well, giving us valuable insight into both the performance of the new technology and the challenges of upgrading sites with this new equipment,” Marc Allera, chief executive of BT’s consumer ision said. “We’re confident that we can bring G to the busiest parts of Belfast and the UK in .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"ni hospice the best of business and sport championing a force for good","story":"Posted on Tuesday  December  by Ulster Business The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice wants to partner with business leaders from right across the province. We speak to some of its supporters, including Celtic boss Brendan Rodgers, and why they are firmly behind the charity When Northern Ireland’s top sporting exports and business leaders are getting directly involved in a charitable cause as worthwhile as the Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice, it’s hard to ignore the work the organisation is doing on a day-to-day basis.The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice was established in  and is the only dedicated palliative care service in Northern Ireland. Among those working closely with the charity are Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers, founder of Vanrath, Wayne Sullivan and Pinnacle chairman, Ken Montgomery.The organisation cares for around  infants, children and their families, each year. With annual costs of £.m, the children’s hospice depends heavily on donations from the public to keep vital services going.But in addition to that, the children’s hospice is focused on boosting and growing philanthropic relationships with Northern Ireland business leaders who want to establish long-term links and a partnership with a charity who make a positive and meaningful impact across Northern Ireland.And as a result of that, it’s Time to Care programme was created – looking at new and innovative ways to reach out for key support.Heather Weir is chief executive of the NI Hospice. “The NI Hospice costs £m to run each year, and we have to raise £.m for direct care costs every year through our fundraising efforts,” she says.“As well as relying on the local community, we rely on business support too. With the vast amount of charities out there, we have been looking at how we can align the charity with business leaders and their companies, in terms of a fresh partnership approach.“We looked at how we could make supporting a charity feel really meaningful for businesses.“As a charity we need business insights, and not just in fundraising support. Having a network of business leaders is a practical way of supporting the hospice.”Heather says, aside from helping young people with le-limiting conditions, it’s also a chance for them to help improve their companies corporate social responsibility agenda.For Co Antrim man Brendan Rodgers – who paid a visit to the organisation’s Newtownabbey base alongside Wayne Sullivan and Ken Montgomery – the connection started with a letter from the NI Hospice, back when he was manager of Liverpool.“When I met Heather and came over, it was something from a personal perspective. We are all brought up as carers in Northern Ireland, and we want to give back. But I also felt that my role and responsibility as a manager – sport touches a lot of people and I could use it in a way that would hopefully open up doors for the NI Hospice in a dferent way.“In the last number of years, it’s been a great opportunity for me to meet people like Wayne, who I have met before – like-minded people who are very driven in their professional le, but alongside that, they have a real duty of care for organisation they support.”“What you have when you support the NI Hospice is something tangible.”Wayne Sullivan, founder of Vanrath, said: “What we have come up with is a project where all donations and funding goes into a specic account that is designated solely for the use of spending on nurse salaries.“You know where the money is going and that really ticks a box from our perspective. The nurses also come out to provide presentations of what they have been doing.“But asfor this, we get to use the brand and we co-partner. This is a marketing partnership.”The Time to Care relationship with companies also includes a Business Ambassadors network, which brings leaders together across a range of events.Ken Montgomery, chairman of Pinnacle, said: “For us at Pinnacle, my interest was the corporate social aspect of it and giving back to the community. Running a successful business in the community, I think there is a big role for corporates to play.”“It was also selling it to our own employees – the people working in the company. One of the things that appealed to me was having the direct contact with a particular nurse, and you felt the direct impact of what you are doing.”The key focus is enabling businesses to fund the cost of a qualied children’s nurse for a year. That relationship then offers a company access to co-branding opportunities and its own business network.The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice has opened two new cots this year, at a cost of £, each. And for each cot, the children’s hospice needs five paediatric nurses.And the target for the NI Hospice in the next three years is focused on achieving maximum capacity, bringing it to  cots and beds, serving over , infants and children living with a le limiting and le threatening illness. That’s an additional £.m over the next three years that’s needed.   So, what’s the key message to get Northern Ireland businesses of all shapes and sizes involved “For most top businesses, their brand will have a set of values which is important to them.” Brendan says.“The key word is alignment... you want to align yourself with those values that will drive your business, your people and your customers or beneficiaries.”This year, it has also launched its Jingle All the Way campaign. It encourages businesses, organisations, schools, clubs, churches and iniduals across Northern Ireland to get involved and fundraise through a iety of areas, including a k run, a Jingle bake-off and a Jingle Jumper Day.Time to Care is a unique offer for business leaders to support the children’s hospice and the specialist nurses who  provide vital care to infants and children with a le limiting illness across Northern Ireland.

Here Emma Deighan looks at the who, what and why of STEM initiatives in the business sector According to the most recent Skills Barometer report the biggest shortage of skills in Northern Ireland falls within the science, technology, engineering and mathssectors.The research, compiled by Ulster University for the Department for the Economyin , shows an urgency to train future generations in what are the fastest-growing areas of our economy.In its analysis the report concluded: “The subjects forecast to be predominantly under-supplied are engineering and technology, maths and computer sciences and physical and environmental sciences. It is estimated that the economy will require an additional  engineering and technology graduates and a similar number of additional maths and computer science graduates each year. Strong demand for the STEM related subjects is forecast.”It’s a concern given the growth within those business isions here. An influx of international STEM related employers have set up shop here, investing in a skillset that still needs much attention. Meanwhile our homegrown hub of STEM related employers are expanding at a phenomenal rate.Some of these investments include Lisburn-based firm Camlin’s announcement that it will create  new roles in the engineering field thanks to a £m expansion. And in earlier in the year, financial services firm, FinTrU revealed it would add a further  employees to its team across Belfast and in the North West.Then there’s the hugely successful sports device firm, STATSports, that is seeking another  staff members. And two years ago Belfast-based global aerospace and defence system manufacturer Thales’ opened up a whole new field here when in it launched a £m space propulsion facility signalling a whole new area of expertise that would open up to graduates here. With the future looking bright in terms of employment in these sectors, sirens sound when the Skills Barometer says STEM related subjects have been regularly under-supplied. It described it as a “consistent finding” across several years of research but fortunately activity to level out the supply-demand flow within the STEM world here is by no means passive. Governmental, third sector organisations and indeed those businesses reliant on that talent pool have been engaging in initiatives to support a deficit in talent. Clinical diagnostics firm Randox is one such employer. Software development, IT support, engineering, science research and mathematics make up the bulk of its operations and as such it promotes roles within the latter fields through STEM programmes.Linda Magee, head of human resources at Randox, said: “At Randox there are plenty of opportunities to work across a wide iety of STEM disciplines. Our APEX programme, which offers first year university students a complete career package, includes work experience between first and second year, a paid placement in third year and, finally, a graduate position post-degree.“Students accepted on to the Randox APEX programme work with, and learn from, the most experienced professionals in the industry, across a range of departments within their discipline.“They might be assisting our ground-breaking research into tests for cancer, kidney disease and Alzheimer’s, working in our engineering department developing diagnostic technologies, contributing to the output of a busy forensics laboratory, or joining our business development teams as they expand the Randox portfolio across the globe.”Linda said the firm also encourages “established talent” to come back and join the company through a ‘ers’ programme, a six-week scheme aimed at those who have had a break from the workplace. It includes induction, training and mentoring.“There are endless opportunities for career progression at Randox – the sky really is the limit,” she said.Another firm with training high up its agenda is FinTrU, the investment bank services firm, at the Gasworks in Belfast.In terms of recruitment, FinTrU developed its two-year Graduate Programme with a long-term commitment to providing analysts with support, training and industry qualications such as Investment Operations Certicates .It also offers financial services academies which have resulted in almost  jobs for graduates in Belfast. Named Academy X,  this year’s intake welcomed a range of graduates from non-financial backgrounds to allow them to forge a career in the sector. Founder of the company, Darragh McCarthy, believes such programmes create an “ecosystem” that gives back to the talent pool and economy here. “I see FinTrU as having a social purpose to create high-quality professional employment in Northern Ireland,” he said.One of the most active firms in nurturing a talent pool in IT is Kainos. Each year the NI digital services giant donates over £, and , man hours to safeguarding the IT sector’s future. Kainos’ technology outreach manager Gemma Crothers said: “You can go into schools and they have this tumbleweed idea thatyou’re going to work in IT you literally get a PC and type stuff. And we want to change that perception.“There are so many dferent areas to IT. And it’s lucrative and that’s the message we’re trying to put across. We are trying to change the way the schools are managed and bring computer science in at a nationwide level and we are lobbying the government for that.“One of the big areas for us is trying to train teachers on all levels so they have the confidence in the classroom to weave the skills in and give the students the exposure they need so they can chose to follow through.”Kainos recently announced that it was seeking applications for its ‘Earn as you Learn’ scheme. It’s a funded computing systems degree that also allows students to earn a salary while they study. Brendan Mooney, Kainos’ chief executive said of the scheme offers students the best of both worlds. He said: “The pace of technological change is faster than ever. So, anyone who can obtain both industry experience and an education at the same time, will have the advantage. They get to apply what they have learned in university and also get a head start in their career.“At Kainos we pride ourselves on our determination to nurture and invest in the talent of the future and are committed to broadening access and offering dferent routes to school leavers from dferent backgrounds.”In the science field, Craigavon-based global pharmaceutical company Almac Group also works closely with schools and universities to encourage interest in STEM subjects and careers.Frances Weldon, STEM outreach manager at the firm said Almac believes it has a responsibility to drive interest in the field to “grow a dynamic and innovative economy that benefits all”.“At Almac we are hugely focused on engaging with the next generation and helping them gain skills that they will need for their future careers. We rely on the talent, skills and expertise of our dedicated employees to drive continued growth and realise our vision to advance human health. We know that to ensure our success in the future we need even more skilled and knowledgeable recruits.”Among its initiatives are the Sloane McClay and Almac McKervey awards, work shadow placements, apprenticeships and industrial placements for third level students, some of which do not require a science background. “In the new year, through a partnership with W, we will launch a £m project aimed at enhancing STEM knowledge, skills and understanding among school pupils. An interactive exhibition will explore the human body and the diagnosis and treatment of illness as well as telling Almac’s story,” Frances said.The objective she says is to “inspire a new generation of students to gain skills to help them secure exciting and innovative roles such as those we offer at Almac”.The latter investments represent just a fraction of STEM activity ongoing here. The wider picture of such initiatives is not just beneficial to STEM businesses but the economy as a whole here.

Seamus Leheny is just one voice in the increasingly tumultuous debate around the main concerns and issues that still exist around the border, following the UK’s exit from the EU. We currently sit on the precipice, a Schrodinger’s cat scenario, where we on one hand have some form of early agreement on ensuring noto a hard border, and at the same time, don’t, while waiting to see whether the Prime Minister can sell it. We then establish what will be done to avoid any severe impact to cross-border trade here. The BBC’s Chris Mason garnered attention with an honest abstract on Brexit progress a couple of weeks ago - ‘I haven’t for the foggiest idea’ he told his colleagues back in the studio. “When we turn our attention to commercial goods vehicles crossing the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, it’s a very dferent story,” Seamus Leheny says. More than . million goods vehicles crossed the border in , according to official stats. And of those . million movements, the majority was recorded on the A Belfast to Dublin road. “When we break down the figures on cross border traffic, this equates to an average of , goods vehicles crossing the border daily, which is  per hour – or to illustrate it in comparison to cross channel movements, it’s a large freight ferry fully laden every  minutes,  ,  days a year,” Seamus says. For Dale Farm for example, and other food processors, its concern is over the certication process, following Brexit. “It’s basically an export certicate for dairy products. You are not allowed to export without this certicate,” Nick says. “For example, we have signed a quite public announcement with Lidl. We are supplying Lidl all over the world. If Lidl were to ask me in the morning, can you guarantee that you can supply my countries outside the UK on April   I actually can’t. “It’s nothing to do with tarfs or costs. If I don’t have animal health export certicates approved well-ahead of Brexit – these things take about six months to negotiate. “I’m screaming at DEFRAand DAERAhere to get this done now. “Why don’t you agree the wording, and have the work done, so when the agreement is or isn’t made… now you can start. “It’s a huge risk for this industry here,we can’t get stuff off the island.” Around % of Northern Ireland’s dairy, as an example, is sold where. A study by InterTrade Ireland said a signicant share of cross-border trade is accounted for by firms that trade “simultaneously in both directions”. “These two-way traders make up around % of ﬁrms, but accounted for over % of exports and over % of imports,” according to Seamus. With transport, Translink boss Chris Conway says it remains unclearthe company will be able to run cross-border bus services,no deal on Brexit is secured. During an evidence session in Westminster, he said that the organisation runs around  cross-border services – some which, he said, “meander” between Northern Ireland and the Republic during a journey. There’s also the issue of whether drivers will be able to operate between jurisdictions following the UK’s exit. That’s due to a question mark floating over the head of licences for drivers in the EU. Elsewhere, the Road Haulage Association has said with around three months left to go it is not prepared for what’s around the corner. It’s a two-way street, of course, for both firms from Northern Ireland selling south, and those from the Republic selling north. Figures from the ONS show Northern Irish business with the Republic of Ireland accounted for around % of exports and % of imports. “The share of intermediate products in imports from Northern Ireland to Ireland is higher in almost all sectors than trade in the same sectors from the rest of the UK,” Seamus said in a piece examining the impact of a ‘no deal’ scenario. “So for example, a company could transport ingredients or components across the border several times before the finished product is completed in Northern Ireland, and is then ready for export to consumers in Great Britain. “Naturally the intermediate products will be of lesser value compared to the completed product, hence the disparity in value of goods crossing the Irish Sea compared to the land border. “In recent Brexit discussions the signicance of the value of trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain has been highlighted. “This is quite right and we must ensure this hugely important market for us is not jeopardised or impeded in any way as a result of Brexit. “What has often been overlooked is our reliance on being able to move goods quickly, cheaply and without tarfs across the Irish border, in order to assemble those valuable goods we end up shipping to Great Britain. “If the all-island supply chains are impeded with subsequent increased costs and subject to tarfs, then those exports we champion and put on those ferries to Great Britain will suddenly become less competitive in price – or, in the worst case scenario, won’t exist anymore.” Seamus says a “holistic approach is required when trade from Northern Ireland is discussed and used as a bargaining chip due to the fact it’s a unique economic region that is finely interwoven with that of another EU member state”. “To pursue, or indeed to sleep walk into, a no deal Brexit would unravel the carefully tailored economy of Northern Ireland and potentially leave it in tatters.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
