Yet Tony had no difficulty in smuggling through Alim, above, a hip-hop artist born in Sierra Leone who has lived in Britain since he was eight. Alim, hidden in plain sight under a blanket in Tony’s cab, does not even elicit a raised eyebrowAnd last December, Sajid Javid, then Home Secretary, declared a ‘major incident’ in the Channel after a spike in the number of migrants trying to enter Britain by water.‘I’m worried because the boat isn’t safe and there are rainclouds coming in,’ says Asher at the start of his journey. He is an experienced sailing, kayaking and powerboat instructor. Even so, he is frightened in the tiny vessel, which doesn’t even have a seat.‘To be crossing the Channel in this inflatable dinghy, even with small waves, is nuts,’ he says.Five hours after he set out, we see him in international waters, 35 miles from land, soaked to the skin and frantically baling out the dinghy. (Days later, an asylum-seeker died in an effort to cross the Channel by similar means.)‘The boat almost sank,’ he admits later. ‘The waves were so big. In open sea, it’s impossible not to be terrified. I was frightened pretty much all the journey. It’s one of the most dangerous ways of crossing the Channel.‘I’ve seen videos of the boats people-traffickers use. They are meant to carry four or five people but they cram in up to 25 and they’re only just sitting on top of the water. They’re so exposed.‘If you’re not experienced and don’t know what you’re doing, then God speed.’Asher is ‘sympathetic’ to people who travel to the UK in search of a better life. His grandma, 80, a retired cancer nurse, came over from Jamaica on the Windrush in the Fifties.‘She came because she wanted a better life,’ he says. ‘We only get one life. We are the lucky ones in a rich country with so many benefits.’I ask if he was shocked that he made the crossing, arriving safely in Weymouth, Dorset, without being challenged. He says he was not remotely surprised. ‘Border Force is doing its best but how on earth are you going to stop every yacht, dinghy or powerboat crossing the Channel?‘The border is massive. I’ve got respect for the people trying to police it but they can’t be everywhere at once.’Indeed, traffickers are trying to outwit the BF by crossing at less intensely monitored routes. Even so, British lorry driver Tony, 56, managed one of the most audacious feats of the experiment.The Calais-to-Dover crossing is one of the most closely patrolled in the world. Yet Tony had no difficulty in smuggling through Alim, a hip-hop artist born in Sierra Leone who has lived in Britain since he was eight.Alim, hidden in plain sight under a blanket in Tony’s cab, does not even elicit a raised eyebrow.Every lorry is checked at Calais, where there are both French and UK border controls. Tony is concerned that a heat detector will reveal he has a stowaway. But high-tech scanners are not used on his vehicle. Tony is pragmatic. ‘England is a little island and it can only house so many people,’ he says. ‘I’d like to help everybody but I’ve got to look after my own.‘As a driver, you’re fined £2,000 if an illegal immigrant is found in your truck.’While in France, Tony watches as asylum-seekers wandering near his lorry are led away by officials. Yet Alim, inches behind him, remains undetected.Tony is amazed. ‘You’re up against guards. You’ve got scanners, heat sensors, dog patrols, passport control. I never thought anyone could get through these checkpoints,’ he says.And at Dover — where checks are being made, but not on every vehicle — Tony’s lorry again sails through security unhindered.Astounded by the ease of what he has just accomplished, he observes: ‘There’s all this security but what did we do? We just stuck a guy behind a seat, put a cloth over him and got through.‘What we proved is that if even we can beat the system. If you’re well-resourced and have infrastructure behind you, it would be easy.’That is a sobering thought at a time when ruthless criminal gangs are exploiting the desperation of illegal immigrants.The Home Office has this to say: ‘The Border Force is intelligence-led and targeted at criminals who seek to break the law.‘All the iniduals in this programme were British passport- holders. When there is reason to suspect criminality, we carry out rigorous checks, as evidenced by the 50,000 detections and refusals at borders last year.’Smuggled starts on Monday at 9pm on Channel 4."},{"url":null,"title":"Societys king clubs bags 200m payday","story":"Share this article The 71-year-old, whose fortune was previously estimated at £650million, started his career in clothing, before buying the Caprice Holdings group for £31.5million in 2005.A flamboyant figure, Mr Caring paid £150,000 earlier this year to dine with Boris Johnson at his own venue, Mark\u0027s Club.

(Only a real pro can notice the teeniest dip in buoyancy when they compare The Wave’s drinking-quality water and saltwater.)But back to my lesson. My instructor Will is a warming force all on his own. He has a handsome grin and enormous thighs, hails from Porthcawl in Wales, and took up surfing aged 14 as part of hip reconstruction surgery rehab. ‘We’ve all got our sob stories,’ he says cheerily.We start on dry land, practise the ‘pop up’ — oh so easy for the lithe 12-year-old and the twenty-somethings in my group, but harder for those of us with stiffer knees — embrace the new lingo of ‘goofy’ and ‘regular’ stances (all about which leg you favour in front) and try not to look at the expanse of grey-blue water behind us. It’s the end of October, for goodness’ sake.‘You won’t feel the cold — no one does,’ says Will for the 100th time. He looks shocked when I ask if anyone ever pees in their wetsuit to warm themselves up, as open-water swimmers frequently do. ‘It is not a good idea if it’s not your own suit,’ he says firmly. ‘And your boots will fill up.’All hired suits are given a good dunk in disinfectant after each wear, he adds.And with that, he leads us into the icy water where, as we paddle like mad things on our boards, he whoops and es in and out of waves like a happy porpoise. For a long time, none of us, bar the agile 12-year-old, ‘pop up’. But despite the icy head-dunking and repeated lungfuls of water, I’m grinning like a village idiot.Every time we crash off our boards to flounder in the shallows, we look up to see the proper surfers dip and curl and jump in the deeper water. They look like birds swooping and looping and, despite the cold, would never dream of wearing gloves or boots, let alone bright orange crash helmets, like us.Nick is watching all this from the viewing platform, and it must be hugely satisfying. His struggle to bring The Wave to life has been ‘really, really, really challenging’. When he promised his dad, he was a father of three young boys and working as an osteopath with his wife, Juliana.         All they want is fast-moving water to hurl themselves onto, and the chance to demonstrate their ‘pop up’ skills — the art of going from lying on a board to standing, while riding a wave. Much of the wider surfing community are ecstatic about The WaveHe started with just £500 seed money, and somehow — despite technical setbacks (this is the third design), planning issues, and funding hurdles, and four years of unpaid 100-hour weeks — his dream has finally come true.That’s not to say there weren’t low points. He confesses to being so overwhelmed by the impossibility of it all, about four years ago, that he sat on the edge of his bed and a had ‘a really proper big cry’ — until his eight-year-old son told him to buck up.‘He put an arm around me and said: ‘‘Don’t worry Dad, I know you’ll be able to find a way round this’’,’ says Nick.And he did. He now has a facility that serves elite surfers, keen amateurs and beginners, and is also accessible for mental health charities (there are endless studies on the benefits of spending time in water and outdoors), schools and disability groups.Nick describes the opening as ‘being like my wedding day, all over again’. Which is all very nice, but whether Juliana (who has taken over their osteopathy practice so Nick can concentrate on The Wave) would agree is a different matter. ‘She hates the water,’ Nick says.Happily, lots of other people don’t, and the timing couldn’t be better, what with the Olympics approaching. The UK squad have already put The Wave through its paces. And, rather pleasingly, the resort has just sneaked in ahead of a similar facility in Melbourne to be the first of its kind in the world.Historically, Britain is not seen as one of the great surfing nations. The earliest recorded surfing here was in 1890, when two Hawaiian princes took their English guardian surfing in the North Sea at Bridlington in Yorkshire. Perhaps unsurprisingly, it didn’t catch on.And while Agatha Christie became obsessed with surfing during her travels in South Africa and Hawaii, bellyboarding — riding prone on wooden boards — was the thing in the 1920s.It wasn’t until the early 1960s that surf culture truly reached Cornwall. But today surfing is one of our fastest-growing sports, with 650,000 regular surfers in a £2 billion industry. Easter Compton is just the beginning. A surfing resort in London’s Lee Valley is next, followed by Scotland (in winter they may sometimes have to keep the paddles going at night to stop the lake freezing over).But not everyone is enamoured by The Wave. The bigger waves won’t be up and running for a few weeks yet, and some advanced surfers are apparently sick of dollying about on Malibu 1. There have also been some rumblings about the prices it’s £40 for an hour-long session.Would I return? Like a shot. Because back in the beginners’ class, things are looking up.I’m on my knees. I’m half up. I’m off, headfirst. I’m back on. Then, finally, I’m up, soaring like a bird — or more like a crouching bear. I’m actually bloody well surfing.And, weirdly, it isn’t remotely cold. I feel light and high and utterly exhilarated. Until the next morning, that is, when I am so stiff I can barely walk down the stairs."},{"url":null,"title":"BBC apologise Harvey Proctor Nick interview","story":"Share this article Mr Proctor said she had not and later filed a complaint with the BBC after it dismissed viewers’ concerns over his interview with Miss Munchetty on October 5, saying she had conducted it in a ‘fair and understanding manner’.BBC Breakfast editor Richard Frediani emailed the former Tory politician on Wednesday to offer a private apology.In the email, seen by the Daily Mail, Mr Frediani said: ‘I fully accept that while the IOPC did not find evidence of deliberate wrongdoing by the Met Officers it investigated, their investigation did not in fact refer to Ms Dick (sic) as the subsequent exchange suggested.‘I’m very sorry we got this wrong, but I hope you can accept mistakes can happen in live broadcasting and that this was not of course a lie (as Mr Proctor had alleged in his complaint).’Mr Proctor had accused the BBC of ‘covering up’ by dismissing the complaints.          Naga Munchetty wrongly claimed Scotland Yard chief Cressida Dick had been cleared by independent reports into the force’s handling of the case         Mr Proctor said she had not and later filed a complaint with the BBC after it dismissed viewers’ concerns over his interview with Miss Munchetty on October 5, saying she had conducted it in a ‘fair and understanding manner’Mr Frediani went on: ‘Naga was faced with a genuine editorial difficulty when you referred to Cressida Dick as a liar because of what she had said in an interview with another broadcaster.‘As Naga did not have a transcript of these comments in front of her she was quite properly conscious of right to reply issues should the interview progress further along these lines.‘I am, however, very sorry that you were upset by the exchanges and by our subsequent response but I hope I have been able to clarify what happened.’In response, Mr Proctor told the BBC executive he ‘accepted’ his apology.

Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.First up, an admirable post from steevieb, who has had a change of heart about Elizabeth Strout’s Olive Kitteridge:Some time ago (years) I began reading Olive Kitteridge. Just couldn’t get on with it though, got bored with the small town America bit. Last week I decided to give it another go, I am so glad I did, totally blew me away, beautifully written, I loved every page so much that I immediately bought Amy and Isabelle, which to me was even better. How I could have been bored by it (Olive K) the first time around is a puzzle. Moods, I guess.Tom Mooney has also been rereading some classics:Hemingway’s The Old Man and the Sea, not for the first time. It is wonderful, perfect even. I found some of it a little tougher to read this time, particularly the killing of the sharks (I had been reading a LOT of Cormac McCarthy around the time I read it before so was likely very desensitised!) but it stands up magnificently to repeated reading.I must be in the mood for old stuff as I also recently reread The Swimmer, John Cheever’s glorious masterpiece of a short story. It’s one of my all-time favourites and shows what a sharp writer he was.Night Waking by Sarah Moss has satisfied BobHammond2:Set on the fictional Scottish island of Colonsay, academic Anna is trying to juggle the challenges of motherhood, marriage, her academic career and a fair amount of sleep deprivation - and then a mystery around a baby’s skeleton buried outside her house on the island. Overlaid on top of this is a separate timeline where we see, throughout the book, a series of letters written by a midwife sent to the island back in the late 1800s to improve infant mortality. So, Moss has a lot to juggle but she does it brilliantly and the two separate stories and all the loose threads are brought together at the end of the book for a very satisfying conclusion.fuzzywuzz has enjoyed The Body by Bill Bryson:What a marvellous adventure I have been on, taking a tour of the various organ systems within a human being. Although I studied biochemistry and physiology in my student days, I have learned some interesting new things and revisited already known facts.What I particularly like about Bryson’s style here is that he has taken some complex subject areas such as immunology and transfusion science and distilled them into something which can be mentally digested by those without a scientific background and does so without patronising the reader.ID673795 has enjoyed Caravan of the Lost and Left Behind by Deirdre Shanahan:The story of a woman traveller and her son returning from chaotic lives in England to live on a traveller’s site in Ireland with her father, where she also hopes to find her daughter, left there as a baby. The landscape is beautifully described and the story very sad but in the end hopeful.BanjoGuru has just finished But Beautiful by Geoff Dyer “which I enjoyed a lot”:I was expecting straight biographies of some jazz greats, but it’s an altogether stranger beast - part imagined, part true, full of shifting perspectives and illusions and some really perceptive and evocative prose. I can recommend it if you like jazz, or even if you don’t.Now this is a funny and wise book. The quips and cultural insights are ridiculously true. Especially about the X and Y generations. Professor Chandra himself is a true delight … I found myself asking, “So who IS this smart guy who wrote this fine book?” That’s when you know it’s a good’un. This book is smart, hilarious, and best of all ... kindhearted. Yes, filled with an open hearted way of looking at the people we love and our struggles as well as struggles of our world and culture today.Finally, MarGar65 has just finished Penelope Fitzgerald’s Innocence:I loved it. I am so glad her books have come into my life! What an observant author ... What trust she places in us as she unfolds her stories. She refuses to bend to the expectation of a happy ending. I fear I am running out of To-Be-Read Fitzgeralds ... This is most alarming in a sense because I will run out of new Fitzgeralds, but I am relieved when I think that I can go always go back and reread them all.Going back to reread Fitzgerald sounds like an admirable idea. Just the kind of thing that should get us through winter…If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

The singer was reportedly paid £9m to promote a range of Christmassy-flavoured crisps.Boots and Marks \u0026amp Spencer are expected to launch their campaigns next week while Tesco, Sainsbury’s and John Lewis – whose ad last year featured Elton John – are set to reveal their Christmas extravaganzas after Remembrance Day on 11 November.The brands’ festive commercials herald the annual battle for hearts and minds in what is known as the “golden quarter” when stores make the vast majority of their profits. Shoppers are expected to spend £80bn in the final six weeks of the season alone, according to a report by the Centre for Retail Research.“TV is the best for building brand stories and mass audience emotional connections and Christmas is a particularly strong time for big multi-media brand campaigns,” said Stephen Woodford, chief executive of the Advertising Association.Argos’s campaign, for example, is led by a TV ad calculated to pull on the heart strings. A kitchen turns into a stage complete with dancing fans after a dad spots that his daughter has circled a drum kit in the traditional catalogue. In a dream sequence he plays along in his slippers to Simple Minds hit Don’t You (Forget About Me). The daughter joins in, with impressive drumming skills, as the freezer becomes a dry ice machine and the cooker morphs into stage lights.The TV clip links to a digital campaign in which the company has made more than 40 years of vintage catalogues available online while celebrities and members of the public reminisce about leafing through their “book of dreams”.Asda’s TV ad also stars a young girl, in a whimsical sequence in which she spreads the magic of Christmas caught from the northern lights across her village. It is tied into a digital storybook, Santa’s Leftover Magic, part of the proceeds of which will go to the retailer’s Fight Hunger Create Change initiative which works with food banks.Mariah Carey’s Walkers ad, which features her singing All I want for Christmas is You, while tussling with an elf over a bag of crisps, was already being teased on digital channels on Friday.Iceland won huge traffic on social media last year for a commercial featuring a Greenpeace-made animation about destruction of Orangutans’ rainforest habitat. It was pulled from TV because it breached political advertising rules. But this year it has opted for a more traditional tie-up with Disney film Frozen 2, including a family playing charades with characters from the film.Woodford said digital advertising continued to grow strongly because brands and retailers were following audiences and looking for channels where they could target particular audiences efficiently.He added: “Small and medium-sized businesses are also driving huge growth online. Twenty years ago small businesses had limited choices but now a one-person business can advertise using digital channels to 100 people if they choose to. It has also opened up routes for a small business to reach global markets.”The expected fall in TV spending comes after ITV’s shares were hit last year by a warning of a difficult Christmas caused by the switch to online and cutbacks by retailers who are trying to trim budgets in a difficult market.But he said recent budget pressure had encourage brands to use digital channels which they saw as providing a quicker return on investment because it more directly prompts spending.“In the times we are living in people are driven by short term,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d83475c02f3ef680b4ccbc179bd6b492ec001b0e/0_253_4104_2462/master/4104.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=554bd21b27c8f92394f7bbce9de33f94","title":"peoples vote campaign remain brexit corbyn","story":"Remainiacs have never recognised that Brexit was a symptom of bigger problems. Like it or not, they now depend on CorbynThe polls have barely moved. Not the polls for the general election, but the ones on voting intention in a second referendum. They show a country as sharply ided on the question as last time. Now remain has shaded a few points into the lead – but most polls find “don’t know” stubbornly high. The conventional wisdom in 2016 was that these voters would break for remain in the final days. Conventional wisdom was confounded.Leaks from the People’s Vote campaign as it has crumbled into infighting show it to be still in thrall to that conventional wisdom – certain that all we have to do is wait, and remain will triumph. Thin on ideas, complacent on strategy, it seems to have little in the way of targets, even the most obvious of all: converting the split electorate into a social majority.Strategic blunders have characterised the campaign since its inception. The most glaring, and the one now pulling the campaign apart, is that it slips between arguing for a second referendum as a democratic necessity – as a means for popular sanction or rejection of the terms of any deal – and for a second referendum because it is the most expedient route to remaining in the EU.Really moving the needle on Brexit would require getting wavering leavers on side, but the campaign’s efforts to do so have been minimal: it prefers to inveigh against its pantheon of folk-devils, from Jacob Rees-Mogg and Dominic Cummings to Jeremy Corbyn. Quietly, some of its organisers accept that it has struggled to escape its reputation as an establishment mafia its prominent organisational caste of washed-up spin doctors, political exiles and job-hungry apparatchiks hasn’t helped. When Boris Johnson’s withdrawal bill looked close to passing last week, it seemed time for the campaign’s last rites to be read. The general election has granted it a reprieve, but one in which its serious options are now few.It is astonishing that People’s Vote should have squandered its obvious opportunities: it is well funded, operating with resources that would make most single-issue campaigns sick with envy. The campaign has simply failed to learn the lessons of the first referendum. The remain campaign in 2016 had the unenviable task of uniting left and right in defence of a political arrangement they liked for different reasons: the right for the EU’s opening up of markets and liberalisation of economies the left because of freedom of movement and cultural exchange, and the European court of justice’s tendency to act as a bulwark against the worst excesses of British governments. They settled on an arid defence of technocracy with a healthy dose of fear.That strategy remains broadly unchanged, though there are other strings to the bow: confronted with a choice between articulating a political argument for a new vote that could bring leavers on board, and exploiting the newfound – if ersatz – enthusiasm for the EU among the remainer base, it has pivoted heavily towards the latter. This is consistent: the groups organising for a People’s Vote have always assumed that to get a referendum means they will win it that means keeping their base fired-up and intransigent. Remain’s highest-profile campaigners are ebullient partisans in the Brexit culture war, blending seamlessly with the digital fringes of Remainia as they muse about leavers’ relative education levels and the manipulative effects of numbers on the side of buses.This is not the serious self-examination of a losing side, but the injured outrage of people who believe they ought to have won, marred by snobbery and self-exculpation.Instead, People’s Vote has persisted in the belief that there is a latent majority in Britain for both a second referendum and a vote to remain. In its more grotesque form, this assumes that demographic shift is the agent of change: as older leavers die off, a wave of younger voters will flood to the ballot box to smash Brexit for good. Recent political history is littered with failed progressive movements that pinned their electoral hopes on such shifts.The strategy is an apolitical one: an unreliable youth wave takes the place of attempts to politically persuade wavering leave voters to change their vote, or think about how the gulf between both poles could be bridged. In an intensely politicised moment, this is insufficient.MPs affiliated to the People’s Vote campaign also dreamed that such a majority might emerge as an exasperated and deadlocked parliament turned its eyes to a second vote. That dream – never credible against parliamentary arithmetic – is done. The chances of a People’s Vote now depend entirely on the complexion of the next government.The most notable success of the People’s Vote has been to tar the Labour party with the Brexit brush, and disillusion many of its most ardent remainer voters. It is a rich irony, therefore, that its only hope of success now lies in a Labour government. For all the scorn poured on Jeremy Corbyn by PV functionaries, the Labour party, under his leadership, opposed Theresa May’s deal, and it opposes Johnson’s harder version of the same text. Any future People’s Vote can only be built on Labour foundations.It is also party policy. Labour’s activist base and its parliamentary cohort is overwhelmingly for remain it is acutely aware, however, that a sizeable chunk of its voters were for leave. The Labour party has always thought of itself as a party of the whole nation it is instinctively averse to the Liberal Democrats’ current strategy, which is geared to appeal to an enthused fifth of the country by promising revocation without further democratic exercise. The rollout of dodgy tactical voting sites directing remainers to choose the Lib Dems even in seats where they finished a distant third in 2017 – like the one launched this week by Best for Britain – may end up handing Johnson the Brexit of his dreams by turning Labour-Tory marginals blue.Labour’s cautious strategy will not always please PVers, who sometimes mirror the ERG’s impatience to “get Brexit done”. But the party is right to intuit that its offer of a second referendum must be presented with a plausible option to leave – with improved guarantees on workers’ rights, watered down in Johnson’s deal – and that Brexit itself should always be considered alongside its wider social and economic programme. Refusing to pretend politics began on 23 June 2016 allows Labour to touch on the deep inequalities and democratic atrophy that churned underneath the Brexit referendum. Reintroducing those questions to Brexit might also provide the People’s Vote with the only means to reach beyond their remainiac base.People’s Vote has been granted a reprieve. It may be a bitter pill for many of its campaigners to swallow, but the truth is this: the fate of a second referendum now depends on Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party.• James Butler is co-founder of Novara Media"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38674830860be0775d3e080b5981abace04c903a/0_395_7360_4418/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9304d31bd4b6ba02634106b45b060517","title":"netflix too much to watch speed watching","story":"My list of unwatched but must-see films is stressing me out. Speed-watching could help, but maybe it’s time to scale backThings in life that could be improved by being speeded up: work meetings, telephone banking, golf, the sandwich queue at my local deli. Films? Well, it’s tempting. The new Martin Scorsese movie is three and a half hours long, and some of us like to be in bed before midnight.This week we learned that Netflix has been testing a new feature that allows users to speed up their viewing without sacrificing the dialogue (making it different from the fast-forward button), prompting outpourings of fury from filmmakers on social media. “Don’t fuck with our timing,” frothed Judd Apatow, the director of Trainwreck and Knocked Up. “We give you nice things. Leave them as they were intended to be seen.” “Another spectacularly bad idea, and another cut to the already bleeding-out cinema experience,” raged Brad Bird, he of The Incredibles and Ratatouille.You can see why they might feel aggrieved. It’s bad enough that Netflix has provided a “skip intro” function, because, really, who gives a toss about who did all the work? Now the expertise and graft they put into creating a visually stunning, expertly paced masterpiece can be bypassed by some idiot pressing a button and turning it into a high-definition Benny Hill Show.While you could argue that there’s no compulsion to use the function, actors and directors would say that that’s not the point. Novelists don’t write imagining that readers will skim their latest opus musicians don’t write songs expecting them to be played back at double speed. While filmmakers don’t get to decide when we press pause before we go to make a cup of tea, they should surely be able to count on the fact that their work will be viewed at the pace that was intended.Defenders of this function have cited podcasts as a medium whose programmes can be sped up for time-poor listeners without adversely affecting the experience. While there’s something to be said for being able to up the pace in order to finish a show before the end of your commute or morning run, it hardly enhances the work. Studies have shown that time-compressed speech leads to a drop in comprehension for the listener, although I’m more concerned about what it does to the voices. Podcast hosts sounding like characters from Disney movies don’t always make for an engaging listen.Nonetheless, Netflix’s new feature, currently only available to some Android users, could be seen as the logical solution to a world flooded with films and TV series that no one person could hope to watch in a lifetime. Right now, my list of unwatched but must-see films and TV series is so long that it’s stressing me out I am forever marooned in catch-up mode. Remember when we only had a handful of channels to choose from, and when watching a film at home meant seeing The Poseidon Adventure for the 67th time, or making a trip to Blockbuster? Back then, I would sit through any old crap. This is not about reduced attention s supposedly afflicting viewers in the internet age, it’s about a surfeit of stuff demanding our attention. Choice can be a good thing but, beyond a certain point, the impulse to skip forwards, or switch to something else, can be overwhelming.It stands to reason that networks will do their utmost to speed up our consumption – with greater competition between streaming services intensified by the arrival of Apple TV+ and the forthcoming platform Disney+, the fight for our eyeballs is becoming ever more brutal. More dispiriting is what this desire to speed things up says about how we, the viewers, have come to see entertainment. It used to be that it was something we did in our downtime to help lift us from the daily grind. But, increasingly, getting through the list of must-see series is a mountain to be conquered, or a job in which we are rewarded for increased productivity.Of course, there is another solution to the fact that we are drowning in what streaming companies charmingly call “content”, and that is to reduce the output, and focus on quality not quantity. It’s hardly a revolutionary idea, but one that seems to elude the networks that see it as necessary to dump a lorryload of new shows on their platforms every week, much of it drivel. Directors could do their bit, too, by trimming their masterworks to a length less likely to give us all arse-ache.We live in a televisual world in which bigger is seen as better, and commissioning budgets have duly skyrocketed. Three and a half hours to watch a movie? I’ve had shorter holidays than that. Perhaps it’s time to scale things back – or the problem won’t be speed-watching, it’ll be cancelled subscriptions all round.• Fiona Sturges is an arts writer specialising in books, music, podcasting and TV"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e48825651147a5299c13fec6918c0538656618e8/0_628_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1f8e6fa1a43734d72e1a05b8f709601c","title":"only in ottawa top 10 unmissable summertime experiences in canadas capital","story":"Summer visitors to Ottawa will be rewarded with a vibrant arts and outdoor scene, with galleries, festivals and waterways. Then there’s the beerOttawa is relaxed, but at the same time an adrenaline-seeker’s dream. It’s funky and kitsch and yet effortlessly cool with brewing, dining and arts scenes to rival anywhere in North America – and its absolute best comes in the summer months.Cruising the Rideau canalWhile Ottawa’s Rideau canal plays host to hundreds of daily ice skaters carving across its frozen surface during winter months, the Unesco world heritage site is just as appealing in summer. Jump aboard Rideau Canal Cruises’ fully electric barge – the only vessel of its kind in North America – and savour the perfect vantage point for some of Ottawa’s most scenic spots. You can take in Lansdowne Park and Dow’s Lake to the south and the gothic revival splendour of the Fairmont Château Laurier hotel closer to downtown.Political manoeuvring – with a twistZen can be found in surprising pockets of Ottawa but none more surprising than in its very epicentre – Parliament Hill. Inside the doors of the nation’s halls of power, things may be particularly frenetic with a federal election coming up this autumn, but on the lawn outside the stunning house of commons, things are decidedly more chill every Wednesday afternoon. The free weekly yoga class is an absolute must for yogis and non-yogis of all abilities. Even prime minister Justin Trudeau, an enthusiast himself, has stopped in at a class or two. Just bring a mat – and some sunscreen – and get your downward dog on while the politicians get their debate on inside.Brewing up a stormWhen former US president Barack Obama rekindled his bromance with Trudeau during a visit to the capital earlier this summer, it was pretty fitting that the pair caught up at a brewery. Ottawa is teeming with taphouses pouring out some of Canada’s best brews. Obama and Trudeau opted for Big Rig Brewing where they sampled the Canadian Amber and Alpha Bomb IPA respectively. But there is hoppy goodness to be found across the city. Beyond the Pale in Little Italy is a gem with great eats to soak up even better beers, while Canada’s first Kickstarter-funded brewery, Dominion City, is so worth the trip to the east end. Can’t decide between the options? Then let the experts at Brew Donkey guide you on an always-fun brewery bus tour.The best season? Patio seasonSummer is patio season. There’s nowhere better to enjoy those great local beers or some of the best cuisine in Canada than in the open air. The uber-stylish Andaz hotel in the ByWard Market may lay claim to the city’s best patio, a rooftop escape that offers stunning views. But there are scores of rivals. Tavern on the Falls boasts soothing waterfall views, while Tooth and Nail Brewing Co has a recently opened sun-kissed courtyard to go with great beers. The Brig Pub may have the most Insta-perfect open-air space of all – a canopy of hanging greenery that still leaves gaps for blue skies to pierce through.Sounds of summerThe capital reverberates to music all summer long. Bluesfest is the biggest and boldest festival of the summer and boasts much more than just blues. Headliners this year include the Killers, Alt-J, Wu-Tang Clan and the Backstreet Boys. But from June through to September there really is something for everyone: Escapade sates all EDM lovers’ appetites Chamberfest is the world’s biggest chamber music festival there are five days of fireworks at the Canadian Museum of History with the Sound of Light competition and, yes, there is also a 10-day jazz festival that features some of the world’s biggest acts.Please the palate at a walking paceOttawa’s food scene – a melting pot that bubbles over with flavours and aromas – is as erse as its population. The city ranges from award-winning fine dining to adventurous ethnic holes in the wall, with plenty in between. But there are so many funky new places opening up that wrangling them all in can seem like a challenge. So why not pass the job off to someone else by joining a walking food tour? C’est Bon Cooking offers great guides to the city’s food culture, snaking through the top foodie neighbourhoods. Centretown and The Glebe might be the most happening neighbourhoods right now.Waterways to pass the dayIf the blue lagoon part of the Goliath sounds appealing, but little else, then keep things upright and a little lower on the adrenaline scale by hitting the waterways that course around the city. With temperatures on the rise, the summer months in Ottawa are made for water lovers. You can take to the Rideau canal in your own personal vessel, with kayak, paddleboat, canoe and stand-up paddleboard (SUP) rentals all available at the marina at Dow’s Lake. Venture beyond the canal to either the Ottawa or Gatineau rivers. Urban Ocean may be the pick of some great rental and guide firms, offering the chance to SUP in the shadows of Parliament Hill or SUP yoga by the Ottawa locks.Live the high life … then dropNot everything has to be chill in Ottawa – there are thrills too. Nowhere does the adrenaline flow freer and faster than at the Rock. Just a 20-minute drive from downtown, this stunning limestone gorge is a site to behold but looks even better upside down. Great Canadian Bungee offers the highest fall on the continent of North America — fully 61 metres (200 feet) into the aquamarine lagoon below. Even the 49-metre (160-foot) rebound is higher than the next biggest bungee in the US or Canada! If you’re not feeling the urge, watching others drop below is a thrill in itself!Culture cravings satisfiedOttawa is not just the country’s political centre. It lays claim to being Canada’s museum and gallery capital too. The sprawling National Gallery of Canada finds room for almost 100,000 works, by a distance the country’s biggest. This summer’s highlight sees the world’s first-ever exhibition devoted to the portrait work of post-impressionist master Paul Gauguin. But make time for the Canadian and Indigenous galleries too, where the country’s cultural heritage can be traced back 5,000 years. At the Ottawa Art Gallery’s stunning new home – shared with Le Germain hotel – catch the Wrapped in Culture project, a powerful reclamation project between Indigenous artists from Canada and Australia.Go wildSo many summer visitors eschew Canadian cities and make straight for the great wilderness. Ottawa offers the best of both worlds. Drive even 10 minutes outside the city and you’ll find your natural paradise. Gatineau Park is over 350 sq kms of green goodness and yet its main entrance is just 4km from downtown. Hike to the Pink Lake lookout where the deepest aqua-green waters ensure that no filter is required for the perfect selfie. There are trails for all levels of hikers, and rookies and experts alike should finish up at the genteel 1900s surrounds of the Mackenzie King Estate, where tea and scones at the former residence of Canada’s longest-serving prime minister are just reward for the hike.Explore all Canada’s capital has to offer with Canadian Affair"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a3f7e5e587883057275ab322ed2a7bab2cb8f88/0_200_4896_2938/master/4896.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0934396a1fcb20fb5ccb680372b62200","title":"10 unmissable autumn experiences in ontario","story":"Visit Ontario in the autumn and you’ll discover food festivals, migrating birds and a kaleidoscope of foliage colour. Relax at Muskoka or fly to Frying Pan Island for its famous local fish and chipsOntario explodes into colour in autumn as the lush greens of spring and summer give way to the reds and golds and scorched orange and browns that are the hallmarks of the harvest time. The best time to see the autumn colours is from mid-September to mid-October when Ontario Parks publishes a colour report on its site of the autumn colours across the province. As you can imagine, the colours vary, depending on your location. In truth there is no better time to hit the road, get out of the city and soak up the kaleidoscope of change for a true Canadian autumn adventure.The natural heart of the provinceNowhere do the seasons change with as much vivid, coursing colour as in Algonquin provincial park. There are more than 100 provincial parks in Ontario, but none can rival Algonquin for popularity. Why? Because it lives up to the hype … and then some. Almost 3,000 square miles – a bigger expanse of land than Luxembourg – of unspoiled natural wilderness, the park is located between Toronto and Ottawa and is less than three hours’ drive from either city. Camp under the tapestry of stars or rent a ranger cabin for some rustic comfort. But, at first light, get out and catch the rich red maples and blinding yellow aspen trees in all their swing season glory.Pull up a chair in MuskokaIf Algonquin is Ontario’s natural centre, then the nearby Muskoka region is its relaxation hub. When Torontonians speak wistfully of a need to get out of the city to “cottage country” it’s likely that the Muskoka region is on their mind. From Insta-perfect tiny cabins to multi-million dollar lake homes, Muskoka has the full gamut of getaway options, almost all of them carving out a corner of tranquility among the pretty towns that pepper the region. A buzzing food scene, great breweries, spas and golf courses – the area has everything. Most of all though, it’s made for lounging lakeside in a low-slung Muskoka chair and forgetting about city life.Why 1,000 Islands make for a delightful trip …Head upstream from Lake Ontario to the mouth of the mighty St Lawrence River and you’ll reach the 1,000 Islands, an archipelago of more than 1,800 islands that straddle the Canadian and American border. A lazy but so rewarding cruise of the islands from Kingston, Gananoque or Rockport all the way up the St Lawrence is not to be missed, with stunning seasonal views guaranteed. And yes, these same islands are forever commemorated in a condiment – the eponymous salad dressing originating here.… Or up the ante with 30,000 IslandsIf you’re a go big or go home type then please don’t go home. Ontario offers a supersized island experience on the eastern shore of Georgian Bay as speckled out from Parry Sound lie the 30,000 Islands. The largest freshwater archipelago in the world, the islands can be enjoyed on water or, if you’re in the mood to splurge, by air. Georgian Bay Airways offers outstanding tours of the Unesco biosphere reserve, including one that stops in at Henry’s, a fish and chip shop that serves up the local delicacy – battered pickerel – on the quite brilliantly named Frying Pan Island, which can only be visited by plane or boat.Give the Highlands a flingJust three hours north-east of Toronto, the Haliburton Highlands offer some of the most spectacular trails and lookout points in the province – especially during the autumn colour season. In late September the four-day Hike Haliburton festival is the largest annual hiking gathering in the entire country. As the tree canopy really begins to find its best burnt crimson, climb the Dorset Lookout Tower and have your breath taken away by the panoramic visions from the top. Once your trail is finished, rest weary limbs and quench that thirst at the Lake of Bays Brewing Company in Baysville to the west.All aboard for northern exposureThe expanses of Ontario that stretch northwest from Georgian Bay can seem intimidatingly vast. But they needn’t be. Sault Ste Marie, a steel town on the rebound with some real gems among the rebirth, is a great starting point for a northern excursion. The rugged appeal of northern Ontario may be best taken in on the Agawa Canyon Tour Train, a journey into the wilderness on tracks that hug the sides of lakes and traverse rivers on their way through towering rock outcrops. Just make sure to book a window seat.A capital ideaNot the provincial capital – that honour falls to Toronto – Ottawa more than makes up for it as the epicentre of national governance. But better to leave the indoor stuff to the politicians because autumn is arguably when Canada’s capital city is at its most charming. Take a paddle along the Rideau Canal (before it freezes over for the winter) to get the best views of some of the city’s autumn foliage.Feast on the fruits of harvest seasonYou can quite literally wade into the riches of Ontario’s agricultural output as harvest season gets into full swing. Strap up your chest waders and take the plunge in Bala, Ontario’s cranberry capital. Autumn fairs crop up across Ontario as the boundless bounty of produce piles up. From the Pumpkinfest in Port Elgin to Oktoberfests across the province’s south-east, tis the season to e right in. Food festivals are popular across the province, and run the spectrum from sweet to savoury. Anything from blueberries, strawberries, peaches, apples and cherries can be found. Ribfests, garlic, bacon fests or buttertarts also feature.Wine for the winding roadThe Bruce Trail is the longest and oldest trail in the country and winds its way more than 550 miles north from Niagara Falls to Tobermory, Ontario. An entire section of the trail snakes along some of the spectacular cliffs of the Niagara Escarpment and other sections along the route make for nice day hikes. It would be a sin not to visit during the Niagara Grape and Wine festival, a two-week toast to the region’s finest tipples in September. It’s Canada’s biggest wine festival and a Discovery Pass pairs the wines with some of the best of the region’s vaunted cuisine.Heading south before the next seasonAutumn is not just moving season for farmers. Some of Ontario’s native fauna are getting their act together too. Upwards of 300 bird species begin to pack up and head south to avoid the winter, while hundreds of thousands of monarch butterflies do likewise. The great migrations are perhaps best witnessed at Point Pelee national park, less than an hour from the border with Michigan and the best time to catch the birdlife is mid-September.Start planning your visit to Ontario this autumn with Canadian Affair"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a7b12462f58d578b58360f4db6e4dfb7c47d442/0_0_2121_1273/master/2121.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1ce0bf1e7b7d972a2e08cb3c63c6475d","title":"from fringe theatre to walking on water 10 experiences that make alberta unique","story":"Alberta is a breathtakingly beautiful province. Home to the Canadian Rockies, farmland for miles (and miles and miles), all-season escapades, and a friendly and erse population, it’s a great place to get a whole lot of adventure for your moneyWalk on (frozen) water at Maligne CanyonStrap on your ice cleats and get ready for an afternoon journey through the frozen Maligne Canyon. During the summer months, visitors pass high over the canyon on a series of bridges, but once the river freezes over, the real adventure becomes possible. Trek over the ice and into the frozen depths of the canyon, and witness sheer icy cliffs on either side of the path – you’ll have definitely earned a mug of hot chocolate by the end.Become a fringe theatre fanatic in EdmontonFirst-timers at Edmonton International Fringe Theatre festival are often surprised to learn that Alberta’s unassuming capital city hosts the second-largest fringe theatre festival in the world (after Edinburgh). Those in the know, however, can attest to the massively fun explosion of wackiness and dramatic creativity that add colour and life to Edmonton’s hip Old Strathcona neighbourhood for 10 days each August.See Indigenous history at Writing-on-Stone provincial parkAlberta’s most recently minted Unesco world heritage site, Writing-on-Stone provincial park, is near the southern border in the area known as the Canadian Badlands. Tall, imposing rock formations called hoodoos populate the plains near the Milk River. On the rock walls are carvings and drawings that record the dreams and stories of the Áísínai’pi (Blackfoot) people, who have been in the area for the past 10,000 years. You need a guide to take you out to the art on the stone – book online to reserve your spot.Challenge yourself with the Crypt Lake Hike in WatertonThe trailhead of the Crypt Lake Hike in Waterton national park is accessed by boat, which is the first clue that this is not just going to be a walk in the park. Follow the trail up the mountain (approximately three hours each way) past four alpine waterfalls over a loop that runs roughly 11 miles. Avid hikers are, of course, drawn to the trail for the challenge of negotiating obstacles such as the 60-metre tunnel through the mountain – but it is the thrilling cliffside stretch near the top, which features stunning views down the ravine of the crystal-clear blue Crypt Lake, that truly makes this adventure something special.Photograph ice bubbles at Abraham LakeSometimes nature does some trippy things, like make a lake that freezes with bubbles in it. Decomposing matter forms methane bubbles in Abraham Lake in central Alberta. When it’s really cold, the bubbles get trapped in the ice rather than bursting at the surface. High winds can polish the ice and clear the snow away, making for perfect bubble viewing conditions.Go underground with a Canmore Cave TourJust outside Banff national park is the town of Canmore. It has all the trappings of a charming mountain community, plus a little extra: Rat’s Nest Cave. The name is straight out of a horror movie, but a tour of Rat’s Nest – one of Canada’s longest caves – is a perfectly safe way to get your thrills. Challenge yourself with the four-hour Adventure tour, or for something more moderate opt for the two-hour Explorer tour. If you are feeling extra adventurous you can book a private “solitude” experience.View larch trees in Banff and KananaskisEastern larches, a variety of pine also known as tamaracks, turn a deep golden yellow or rich copper for a short season – generally mid-September to mid-October – before dropping their needles for the winter. Pack a bright coat to pop against the colours in photos and head out to viewing hotspots like the Sentinel Pass in Banff’s aptly named Larch Valley, or the more easily accessible Chester Lake in Kananaskis country outside Calgary.Play palaeontologist at the Royal Tyrell MuseumDedicated to all things dinosaur, the Royal Tyrell Museum is Canada’s home of palaeontology, featuring one of the world’s largest collections of dinosaur displays alongside more than 130,000 fossils and an unbeatable programme of special exhibits and interactive learning experiences. Located just an hour-and-a-half drive out of Calgary, the Royal Tyrell Museum offers a great day trip out of Alberta’s largest city for people of all ages, not just kids.Touch the top of the world in Lake LouiseIf skiing isn’t your cup of tea, or you need a break from carving down the mountain, the Lake Louise Ski Resort offers a different kind of alpine experience – snowshoeing! Book a tour with a guide who will lead you off-piste for a peaceful snowbound hike around the summit, taking in panoramic views of some of the most stunning scenery in the Canadian Rockies from the spectacular vantage points dotted across the trail.Star gaze in Wood Buffalo national parkIn the far north of the province, with an area larger than Switzerland, lies the largest national park in Canada, Wood Buffalo national park. It is also the world’s largest dark sky preserve, making it the perfect spot to escape light pollution and star gaze or hunt for northern lights. With about 18 hours of daylight in the summer months, you will need to be a night owl to stay up for the show, or consider a visit in the autumn, winter or spring.So what are you waiting for?

We think it’s unnecessary, we think it’s pollutive of ground water systems, and also all the evidence from Preston New Road in Lancashire is it’s actually dangerous and has caused serious earth tremors.”His intervention came after the business secretary, Andrea Leadsom, made it clear that the moratorium was only in place “until the science changes”.“It’s a disappointment but we’ve always been clear that we will follow the science … the Oil and Gas Authority is one of the world’s best regulators and they have said to us that we cannot be certain that shale gas can be extracted safely,” she told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.Asked why a permanent ban was not being imposed, she replied: “Because this is a huge opportunity for the United Kingdom, but we will follow the science.“What we’re looking to see now is the exploration that Cuadrilla have carried out at Preston New Road, there will be some reports of what the potential is from those wells. So we will have better information in the future once that data has been assessed.Fracking, or hydraulic fracturing, is a way of extracting natural gas from shale rock formations that are often deep underground. It involves pumping water, chemicals and usually sand underground at high pressure to fracture shale – hence the name – and release the gas trapped within to be collected back at the surface.The technology has transformed the US energy landscape in the last decade, owing to the combination of high-volume fracking – 1.5m gallons of water per well, on average – and the relatively modern ability to drill horizontally into shale after a vertical well has been drilled.In England, the government placed a moratorium on fracking in November 2019 after protests,\u0026nbsplegal challenges\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspplanning rejections. A year earlier, the energy company Cuadrilla was\u0026nbspforced to stop work\u0026nbspat its Preston New Road site in Lancashire twice in four days due to minor earthquakes occurring while it was fracking. The tremors breached a seismic threshold imposed after\u0026nbspfracking caused minor earthquakes at a nearby Cuadrilla site in 2011. In March 2019 the high court ruled that the government\u0027s fracking guidelines were unlawful because they had failed to sufficiently consider scientific evidence against fracking.“It is quite clear that we can’t be certain. The science isn’t accurate enough to be able to assess the fault lines, the geological studies have been shown to be inaccurate and therefore unless, and until we can be absolutely certain we are imposing a moratorium.”Claire Stephenson from Frack Free Lancashire welcomed the end of the government’s “gratuitous” support for fracking. “Our position, however, is unchanged. We believe that only an outright ban is appropriate to protect the residents and the communities they live in, and our campaign will actively continue until one is implemented,” she said.Susan Holliday, the chair of the Preston New Action Group, also called for a total ban. “The earthquakes in August were felt by thousands of people. It must be clear from this that the Fylde coast is just not suitable for fracking,” she said.“It must be a huge relief for those communities that are currently under the threat of planning applications for fracking, knowing that they will now no longer need to go through what we have.”Friends of the Earth’s chief executive, Craig Bennett, hailed the move as a “tremendous victory” but urged the passage of new laws to enshrine an outright ban on fracking.“We must now ensure that legislation is passed so that the ban is made permanent,” he said. “But we can’t stop with banning fracking here if we are going to avoid catastrophic climate change. Time is running out. The UK must stop funding fracking abroad and we must leave all fossil fuels in the ground.”The Green party co-leader Sian Berry tweeted: “Banning fracking is for life, not just for Christmas.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bbcb92442a94af0ed00c7eee92b94d06886a8acc/0_284_5189_3115/master/5189.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f9a1e581b80ad950561d3d0d1c9315ba","title":"leonardo dicaprio calls greta thunberg a leader of our time","story":"Environmentalist actor says first meeting with teenage climate activist was ‘an honour’Leonardo DiCaprio has praised teenage climate change activist Greta Thunberg as a “leader of our time” following their first meeting.DiCaprio, a prominent environmental campaigner, said 16-year-old Thunberg’s message should be a “wake-up call to world leaders everywhere that the time for inaction is over”.The Academy Award winner shared a picture of him and the Swedish student on Instagram, writing: “There are few times in human history where voices are amplified at such pivotal moments and in such transformational ways – but Greta Thunberg has become a leader of our time.“History will judge us for what we do today to help guarantee that future generations can enjoy the same livable planet that we have so clearly taken for granted.“I hope that Greta’s message is a wake-up call to world leaders everywhere that the time for inaction is over.”DiCaprio, 44, who most recently starred in Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, said he was “optimistic about what the future holds” thanks to Thunberg and young activists like her.“It was an honour to spend time with Greta,” he added. “She and I have made a commitment to support one another, in hopes of securing a brighter future for our planet.”DiCaprio is a vocal climate change campaigner and highlighted the issue during his acceptance speech at the 88th Academy Awards in 2016.He said: “Climate change is real, it is happening right now.

London had the highest concentration of car charge points in the UK, with 49 for every 100,000 people.The Isles of Scilly and Barrow-in-Furness were the worst local authority areas within counties for drivers looking for charge points: the data shows there are zero public charging points in either location.More than 100 local authorities had fewer than 10 public chargers per 100,000 population.The lack of charge points across the country is thought to be one of the most important factors holding back the consumer take-up of electric vehicles, with drivers wary of being stranded on longer journeys – even though the vast majority of car journeys taken by British people are well within the range of new electric cars.Consultancy Capital Economics last month estimated that the UK will need 25.3m charge points in 2050 to hit the legislated target of net zero carbon emissions. The majority of these will be privately owned but 2.6m will be required in public places. There are currently only 15,000 in public places and only 2,500 of those are fast chargers. The estimated cost of installing chargers across the UK is £45.9bn.There is a broad political consensus in favour of rapidly increasing the number of electric car charging points in the UK, but some experts are concerned that a market-led approach to charger rollout could lead to poorer areas being left behind.Keith Anderson, chief executive of ScottishPower, which commissioned the Capital Economics report, said the government should give local communities more power to manage the transition to lower-carbon technology.“In a few years, our roads will look very different, with electric cars and buses dominating,” he said. “The way we heat our homes will change as well, as gas is phased out in favour of heat pumps. These changes to transport and heating will place huge demands on our energy networks – and we need to ensure we have the infrastructure in place to anticipate these dramatic changes.”Labour has pledged to spend £3.6bn on a national charging network if it wins the general election. The Conservative government has so far committed to spending £1.5bn by 2020 on its “road to zero” strategy, as well as funding half of a £400m fund for charging infrastructure.Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, said: “Your postcode should play no part in how easy it is to use an electric car, and I’m determined electric vehicles become the new normal for drivers. It’s good news there are now more charging locations than petrol stations, but the clear gaps in provision are disappointing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c360b6db88dd12f0f8eafa47bba9c28f98bf0c38/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=393fa324178e44eddef16bb0d0466dbf","title":"the guardians climate pledge 2019","story":"We want the  to play a leading role in reporting on the environmental catastrophe.

The only thing a gig in a cinema might lack is a moshpit for fans to squeeze into at the front. According to the award-winning filmmaker Anton Corbijn, one-off big-screen music events now come a close second to the live concert experience and have a growing value for both fans and musicians.“It is a real event, rather than seeing it on TV on your own at home. This is like a concert, and it is a more exclusive way to see a band that also brings people together,” Corbijn told the Observer this weekend, ahead of the worldwide cinematic event that is to launch his new Depeche Mode film later this month.The 90-minute film, Spirits in the Forest, is a concert documentary, but it is also a tribute to the band’s fervent international fans. It is this inclusive attitude that can make single-night music events work well for a cinema audience, Corbijn believes.“Of course, it is still fantastic to see a live concert, but not everyone can. And this is a way of getting some return on your money after a tour, now that fewer DVDs are being sold,” he said. “Nick Cave did it, Coldplay did it and Metallica have just done it, so it is a new way to make live concert films feel live again.”Corbijn, initially a noted photographer, won acclaim in 2007 for Control, his film drama about the troubled life of the late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis. Yet he is not tempted to return to looking at the backstage life of the stars, he said.“Control was such a one-off for me, and then suddenly everybody sent me scripts about other dead singers, like Jeff Buckley, Kurt Cobain and Marvin Gaye. I’ve worked with Depeche for decades now and they are different to any other band. In the late 80s, I realised my visuals and their sound go together really well. It all grew organically, with no big meetings or negotiations.”Corbijn, 64, also suspects that Depeche Mode’s fanbase is distinct from other bands’ because “they all feel they are members of a big club”.And the Dutch-born director’s treatment of their 115-date Global Spirit tour is appropriately centred on the fans’ experience. It focuses on the stories of six devoted followers of the band who have travelled from as far afield as Colombia and Mongolia for the gig at Berlin’s Waldbühne (Forest Stage) stadium.“It is amazing that Depeche Mode can touch so many people’s lives. These fans have very erse stories and erse cultures, so we set about a plan to film them in their own environments and then bring them all together for the concert,” said Corbijn.All six were inveterate Depeche Mode fans with moving personal stories. Five had already seen them play live but one, a young Mongolian tour guide, had never left her own country before.Corbijn suspects the band’s grip on the imagination of such a disparate group is down to the lyrics of guitarist Martin Gore’s songs. “The themes of Martin’s songs connect a lot with people who feel they need guidance, or perhaps a helping hand,” he said.The group, which came to fame in the electronic pop boom of the 1980s, has been through many style transformations but has somehow kept a strong emotional bond with fans. This, for Corbijn, makes Depeche Mode the perfect performers for a cinema event.“Depeche has something cult-like about them, so the concert experience is special,” said the director, who designs the stage sets and also works with U2. “Depeche put out an album every four years or so and have a tour, but that’s it. You don’t see them on chat shows. They are sort of reclusive. Other bands, like U2, don’t have quite that same cult feeling because they are very open and talk about everything.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c19124bba4f8626b98dad726086c8392c89d064f/0_1098_4375_2625/master/4375.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e570bf337808721fd3fecba558613517","title":"yotam ottolenghi recipes zero waste meal chicken soup matzo balls roast poached chicken roast stock vegetables","story":"A satisfying supper using only one set of ingredients to the fullest: start with chicken soup, then roast the stock vegetables, and finish by flash-roasting the poached chickenThe UK’s unsettling food waste statistics make me go into immediate chef mode.

Recently, however, I’ve found that using robust root vegetables and cutting them into large pieces is the way forward. They will still be quite soft, but if handled gently and roasted at a very high heat, they are really tasty. Serve these with the roast poached chicken in the following recipe to make a complete meal.Prep 5 minCook 35 minServes 4 as a side1.2kg boiled carrots, parsnips, onions and celeriac, reserved from the previous recipe 70ml olive oilSalt and black pepper2 tbsp capers, drained and roughly chopped1½ tsp grated lemon zest – reserve the zested lemon for the following recipe5g roughly chopped parsley leaves, left over from the previous recipe1 tbsp roughly chopped oregano leaves, left over from the previous recipe2½ tbsp red-wine vinegarHeat the oven to 250C fan (or to its highest setting). Spread out the reserved stock vegetables on a large oven tray lined with baking paper. Add two tablespoons of oil, half a teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper, and toss gently to coat. Roast for 25 minutes, or until nicely coloured, stirring once halfway.In a small bowl, mix the capers, lemon zest, parsley and oregano.To serve, transfer the vegetables to a platter and scatter over half the caper mixture. Drizzle the vinegar and remaining 40ml oil over everything, then serve with the remaining caper mixture alongside.Roasting the chicken after poaching it may seem unorthodox, but when cooked at a high heat and with the help of a little baking powder, it’ll get a wonderfully crisp skin. The whipped garlic was born out of a random experiment that ended up working surprisingly well. Serve this alongside the roast stock veg above to make a meal.1 large poached chicken, segmented into 2 legs, 2 breasts and 2 wings – left over from today’s first recipe¼ tsp baking powderFlaked sea salt and black pepper60ml olive oil3 heads cooked garlic – left over from today’s first recipe1 lemon (reserved from the previous recipe), halved - juice one half, to get ¾ tbsp, and cut the other into 2 wedges3 tbsp sunflower oilPat dry the pieces of chicken with kitchen paper and spread them out skin side up on an oven tray lined with greaseproof paper. Combine the baking powder and a teaspoon and a half of flaked salt, then sprinkle this all over the chicken skin. Leave to sit for 30 minutes, or refrigerate uncovered overnight if you’re getting ahead (in which case take it out of the fridge about 30 minutes before cooking). Meanwhile, heat the oven to its highest setting (or 250C fan). Drizzle two tablespoons of olive oil over the chicken skin, then roast the jointed bird for 15-20 minutes, or until browned and crisp.Meanwhile, make the whipped garlic by squeezing the garlic flesh out of the papery skins – you should have roughly 100g – then put in the small bowl of a food processor. Add half a teaspoon of flaked salt and the lemon juice, and blitz smooth. With the motor running, slowly drizzle in the sunflower oil and remaining two tablespoons of olive oil in a steady stream, until the mix is smooth and resembles a loose mayonnaise, then transfer to a small bowl.Arrange the roast chicken pieces on a platter, squeeze over the lemon wedges and serve with the whipped garlic for dipping."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a7e1464cc938ddee330f5c67c368c5840a5520c/0_0_3500_2333/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=12fd9aefaeb20cd0ea877714a51fe762","title":"bournemouth v manchester united premier league live","story":"Joshua King ended Bournemouth’s goal drought and United’s three-game winning run with a fine finish just before the break.An extremely content Eddie Howe speaks to BT Sport. “I thought it was a really good game. We were solid and competitive, we looked a real threat. We respected our opponents, but we got over the line. Another clean sheet as well. A great goal, and that would have meant a lot to Joshua King. We didn’t start too well, the first ten minutes, but once we settled we were fine in the game. It was always going to be a game of few chances, but we always looked as though we would score. And we looked quite secure. The two centre halves did really well, Ake and Cook are big players for us.”That’s three clean sheets in a row for Bournemouth, and so Nathan Ake is named man-of-the-match by Steve McManaman on BT Sport. “After ten minutes, we started to play really well,” he says. “We worked very hard for this win, and I think we deserved it. I am very happy with the clean sheet we got.”The match-winner Joshua King adds: “To get the winning goal is a good feeling. I focused on the goal, lobbed it over with my right foot. I didn’t know whether anyone was there, and hit it cleanly through De Gea’s legs. We know we can score goals, even though there’s been a dry spell.”United started strongly but lost their way midway through the first half and never got their mojo back. Bournemouth deserved their victory, earned by the one moment of true quality in the match, Joshua King’s flick, spin and shot just before the break. It was a finish Ole Gunnar Solskjaer would have been proud of himself, though doubtless he won’t appreciate it right now.United’s three-game winning run comes to an end on the south coast. Bournemouth beat them for only the third time in their history ... and move up to sixth in the Premier League as a result! They leapfrog United, who drop to eighth.90 min +2: Williams races down the left and shifts the ball inside for Lingard, who tries to work space to shoot just outside the Bournemouth box. Lerma closes the door.90 min +1: Fred has a pop from 20 yards, but it’s straight at Ramsdale.90 min: Callum Wilson is booked for his brazen attempt to win a free kick on the halfway line. Rightly or wrongly, the referee doesn’t buy it. There will be three minutes of bonus time. 89 min: King and Fraser take turns to dribble upfield, taking the ball as far away from their goal as possible. McTominay tries to return it, but his cross from the right is no good whatsoever. Not too much quality on show right now, but it’s good fun nonetheless. It’s tense at Dean Court!88 min: A poor defensive header skims off Rico’s head, and that’s a free corner for United out on the right. Maguire meets the set piece, but once again can’t get a header on target. Goal kick to Bournemouth, and they’re not rushing to take it.86 min: Lindelof crosses from the right. Maguire clanks a header wide left from six yards. His blushes are spared by the offside flag it wouldn’t have counted anyway. Then Bournemouth make a defensively minded change, replacing Harry Wilson with Lewis Cook.84 min: Now McTominay bashes a shot into Ramsdale’s arms from distance. United are finally showing some urgency. Should they equalise, Callum Wilson will rue latching onto a long pass that sprung United’s offside trap. He was offside, but dribbled goalwards anyway. Had he left it for King, Bournemouth were in.83 min: And it nearly pays instant idend, as Fred swings a ball in from the left. Rico loses it, and it drops to Greenwood, who slams a shot against the right-hand post from close range!81 min: Ole Gunnar Solskjaer makes his last throw of the dice. Wan-Bissaka and James are replaced by Williams and Greenwood. Lingard is handed a sheet of paper detailing United’s all-new formation. A furrowed brow. Everyone shifts around.79 min: Another corner for United, out on the left. Young loops it into the mixer, but Ramsdale punches miles clear with confidence. However the visitors are soon coming back at the hosts, and Young earns himself another corner, which he takes. Billing heads clear, then Callum Wilson purchases a cheap free kick by running into McTominay, who is waving his arms around in the semaphore style.78 min: Rashford and Lingard nearly one-two their way through the Bournemouth back line, but Cook clears just in time. “If Bournemouth are dressed like AC Milan,” begins fashion’s Peter Oh, “United look like Palermo-lite.”76 min: From the resulting corner, Callum Wilson heads harmlessly wide from close range. A poor miss, though it wouldn’t have counted anyway, as amid a rumble, McTominay had been illegally impeded.75 min: Callum Wilson tees up his namesake Harry on the edge of the United box. Harry drops a shoulder, shifts the ball towards the right-hand edge of the D, and fizzes a low shot towards the bottom corner. It’s going in, but fingertipped round the post by De Gea. What a save!73 min: Fraser has the chance to release King down the left but dawdles and is robbed. Then Fred sends a shot towards Plymouth. Not a high-quality moment.71 min: Lerma tries to thread a shot into the bottom right from an ambitious distance. It bobbles harmlessly wide, and De Gea had it covered in any case.70 min: Bournemouth half clear the corner, but United are soon coming back at them. Young tears down the left and hooks into the mixer. Ake heads clear, just in time, with Martial lurking. This is better from United, who have turned it up a notch. They needed to.69 min: Lindelof channels his inner Beckenbauer and strides forward with great purpose, nearly releasing Martial with a sliderule pass. Smith intervenes and hacks out for a corner on the left. 68 min: Harry Wilson looks to curl one into the top left, but gets it all wrong and it flies towards the top-left corner of the stand behind. Awful. Meanwhile United make their first change, replacing Pereira with Lingard.66 min: Lerma and Callum Wilson combine nicely down the inside-right channel. Wilson looks to lay off to Smith, rushing into the box to his right. Young tugs Smith back just before he enters the area. Young is booked for his cynicism, and he’ll miss the next match. Meanwhile this is a free kick just to the right of the D, and Harry Wilson really fancies it.64 min: A hectic moment or two. Billing hoicks a ball into the United box from the right. It drops, via a deflection, to Callum Wilson, but the striker can’t poke the ball past a star-jumping De Gea, who blocks. The ball breaks to Harry Wilson, who can’t steer it into the unguarded net. Pereira goes up the other end and has a whack. That’s blocked too. Then Lindelof is booked for clattering into the back of Harry Wilson in midfield. And breathe.62 min: Fraser slides into James. He comes in from the side, but with excessive force, and he’s late to boot. Into the book he goes.61 min: Martial nearly bustles his way past Ake, chasing a pass straight down the middle. Ake does very well to stand firm, just as it looks as though Martial might nip through, and hooks clear. That was a good battle.59 min: McTominay tries to take a quick free kick, and King cynically gets in the way. The referee’s in a good mood, because he stops short of booking the goalscorer for his sauce. Just a quiet word.57 min: Pereira has a dig from distance. Ramsdale turns the ball away from the bottom-left corner, a fine save. United then win a corner, which is wasted. A little bit better from the visitors, who haven’t really got going in this second half.55 min: Cook is booked for a wild slide through Rashford on the halfway line. That was needlessly aggressive, arguably out of control, and the Bournemouth defender can count himself lucky the referee didn’t brandish red. He’s fortunate Rashford had the wit to jump out of the road, because if his feet were planted that could have been very ugly.54 min: Pereira tries to release Martial down the inside left, but his ball skims off the wet surface and out for a goal kick. Martial had no chance of catching that. “Is this the same Man U that beat my team in Cup?” wonders Paul Sinclair. “Ole needs to stick to a system plus give Rashford and Martital more freedom.”53 min: Ramsdale shanks the ball out of play under pressure from Martial. United are gifted good field position, but do little with it, McTominay wafting a weak shot goalwards that’s easily charged down by Lerma.51 min: A better pass down the inside-right channel by Billing for Harry Wilson, and Bournemouth are in. But it’s behind Wilson, and the move putters out. United were light at the back there, and got away with one.50 min: United, so entertaining when playing at speed last week in Norwich, have slowed down to a crawl. They’re going nowhere. All very sluggish.49 min: Harry Wilson and Smith triangulate deliciously down the right. Wilson hooks long for Fraser, racing in from the other flank. Fraser leaps, shapes and guides a volley goalwards. It’s straight into De Gea’s midriff. A shame for the purists, because that would have been a picture-book goal.47 min: King races after a long ball down the left. He nearly gets the better of a leaden Lindelof, but the defender does just enough to guide the ball back to De Gea, who wallops clear.Bournemouth get the second half underway! No half-time changes ... although the weather’s a lot better. No rain. And everyone in nice new dry kit, too.Half-time reading. Get ready for the 3pm kick-offs with our match previews.That’s the end of Bournemouth’s goal drought, then. Appropriately enough, given the conditions. They trot off soaked to the bone, but feeling all warm inside.... so having said that, a moment of great quality! Smith dinks a cross into the United box from the right. King chests it down on the edge of the six-yard box with his back to goal and Wan-Bissaka right behind him. King dinks the ball over his own head, spins, leans back, and lashes past De Gea! What a fine finish! Although the collective defending by Wan-Bissaka, Lindelof and Maguire, statuesque to a man, wasn’t all that great.43 min: The wind is playing havoc. Ball control is at a premium right now. They should replace the TV commentary with a symphony for swanee whistle.41 min: The wind’s swirling about, and so is the ball. It doesn’t make for classic viewing.39 min: Pereira needlessly bundles Lerma to the ground, and it’s a free kick for Bournemouth out on the right. The free kick finds Harry Wilson on the edge of the box, but his fierce shot is well blocked by one of those ecru shirts.37 min: It’s all got a bit scrappy. So with nothing much going on, the home crowd give Martial pelters, accusing the forward of ing back there in the hope of winning a penalty. All pantomime stuff.35 min: It’s not much of a ruck, to be honest. Nobody throws hands. But the pushing and shoving earns both Lerma and Fred a yellow card. That’s earned Lerma a suspension. The resulting corner’s a non-event."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0da5fa38f499f6ba7ca9380a5c9ccb71343f23a/0_0_5000_3333/master/5000.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=07f8f87fc4b5e4376431b1ba5ffac328 700w","title":"blind date allegra charlie","story":"What were you hoping for?A fun time, good food and an interesting story.What did you talk about?The Bristol food scene, cooking, dentistry, his lawyering, how we are both sarcastic and the awkward situations it gets us into.

I won my first national championship when I was 12, and my second, in a different class, when I was 15. The following year I progressed to racing single-seater cars. It was a struggle. Motor sport is really expensive and my family didn’t have the money, but we managed to find some sponsorship.I had some successful years in the Formula BMW UK Championship and got nominated for the McLaren Autosport BRDC Young Driver of the Year award at the age of 19, which I went on to win. That was quite a turning point. The prize included a test drive in a McLaren F1 car. That first test went really well and I signed for the team as a test driver at the end of the year.In the early 2000s, test drivers did a lot of track testing. Nowadays, that’s quite limited. Access to the cars is difficult and the race drivers themselves want to track-test as much as possible. But, most years, I’ve been fortunate enough to drive the car for a couple of days at least. Most of my time at McLaren is spent driving the simulator in the team’s factory in Woking. In the short term, it’s about working on the car’s set-up for the next race. In the medium term, it’s working on developing the car through the season. And then there’s the long term, adapting the design of next year’s car within any new regulations that are coming in.I studied engineering at Cambridge, and have always been interested in the technical side. You get to see the developments and innovations first-hand – they all come through the simulator before the car is manufactured. Other test drivers are maybe less interested in this aspect. Perhaps my fascination for it is why I’ve been a test driver for 10 years I’m one of the longest-standing in Formula One.It’s important for a race driver to have someone they believe in. Every time a new driver comes in, they want to understand your role and to trust that you’re improving the car for them. And you need to understand what they want from the car. At each post-race debrief, we listen back to the drivers on their radios to hear their feedback.As a kid, racing in Formula One was obviously the dream. Being a test driver can be a route to one of the racing spots in a team – you always hope you have the chance to step up one day. But there are few opportunities. There are only 20 seats in a season – it’s a very tough environment. It won’t happen for me now.At the same time as testing for McLaren, though, I have been able to develop my career as a race driver. I’ve raced across many formulas, including Formula Three and GP2. I’ve also won the Le Mans 24-Hour race in the LMP2 class. I currently race in Formula E, the class that solely uses electric-powered cars, so I still carry a dream of becoming a world champion. McLaren have been very flexible in working around my racing schedule: they think it’s good for me to be race-sharp.I feel very proud to have made a career out of motor sport. Many of the guys I used to race didn’t even progress from karting. Even if I didn’t quite reach the pinnacle of Formula One, being a test driver for one of the top teams has been the next best thing.I didn’t start out understudying – I did a lot of ensemble stuff and had some lead roles. But the bigger the productions that I’ve worked on since, the more understudying work I’ve done. I was the understudy for the role of Hermione Granger, played by Noma Dumezweni, in Harry Potter And The Cursed Child for three and a half years. Over that time, I was Hermione on just eight occasions.I’ve just finished a run in a production of The Color Purple. I had a featured role as Darlene, but was also an understudy for the part of Shug Avery. I had an understudy for my featured role and so, if I needed to become Shug Avery, my understudy would step up. Having both a featured role and being an understudy in the same production is really common most understudies have responsibility elsewhere.Nobody becomes an actor to be an understudy. We’re all ambitious, but you have to be patient. A standard West End production will have eight shows a week, spread over either five or six days. We are required to be at the theatre for every performance – even if we’re just sitting in our dressing rooms. There are always ways to keep yourself busy and engaged off stage. During my time at Harry Potter, when not on stage in my ensemble role, I would regularly work on the script and the character of the role. I’d also watch the show from the wings to stay as connected as possible. If you need to go on, you need to be there.You might not have the same level of contact with your director as the principal actor, so you’ve got to be really on the ball. You always have to be at the point of emotional and physical preparedness, in order to go on at the drop of a hat. Your adrenaline levels are always high. You’ve got to keep sharp and stimulated, too – boredom can have a huge impact on you psychologically. I know people who study for degrees in their dressing room. In fact, I did my master’s in music while understudying.Do understudies get on with lead actors? Everyone is different sometimes personalities knit nicely together, other times they don’t. But generally speaking, a company of actors will endeavour to work well together for the good of the production. I’ve always been fortunate enough to work in that way.I’ll look back fondly on my understudy days, without a shadow of a doubt. Being an actor is not just about the role itself – it’s about the company, the project, the content. Understudying has taught me about self‑belief. You need to have a heck of a lot of it – and those lessons filter into the rest of your life.I started doing standup in the late 90s, in exactly the same way that every other comedian does – clubs, open spots, gigging all over the place. But I worked out early on that compering was something I could do, too. In 2004, there was a Channel 4 show, Kings Of Comedy, where standup comedians lived together in a Big Brother-style house. Every week they’d do a gig and the least good person would be evicted. Beforehand, the production team wanted to see how a comedy club worked and, because it was being made in Bristol, they came to see one of the nights I compered. When they started doing the live eviction show, hosted by Russell Brand, they asked me to do the warm-up.I did a few more warm-ups the following year, and then Deal Or No Deal started, which I did for more than 10 years. I now do a lot of shows. I’m the warm-up on Have I Got News For You, Vic \u0026amp Bob’s Big Night Out, The Last Leg, and loads more.The core task of warm-up is the same as standup: it’s communicating with people – making them comfortable, making them laugh. The job is a combination of standup, cabin crew and holiday camp redcoat. A lot of it is housekeeping, so I try to find the funniest way to do it. I have jokes about every element of the studio experience: health and safety, fire exits, mobile phones. I joke about getting a young person to turn off your mobile phone for you, about drug dealers and doctors having a night off, about teenagers struggling to go two hours without Instagram. There’s lots of admin. There’s getting the right shots for the director, and there’s making sure the audience aren’t worn out before the show begins. I sometimes need to slow them down, because I want them to still have energy in four-and-a-half hours’ time.With standup, the crowd has come to see you, or at least a night you are part of. With warm-up, you’re not an expected part of the evening – you’re an appendix or footnote. It’s not the place to experiment with quirky material – the warm-up has to fit with the tone of the show.If there’s a break in the recording, you have to plug the gap one skill I have is that I can just talk for ever. I’m happy discussing the perfect burger or the best biscuit or my favourite service station ad nauseam – I think I’m a naturally funny person. Once, on Never Mind The Buzzcocks, I was told I only needed to do five minutes, because everyone was ready, but the floor manager came up to me and said, “There’s a problem. Someone’s refusing to sign a contract.” And I was on for an hour.Lots of other people who do warm-up aren’t comics they may have come from cruise ships or holiday camps. There are a few standups on the circuit who do warm-up, but not many enjoy it, as the ego has to be left at the door.If I met someone at a party, I’d still describe myself as a standup. I’ve got a gig in Halifax later this week, sandwiched between doing Pointless today, The Great British Bake Off: An Extra Slice on Sunday and 8 Out Of 10 Cats Does Countdown on Monday. It’s a varied life and I’ve done warm-ups around the world: in Bangkok, Buenos Aires, Rio. It’s lovely to be a full-time comedian and I’m really well-paid. I’ve got standup friends who are now superstars – I used to live with both Russell Howard and Jon Richardson. But I’m very happy where I am. Whatever level you’re at in comedy, there’s always someone above you, so you have to find a place where you’re at ease. And I am considered one of the best at what I do, even though it’s quite niche. When Richard Osman introduces me to people, he says, “This is Mark Olver. He’s the best warm-up in the world.” I would never say that myself, but I’m glad that he does.I’ve been a goalkeeper since I started playing football at the age of five with the local boys’ team in Edinburgh. I joined Bristol City in the summer of 2018, but only turned professional this summer. Last season I was combining football with studying ancient history at university. But that went a bit sideways as I was spreading myself too thin, so I decided to leave uni and focus on football.I made two appearances for the first team last season: one in the Continental Tyres League Cup and one in the FA Cup. The Conti Cup game against Aston Villa was played in torrential rain. We were winning 4-0, but I slipped in the mud and they scored. Not a dream debut. But we won the FA Cup game 3-0, so it was relatively easy.During the week, I do the same training and gym sessions as the first-choice goalkeeper, Sophie Baggaley. The only difference is that, at the weekend, I’m on the bench and Sophie is on the pitch. I’m sitting down and she’s standing up.There’s a danger that, knowing the chances of actually playing on Sunday are low, you just go through the motions. You’ve got to motivate yourself. There could be an injury at any moment and you’d be in at the deep end. It’s hard to feel ready, and keep feeling ready, for something that’s probably not going to happen. It can be quite isolating. Outfield players can at least come on for five or 10 minutes at the end of the game, but with goalkeepers it’s all or nothing. It’s tough: it can make you feel as if you’re not part of the team.You can’t wish ill on the first-choice keeper though. I respect that Sophie’s better than me and we are great friends, despite us vying for the same spot. Maybe if you didn’t get on with the first-choice keeper, you’d go to the coach and shout about it: “Why am I not playing?”Because they don’t get game time, understudy goalkeepers have to show the best of themselves in training. That’s their audition. I don’t have to dislodge Sophie this year. At the end of my 12-month contract, it won’t be “Eartha’s not number one, so she’s out” it’s more that I have to be pushing myself and pushing Sophie – blurring the line between the number one and number two. The club want the best goalkeeper, regardless of who that is. It can be hard to maintain concentration and motivation to prove myself every day when, more than likely, at the end of the week I won’t be the one who’s playing. But if I decide to stop trying, I will be damaging Sophie’s chances of improving, too.This year will hopefully be the year I can really kick on. I have international ambitions, too. I’ve played for Scotland under-19s, and I want to play in the World Cup for the full side. A couple of years ago, I nearly lost both my legs. I got compartment syndrome. During a fairly routine operation for a health condition, there was a problem with oxygen flow getting to the muscles and they began to swell up and up. If not operated on in time, compartment syndrome results in the breakdown and death of your muscles. I had to sign a form giving the surgeons permission to amputate if the operation went wrong. I was a footballer and my life was in my legs. I had to have numerous surgeries to repair the injury and spent a good bit of time on crutches. Nearly losing the opportunity to play football changed my outlook. Even if I’m just sitting on the bench, I still think that’s a huge achievement.I went to art college. Everyone there pretends to be a painter or a sculptor, but it’s just a way of getting into bands. We described our band as punk-skiffle, a description we made up, because it fitted what we did: you played whatever instrument you were given or had found in a skip. We made a godawful racket. We were technically appalling, but we had the enthusiasm of youth.We were doing gigs around Leeds, but I had some friends who were in a band called Cud and they were doing a fair bit better they were gigging beyond Leeds and getting John Peel sessions. One day they had a gig in Preston and they were looking for someone to drive them. “Can you drive?” “Yes.” “Can you hire a van and drive us to Preston?” “Yes.” “We’ll give you £10 for it.” “Yes!”So a driving licence was the most important qualification I ever got. Then it became, “Can you set the amps up? Can you tune the guitars?” Cud started playing bigger gigs in bigger venues and you’d bump into other bands on the road. They’d say, “Oh, we need someone, too.” Before I knew it, it was a job.I’ve been working with Richard Hawley for about 12 years. Anywhere he has to plug in a guitar – including in-store shows or TV and radio appearances – I’ll be there. I can do a couple of weeks touring with him and then come back and get on with things in my workshop. We’re all of a certain age and we’ve all got kids and families. None of us are remotely interested in the one‑and-a-half-years-away-from-home thing.On tour, a big chunk of the day will be spent setting everything up on stage: amps, pedals and the like. Richard uses four amps and about 30 pedals. They surround him in a semi-circle – an arc of guitar noise. He also uses about 12 guitars per gig it’s virtually a guitar change with every song. Once the PA is set up, I tend to do a soundcheck by having a go on a couple of the guitars, making a bit of a racket and making sure all the pedals do what they should be doing. I need to make it sound the same as it did the night before – what I heard when I stood in the middle of that arc of noise 24 hours earlier.Through working with Richard, I ended up working with Duane Eddy, as his guitar tech when he comes to the UK. I’ve also worked with the Cure, Joe Strummer, Nick Cave And The Bad Seeds, Tindersticks and Embrace.If you’ve been in a band, you always regret packing it in. Life gets in the way and you have a mortgage to pay. But I couldn’t contemplate being able to do what Richard does: his skill as a songwriter, singer and guitarist is at such a level. Richard needs me, and I need him, but I don’t think he could do my job, and I certainly couldn’t do his. If something terrible happened and Richard couldn’t do a gig one night, but they decided to go ahead with me in his place, I think there’d be a lot of people asking for their money back.• If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine’s letters page in print, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6eb1baa6c5c252bd652fac04e94c3e2d9cb5d86b/0_635_3615_2167/master/3615.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d77c233b43ba034095b059ca1cdce69b","title":"how we live together sofa surfers","story":"I’ve developed a good instinct.

I dreamed of hothouses dripping in exotic blooms and joined the Orchid Society of Great Britain. Then I went to work in one of those hothouses, and those glamorous flowers suddenly seemed a little uptight, with all their demands and high humidity needs. Slowly but surely, orchids disappeared out of my life, until a couple of years ago when my neighbour gave me a moth orchid, Phalaenopsis x hybrid, when she was moving house. I thought it was a loan and then it turned into a gift, and just when my indifference was peaking, it flowered in great profusion.The name phalaenopsis is derived from the Ancient Greek for mothlike it is said that when the entomologist and botanist Carl Ludwig Blume first saw them dripping off a tree on the other side of a valley in south-east Asia, he thought they were moths fluttering in the wind. Even my overbred giant pink version still hints at this – that is, if you let it off the stick with hairclips that tethers every modern orchid. The blooms are never supposed to be upright but to gracefully flop and dance in the slightest breeze.Epiphytic orchids are the sort that grow clinging to trees and occasionally rocks (known as lithophytic) but never soil. Their alien roots, which creep like fingers out of the pot, glow white green and have specially adapted cells on the outside that allow the roots to absorb atmospheric moisture. In the wild they cling to bark to absorb rain run-off, sipping their nutrients from rotting leaf mould that catches in the cracks they inhabit.The reason mine flowered so prolifically is, in part, thanks to its perfect position: an east-facing window bathed in good winter light, which is essential for getting the plants to reflower.That, plus consistent watering, every week in the growing season, every other week during the winter. But I think the winning formula was feeding the plant. I use Lou’s Poo, dried alpaca poo that is a terrific fertiliser for houseplants. The tiny round “beans” are dehydrated so don’t smell you just feed each plant a few and let them slowly rot away.The other trick to reblooming is to not cut the whole flower spike off when the flowers finish. It takes such an effort to create those blooms that phalaenopsis often sends out a side branch of new flowers off the main stem just when it looks as if it’s dying back. If you snip it at the base, you’ll miss this."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/557117279917c4cd59e6f2a49a9f058fa3bac11a/324_1084_3433_2060/master/3433.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c2abf8b2e33fc646c1572ecc8ad504d4","title":"thurston moore i was a nerd and a dork at school","story":"The musician, 61, talks about hanging out in record stores, meeting his heroes and why he wants to write a 24-hour songI was not a cool guy at school.

That means these owners can’t sell up or switch to a cheaper mortgage.Stevenson owns a two-bedroom flat in an 18-floor private housing block in Barking, east London, and had wanted to sell to buy a three-bedroom property. An interesting quirk in her case is that Barclays was one of the banks that turned her down for a remortgage because of “issues with cladding and fire safety” – yet there is a Barclays branch on the ground floor of her building.Some might say that if the bank thinks the building is safe enough to let its employees work there, why won’t it touch her with a bargepole? However, that might be a little unfair on Barclays, as this is clearly an industry-wide issue.Stevenson, who has a 17-month-old son, bought her flat 10 years ago, and told  Money: “I’m trapped in terms of the future. I can’t sell unless it’s to a cash buyer.”Earlier this year, wanting a better mortgage deal, she approached several lenders. But she found many had changed their rules just in the last few months – for example, Santander updated its lending policy relating to buildings with cladding in May, while Barclays’ revised policy took effect in June.In each case, the valuation came back as “zero” until a specialist report was issued confirming the property meets the requirements of the current guidance from the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government. All the banks said this report had to be commissioned by her building manager and done by a suitably-qualified expert who is a member of one of an approved list of bodies.“The problem is, my building manager is reluctant to do such a report, and I cannot compel him to do so,” says Stevenson.But the situation is actually a lot more serious than that. In a briefing document, Arma, the leading trade body for residential leasehold management, said that “current demand for the services of suitably qualified experts is excessively high,” adding: “We are being advised this potentially means a wait of six to 12 months or more. It is deeply regrettable that this means, in some instances, owners may struggle to remortgage or sell their properties until this report is available.”Nick Morrey, product technical manager at mortgage broker John Charcol, says this is “a huge problem” and is creating thousands of “mortgage prisoners” who have very limited options.While her building’s outer skin is made of real solid brick, there are some small isolated single sheet aluminium panels, though this is not the aluminium composite material (ACM) cladding that helped spread the fire that claimed 72 lives at Grenfell. There is also some possibly combustible (but not flammable) insulation between the outer brick construction and the concrete inner frame.Valuers and lenders toughened up their criteria on high-rise blocks after the government issued what’s known as “advice note 14” relating to cladding in December 2018. However, low-rise apartment buildings were also dragged into all of this following a fire at a block in Barking in June, and another in Worcester Park in Sutton, south-west London, in September.In June the government issued an advice note on the risks relating to balconies, which resulted in things being tightened up even more.So what’s the advice for those affected?If remortgaging to another lender looks tricky, talk to your existing bank or building society and ask for a full list of products you can move to, says Morrey.Barclays confirmed the need for a written report in cases where a valuer identifies that a building’s external facade may contain potentially combustible materials. In a letter to Stevenson, it said that “we are not saying the building is unsafe or a fire risk as we are not qualified to make that assessment”.One bit of good news is that Fiona Haggett, head of valuations at Barclays Mortgages, has been working on a solution regarding buildings with cladding that has been put forward to chartered surveyor body Rics to implement as an industry-wide initiative. Rics has agreed to adopt Haggett’s certificate idea, which should make it much easier to identify buildings that are not impacted by all of this, and will hopefully open up the market for some flats, she says.Stevenson’s building manager, Block Management UK Ltd, told us: “Having facilitated many safety tests at sites we manage, we are sympathetic to all affected by lender requirements.

Tasker tapped out the post in her iPhone notes first and, 10 minutes later, found herself pressing share. “I went back in and edited it for five minutes and then sat poised, waiting for the comments.”Tasker has a public account, with more than 200,000 followers. The post wasn’t going to sit in an internet vacuum it would be seen by strangers, friends, the other parents at her daughter’s school. “This year I made over £200k,” she wrote, “mainly whilst sat at my kitchen table, drinking gin \u0026amp doing what I love… It’s all possible, friends.” Tasker knew there would be a reaction: “It was terrifying – I felt very vulnerable.” But she wanted people to know it was possible to make a very good living in her multi-hyphenate role of influencer, photographer and coach. “My parents didn’t know what I did,” she says. “There was no evidence that it was possible to do this well.”Despite the cynicism in some quarters about influencer culture, the response to her post was overwhelmingly positive. Tasker’s success story is the palatable kind: she’s a self-made northerner, who before going all-out on Instagram worked as a speech therapist in the NHS, earning £21,000 a year. She believes this coloured the response to her new, six-figure salary.“You can’t just say, ‘This is what I earn,’ and it be a neutral fact,” Tasker admits. “It has to be contextualised.” But despite all the raised-hands emojis in the comments, Tasker couldn’t sleep, knowing the post was sitting there. “I took it down two days later,” she says. “I felt like I’d had the conversations I needed to have. I didn’t want to feel like a target. It’s exposing in ways that I haven’t quite processed yet. The post felt bigger than me.”However, there are signs of a new openness, much of it led by personal revelations – from iniduals sharing their salaries, to money diaries going viral, to the rise of “debtstagrammers”, people who are happy to post their credit card bills to Instagram in the hope that their followers will make them accountable when it comes to paying back their debt. Even Lloyds bank’s latest TV ad campaign has featured family members having halting conversations about their finances, ending with the tagline: “It’s good to talk about money.”Tasker is not the only influencer to have revealed what she earns publicly. In May, the food writer and activist Jack Monroe disclosed her salary of £21,000 to a  journalist reporting on the squeamishness British people still feel about discussing what they earn. Earlier this year, fashion blogger Alex Stedman, AKA The Frugality, posted to her blog: “Money, it’s something we never have enough of, right?! But it’s also something, I believe, we’re not talking enough about.” Stedman started her blog, which champions affordable fashion and sustainability, because she “wanted to take away the stigma of not having tons of money”. She revealed that she currently pays herself a salary of £30,000 – the highest she’s ever earned.Legislation that in 2018 made it mandatory for all UK companies with more than 250 staff to publish their gender pay gap – the disparity between what male and female employees earn – has helped propel what was once private information into the public domain. Suddenly there was no denying that our reticence to talk about money was protecting unfair pay gaps and, in some cases, illegal discrimination. On 2018’s Equal Pay-Day (the day in the year that women effectively begin working for free), the Fawcett Society launched a campaign calling on people to “end the culture of pay secrecy” by “talking to your colleagues and asking what they earn”.Last month it was reported that Samira Ahmed, presenter of Newswatch, is taking the BBC to an employment tribunal over alleged unequal pay. It follows the high profile case of broadcaster Carrie Gracie, who in early 2018 resigned as the BBC’s China editor, citing gendered pay discrimination. She is passionate about why we need to get more comfortable with talking about money. “However difficult that first conversation might seem, you’ve got to have it,” she tells me. “It’s like gym work, isn’t it? You build muscle and you get stronger.” Gracie recently published a book on the subject, Equal: A Story Of Women, Men And Money. “One of the reasons I’ve written it is to say to women: ‘You really have to be vigilant.’ It is imperative for women to talk about this because, if they’re not careful, over their working life they could lose out on hundreds of thousands of pounds.”So how do you start a conversation about equal pay at work? “It’s obviously very important to start off in a friendly manner,” says Gracie, who ultimately won an apology and a payout from the BBC. “You need to be professional, businesslike, and show that you’re serious and take yourself seriously, but that doesn’t mean you have to be angry or emotional.” And if your emotions or nerves get the better of you? “If you emerge thinking, ‘Ugh, I wish I’d handled that better’, then don’t worry about it: you should be proud of yourself and know that you’ll get it better next time. It’s a learning journey.”In August 2019, Ben O’Brien, an illustrator with more than 15 years’ experience of making art for clients including the BBC, tweeted to his 25,000 followers: “Lame start to the week when I find out the job I was in line for (16 illustrations for one of the biggest smartphone brands with a major ad agency) was to be paid for with… a new phone worth £1k. No thanks mate.” The first time O’Brien had asked about the budget, his question was ignored. “I had no reason to be suspicious,” he says. “It’s a huge agency, so I presumed they were finalising details.” But a week away from starting the job, which O’Brien estimated would take a month working full-time to complete, he asked again. They replied: “No, the phone we sent you, that is the payment.” Frustrated, O’Brien aired his grievances on Twitter. “Although I have great clients, illustrators are often underpaid and undervalued,” he says. “By calling it out, I hope people will realise that it’s not OK to presume someone will work for no actual pay.”Another illustrator, Niki Groom, aka Miss Magpie, has founded a collective of illustrators who are open with each other about pay, allowing them to enter negotiations with clients knowing the market rate. She also took the step of posting her illustration earnings over the past 10 years online. Through beautifully rendered pie charts, she reveals that she went from earning just £160 from illustrating in 2012 to £59,548 in 2018. “If people think I’m showing off, then they have misunderstood,” says Groom. “I wanted people to know that it takes time to build earnings, but that it’s possible to make a living. It’s amazing how helpful a data point of one or two people can be to knowing your own worth. The most surprising thing is that even those who I’d have considered my competitors have been positive and thankful.”Once again, though, a shift does seem to be under way. On MoneySavingExpert’s Debt Free Wannabe forums, members display an almost cultish devotion to openly discussing money. Each contributor signs off their posts with the amount of debt they owe and their predicted debt-free date. While no substitute for formal, one-on-one advice, the platform is an opportunity to speak to someone who knows how it feels to be £15k in debt while earning the minimum wage. “The threads are non-judgmental places for people to swap their experiences, celebrate even the smallest of wins and, in some cases, save lives,” says Good.I speak to a woman called Anna (not her real name), who in March this year posted a list of her debts on Instagram. From a Next credit account to an American Express card, they totalled £25,438.11. She named the account @myfrugalyear and publicly announced her intention to be debt-free by March 2021. “It was a pretty rough moment, actually,” she says. “I felt like the protagonist of a 1990s debt consolidation advert, sitting head in hands at my kitchen table. I’d just had a really difficult conversation with the bank, as we were in an unarranged overdraft. They were asking when I would be out of it, and I had to say, ‘I don’t know. We were just paid last week and there is no money left.’ I realised in that moment: enough is enough. I knew I needed to sit down and add up all my debt.”The bank offered Anna an adviser, but she turned the offer down: “I didn’t want to be patronised or belittled in a meeting about my finances.” But if she couldn’t talk about it in a private room, why post it to Instagram? “I had always been influenced to spend by Instagram, and it felt like poetic justice to use it as a vehicle out of the situation,” she says. Anna is not the only one looking to social media for a way out: the hashtag #debtfreejourney has now been used half a million times on Instagram. For Anna, it’s working: in six months she’s paid off nearly £5,000 and has 20,000 new social media followers to hold her accountable. She’s also found that her relationship with Instagram has changed. “The illusion has been shattered,” she says. “I look at the interiors accounts I used to follow and think: what was so seductive about them? I look at my old feed and see it’s just pictures of stuff. Going public has forced me to be honest with myself.”The popularity of money diaries, where people document their outgoings, is another sign of the new openness about spending. ’s regular How I Spend It column, in which readers discuss their finances, has been running since January 2018 and has proved hugely popular with people who are curious about how others save or spend. For many would-be contributors, though, the sticking point is the need to declare their earnings. “Those willing to share their income details usually come from the public sector or are self-employed or on benefits,” says Patrick Collinson, editor of  Money. “If you are a nurse or teacher, then your salary details are already in a sense publicly available, as there are agreed scales.”On the website Refinery29, anonymous female social workers, accountants and paediatricians have broken down their spending in minute detail one writer included everything from their rent, to their New Year’s Eve cocaine bill, to paying their flatmate back £1 for a packet of crisps. Last month the BBC launched its own version, in which a 27-year-old wrote of her guilt over spending £1.50 on a can of tuna. The story went viral, with readers debating whether her frugality was commendable or depressing, and the woman, who wasn’t anonymous, found her spending trending on Twitter. “Money is a window into our society, so people enjoying the voyeurism of the series isn’t a surprise,” explains Gillian Orr, head of content at Refinery29. “Millennials came of age during the financial crash, so they have a different perspective on money to other generations. Whereas their parents kept conversations about finance behind closed doors, young people today are much more relaxed discussing this previously ‘sensitive’ issue with friends, partners and even strangers online.”A year after that Instagram post, I ask Sara Tasker if there have been any negative consequences of revealing her salary. “It’s been really positive – my friendships are definitely more honest,” she says. “I guess it’s slightly strange when I go out for dinner with my family, and my mum and dad will pay for my siblings and not me, but that’s also totally OK.”I ask Anna of @myfrugalyear how her friends reacted to her honesty. “They were surprised,” she says. “We’d put on a good act over the years, and no one realised quite how much debt we were in. Afterwards some friends revealed that they are in the same situation, and having that chat was such a relief – a bonding experience.” She adds that not every conversation has been that easy. “One friend who is sorted financially said, ‘Well, now I don’t feel I can talk to you about the house I’m buying.’ And in truth it does make me feel jealous. But at least we can work through those conversations together now, with a bit more empathy.”Honesty box: how to be straight about cash1 You might not be ready to chat openly, but don’t deceive yourself. Look at your bank account and be mindful when spending. No one should get to the end of the month saying, “I don’t know where all my money went.”2 Don’t just accept that you’re “rubbish with money”. As MoneySavingExpert’s Kirsty Good says, “It’s crucial a consumer can do the maths on a discount, or know how to split the bill with a friend – it stops them being ripped off.”3 Try to have casual chats about money with friends, colleagues and your partner – that way, when you have to talk about it in a high-stakes situation, you’ll have the vocabulary to advocate for yourself.4 Money is a topic for everyone, not just for rich people. There is no one who wouldn’t benefit from a conversation about it.5 Talk about how you’re paying for things, not just how much things cost. It’s a chance to educate each other about good and bad sources of credit.• Alex Holder is the author of Open Up: Why Talking About Money Will Change Your Life (Serpent’s Tail)If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine’s letters page in print, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b93aaf503195e820b2ae60639040d516385fde80/0_163_4332_2600/master/4332.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=34557e93407323c358026eef7b0f1640","title":"what temperature should i set my central heating","story":"My partner and I argue over whether we should turn it up or just put on another jumperEvery week a  Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next Saturday’s paper.Our annual heating battle has begun.

Aramco, the holder of Saudi Arabia’s oil reserves, is likely to come to the market with a price tag as high as $2 trillion.The kingdom is only selling a small portion of the company, but if it achieves anywhere near that price, Aramco will be valued at more than BP, Shell, Google, Walmart and Netflix combined.You don’t have to sign up to Extinction Rebellion to know that if we burn all the oil in Saudi Arabia’s vast reserves, we’re never going to tackle the climate emergency. Yet Aramco just recently agreed to spend $18bn to massively expand production at two of its oilfields.Putting aside – if you can – the murder of the Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, the croneyism of an autocratic state and the proxy wars – even on a cold-headed financial calculation, investing in Aramco could well be a dud.The era of oil is coming to an end. The Saudi Arabians are cute, flogging it off now, because although it may be the world’s most profitable company at present, it could be worthless within 50 years. At some point there is going to be a global switchover to electric cars. Offshore windfarms, we’re told, can provide more electricity than the world needs. Aramco’s vast reserves will be left in the ground, and we’ll all be quoting Ozymandias: “Round the decay Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare The lone and level sands stretch far away.”Yet the way our asset management industry runs, virtually every company employee with a pension scheme will, over the coming months and years, see it stuffed with Aramco shares – whether they like it or not.It’s partly the fault of indexing. Much of our company pension money now goes straight into global index funds, which can’t help but buy into Aramco to fulfil their mandate of matching moves in stock market indices. But even when pension activists try to stop their money going into fossil fuels, they are usually stumped.Greta Thunberg sails the Atlantic, speaks to the UN and inspires a whole generation. Climate activists take direct action in cities across the world. But they are no match for the stonewalling, evasiveness and sheer truculence of the fund managers who could have the most immediate effect on the world’s biggest polluting companies.Classical economics says that as shareholder-owners we can tell the boards of these companies what to do – from cutting pollution and carbon emissions to setting caps on runaway executive pay. And we can choose to buy or sell out whenever we like.Like hell we can. Currently there are almost no company pension schemes in Britain that allow the employee to stop their money going into fossil fuel extraction. It’s also virtually impossible to get fund managers to use their votes to take even the mildest steps towards fighting climate change or voting down excessive corporate pay.One group, which represents hundreds of UK company trustees with ownership of around £750bn worth of shares, contacted me this week with its deep, deep frustration at being able to effect any change, despite nominally owning vast amounts of shares.The group, the Association of Member Nominated Trustees, a few years ago set out its Red Lines when it came to voting. None of them is especially radical. They ask that fund managers vote against pay levels that are more than 100 times the UK’s average wage, and if they don’t, to report back to shareholders why not. Given the UK’s average wage is around £29,000, that limits chief executive pay to just shy of £3m.On climate change, it doesn’t ask for estment. It just asks that if a company has failed to introduce an emissions reduction target, and is failing to take action to stop the planet warming by 2C, then the fund manager must vote against the re-election of the chair of the environmental sustainability committee of the offending company.Yet even these mild measures are usually blocked. When the AMNT surveyed fund managers, it found half did not even have a climate change voting policy. Aramco will hardly be quaking in its boots. Instead, the attention of Wall Street and London’s bankers will be on the $450m fees bonanza the Saudi government will shell out to get Aramco launched on global markets.Many people will regard it as hypocritical to est from fossil fuels when so many of us drive cars and fly off on holidays. Maybe they also think corporate pay packets are just the going rate for the job. But for those who think otherwise, there’s a need to have bolder, simpler and more accessible ways to opt out of investing in the likes of Aramco if they wish. It is their money, after all.One final word of caution. Back in 2000, tobacco companies looked like history as cigarette bans took hold in western countries. Yet in the following decade, British American Tobacco was the very best performer on the London Stock Exchange, with its shares soaring and idends gushing. It was morally and ethically right to est from tobacco, but not (at first) financially. The same may well be said about Aramco."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f87abf12cf864e1eb5ef1ed2a9d172a7cf9ea76a/0_2_3527_2116/master/3527.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fdeca2841b351c3e78fd4a13e1100c40","title":"charli xcx birmingham o2 institute","story":"Charli XCX is a fascinating study in self-belief. Backlit, she strikes an attitude in front of an illuminated cube, bookended by more lighting. There is no band: just her, dressed a bit like a flamenco aerobics instructor. A gauzy train streams behind her, which she regularly whips for emphasis when she’s not pummelling the air with her fists.She cuts even more of a solitary figure because her last album, third outing Charli, contained multitudes. There were so many guest features, you suspected the artist born Charlotte Aitchison in Cambridgeshire 27 years ago was trying to make an ironic point about the current rash of pop hook-ups – a predilection acquired from hip-hop. That, or she was just revelling in excess, a familiar habit for an artist for whom the party never seems to end.There are 15 guests on Charli. None of them are in Birmingham, but all are thanked in a recorded message at the start of the gig. It’s worth listing them in full for the breadth of styles they encompass: French visionary Christine and the Queens, Los Angeles pop outrider Sky Ferreira, positivity powerhouse Lizzo, soft rock auteurs Haim, out pop pin-up Troye Sivan, trans electropop singer Kim Petras, Estonian mischief-maker Tommy Cash, bedroom-pop arriviste Clairo, Korean-American electronic producer Yaeji, New Orleans bounce star Big Freedia, rapper Cupcakke, sex-obsessed singer-rapper Brooke Candy and Brazilian rapper Pabllo Vittar. Aitchison also thanks AG Cook, who produced Charli with her.So: how do you tour one of the most populous albums of 2019, a work not explicitly, but still quite clearly about female solidarity and LGBTQ+ acceptance, without the album’s unique selling point – a posse? By having the brass neck to do it entirely solo. Aitchison plays the new album virtually in its entirety, with only volume and charisma to accompany her.She does have some company towards the end, though. Each stop on this jaunt has featured a handful of local drag queens, who cavort around the stage for Shake It, one of the album’s strangest, most deconstructed noise experiments.It has taken Aitchison some time to distil her essence. Her canon contains bona fide hits (some, like 2014’s Boom Clap, now retired), many standalone singles (like 2018’s near-perfect Boys, played tonight), umpteen co-writes, a few EPs (2017’s Vroom Vroom marked a turning point), a handful of mixtapes and two previous studio albums.But Charli marks peak Aitchison – an album of resonant, sad bangers that gives both Robyn and Mark Ronson a run for their money, and which ranks up there with Lana Del Rey in chronicling a version of LA, one where car engines and loud parties and “blue and yellow pills” can’t quite drown out the whirl of the abyss inside.Aitchison makes a little speech about this being the music she has always wanted to make, and although the onstage effusions of pop stars can become wearing with repetition, this one rings true. She began her career as a home counties teen prodigy who decamped to LA and spent years wrangling with the pop sausage machine, eventually emerging with artistic control and rekindled success on her own terms. She sings with a British accent. Sigrid wrote Don’t Kill My Vibe about being pushed around by older male operatives Aitchison has been fighting that corner for years, bristling since 2013’s True Romance.She has written for others, hiding behind the scenes. Most lately, she has turned to A\u0026ampR. A Netflix series begins in mid-November, charting the progress of Nasty Cherry, a girl band Aitchison has convened. It remains to be seen whether her Monkees succeed, but for now, she’s swapped opening for Taylor Swift in stadiums for making small venues rattle to the sound of a bonsai version of an arena show.The song Next Level Charli finds Aitchison ramping up the celebrations. “Turn up the volume in your Prius,” she yells, with a wink, interpolating the “vroom vrooms” from Vroom Vroom, a tune that later makes its own gloriously cacophonous appearance: “Let’s ride!” it goes.In its infancy, pop was all about cars and girls (as a Prefab Sprout hit once satirised the work of Bruce Springsteen). Aitchison’s pop is largely about cars and boys, a tendency that reaches an apotheosis of sorts on White Mercedes. It starts minimally, with her vocals front and centre they gradually warp and bend with effects. The chorus is pure pop schmaltz (“Like a white Mercedes, always been running too fast”) but it finds her apologising to a lover she has wronged.Aitchison is not one for highfalutin theory. Her work is very direct: (“I don’t care!” yelled her first hit, given to Icona Pop, “I love it!” It comes in the encore). But she is an avant gardist’s dream, taking all the ingredients of pappy mainstream chart-filler – nagging melody, partying beats, R\u0026ampB excess, youthful lust, EDM drama and soggy heartbreak – to the very edge of what a pop audience can aurally bear. The saccharine insistence of J-pop looms large, as do cheerleader chants. When Aitchison connected with a cadre of London leftfield producers like Sophie and AG Cook, working as the label PC Music (PVC music would have been a better name, given their productions all sounded like lurex rubbing against polyvinyl chloride), two disruptive imperatives chimed.Sometimes, this set suggests Dua Lipa remixed by Aphex Twin – or, on the gustier ballads, Bonnie Raitt produced by the Crazy Frog. Vroom Vroom (which was co-produced by Sophie) remains all futurism and onomatopoeia and sonic aggro. Click is functionally a hip-hop cut, made up entirely of posturing and digital shock and awe.Aitchison seems to be made entirely of swagger – every whipcrack beat gets a kick or a slap – but simultaneously, she owns up to self-doubt, mistakes, and regrets, capturing the grand drama of love going wrong. The tunes ring out of the cacophony. Gone – sans Christine and the Queens – casts her as an unexpected introvert hating “all these people”, but this anti-party anthem still manages to sound huge. Strafed with screes of sound, Silver Cross builds and builds but – crucially – never peaks, withholding the satisfaction of a conventional EDM-pop bass drop, or much in the way of resolution. It just ratchets upwards and plateaus, leaving you wanting more of its lurid neon oversaturation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/607b0518c59a4994a73e89f94d66496e794a3e2c/0_51_800_480/master/800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=58abee6748898bf11f24fedf9cb8fb24","title":"one to watch working mens club band teeth","story":"With nods to the Fall and Soft Cell, the urgent Yorkshire indie band like confusing people, and badmouthing Andrew NeilWorking men’s clubs in West Yorkshire didn’t used to be full of teenagers.

It’s about information. I want to emphasise I’m not about to explain what’s in the report, I’m not allowed to and I wouldn’t dream of doing so.“But the report is informative and people are entitled to information, and it seems to us that this report is germane because we do know, and I think it is widely accepted, that the Russians have sought to interfere in other countries’ democratic processes in the past.”The House of Commons was previously told the report was sent to the prime minister on 17 October.The business secretary, Andrea Leadsom, said there was nothing unusual about the report not being published.She told the Today programme she did not know why the report’s publication had been delayed and said: “I wouldn’t accept that it’s been held up. I don’t think there’s anything unusual about this.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d82e297caafb0a1c9f24979f63f12659c77ed16/0_0_6585_3951/master/6585.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e403baf36c9f012920c6fef597d86be","title":"labour mp gloria de piero urges women to change parliament","story":"She is standing down at the election but calls on others to come and take her placeGloria De Piero, who is stepping down after nine years as a Labour MP, is urging women to “come into parliament and change it,” despite the proliferation of threats and abuse faced by many female MPs.One of 58 MPs who have announced that they will not be standing in the 12 December general election, De Piero, who represents Ashfield in Nottinghamshire, said she hoped women would not be deterred from entering frontline politics.“I would still say to anybody who wants to change the country - it does have strains and stresses, but I wouldn’t have not done this for the bloody world.”She added: “It’s not great at the moment: but come into parliament and change it. All that progress that we’ve made in getting women there: we can’t go back on that.”Several of the women who are stepping down from parliament, including the former Conservative Heidi Allen, have cited the toxic political debate in explaining their reasons for quitting Westminster.And the independent MP Anna Soubry has detailed a string of threats, most recently including a card posted through the door of her partner.De Piero said that she had taken security precautions, on the advice of the police and parliamentary authorities.“My mailbox is bombproof: there was a letterbox in my door, and it’s probably sensible that I don’t have that any more. I have an external mailbox, that’s bombproof. And I have good locks on my door, fitted by the parliamentary authorities.“I’ve got a panic button as well, in my house – but I’m OK,” she adds. She also doesn’t publicise in advance where she is going to be, in accordance with police advice – and admits she does feel nervous before going out door-knocking.“Before every one of my canvass sessions, because I’ve seen it on social media I think, ‘Oh God, am I going to be OK?’. Because I canvass a lot. But touch wood, it’s always been OK on the doorstep.”“I haven’t spoken to all these women, I’m sure there will be different reasons why they’re standing down,” she says. “It’s worth exploring that to find out. But at this stage, I still want to say to women out there – do this, you will never regret it.”And she points to the “great solidarity” among women MPs. “My female friends, Vicky Foxcroft, Stephanie Peacock, Louise Haigh - you will make friends in there that will support you through the tough times. Your women colleagues, you put your arms round each other, and you’re there for each other.”De Piero cites harrying the government into implementing equal pay audits as Ed Miliband’s shadow women’s minister – under legislation passed by Labour but set aside by the coalition – as an example of the difference even opposition MPs can make.“You can change the law,” she adds, pointing to the case of a woman constituent who had been a victim of domestic violence.“A woman came to see me about a year ago. She had some scars, she said ‘my husband is serving time for attempting to kill me, he is in prison, he is now entitled, as part of the orce, to half the house’”.“I didn’t know that – and I went to see the minister, and nobody seemed to know it. So I’ve been working on amendments to the domestic violence bill to remove the automatic presumption of joint assets.”“I just hope my colleagues will continue that work when they come back. But it’s things like that: you can’t learn that from any book.”As a former broadcast journalist who grew up in a working-class family, De Piero says encounters like this have changed her political perspective dramatically.“You leave Bradford, you go to university, and you’re not conscious of this along the way, but you’re getting a bit more liberal. Then you go into the London media: and before you know it, you are pushing some very, very predictable lines. Which you think are original, but actually everybody in your bubble thinks those things.“And I just felt, when I came to do this job and I started knocking on doors in 2010 I was like, ‘shit, this conversation is totally different’. I thought the world had changed, on my little journey from Bradford to London, and it hadn’t: I had changed.”She warns there are still too few MPs from backgrounds like hers who make it to Westminster – or even consider it. “Speaking from the working class is as important as speaking for the working class. That’s why I have talked about my background: not because it is a badge of honour, obviously it is miserable to grow up in child poverty. I just think the more people know that there are people in there who weren’t born with a silver spoon in their mouth, the better.”She was one of the 19 Labour MPs who took the controversial decision to vote for Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal at its first parliamentary stage last month – hoping, she said at the time, to amend it: a process that was brought to a halt when the general election was called.That decision came from the feeling that voters in constituencies like hers should have their voices heard, she says – but she has been taken aback by the toxic tone of the debate, in Westminster, on social media, and in her inbox.“We get emails - saying that you’re a traitor. Because of course the weird thing is – and this is what illustrates the gulf over Brexit more than anything – is that up here they think I’m trying to stop Brexit. Down there, I go down and they think that I’m bloody Nigel Farage, some of my colleagues, to put it bluntly.”De Piero had always intended to step down after 10 years, she says – or as it has turned out, nine, all of them on the backbenches, and the last three dominated by Brexit.As she prepares to leave the House of Commons for the last time, she now wonders whether she did the right thing in not backing Theresa May’s deal.“What do I ever regret? Not voting for Theresa May’s deal? I think about it a lot.” May’s deal, unlike Johnson’s, would have underpinned EU standards on workers’ rights in law – and while it didn’t include a customs union, it needn’t have precluded a future government from negotiating one. “I’ll never know whether I did the right thing there, but I know I ask myself a lot,” she says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba7f5254bddf39ed836c205d9a437aa7e9606c52/239_203_3181_1910/master/3181.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb8f2a669b435a2c6c87c7b26f91d928","title":"england south africa fans preview world cup final","story":"The two sets of supporters are ready for the Rugby World Cup final on Saturday – when they will both be on the bacon butties“I’ve been supporting England since I was 11 and remember cheering the World Cup win in 2003. I’m optimistic it will happen again on Saturday, when I’ll be up at the crack of dawn to drive to Surrey to watch the game with my dad as per our tradition. I couldn’t think of anyone better to watch it with – he’s so invested in England rugby matches that he’ll yell, curse and roar. His enthusiasm is infectious sometimes I’m louder than he is! My mum isn’t a rugby fan, but she’s always brilliant – supplying us with sausage sandwiches and putting up with our swearing.England need to maintain the brilliant form they showed against Australia and New Zealand. Both teams are going to go for broke and we need to be careful not to lapse into some of the sloppiness we’ve been prone to in the past. But Eddie Jones and his team are surely on the case, so I’m not too worried. Lucy Eldridge, 27, Oxford“I went to Japan for one of the England games and was blown away by the hospitality of the people. The Japanese were hi-fiving me in the streets because I was wearing an England jersey. The only low was the typhoon. I was in Tokyo as it approached and could feel the dread in the air. On Saturday, I’ll be watching at home with my rugby teammates and some close friends, wearing an England jersey with a Japanese beer in hand. Elliot Daly and Billy Vunipola are due a stormer. I hope this is the game in which they cement their names in English rugby history. Aravin Kumar, 26, Singapore“I’ve been getting up early on Saturdays to watch the rugby with my dad at our rugby club with bacon sandwiches and hot chocolate. Last Saturday we had a whole day of rugby. We watched the finals then went to Harlequins because my team Haywards Heath Under 10s were doing a guard of honour thing at the Stoop. I’ve enjoyed watching all of it and on Saturday, my teammates and I will be watching the game at our club on the big screen. My advice to the England team is to tackle hard, run fast and score lots of tries. Rosa McDonald, nine, Haywards HeathIt was been a thrilling experience. My family and I found a South African-run pub, the Percy Arms in Chilworth, which draws a large crowd of South Africans. I find watching the game at a pub with lots of fans makes it all the more enjoyable and exciting. You feed off the energy of other supporters. South Africa’s first game was a disappointing loss and left me feeling surprisingly low (still hopeful, however) but I love how rugby elicits such strong emotions. No matter what the score, it brings everyone together – even opposing sides!We’ll be watching the final with a number of fellow South Africans at the pub, bacon butty and beer in hand. South Africa really needs this win. With our first black captain and the most culturally erse team we’ve ever had, South Africans everywhere could use this to unite as a nation. This would go far in blurring racial lines that still form a ide in our country. England have done so well this World Cup. If they win, they will truly deserve it, but we won’t go down without a serious fight.If South Africa are to win, we need to focus on keeping our strong defence lines intact. England are a strong team and are going to make this a tough game. We need to keep as much possession as possible and ensure we don’t drop the ball – in all senses of the word. Shannon O’Farrell, a South Africa fan in GuildfordIt’s been a very exciting World Cup. I’m so glad for Japan. It’s going to be one cracker of a game on Saturday. Both teams are so strong physically. I can’t wait for the final. I’m having a braai (barbecue) at my brother’s house next to the swimming pool and a big TV outside. All four of my brothers will be there and we will be going big with outfits and flags, all the necessary stuff. We will open the first can of beer at 9am, two hours before kick-off. The Springboks need to play wisely with their physicality and dominate England up front. The rest will fall in place. Enjoy the game. May the best team win. Anton Wessels, Johannesburg“I’m very excited about how South Africa have progressed. The low was losing to New Zealand after camping in their half for 20 minutes and only getting three points for their efforts. On a high happy, they made the final and were made to work hard for it by Wales which has prepared them for the final.The difference between teams is basically nothing but England may have peaked a week too early. We have not seen the best of this South Africa team. If they click on Saturday, England are in for a torrid time.I shall be watching with my brother as I can scream at his house as his wife is a Springbok supporter. South Africa will have to play it in the forwards with their power and domination of being very physical and in England’s faces. Their backs can also be devastating, especially Makazole Mapimpi and Cheslin Kolbe. If given the chance, Damian De Alande and Pollard can be dangerous. They must just stay calm and focused.” David Lichtenstein, South Africa"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c6393ee2b011a4651e213ef79d79f46c4333aa0/0_100_3736_2241/master/3736.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=139347e2dc26ad50e542f5f563584944","title":"england south africa rugby world cup final match report","story":"In the end it appeared to be written in the stars. Every 12 years South Africa have an unerring habit of winning Rugby World Cups and they have done it again, following up their triumphs of 1995 and 2007 with another prodigious display of power and might. The image of Siya Kolisi, the first black captain to collect the Webb Ellis Cup, raising the trophy is set to become as treasured as any picture in Springbok history.In truth they had a crestfallen England exactly where they wanted them long before two last quarter tries from the wingers Makazole Mapimpi and Cheslin Kolbe settled a wincingly physical contest. Under massive scrum pressure and lacking the accuracy and front-foot dynamism that characterised their stunning semi-final win against New Zealand, there were only fleeting moments when England looked in with a chance of emulating Martin Johnson’s champions of 2003.Eddie Jones’s side could have no complaints, even if the final margin was a touch lopsided. South Africa fully deserved to become only the second country after the All Blacks to win three World Cups and, propelled by a dominant pack and 22 points from their fly-half Handré Pollard, they now also have the distinction of being the first side to win a World Cup having lost a pool game en route.Those predicting a comfortable English win were guilty of overlooking South Africa’s proud World Cup heritage. They had never previously fallen at the final hurdle or even conceded a try in either of their two previous finals, though neither triumph involved them registering a try themselves. None of their tight forwards looked in the mood to take a backward step and their bench was similarly locked and loaded.It made for a predictably physical contest on a cool, windless evening and England made an inauspicious start. Inside the opening three minutes they gave away a ruck penalty which Pollard narrowly put wide before Kyle Sinckler collided with the elbow of Mapimpi and was knocked cold, necessitating a lengthy stoppage. He was eventually able to walk off the field having waved away the stretcher cart but there was no question of him returning to the fray.Barely had his replacement Dan Cole jogged on than England’s scrum was being shunted backwards, conceding another penalty advantage. South Africa, a touch surprisingly, decided to keep playing and, with Willie le Roux posing an early threat, England’s defence had to work extremely hard to keep them out. When the Boks did eventually take the lead through a simple Pollard penalty in the 10th minute, after Owen Farrell had been pinged for not releasing in front of his own posts, it was fully deserved.A brief lull followed from an English perspective, with South Africa slightly unluckily penalised after Pollard juggled a high ball and the subsequent catcher Pieter-Steph du Toit was adjudged offside. During the subsequent spell of English pressure, the Boks lost not one but two of their tight five injured and Farrell, after another lengthy delay, chipped over an equalising penalty.England, though, were still looking nowhere near as accurate as they had against the All Blacks. A botched restart collection gave South Africa more decent field position and further scrum pressure allowed Pollard to restore his side’s advantage. It took a big tackle from Sam Underhill on Du Toit to wrest back the momentum once again but, despite a prolonged period of advantage close to the Bok line, England ultimately had to settle for another close-range Farrell penalty.Again it provided only temporary respite. Mapimpi robbed Elliot Daly in the air and, with England again clinging on illegally on the floor, Pollard made it 9-6. Jones’s team would definitely have settled for a three-point half-time deficit but another punishing scrum prompted Jérôme Garcès to extend his arm again and Pollard was wheeling away back towards the tunnel even before his fourth penalty had sailed through the uprights.Suddenly South Africa’s formidable record against European opposition in World Cups began to loom ominously large. What could possibly turn the tide? The organisers opted for John Denver’s Take Me Home, Country Roads which, for a moment, completely changed the vibe in the stadium. It felt almost like a heartfelt farewell appreciation to the tournament itself and 70,000 spectators, some of whom have been away for weeks, were suddenly united as one.England, though, needed to break the spell out where it really mattered. If they imagined they had spotted a glimmer of hope when their chief tormentor, Tendai Mtawarira, and his fellow prop Frans Malherbe were replaced just three minutes into the second half, it turned out to be the ominous headlights of another onrushing train. Steven Kitshoff and Vincent Koch would make the starting lineup of most teams in the world and yet another scrum penalty allowed Pollard to make it 15-6.Bringing on Joe Marler for Mako Vunipola was, in the circumstances, a no-brainer and the Harlequins loosehead swiftly made his presence felt. For the first time in the game it was the Springboks who found the ground disappearing beneath their feet and Farrell drilled home a 46-metre kick which ranked among the most weighty of his career.It galvanised his side just when all had seemed lost. Pollard, attempting to jink his way out of defence, was tap-tackled by Anthony Watson and, with England swarming over the top of him, was penalised for not releasing. Farrell’s kick, though, was fractionally adrift this time and with it went England’s best hope. The rest was a green and gold dream, Lukhanyo Am unselfishly putting Mapimpi over and Kolbe leaving Farrell sprawling down the right touchline to complete the rout.The dramatic final act was typical of a tournament that seldom disappointed. From the hot springs of Beppu to the backstreets of Tokyo there has been something for everyone, entirely justifying the decision to stage the event in Asia for the first time. Japan have been exceptional hosts, exceeding expectations on a consistent basis on and off the field. Even for England’s disappointed players the memories will last a lifetime."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7fe2a390a62f9a0637f50c65390d73c9d02dacaf/825_0_2675_1605/master/2675.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=707080fa581e91d9eac945ee8950539d","title":"mood among england rugby world cup fans as miserable as the weather","story":"South Africa’s emphatic victory in the Rugby World Cup final leaves supporters flatEngland rugby fans were left as miserable as the weather after their team’s defeat to South Africa in the Rugby World Cup final in Japan, a repeat of their heartache after the Springboks’ victory in the 2007 final.Supporters filled pubs up and down the country or the 9am kick-off, tucking into sausage rolls and pints of Guinness.The British Beer and Pub Association had predicted that 1m extra pints would be sold throughout Saturday if England were victorious.But in keeping with the wet and windy weather across parts of the UK, the game turned into a damp squib as South Africa’s swept to victory 32-12.Handre Pollard’s penalties and late tries from Makazole Mapimpi and Cheslin Kolbe made the difference, leaving England’s dreams of lifting the trophy in shreds.The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, wrote: “Commiserations to englandrugby. It wasn’t to be today but you’ve done us proud throughout this World Cup.”Sadiq Khan, the London mayor, posted: “Thank you englandrugby for a terrific, thrilling tournament. You did us proud!”Harpenden Rugby Club in St Albans, where three of the World Cup team – captain Owen Farrell, Maro Itoje and George Ford – trained, screened the game for around 350 fans.Tom Stagg, a fly-half for Harpenden, told PA: “What can I say about this day that hasn’t been already said about my grandma’s funeral? It’s sad, it’s depressing and it’s going to end with a few beers.“We have four ex-players from the club in the final, to lose is obviously very disappointing but it has been such a great trip and it has been awesome.”Paul Wylie, 57, of Sevenoaks, said South Africa had been “strong and brutal”.“I was worried that we peaked last week because it was a massive thing to beat New Zealand,” he said.“Their game today was too strong for us. They set their stall out and played a much tougher game. Getting to the final is a massive achievement in itself.”Other fans had come out for the first time to see how England fared in the final, but left disappointed.Thomas Bishop, 30, said: “I was expecting England to do better and they underperformed if anything.”Dominic Maher, 34, added: “It’s the final and I just came out for the atmosphere but England massively underperformed. They had a lot of spirit in the first half but in the second half it went downhill rapidly.”Those watching belted out songs including Swing Low Sweet Chariot and Rugby’s Coming Home, an anthem synonymous with last year’s football World Cup which adapted after England’s emphatic win over New Zealand in the semi-final, which had raised expectations for Saturday’s finale.Crewe \u0026amp Nantwich RUFC in Cheshire, where the England flanker Tom Curry and his twin brother Ben played until they were 16 – , also screened the match.The vice-chairman, Andy Pemberton, who helped to coach the twins during their time at the club, said: “To see one of your guys walking out, knowing he’s played at the pitches here at Crewe \u0026amp Nantwich, is something special. The chest puffs out.“You see him belting out the national anthem and it brings a tear to your eye.” Some supporters created Tom Curry masks.In the Warwickshire town of Rugby, which gave its name to the game, the landlord of the Merchant Inn, James Reeve, opened up early but is now faced with the prospect of England fans drowning their sorrows for the rest of the day.Thousands of England supporters had travelled the 6,000 miles to Yokohama this week, some in search of tickets for which they were willing to pay thousands of pounds. Prince Harry and Japan’s Crown Prince Akishino.The prince did not, however, turn out to be a good luck charm for Eddie Jones’ side, which was hoping to repeat England’s 2003 triumph against Australia which turned Martin Johnson, Sir Clive Woodward and Jonny Wilkinson into sporting legends.ITV’s coverage of the final was expected to attract a record television audience for a rugby match. The semi-final against the All Blacks peaked at 10 million viewers, almost three-quarters of the overall TV audience."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01f1476a814f01c4d6628782758dc7d91aa4d387/0_273_3171_1902/master/3171.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=32a010db452136097af86c794ec498d6","title":"ashleigh barty v karolina pliskova wta finals semi final live","story":"Third set: Ashleigh Barty 4-6 6-2 5-2* Karolina Pliskova: It’s all getting a bit much for Pliskova now and she gets a warning for racquet abuse. Barty senses the kill and holds to love. After an hour and 44 minutes, she needs one more game to reach the final.Third set: Ashleigh Barty 4-6 6-2 *4-2 Karolina Pliskova: It’s been an excellent contest so far but Pliskova is now starting to slightly swing at everything as the tiredness kicks in. Barty takes her to 30-30 before a lengthy and gruelling fifth point goes the way of Pliskova. Barty forces deuce, Pliskova double faults for the fourth time in the match and the world No. 1 cashes in brilliantly with a cross-court winner. Barty has the break.Third set: Ashleigh Barty 4-6 6-2 3-2* Karolina Pliskova: Who will blink first? Not Barty in this one.

Impressive.Third set: Ashleigh Barty 4-6 6-2 1-0* Karolina Pliskova: So, into the decider we go. Pliskova wins the opening point but Barty has a head of steam up now and reels off the next four to win it to 15. Pliskova’s team must be concerned now. Barty made just four unforced errors in that second set and she’s ramping up the pressure.Second set: Ashleigh Barty 4-6 6-2 Karolina Pliskova: A Barty lobs wins the first point of the game before her backhand drifts out when she sniffs 0-30. Pliskova’s first serve is still landing and she smashes a forehand winner to get to 40-30 before being taken to deuce. Barty wins the point of the match to retrieve a Pliskova smash and levels the contest at one set apiece as the Czech finds the net. Superb fightback by Barty, who is showing just why she’s world No. 1. We’re heading for a deciding set, folks!Second set: Ashleigh Barty 4-6 5-2* Karolina Pliskova: Barty has Pliskova guessing on her serve - and guessing wrongly! She sends her completely the wrong way for an ace and 40-0 and then holds to love. Barty has won her last six service points and is right back in this match.Second set: Ashleigh Barty 4-6 *4-2 Karolina Pliskova: Pliskova was definitely in the zone for the first 40 minutes of this match but now Barty is reading her and making the Czech think. Barty takes the opening point to hint at 5-1 but the Aussie is still finding the net too often and misses a good passing opportunity to give Pliskova the game.Second set: Ashleigh Barty 4-6 4-1* Karolina Pliskova: Barty’s hopes of going 4-1 up look rocky as Pliskova comes out firing to go 30-0 up but she remains patient, let’s her opponent make the errors, and reels off four straight points to stay in control of the set. 4-1.Second set: Ashleigh Barty 4-6 *3-1 Karolina Pliskova: Barty has faced 12 break points so far but had just one on the Pliskova serve. Until now. She gets to 0-30 with a beautiful backhand slice down the line and a Pliskova error makes it 15-40. A double fault from the Czech and suddenly Barty leads 3-1 and is a break up.Second set: Ashleigh Barty 4-6 2-1* Karolina Pliskova: Barty is under the cosh here and the ice-cool Pliskova wins the opening three points to get to 0-40, the third after a clever drop shot. Barty saves the first two, the second with a forehand winner, and then forces deuce as Pliskova dumps one into the net. Barty saves yet another with a topspin lob and then serves out the game for a big, big hold.Second set: Ashleigh Barty 4-6 *1-1 Karolina Pliskova: Pliskova’s first serve percentage was up at 77 in that first set while Barty made too many unforced errors (16). The Aussie has to break the pattern but she can’t here. Barty goes long with a forehand and Pliskova takes it to 15.Second set: Ashleigh Barty 4-6 1-0* Karolina Pliskova: Barty’s coach gives her a pep talk but basically confirms how well Pliskova is playing! Can they work out a way to combat her? Mixing her own serve up helps but the problem is dealing with Pliskova’s. Barty is taken to 30-30 but hangs in there to win the opener of set two.First set: Ashleigh Barty 4-6 Karolina Pliskova: Pliskova’s serve is a little more tentative with the prize of the first set on the line. Barty gets a huge slice of luck with a net-cord to force a break point at 30-40 but Pliskova saves it. The Czech fluffs a glorious chance to put the set away but makes no mistake second time and takes it 6-4. Hugely impressive stuff from Pliskova.First set: Ashleigh Barty *3-5 Karolina Pliskova: Pliskova opens game eight with a pair of winners - a cross-court forehand and a backhand down the line - and wins it to love with a heavy serve. The easiest hold so far.First set: Ashleigh Barty 3-4* Karolina Pliskova: Barty needs to up it a little here. Her serve is coming under constant pressure while she’s had just one break point herself. Despite a double fault on the fourth point, she sees this one out to 15. Better, but she has to come up with a break.First set: Ashleigh Barty 2-3* Karolina Pliskova: A forehand error from Barty gives Pliskova two break points again. Barty’s serve to the body saves the first and she then has her opponent on the run to force deuce. But Pliskova forces an eighth break point and finally takes it as Barty dumps her forehand into the net.First set: Ashleigh Barty *2-2 Karolina Pliskova: No easy service games here as Pliskova snatches at game point and drives into the net. Another unforced error at deuce gives Barty her first break point although the No. 1’s cross-court backhand goes wide. Pliskova’s thumping forehand winner followed by a heavy serve levels it up at 2-2.First set: Ashleigh Barty 2-1* Karolina Pliskova: Pliskova replying to Barty’s low slice in kind and it’s working. This time the Czech forces two break points with a thunderous forehand which just clips the line to make it 15-40 but the dogged Barty forces deuce. Pliskova has a fifth break point but once more Barty sees her off. Still going with serve, just!First set: Ashleigh Barty *1-1 Karolina Pliskova: Double fault from Pliskova on the second point of the match puts her 0-30 down and in danger of being broken but the Czech wins the next four points, seeing out the game with a serve-and-volley winner.First set: Ashleigh Barty 1-0* Karolina Pliskova: Barty just coughing a little in the warm-up. Hopefully nothing in that. Well, what an opening game this is! Pliskova gets to break point three times as she deals with the Barty slice and forces her opponent into errors. But Barty holds firm to come through it. Has the tone been set?Here come the two players to loud cheers from probably the noisiest crowd of the week. Getting ready for the coin toss. Pliskova will receive first.We already have our first finalist in China after defending champion Elina Svitolina came through against Belinda Bencic after the Swiss was forced to retire with a foot injury in the third set. Red Group winner, Ashleigh Barty, has already secured the year-end No. 1 ranking but she’ll want to justify that status by reaching and winning the final. Barty leads semi-final opponent Karolina Pliskova 3-2 on the head-to-heads after nudging in front with victory in their only 2019 meeting, the final of the Premier Mandatory tournament in Miami.The ultra-consistent Pliskova has made at least the last eight of every WTA event she’s contested this year and booked her place in the last four with a battling 6-0 2-6 6-4 win over Simona Halep on Friday to secure second place in the Purple Group. Barty is a narrow favourite to prevail but this is definitely a hard one to call. And after a series of withdrawals due to injury this week, let’s just hope both players make it through the match unscathed!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28c0cc14dd0133a9701903bb2ecde4ef0f6b0215/0_16_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b226f070d055a0845fb515bfdefdef38","title":"england v south africa rugby world cup 2019 final live","story":"Hindsight being a fine thing and all that, but there did seem to be a celebratory tone to some of the pre-match coverage in parts of the English media following that superb semi-final win against the All Blacks. It reminded me a bit of the time before England’s crunch Grand Slam decider against Wales in March, when attack coach Scott Wisemantel spoke of treating winger Jonny May ‘like a Ferrari’. It seemed a bit self-congratulatory back then, and England were ultimately found out by Wales, who went on to win the Grand Slam.Speaking of Gatland and Wales, today’s result reflects incredibly well on them, considering they moved into the final 10 minutes of a semi-final against the Boks trying to find a drop-goal that would put them ahead on the scoreboard and potentially grab a place in the final. Come the last 10 minutes today, England were simply trying to limit the damage. Wales’s achievements at this tournament shouldn’t be underestimated.Here’s a brief clip of England No 6 Tom Curry struggling to fit into Siya Kolisi’s shirt.A Boks back-rower causing problems for his England opposite number, shocka!Here’s a question for you: What was the best match of the tournament?My nominations would be New Zealand v South Africa, Wales v Australia, Japan v Scotland and England v Australia, with a special mention for Fiji v Uruguay.How about you? Which match will stick in the memory the longest?Let’s have a look at some match stats.But tellingly, South Africa carried 369 metres in attack to England’s 201.England made a total of 153 passes while the Boks made 97.South Africa made a whopping 11 clean breaks compared to England’s two.England made a total of 21 kicks from hand, South Africa made 26.These are all courtesy of the official Rugby World Cup site.Abhijato Sensarma emails, with a message titled ‘A thank you note, I suppose.’“The better team on the day wins a match, and the better team in the final wins a tournament. It’s as simple as that, and the winners don’t necessarily have to be the best team too - as the Kiwis can attest. But the World Cup win is a much-deserved one for the Springboks nonetheless. This was a high-quality tournament with surprise packages, upsets, and gravity-defying performances throughout. Gleeful souls, broken hearts and awestruck faces are all inevitable byproducts of sports, which one can only thank the heavens above for allowing fans to witness. Three cheers to rugby, its fans, and the wish to see it live on for long!”Highlights here, if you missed the match earlier, and even if you didn’t:Phil James emails: “If you watched the game there were a few poor English performances that should have been 3 or 4? Cole, Youngs, Ford for starters.”Ford wasn’t great - and although he wouldn’t make any excuses himself, it was always going to be hard with his pack going backwards as they were.“Unity is strength,” says Ian Wright in congratulating South Africa.He learnt that from Tony Adams, Steve Bould and the Arsenal back four, of course.“All I want to do is inspire my kids...When I was a kid, all I was thinking about was when I was getting my next meal.” This is another wonderful interview with the Boks’ captain Siya Kolisi, via ITV.Bryan Habana, who won the Cup with South Africa in 2007, looks completely overcome with emotion as Kolisi talks.“I don’t know why we didn’t play well today, and this is one of these things that happens in high-level rugby. We thought our preparation this week was good, but at the end of the day it wasn’t, because we didn’t play well...We’re going to be kicking stones now for four years, and it’s hard to kick stones for four years.”Eddie Jones speaks to the media.Over in South Africa, Sport.co.za has nothing lower than a 7.510 in their player ratings for the Boks. There is a 9 for the No 8, Duane Vermuelen. Handré Pollard and Lood de Jager are the poor blokes with measly 7.5s. It certainly seems odd that Pollard is one of the two lowest-ranked performers, but hey, they probably cracked open the champagne two hours ago.Speaking a couple of days ago, Martin Johnson was asked to compare his 2003 Rugby World Cup-winning side to Eddie Jones’s 2019 vintage.“They’ve produced the best-ever performance by an England team,” he said of their semi-final triumph. “But if they don’t win at the weekend it won’t mean anything.”For one thing, I don’t agree with Johnson that the win against the All Blacks is rendered meaningless by losing the final. The head-to-head record between the two teams at World Cups is now 3-1 to New Zealand instead of 4-0. The memories of that day for players and fans will remain special, regardless of their disappointment in the final.But looking at the two teams, I felt before the tournament that the England machine in 2003 was more well-oiled. The moving parts had been stress-tested repeatedly and the partnerships were incredibly well established. You can’t say the same for this England team, as much as it came together very nicely before today.Captain Siya Kolisi and the Boks ‘take to Twitter’: “South Africa, South Africa, we just want to thank you as a team for all your support. We’ve given everything as a team today.”This is great, isn’t it? Hats off to them.Jeff Docherty on email: “Surely I’m not alone wondering about the strategy of not selecting our strongest pack and best lineout to begin with given that’s clearly where S Africa wanted and needed to dominate, Kruis and Marler would have been better starting. We either made a wrong call or SA were better than we predicted. Well played SA their best game of the WC.”Thanks Ben Winsworth for the email about the referee: “Best team won, but Garcès helped them build a foundation on which to do it… gave nothing to England, time to SA and surely missed a decisive forward pass in the try that helped to seal England’s fate. This is not sour grapes, but it would be like having a ref from Ipswich in charge of a Norwich fixture…”Certainly, early in the game I think you can argue that Garcès was kinder to South Africa. Lawrence Dallaglio on commentary was pretty emphatic about it - and the Courtney Lawes penalty for not rolling away seemed to come remarkably quickly.Having said that, South Africa were winning the collisions right from the start, and in that sense they were far more likely to earn a favourable decision here or there. In other words, they made their luck. I don’t buy the IpswichNorwich analogy, myself ...Here we have some player ratings courtesy of Ian Malin.Do you agree? Drop me a line. I think I’d have du Toit more an 8 or a 9.Can you imagine the size of the shampoo endorsement deal Faf de Klerk is about to sign? His agent’s phone must be lighting up with calls from the marketing team at Timotei.Meanwhile, great scenes in the Boks changing room beneath the stadium in Yokohama:Jenny Bowen emails: “How sad that England could not respect their medals.”I must admit, personally I think it’s up to the players what they choose to do there. I don’t remember anyone being offended when José Mourinho chucked his first Premier League winner’s medal into the crowd.Thanks to Rodney Ward for the email:“England seemed surprised by the intensity of the SA tackling and the v little time they afforded England to run with the ball. Without taking anything away from SA’s magnificent victory should England not have been prepared for SA to play as they did. Why did our scrums fail so often - strange to them being turned al, the time by a lighter pack. No criticism just a feeling we were not prepared for SA to be all over us as we were all over NZ last Saturday.”I see your point about England’s preparedness, Rodney, but I’m going to have to reach for that well-worn Mike Tyson quote: “Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face.”In other words, South Africa imposed themselves physically from early on, and no matter how well you prepare, it can be quite hard to do anything about that.As for the point about the Boks having a lighter pack - I am by no means an expert on the art of scrummaging but I know it’s not just about weight, it’s about technique and timing as well. Erasmus said he wanted South Africa to get back to basics and play to their strengths and there is no question he succeeded in that.The Boks have only gone and filled the Webb Ellis Cup with the official tournament lager, Heineken.A lucky escape for England’s players, not having to drink that stuff, am I right?Eddie Jones: “It wasn’t until late in the second half that we got any power in the scrum and it’s hard playing off back-foot ball.”Rassie Erasmus: “Six or seven months ago I started believing.”Where do you think England went wrong today? England proved against the All Blacks that when one team gets on the front foot early in a match, it can be very hard for their opponents to reclaim the momentum. The All Blacks were favourites going into that encounter and they barely had a sniff for the full 80 minutes. The same thing happened today, only with England on the receiving end.All credit to South Africa because they established a stranglehold on England early in the piece and very rarely let it slip. They were dominant at scrum time, their swarming defence tended to snuff out any threat from Eddie Jones’s team when they did have the ball in hand. And on a couple of occasions in the first half, the Boks threw the ball around very nicely and stretched England’s defence with some quality passing rugby, which I suspected would feature in their gameplan, given all the pre-match talk about their conservative approach.Thank you to Lee, and good afternoon everyone.Many people predicted it would be a very tough task in today’s final for England against this powerful Springboks team. But no-one, after England’s exemplary victory over the world champion All Blacks in their semi-final last week, predicted such a crushing victory for Rassie Erasmus’s men. Let’s try and make sense of it all over the next few hours - I’ll bring you as much reaction and analysis as humanly possible - together with all the reaction from the ’s rugby correspondents.Please send your thoughts on the match - and the tournament as a whole - to me via email or on Twitter.Well, it wasn’t to be for England, but you can’t argue with this South Africa team being top of the world. That’s it from me, thanks for all your emails and sorry I couldn’t use all of them. I’m handing over to my colleague Luke McLaughlin to bring you the rest of the reaction. Bye.“They managed to force our hands. It’s all aspects of the game, not just set piece and we have to all look at ourselves”He’ll feel this defeat perhaps more than anyone, as he does take personal responsibility both as captain and simply for the type of character he is. He probably has one more World Cup in him, though.England scrum-half Ben Youngs is offering some words.“We’re devastated mate. It’s hard with the set-piece issues as you’re always vulnerable, and the bus being late made no difference. Thanks to everyone back home and everyone who travelled.”We can now have a look at all the details of how whole tournament was made up, so take a look here at our scores and everything else pageIn the midst of all this happiness, spare a thought for England fansIt clearly means so much to all involved and Kolisi is the perfect lightning rod as he wears his role in all of this with so little fanfare yet so much presence. Rassie Erasmus is telling us what this means for him“It’s weird as I didn’t think two years ago we could do it, then in the past few months I thought we could. I’m so proud of my team, I’m proud of my countrymen and I’m a proud South African right now. We have to use this to build for next 6, 7, 8 years, we have to use this to put South African rugby back at the top”Eddie Jones is giving his thoughts“We struggled to get on the front foot, they had dominance and it’s hard to play on back-foot ball. South Africa are worthy winners, but I can’t fault the effort of our players, my team are hurting badly. We have no excuses and it’s not the time now to discuss my future, but this team will keep developing.”There are tears in the stands and no doubt plenty in front of TVs where all of the SA diaspora sit across the globe and the squad enjoy the moment on the plinth with their winner’s medals. Siya Kolisi is called forward and grips the golden cup in his hands. Up in the air it goes as the fireworks pop and Kolisi can be seen offering a quiet prayer in the midst of all the madness.What a leader, what a man, what a moment.It’s all smiles from South Africa, though, and for all the talk of the historic moment, we shouldn’t forget that this is a squad of mates who’ve done a bloody good job and that brings enough joy in itself. Then you add on the backstory to Kolisi hoisting the trophy and it becomes so much more.England players all have faces like bloodhounds as they head up to collect the runners up medal and most make a show of immediately taking them off, which always seems petulant to me. Itoje didn’t even put his on, and if that proves something I’m not sure what it is.“We were massively inaccurate first half and couldn’t build any pressure, it’s a hard one to take. Our forwards have been unbelievable all tournament, but SA got ahead today, it’s a tough one to take but congratulations to them.”He’s right about he first half, that mangling of possession by Vunipola and Ford in the opening minutes was a short story for the whole novel of a game.All the talk now is about Siya Kolisi, a black Sprinbgbok captain, lifting the trophy. Anyone who knows about the history of the country and the sport of Rugby will know what this means and we should not underestimate what a moment this will be.Here’s the full match report on this historic South Africa win.England didn’t get a toe in this game from minute one and you can blame them and their performance but that would take away from what South Africa have done - they were absolutely outstanding, absolutely everywhere. 79 mins. Sprinboks are on the attack in the England 22 again as they and the clock inch towards the end.78 mins.  Pollard attempts a drop goal but it’s sliced horribly, not that it matters as the engraver is already working on putting SA’s name on the trophy.77 mins. The score is entirely representative of this South Africa performance, they have been better everywhere and will win their third trophy at what is, in the end, a canter.England knock on again and will have to face another nightmarish scrum.Jantjies is on for De Klerk.75 mins.  England again are trying to work in midfield in their own half but Slade drops the ball as he’s rattled in the tackle. It rolls to Kolbe and he dances around Farrell to run in from 30 metres. Pollard slots the extras.72 mins.  Its won by the Boks at their own scrum and de Klerk launches it to touch. England win the lineout and are punching at the SA midfield but are once again getting no change at all from the SA tackle line.Frans Steyn is on for Le Roux.70 mins. England are in the 22 but Watson is deemed to have knocked on as he hit the ground, it was marginal but no matter as SA have a scrum near their own line. It was Du Toit in the tackle and he has once again been utterly magnificent in defence. Jonny May is off and Jonathan Joseph is on. Daly is moved to wing and Slade is at fullback.69 mins, That’s the game, surely. England have shown nothing to suggest they are scoring two tries in 11 mins. South Africa, the team lambasted for so little creativity, have crafted a delicious score to potentially win the tournament.68 mins. Nothing to see and it’s awarded! Pollard adds the extras.66 mins. TMO on potential SA try!SA penalty on England 10m line which is won without incident. Le Roux is in the line again and sends a probing chip into the corner which Daly gathers but England are forced to exit. On the return Am gathers a chip from Mapimpi and they are into the 22 and Am throws a lovely no look pop back to Mapimpi and he’s in. Ref wants to check Am was onside.63 mins.  That was an attempt from his own half and it’s drops short. Slade sends it to touch.62 mins.  Flag on the play as Romain Poite spotted Watson changing his lane to block Mapimpi’s kick-chase. Absoltely right decision and an entirely pointless and damaging thing for Watson to do. Pollard is going to kick it from way downtown."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0989c5b5059462eb4e2bdf07b2f520e58e99b7e0/0_14_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3ea109d3ea8628f2b1ca5c431878c60f","title":"15 pilgrimages plilgrim trails walks europe uk","story":"Walkers of any faith or none will be inspired by our pick of historic, uplifting and long-distance pilgrimages, with transport links and places to rest weary legs each nightA thoroughly modern pilgrimage route, this 40-mile waymarked path was opened four years ago to celebrate the life of the seventh-century local heroine. The route goes in a semi-circle from Hinderwell near the coast, up on to the North York Moors, and down the Esk Valley to Whitby Abbey. On the way it takes in no fewer than eight churches dedicated to St Hilda, a fine Yorkshire “trod” – a stone pannierway indented by medieval wayfarers and their packhorses – and stepping stones over the River Esk at Lealholm.Further information Walking St Hilda’s Way, £5 plus p\u0026ampp from dalescourtpress.Getting there From Saltburn station take the X4 bus to Hinderwell.

Not a great deal is known about the 11th-century Scottish saint, but centuries after his death his body was found incorrupt (avoiding the normal process of decomposition). If your own body is similarly robust and you fancy a tougher challenge, you could start off at Tain – 135 miles north-west of Aberdeen – where the shrine to St Duthac was itself once a pilgrimage site.Further information thewayofstandrewsGetting there Aberdeen, Tain and St Andrews all have railway stations.Where to stay Dundee Backpackers Hostel is in five buildings dating from the 16th century and offers private rooms and four-, six- and eight-bed dorms (from £17 a night, hoppodundeebackpackershostel).The “Welsh Camino” is a 136-mile waymarked walk across the woods, rivers and mountains of north Wales, from Flintshire’s Basingwerk Abbey – and the holy waters of St Winifride’s Well – to Bardsey Island, off the tip of the Llŷn peninsula. The little isle has been the focus of pilgrimages ever since St Cadfan founded a religious community there in the sixth century. Today it’s also a national nature reserve open from March to October, making it a perfect summer destination.Further information pilgrims-way-north-wales.orgGetting there From Flint station, take bus 11 or 19 to Holywell.

They crossed Cornwall from north to south before sailing to Brittany and sacred sites beyond. Around 28 miles long, the well-waymarked path starts at St Petroc’s church in Padstow and ends at the church of St Fimbarrus in Fowey. Highlights on the way include 360-degree vistas from St Breock Downs, stone crosses raised by Celtic Christians and a holy well at Golant.

The newly devised, 70-mile St Augustine’s Camino – a guidebook and pilgrim’s passport were launched this year – sets out from Rochester Cathedral bound for Augustus Pugin’s recently renovated St Augustine shrine in Ramsgate. It visits the Carmelite Friars at Aylesford Priory and takes in swathes of lush Kent countryside, stopping off at Canterbury before pushing on to the coast.Further information augustinecamino, guidebook £5.99 plus £2 p\u0026amppGetting there Both Rochester (from 30min) and Ramsgate (from 1hr 12min) have direct rail services to London.Where to stay Ramsgate’s 18th-century Albion House is dripping in history and was once graced by Princess Victoria (doubles from £85 room-only, albionhouseramsgate).Once one of Europe’s busiest pilgrimage sites, this shrine was created in 1061 after Saint Mary appeared to one Richeldis de Faverches and asked her to build a replica of the house where the Annunciation took place. The statue was destroyed in the Reformation but trekking to “England’s Nazareth” was revived in the early 20th century.

Though sometimes incorporated into walks from northern Europe to Santiago de Compostela, it works as a discrete pilgrimage. Passing the spa town of Bad Münstereifel and the former Benedictine abbey at Prüm, it ends at Trier’s St Peter’s Cathedral. This happens to be the oldest church in Germany, commissioned by Emperor Constantine in the fourth century (though since destroyed and rebuilt).Getting there Cologne’s central station is opposite the cathedral and only 4-5 hours from London by train. Trier also has a station.Where to stay Treat yourself to a night at the modern but stylish Boutique Hotel Marielle in Bad Münstereifel (doubles from €90 roon-only, hotel-marielle.de).It’s a little-known fact that the first incident in Finnish history that was written down occurred on 20 January 1156, when Bishop Henry was murdered by a yeoman named Lalli on the ice of Lake Köyliönjärvi. The tiny wooded island of Kirkkokari, near the scene of the crime, has attracted pilgrims ever since. Join Finnish Catholics as they walk or cycle 87 miles from the port of Turku to Köyliö, on the waymarked St Henry’s Way, to take a boat across the lake for a memorial mass on the Sunday before the summer solstice.Getting there Turku is accessible by ferry and train.

For over 1,000 years pilgrims have trodden this path, which was once the main route from northern to southern Europe. With the Pilgrims’ Passport (€5), their modern counterparts have access to a huge number of cheap-and-cheerful lodgings along the way.Further information viefrancigene.orgGetting there Lausanne, Vevey, St Maurice and other popular starting points all have railway stations.Where to stay La Casa del Movimento Lento (the Slow Movement House) in Roppolo, north of Turin, is a B\u0026ampBhostel with a library of travel books and maps (bed in three-bed dorm €16, doubles €46, linen extra, casa.movimentolento.it).Looking for a holiday with a difference?

While writing Girl with a Pearl Earring, I took a painting class. For Remarkable Creatures, I hunted for fossils on the beach at Lyme Regis, just as Mary Anning did. For my latest novel, A Single Thread, I learned needlepoint the way my heroine Violet Speedwell does – to make cushions and kneelers for Winchester cathedral in the 1930s.That wasn’t the only on-the-job training I did. I also literally followed in Violet’s footsteps as she walked cross-country between Winchester and Salisbury cathedrals in her summer holidays. Who could resist walking between two of the UK’s finest cathedrals? It would be a modern-day pilgrimage across some of southern England’s finest green and pleasant land, and there is even a well-marked path to follow called the Clarendon Way.In an ideal world I would do such a walk just as I am writing the scenes. In May 2018 my husband Jon and I set aside a weekend, but cancelled when I caught a cold. A few weekends later I thought I would try again, though Jon wasn’t free. But I hesitated. For something happens during Violet’s walk: a man begins following her in a cornfield and she runs. Almost 90 years later, much has changed for the better for women. We have more access to higher education. All kinds of career paths are open to us. And unlike in Violet’s world, it is no longer assumed that we will marry and have children. But we still don’t feel safe walking alone.I wrote the scenes anyway, finished the book and in October, while I was editing it, Jon and I at last found a free weekend.October weather can be very different from May sunshine. We started in cold mist in Winchester, the cathedral rising romantically from the gloom. I wished I could stay inside it, admiring the longest nave in Europe, Jane Austen’s grave, and remarkable stone and wood carvings. But pilgrims don’t linger. As we walked up the High Street and through the medieval West Gate, it began to spit with rain, which carried on as we crossed the railway line and passed the prison and hospital, just as Violet does on a hot August morning.It rained harder as we walked through the suburbs – houses Violet would not have seen. I know because I was carrying a 1930s Ordnance Survey map to consult alongside our modern one. I looked for an orchard that is marked on the old map, hoping to spy a gnarled old apple tree, but there were only 1960s bungalows.As we finally left the city and joined the Clarendon Way, it really began to pour. “I’m sure this is beautiful in the sunshine,” I kept saying as the rain tested my raincoat’s mettle. By then we’d also donned the ultimate humiliation – waterproof trousers, which swished as we walked and made me feel about four years old.We’d planned a break at Farley Mount, an 18th-century folly erected by a local man in honour of his racehorse, which he had saddled with the bizarre name Beware Chalk Pit. Violet has the same idea. Oddly, in this instance, life mirrored art. In my scene, Violet is planning to eat her breakfast rolls at the monument while admiring the view. But a visiting family is there already: the wife gives her the side-eye for being a woman on her own, and Violet feels forced to move on.We were planning to sit inside the white pyramid to rest and dry off. But two dog walkers had the same idea and their frisky hounds enjoyed barking inside the echoey chamber so much we had to flee the noise.In rain or shine, the Clarendon Way is a heavenly walk, along straight Roman roads and up and down hills, offering views of green and brown fields broken up by hedgerows and clumps of woods.Finding the cornfield where Violet meets the lone man, I was now struck by how very different life and art can be. Where there had been corn there were just benign turnips. “But this is where the fear began!” I thought. Maybe we would have better luck at the John O’Gaunt Inn in tiny Horsebridge, which Violet flees to. But here again, life did not imitate art: I popped in to look around, and the whole geography of the interior was completely unlike what I’d imagined: the bar was in a different place, and it was bright and airy rather than dingy and smelling of chip fat. Plus the staff were friendly, whereas I made the 1930s publican nosy and sinister.As we trudged past the many tributaries of the chalky River Test, where modern dry fly fishing was born, anglers unbothered by the rain plied their lines. Then came Broughton, where later that night we had an excellent, unexpectedly creative meal at The Tally Ho! inn. From there we momentarily erged from the Clarendon Way and strode across country to our B\u0026ampB in Nether Wallop where, after 15 miles in the rain, I hung my sopping clothes over the radiators and did what Violet does: “She kicked off her boots and was asleep in a minute.”In the morning, sunshine transformed everything. Nether Wallop may have a joke name, but it is a lovely village, with thick thatch hanging over windows like eyebrows and actual roses around the doors. Used for filming the Miss Marple BBC TV series, it is also where Violet’s love interest Arthur lives and rings bells. Here we met friends who were joining us for the second 13 miles of the route .Twenty-six miles has a certain ring to it. Add 0.2 miles and you get … a marathon. Which is what we found running towards us along the narrow path – 1,000 participants in the annual Clarendon Way marathon. Rather than swim against this wall of humanity, we cheated and went around, cutting seven miles off the distance. We finished the route in mellow autumn sunshine with the leaves just beginning to turn, walking through sleepy villages and past harvested fields.Just outside Salisbury we passed through Clarendon Park, an old hunting ground, and the ruins of Clarendon Palace, built by Henry II in the 12th century. Now it is all crumbling flint walls, surreally populated with grazing llamas.Poor Salisbury has been in the news for all the wrong reasons, but it appeared to have bullishly recovered from Russian interference. Its cathedral is a corker, with its 123-metre spire dominating the skyline. It has beautiful stained glass, especially the gorgeous modern “Prisoners of Conscience” window in the eastern end. The Chapter House famously houses a copy of the Magna Carta. I touched the walls of the cathedral, bringing greetings from that other great cathedral I had just walked from, my pilgrimage complete. Despite the rain, I was glad I’d done it, and would do it again – the whole thing next time. I just need to check when the marathon is.• A Single Thread is published by Borough (£14.99).

How many times will I have to watch a special child central to the mystic storyline run lightly across the high walls of an olde building? How many times will I have to watch another child, their friend (not special), gasp “Wait for me!” as they pace off into the distance? How many times will the matron of the house grab the special one by the ear and say: “You know you shouldn’t be out here, miss, racing around like that! G’worn now!”?

Bad! Guy! Converse! With! A! Snake!How many fantastical airships will I have to watch take off from perfectly trimmed, green and lustrous lawns? How many MacGuffins will I have to watch be handed with holy sanctity to a child before they go on their “journey”? “Careful, Lyra,” the scholars may as well be saying, “for the MacGuffin is vital, and made of bronze. Nerds on Reddit will be talking about the importance of this for, like, the next five years.” How many times do I have to watch a child be warned: “Don’t go in there, dear: for it is my forbidden room” – then watch the child walk straight into the forbidden room and find a secret almost immediately? How many times do I have to watch a rough-and-tough character storm around in the mud and snow and ice and then, on their return to the warm embrace of humanity, be saluted and addressed as “Lord”? How many two-minute intro sequences where stirring orchestra-and-choir music plays while swish CGI graphics construct either a clock or a horse out of atoms will I have to sit through before the abyss embraces me?How many arcane-symbol bad guys will I have to watch talk in plotting whispers as they look ominously off over a high balcony? How many times will I flinch when everyone in the show says “ma” instead of “mum” in forced, rough, drama-school working-class accents? How many times, crucially, will I have to listen to a boring man with a thin, lank ponytail tell me at length at a party that, actually, the books were better, and, actually, a very crucial scene from the second book has been omitted, and that’s why the thing with the dragon doesn’t make sense?Anyway, we’re in an era now – and you know what I mean: post-Game of Thrones – where fantasy is now all right, and the adult figurine market booms. This latest BBC effort is lavish, A-list, beautiful, drawn from immensely popular and perfectly mystery–adventure-dense source material (in this case Philip Pullman’s hit novel series), and they’ve got James McAvoy in as the glue. They have – apart from a small segment in the first episode where someone shouts: “NO! THE GOBBLERS ARE REAL!” – got everything right. So in answer to the question of how many more of these I’m going to watch entirely through before death, the answer is: at least one more."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a75273fa561e6262aabfd50f90d79e32b7aa5c1/0_0_2480_1489/master/2480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6461cb0e017cda0829e66c11b1a8db2f","title":"tv tonight the plot thickens in spiral","story":"Laure’s falling apart in the French detective drama.

His decision met with tributes from his former competitors and insults from Donald Trump.Speaking at a rally in Mississippi, the president crowed over the fate of the former Texas congressman, calling him “pathetic”, “nasty” and a “poor bastard”.“He made a total fool of himself,” Trump said, mocking an infamous Vanity Fair interview in which O’Rourke said he was born for the presidency. “He said that he was born for it, like he was born from heaven, he came down.”O’Rourke made his announcement in a Medium post and a series of tweets, saying: “Our campaign has always been about seeing clearly, speaking honestly, and acting decisively. In that spirit: I am announcing that my service to the country will not be as a candidate or as the nominee.”Speaking to supporters in Iowa, O’Rourke said he made the decision “reluctantly” and would stay active in the fight to defeat Trump.“I will be part of this and so will you,” he said.The three-term congressman rose to national prominence with a strong performance in a 2018 US Senate race against the Republican Ted Cruz, a contest he lost narrowly.He parlayed that run into a presidential bid which started strongly, as donors and voters were drawn to his unconventional background and energetic style.Born Robert Francis O’Rourke to a solidly Irish American family, he nonetheless had a Hiic nickname and a past including arrests and membership of a punk band which helped him stand out in a erse field. His time in Congress as a rare Texas Democrat, from a border district, was valued and his habit of giving speeches while standing on tables celebrated, before the latter tactic began to be roundly mocked.O’Rourke soon experienced very public misfires, including the Vanity Fair article and photoshoot and controversy over a joke about his wife, Amy, raising his children without him. Such reverses led to a public apology for his white male privilege but he never made a serious impression on the polls or in the crowded debates.O’Rourke could not match progressive favourites Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders or muster the centrist appeal of Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg. Some of his policy plans, such as an assault-weapon buyback to stop mass shootings such as that which killed 22 people in his home town in August, were popular with liberals but prompted ferocious criticism from Republicans in his home state and on the national stage.Trump, en route to a rally in Mississippi which he mistakenly tweeted would be in Louisiana, first mocked O’Rourke in surprisingly muted tones.“Oh no,” the president wrote, “Beto just dropped out of race for president despite him saying he was ‘born for this’. I don’t think so!”He was harsher in front of a crowd, saying: “Anybody who says they were born for this, they’re in trouble.”“He came out of Texas a very hot political property, and he went back as cold as you can be.”O’Rourke thanked volunteers and supporters and said: “Let us continue to fearlessly champion the issues and causes that brought us together. Whether it is ending the epidemic of gun violence or dismantling structural racism or successfully confronting climate change, we will continue to organize and mobilize and act.”He said he would support the Democratic nominee. The frontrunners in the still-unwieldy field are former vice-president Biden, the US senators Warren and Sanders and Buttigieg, the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana.O’Rourke has also trailed Senator Kamala Harris, tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang and representative Tulsi Gabbard. But he has consistently polled ahead of senators Amy Klobuchar and Cory Booker, the pro-impeachment billionaire Tom Steyer and the former federal housing secretary Julián Castro, who all remain in the race.Candidates including Warren and Sanders were quick to send O’Rourke on his way with tweeted thanks. Most concentrated on his advocacy for gun control reform.Castro, who attacked O’Rourke on the debate stage on immigration, a key part of the former congressman’s platform given his roots, said his opponent “inspired millions of Americans … and rallied Texans and El Pasoans after the tragedy that struck his hometown”.Harris, whose own campaign has refused to catch fire after a strong start, thanked O’Rourke on Twitter “for always speaking from the heart. Your passion for your community and conviction to create a future free from gun violence have enriched this campaign and shown us the leader you are.”At 47, O’Rourke seemed to many to have a long political future, perhaps focused on the next Texas US Senate race, against the senior Republican John Cornyn. But on Friday an aide told the New York Times O’Rourke would not mount another run.That perhaps reflected a realisation that the former congressman reached too far by targeting the White House too soon. That is certainly a view held by many of O’Rourke’s critics, that as the Daily Beast put it: “Reacting to losing to Ted Cruz by running for president is like failing to land a role in a community theatre production and deciding to take your talents to Broadway.”In a statement, the Texas Democratic party chair, Gilberto Hinojosa, called O’Rourke “a fighter, advocate and leader”.“In the wake of the El Paso shootings,” he said, “he made the entire country proud as he focused his campaign on ending gun violence and the rise of white supremacy. We thank him for his service and leadership. He made Texas proud.“Beto O’Rourke has done amazing things for the Democratic party in Texas, and we look forward to his future.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6709699e16f83471b99ac525c10895b2a528455/0_316_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8207f9abdf1643a1d600e80dae38ded","title":"uk social integration agenda abandoned by government says former tsar","story":"Community cohesion has been effectively abandoned by the government, according to a former integration tsar who says the approach is typified by the prime minister comparing Muslim women wearing burkas to “letter boxes”.Speaking three years after producing a hard-hitting report into ministers’ failure to tackle social cohesion, Dame Louise Casey said the gap between the haves and have-nots had widened, communities had become more ided and Muslim women remained the most marginalised group in the UK.Casey said that since her 2016 report grievances and prejudice had deepened and toxic views had become more normalised, describing Boris Johnson’s “letter box”  column last year as “absolutely extraordinary”.Casey’s report, commissioned by former prime minister David Cameron, advocated initiatives to encourage immigrants to embrace British values, and promote social mixing among young people.“If you look at the data then and now, little has changed. The brave domestic agenda has been forgotten with universal credit and working-level poverty absolutely symbolic of the country’s dissonance between the rich and poor,” she said.Her key recommendation of teaching English as a second language had been broadly sidelined, Casey said.“It needs to be a flood of resources, not just a drop here, a drop there. I would set a target that says in five years’ time we want everybody in the country to be able to speak a common language. We’re all in this together.” Her report found that people from black, Pakistani and Bangladeshi ethnic groups were three times more likely than white British people to be unemployed, with economic inactivity levels unusually high among women from the Pakistani and Bangladeshi communities.Casey said the situation for many Muslim women had not improved. They still faced a toxic blend of challenges stemming from their gender, their belonging to a community facing hate crime and Islamophobia, as well as sexist, misogynistic and patriarchal behaviour from within their own communities. “It is still so difficult for Muslim women to stand up and be counted,” she said.Casey said young Muslim women should be able to believe that they could emulate the success of BBC presenter Mishal Husain. “When every Asian girl of Muslim heritage has eyes on Mishal Husain, we’re game on. My integration job is over,” said Casey.Integration expert Fiyaz Mughal said that the government’s response to Casey’s review, which also advocated an “integration oath” to encourage immigrants to embrace British values, had been poor.Mughal, founder of interfaith group Faith Matters, said: “The government’s response has been too half-hearted and not thought through.”He said ministerial lethargy over the issue had helped contribute to the societal rancour and increase in hate crimes recorded during the aftermath of the 2016 EU referendum. “It’s part of the reason why the ide in our country opened up so quickly after Brexit, partly because there wasn’t anything strong binding us together, these things can unravel quickly You have to be constantly assisting cohesion,” said Mughal.Casey said that the left should accept some of the blame for failing to speak up on behalf of Muslim women for fear of being labelled Islamophobic. This had prevented them from challenging misogynistic and patriarchal behaviour in some minority communities, she added.“The left should be shouting from the rooftops for these women, not being quiet about it. I think people get really confused about being anti-religious. They’re worried about being called racist, but it’s not about faith, it’s about equalities, poverty and deprivation,” said the former civil servant, who is promoting the global homelessness event The Big Sleep Out.Casey, head of the former rough sleepers’ unit introduced by Tony Blair, also said that the liberal response to the high-profile row over a long campaign to halt LGBT equality messages being taught in a Birmingham school indicated a lack of progress and confidence in defending and encouraging British values.“I will fight for the right for a Muslim to dress however she wants, but I’ll also fight for the right for Steve to be married to Steve,” she said. “We have to be able to be both – that’s being British, that’s our values and what we fight for – and it’s not an either or.” "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4069572.1572626520!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"nuns avoid vacant site levy saying field used for prayer","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe entrance to the Carmelite monastery of St Joseph on Kilmacud Road Upper. Photograph: Crispin RodwellA community of nuns in Dublin has avoided having to pay a vacant site levy by claiming a meadow was used as a location for exercise and prayer.The Carmelite order has successfully challenged a decision of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council to place an overgrown field they own near Stillorgan on the vacant site register in December 2018.The nuns claimed a circular path surrounding the site at the Carmelite Monastery of St Joseph on Kilmacud Road Upper was in regular use for exercise and prayer.The local authority believed the 1.64 hectare site should be registered as vacant as it was not in use and situated in an area where there was a need for housing as well as being zoned for residential development.The council also noted that only 1.85 per cent of its administrative area’s housing stock was for sale or rent in October 2018, with the average three-bed home costing €567,110 or €2,612 in monthly rent.Council officials claimed the land was not being used in the most efficient and effective manner possible, and that it was not being put to the most productive and appropriate use in the interests of the common good.They said an inspection of the site found minimal evidence that the site was being used for amenity purposes.While the council said the meadow might provide an environment “conducive of tranquil reflection, passive thought and allow for silence and solitude”, it did not consider that should be a basis for allowing a greenfield site zoned for residential development and located in a built-up suburban location to remain vacant.The contemplative order appealed the decision to An Bord Pleanála, claiming zoning allowed for a residential institution.Nuns’ caseThe Carmelites pointed out that a site should not be deemed vacant under planning legislation if the most recent purchase of the land occurred before it was zoned for residential use.They said they had owned the land since 1892 and its retention was most important for the longevity and amenity of the Carmelite order.The nuns said the site was in active use as both a residence and a place of worship.As a contemplative order, they said reflective prayer was done in the grounds of the monastery.In upholding the appeal by the Carmelites, An Bord Pleanála ruled the meadow was part of the nuns’ “home” under planning legislation.The board said the area of land was a garden used for amenity purposes associated with the Carmelite community and was therefore not vacant or idle.It also found there was an absence of sufficient appropriate records to support the council’s contention that the meadow was vacant for a 12-month period before it was placed on the vacant site register as the local authority had relied in part on Google Earth aerial photography.An inspector with An Bord Pleanála said the site was “an integral part of the monastery complex”.Under legislation, the owner of lands registered as a vacant site was liable for a levy of 3 per cent of its market value this year with the rate increasing to 7 per cent from January 2020."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"One man (24) arrested at the scene following west Dublin drugs

cars in bus lanes","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDublin City Council said ‘adding any more vehicles in the bus lanes would not facilitate public transport and bus operations’. File image:  Alan Betson  The Dublin City Council has said it is opposed to proposed regulation changes which would allow electric and hybrid vehicles to use bus lanes.Last week, Leo Varadkar said the Government was considering allowing electric vehicles (EVs) to use bus lanes in a bid to encourage more motorists to take up the more carbon-friendly mode of transport.On Tuesday, Minister for Climate Action Richard Bruton confirmed the proposal was something the Government was looking at, while acknowledging it would be difficult to implement due to public transport plans such as BusConnects.However, a spokesman for the local authority’s environment and transport department said it did not believe privately owned EVs should be allowed to use bus lanes, adding that it would be “opposed to any changes in regulations to allow this to happen”.“The bus lanes are currently at capacity and the current legal presence of small public service vehicles is causing delays and disruptions to bus services, adding any more vehicles in the bus lanes would not facilitate public transport and bus operations,” the spokesman added.John Lahart, Fianna Fáil’s Dublin spokesman, said the Taoiseach’s proposal to examine this is “surprising” because the Government has shown “commitment to BusConnects to reducing congestion in Dublin and to proposing greater use of public transport”.“The idea of filling up our bus lanes into the city with cars just defies logic. There is no mention of cycling or e-cycling in the Government’s climate action plan and they have put all their eggs in the basket of e-cars,” he said. “I have no idea why the Taoiseach would propose the use of bus lanes by e-cars.”He added that Mr Varadkar should instead direct his focus on the roll out of nationwide EV charging points.Separately, Mr Varadkar said the Government was encouraging Ministers to switch to EVs and hybrids but acknowledged they cost a lot of money. In his case, in consultation with the Garda, his department was trialling a hybrid car. In relation to other ministerial cars, there was a case for acquiring greener vehicles over time as the current fleet was being replaced, he added.Speaking at a briefing on progress in implementing the Government’s climate action plan on Thursday, he said that the use of the Government jet could be justified through carbon offsetting. Replacing it was out of the question on cost grounds. The Taoiseach said he did not believe flying was about to end due to its climate impact, or that people would soon stop flying to Spain on their holidays. He highlighted the potential of carbon-neutral synthetic fuels, which are currently being tested by Lufthansa airline.On a suggestion that more than €1.1 billion recently announced for three major road projects would not get people out of their cars and was “a bad use of scarce resources”, Mr Varadkar said many other public transport projects had also been funded, while Government policy was a 2 to 1 split in favour of public transport over roads. “I think it’s a bit too extreme to say there should be almost no investment in roads at all.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4057998.1571674594!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the irish times most nominated in newsbrands shortlist 2019","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tRosita Boland with her trophy at the 2018 Newsbrands Ireland journalism awards Photograph: Simon CarswellThe  has received 32 nominations in the shortlist for the NewsBrands Journalism Awards 2019 – the highest number for a publication in this year’s competition.The NewsBrands Journalism Awards are open to any work published in print, website, online, mobile, video, audio or any other news delivery format from any NewsBrands Ireland member title.Five of the six journalists shortlisted in the Foreign Coverage category write for The : Sally Hayden Derek Scally Suzanne Lynch Lara Marlowe and Patrick Freyne.The  received four of the six nominations for Best Use of Video, citing the work of Simon Carswell, Kathleen Harris, Enda O’Dowd and Bryan O’Brien.Jack Power of The  was nominated in three categories Business Story of the Year Investigative Journalism and Young Journalist of the Year.  reporter Sarah Burns was also shortlisted as Young Journalist of the Year as was current  reporter Shauna Bowers for her past work at The Times, Ireland edition.Markets Correspondent Joe Brennan is shortlisted for Business Journalist of the Year.In the Campaigning Journalism category, The ’ No Child campaign has been shortlisted.Fintan O’Toole and Hilary Fannin are both nominated in the Broadsheet Columnist category, while in the Critic of the Year category The  has four writers shortlisted: Catherine Cleary Patrick Freyne Niamh Donnelly and Fintan O’Toole.Three  writers are shortlisted in the Features Broadsheet Writer of the Year: Rosita Boland, Conor Gallagher and Conor Pope.Carl O’Brien is nominated, along with Power, in the Investigative Journalism category.

Video: Simon Carswell \u0026 Enda O\u0027DowdLorry driver Tony Grady has lost count of the number of times he has taken his truck on the ferry from Scotland to Northern Ireland, but he can remember how many times he has undergone a customs check.The answer? “Never,” he says.All that may change if the Brexit withdrawal agreement negotiated by UK prime minister Boris Johnson with the EU ever becomes law.The complex, untested plan to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland with the UK’s departure from the EU would keep Northern Ireland legally in the UK customs union but practically under EU customs rules.How that might work is anyone’s guess given that there is little operational detail in the 64-page Brexit “protocol” for Northern Ireland, published ahead of the UK’s planned exit from the EU on January 31st. There is a broad outline: the UK would collect tariffs for Brussels on EU-bound goods moving from Scotland to Northern Ireland, and Northern Irish firms would be able to reclaim tariffs on goods staying in the North.Pushing a customs border from the land border on the island of Ireland to a border in the Irish Sea has left those who will face the greatest burden of navigating these arrangements – lorry drivers – flummoxed.“I don’t really see that working. You are not going to hold up a port,” says Grady, as he drives in the darkness of the breaking Scottish dawn towards Cairnryan to catch the 10.30am P\u0026ampO ferry to Larne.This sea journey is, at just two hours, the quickest crossing between Ireland and Britain, explaining why roughly 10 per cent of the roll-on, roll-off freight moving between the two islands takes this route.About 550 lorries crossed on this route on average every day in 2018, according to data gathered by the Irish Maritime Development Office. There are seven sailings every weekday between Larne and Cairnryan.Fresh produce\u0026nbspThe branded lorries of Tesco, Asda and Marks \u0026amp Spencer driving into this small port village reflect its popularity for next-day deliveries, which keep the shelves of the major supermarket chains stocked with fresh produce.“We will definitely be the most affected if we are going to get held up,” says the Co Antrim-based driver, who is transporting pasta and beans that originated in Italy and are destined for a major supermarket chain.“Goods are not going to get delivered. Customers may go elsewhere,” he says, adding that traders may decide to move goods destined for the North directly from mainland Europe to the Republic and then across the Border, thereby avoiding Britain.His food shipment landed in freight containers at the port of Felixstowe on the east coast of England the previous day. The final leg of Grady’s journey started at 5am in Carlisle, 180km south of Cairnryan.From a practical point of view, Grady cannot see customs working in this small Scottish village port, or the two shipping companies – P\u0026ampO and Stena Line, which serve Larne and Belfast respectively – tolerating checks.He believes checks could lead to a queue of traffic down the road to a nearby link road where trucks are often parked, with no facilities if bad weather prevents a ferry sailing.“We are a bit of a thick lot we just won’t put up with it,” he said.Grady arrives at the check-in kiosk, where a P\u0026ampO staff member asks the names of the passengers and what kind of goods he is carrying. A minute later he is on his way and the truck is the first in a queue of about 100 lorries.“They don’t need to know where it has come from – just what’s in it,” he says, driving away from the kiosk.“I just don’t think it will change. We will still move things but slower. It may just be a day late. Hauliers will just bill people for an extra day.”‘Unfettered access’The proposed Brexit deal says that nothing in the agreement prevents the UK from ensuring “unfettered access” for goods moving from Northern Ireland to the rest of the UK’s internal market.Drivers travelling the Cairnryan-Larne route are not so sure. They have little faith in the word of Boris Johnson or his cabinet. In three days after the publication of the proposals, four UK government ministers offered seven different answers to questions about what checks would apply on goods moving from Northern Ireland to Britain.The government has conceded – much to the anger of Northern Ireland’s unionist politicians – that an exit summary declaration would be required on goods moving west to east if the North followed the EU’s customs code.For goods going the other direction, from east to west, the government has said customs declarations will lead to extra costs for companies in terms of paying customs brokers. The government estimated this could cost between £15 (€17) and £56 per declaration, depending on whether a Northern Irish company used an external customs agent.“It will make a mess of the Northern Ireland economy,” says Philip Murphy, a lorry driver from Newry, Co Down, who is hauling animal feed from Hull, a northern English port, to Newtownards near Belfast.Like other drivers, Murphy cannot see the proposed arrangements working. Most drivers arrive to catch the ferry at the last minute, he says. He believes checks will cause havoc for highly regulated driving time limits monitored by electronic devices in trucks called tachographs.“Between tachograph rules and everything else you have to go through, to start border checks again, it is not going to work,” he says.Another driver, sitting in the waiting area of the P\u0026ampO terminal building at Cairnryan, wonders how they are going to impose an external EU border within the UK.“It’s UK here, it’s UK there,” he says, pointing towards Northern Ireland. “What’s the border doing here?”Murphy is more concerned that fears about potential unrest among republicans reacting to a hard border on the island of Ireland has been replaced by anxieties around the reaction of loyalists to a border in the Irish Sea.“I just think it is going to create trouble in the North. One side doesn’t want one thing and the other side doesn’t want the other,” he says.“It would take very little to kick off the Troubles again something like this here could kick it off.”Regulatory frontierOutside the trucker loung on P\u0026ampO\u0027s European Highlander frery, midway between Scotland and Northern Ireland, another lorry driver – who does not want to give his name – has plenty to say about the latest Brexit deal.“This is the border boat,” he says.The ferry will be where goods cross the new post-Brexit customs and regulatory frontier, he notes, describing the proposed arrangements as “a disaster”.Pushing regulatory checks to the Irish Sea to align North and South on EU single market rules, thereby avoiding land border checks, could mean delays up to 24 hours on food deliveries heading to Northern Ireland. He says deliveries will have to be signed off by a veterinary inspector working to EU sanitary rules before being transported.To guarantee the same supply of agrifood, he estimates that three lorries will be required to do the work two lorries do now, adding to costs. There will also be a mountain of new paperwork to fill out.“It is unworkable but it is going to come. There is going to have to be some way of doing it,” he says.“Personally I think – and this has nothing to do with politics – a land border would have been better because there is an established routine of doing paperwork between two countries. Now they are making up a whole new set-up and nobody knows what they are doing.”Grady’s boss, Alan Blair, who runs his own haulage business out of Ballymena, Co Antrim, believes he will be going back in time 20 years if he has fill in paperwork.He questions why he has to complete any kind of paperwork, even exit declarations listing the contents of his trucks, if one of his lorries transports a load from Belfast to London when Belfast is in the UK.“It will be an absolute nightmare if we have to fill out paperwork. It has to continue the way it is,” he says.One of his meat exporters points out that under these new arrangements, he will have to give three days’ notice of exports where his current system involves the sale of produce for next-day delivery.The proposed arrangements will prove “impossible” for Northern Ireland’s businesses, he says.‘Build a bridge’Most truckers on the ferry route express puzzlement about how the Brexit plan will work, including hauliers who transport large number of different products known as “groupage”.One Donegal driver, PJ Carr, who is moving concrete from Letterkenny to Scotland, shrugs his shoulders when asked where his goods might be checked given that there will be no checks at the Irish Border.Another trucker doubts the plan, too.“I don’t know if it will work or not, but it will hold the whole process up,” says Ian Duff, who transports engineering parts from Co Antrim to various parts of England on his lorry.“We have timed deliveries. It will affect everything. Our customers will be complaining.”He believes checks could be done electronically, rather than through a manual or physical exercise.More generally, Duff does not like how the deal separates Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK.“That isolates Northern Ireland. That completely puts us in no-man’s land. The Border is between the North and the South it is not between Northern Ireland and Scotland or mainland England,” he says.Duff believes there is a better option.“With Boris anything is possible,” he says in response to an idea that has been widely dismissed.Just over two hours after leaving Cairnryan, Tony Grady climbs into the cab of his lorry and, a few minutes later, is driving down the ramp off the ferry.At Larne he passes two men in luminous yellow jackets, agricultural inspectors who might ask about any fresh fruit or vegetables he transports. He says that in his 20 years driving he has never had a load actually checked here.At the exit to the port, he does not even have to stop his lorry to give a security guard his exit ticket he hands the ticket out the window of the passing truck.“He wants your ticket – that’s it,” says Grady before heading for Ballymena with his load of pasta and beans in tow.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Ha Tinh police also summoned others for questioning as part of an investigation into human trafficking. - Additional reporting from Reuters"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons november 2019matt cartoon nov 1","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to telegraphmattprints or call 0191 603 0178.\u0026#39History should not be airbrushed\u0026#39, historians complain as Wolverhampton\u0026#39s role in record-breaking balloon flight left out of Aeronauts filmComment: Revealed: The 50 seats where a five-point swing could see Labour lose to the ToriesBattle over $40m pink diamond bought by Qatari royals as Christie\u0026#39s sued over \u0026#39stolen\u0026#39 gemComment: The hounding of pro-life protesters shatters the myth of \u0026#39tolerant\u0026#39 Britain\tWho will win Strictly Come Dancing 2019?

They are not “worth” less than men because of their sex, and should therefore not be treated, or paid, as though they were.But recent efforts to achieve the laudable aim of equality have begun to work against women. Rather than waging just and focused battles against egregious sexism, of which there is plenty, the noisy batch of high-powered women “taking a stand” are in danger of making women in the workplace seem a kind of special needs group, petulant, entitled, and...To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Money editor Jenny Ross said: “This is a positive step that may help to plug the gaps created by the alarming rate of bank branch and cashpoint closures across the UK – so Link must deal with requests swiftly and aim to provide free machines for all those left cut off from cash.“But it\u0027s clear this scheme alone won\u0027t fix the country\u0027s broken cash landscape.“Appalling mismanagement by the industry and regulators has left the cash system on the brink of collapse and communities are being presented with a confusing array of schemes claiming to fix the problem.“That\u0027s why the government must intervene to protect cash for as long as it is needed.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Eighty years later, and the effect is still breathtaking. MGM’s legendary musical adaptation of L Frank Baum’s children’s book, nominated for six Academy Awards, not only cemented Garland’s early stardom, but continues to transport those both young and old to a world where imagination is the only limit.Most memorable track: “Somewhere Over the Rainbow”Madonna, The Beatles, Nirvana, and The Police found themselves transported to the streets of 1900s Montmartre for Baz Luhrmann’s jukebox musical. Yet, as giddy and eclectic as Luhrmann’s directorial approach may be – making him one of Hollywood’s most unique creative forces – Moulin Rouge!’s doomed love story of a penniless writer (Ewan McGregor) and a courtesan (Nicole Kidman) is still grounded in the same sweeping romanticism that fuels the classic operas from which Luhrmann took his inspiration, including La traviata and La bohème.320 Singin\u0027 in the Rain (1952)Hollywood has (and will forever remain) in love with itself, but no other single film has ever quite shared that joy with audiences in the way Singin’ in the Rain does. A light-hearted parody of the industry’s transition from silent film to sound, MGM struck gold with its stars Gene Kelly, Debbie Reynolds, and Donald O’Connor. All three play off each other with both spirit and wit, while demonstrating unmatched technical ability: from the delightful tap routine of “Good Morning”, O’Connor’s pratfalls in “Make ‘Em Laugh”, to Kelly’s now iconic umbrella dance.Most memorable track: “Singin’ in the Rain”It’s a tough decision to determine which of the 10 musicals Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers co-starred in represents the very best of their work. The dance team are responsible for some of the most graceful, accomplished routines ever captured on film – and there’s no denying they made a perfect pair. As Katharine Hepburn is said to have noted: “He gives her class and she gives him sex appeal.” Yet, it’s Top Hat that remains their most fondly remembered collaboration, as a screwball romance of mistaken identities plays out across a series of glamorous locales in London and Venice.Most memorable track:  “Cheek to Cheek”520 Cabin in the Sky (1943)Cabin in the Sky has a complex legacy, and it’s difficult to judge how exactly it should be remembered. On the one hand, it’s a radical work, as a rare example of a musical with an all-black cast produced during Hollywood’s Golden Age. Although it was released by MGM and even nominated for an Oscar, the film was banned in several US cities on its release. However, as the product of a major Hollywood studio in the 1940s, the film is guilty of troubling racial stereotyping in its depiction of folksy, childlike black characters. Although this must be taken into account, the film remains a major part of film history, especially as it provides an opportunity to see some of the greatest black performers of the era – including Ethel Waters, Lena Horne and Louis Armstrong – in one place. It was also the debut film of Vincente Minnelli, who went on to direct the likes of Gigi (1958) and An American in Paris (1951).620 An American in Paris (1951)The height of class and elegance, An American in Paris rises to the top of MGM’s crop of musicals thanks to its George Gershwin score and its unforgettable 17-minute ballet sequence, which cost almost half a million dollars to film. Imagined as a fevered daydream of the film’s main character, Jerry (Gene Kelly), the sequence is a riot of colour and twirling skirts, as Jerry and his love (Leslie Caron’s Lise) traverse across a series of theatrical sets, each stylised to evoke a famous French painter. La La Land’s epilogue sequence is a direct reference to the film.720 The Sound of Music (1965)The third highest-grossing film of all time (when adjusted for inflation), Robert Wise’s adaptation of the stage musical has remained a source of great comfort over the decades. Drawing from the true story of the von Trapp family, who escaped Nazi-invaded Europe to continue their musical career in the United States, the film allows us to believe, even momentarily, in a world where kindness, joy and optimism is all that’s needed to shield us from the evils of the world, as exemplified by Maria (Julie Andrews) herself.Most memorable track:  “The Sound of Music”This wasn’t simply William Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet reheated for a new generation. West Side Story injected new blood into one of our greatest tragedies, exposing how relevant the story remained in a decade as ided as the 1960s, when America faced conflicts both on a global scale, in the Cold War, and at home, with continuing racial tensions within the US. As the Jets, the white American gang, and the Sharks, the Puerto Rican gang, fight for control of their New York neighbourhood, two lovers cross the battle lines to offer the hopeful message that love will save us all.The inarguable peak of Bob Fosse’s career as a director and choreographer, Cabaret exemplifies exactly what’s possible within the musical genre. Utilising the Weimar Republic’s booming nightlife scene as a backdrop for the rise of the Nazi Party, Cabaret could be sexy, glamorous, dark, and sinister in equal measure, exploring topics that were largely taboo at the time (including abortion) while still delivering the musical’s traditional exuberance, anchored in Liza Minnelli\u0027s magnetic lead performance.The ultimate cult musical, once described by critic Roger Ebert as more of “long-running social phenomenon” than a film, The Rocky Horror Picture Show now comes with its own rules and traditions – you can either be enlisted to dress up and perform alongside the film, or join in with one of the many callbacks that fans all know by heart. It’s a testament to the film’s glorious, schlocky embrace of B-movie history and its message of feel-good sexual liberation and gender fluidity.Bugsy Malone is an idea that never should have worked on film: would we really sit and indulge in a cast of children playing pretend cops and gangsters? Yet, under Alan Parker’s direction, and thanks to Paul Williams’s riotous lineup of songs, the film is not only a delight, but feels oddly subversive in the way its cast so gamely fill the roles of wisecracking ne\u0027er-do-wells – a smart way to parody the cultural obsession with the machismo of the gangster genre.While the film may have earned its place in the history books thanks to Marilyn Monroe’s now iconic performance of “Diamonds Are a Girl’s Best Friend” – frequently revisited, whether by Madonna or Moulin Rouge!’s Satine – Gentlemen Prefer Blondes also deserves to be heralded for including one of cinema’s greatest double acts. Monroe and Jane Russell are formidable as two best friends on the hunt for the ideal husband, with Russell’s witty cynicist providing the perfect counterbalance to Monroe’s goofy bombshell.1320 Dancer in the Dark (2000)The film’s production history has been mired in controversy after its star, Björk, alleged that she had been sexually harassed by a Danish film director she worked with, with the Los Angeles Times later identifying the accused as Dancer in the Dark’s Lars von Trier. He has denied the allegations. However, it’s hard to deny the film’s cultural significance, as one of the most startling and groundbreaking musicals of the 21st century. Björk’s score adds incredible compassion to the story of an immigrant factory worker who finds herself betrayed by the world and its cruel machinations.Most memorable track:  “I’ve Seen it All”Rob Marshall, whose last film was Disney’s Mary Poppins Returns, has become the go-to director for the modern Hollywood musical. Having also directed Nine (2009) and Into the Woods (2014), his best work is easily Chicago, which became the first musical to win Best Picture since Oliver! in 1968. It’s a film that dutifully pays homage to its stage origins, including Bob Fosse’s original choreography, while still feeling slick and modern in its invocation of the 1920s and its lurid culture of celebrity criminals.Most memorable track:  “All that Jazz”Director George Cukor knew he had two key ingredients when it came to his take on the musical adaptation of George Bernard Shaw’s Pygmalion: Audrey Hepburn and the gorgeous stylings of Edwardian London. And so, My Fair Lady’s most delightful image remains Hepburn’s Eliza Doolittle, engulfed by an enormous black and white hat, hollering at a race horse to “move your bloomin’ arse!” Doolittle’s resilience and fierce sense of independence endures today, 50 years after the film was first released.1620 The Umbrellas of Cherbourg (1964)Arguably, the film could could be described more as an opera than a musical, since every line of dialogue is sung, accompanied by Michel Legrand’s score – but it’s also a work that feels purely cinematic, in love with how much life and colour can be conjured in every frame. The film remains one of the most purely romantic entries in cinematic history, as Geneviève (Catherine Deneuve), a teenage girl working in her mother’s umbrella’s shop, pines after her lover (Nino Castelnuovo) after he’s drafted to fight in Algeria.The Disney animated musical is almost a genre unto its own, considering how much it has to offer, but if one film must tower above the rest, it’s almost certainly The Lion King. Released at the height of the studio’s renaissance in the 1990s, the film recasts Shakespeare’s Hamlet in the African savannah, offering an epic story that deals with themes of destiny and responsibility, without skimping on the humour. If an entire generation is now scarred by the infamous stampede scene, it’s a price worth paying.Most memorable track: “Circle of Life”Much more than the screen debut of Julie Andrews, Mary Poppins has endured in the hearts of so many because of how it spoke to children: directly, but with a wit that never dared to patronise them. Knowing Mary was to be in on the great secrets lost to world-weary adulthood, and to be welcomed into the bountiful world of imagination and play – as beautifully represented in the Sherman brothers’ musical score and the film’s combination of live-action and traditional animation.Most memorable track: “A Spoonful of Sugar”Although Grease will largely be remembered for its karaoke-primed tunes, what’s often forgotten is how subversive the film actually proved to be at the time of its release. Grease helped break barriers when it came to the teen film, featuring characters (especially female characters) who speak frankly and openly about sex. As much as Sandy (Olivia Newton-John)’s “bad-girl” transformation can elicit eyerolls today, the scene isn’t as simple as a woman changing herself in order to impress a man – it’s also a kickback against the stifling sexual norms of American society.Most memorable track: You\u0027re the One That I WantLa La Land’s legacy is now forever tied to the great snafu of 2017’s Academy Awards, but there’s more to Damien Chazelle’s modern musical than a besuited Ryan Gosling trying to suppress an embarrassed giggle on the Oscars stage. A love letter to the genre’s history, it’s a film that both pushes forward while looking back, much like the ill-fated lovers at the centre of its story.Memorable track: “City of Stars” 120 The Wizard of Oz (1939)All the tricks and gimmicks of today’s filmmakers could never upstage The Wizard of Oz’s grand reveal, as Dorothy (Judy Garland) takes her first step into cinema’s bold, technicolour future. Eighty years later, and the effect is still breathtaking. MGM’s legendary musical adaptation of L Frank Baum’s children’s book, nominated for six Academy Awards, not only cemented Garland’s early stardom, but continues to transport those both young and old to a world where imagination is the only limit.Most memorable track: “Somewhere Over the Rainbow”Madonna, The Beatles, Nirvana, and The Police found themselves transported to the streets of 1900s Montmartre for Baz Luhrmann’s jukebox musical. Yet, as giddy and eclectic as Luhrmann’s directorial approach may be – making him one of Hollywood’s most unique creative forces – Moulin Rouge!’s doomed love story of a penniless writer (Ewan McGregor) and a courtesan (Nicole Kidman) is still grounded in the same sweeping romanticism that fuels the classic operas from which Luhrmann took his inspiration, including La traviata and La bohème.320 Singin\u0027 in the Rain (1952)Hollywood has (and will forever remain) in love with itself, but no other single film has ever quite shared that joy with audiences in the way Singin’ in the Rain does. A light-hearted parody of the industry’s transition from silent film to sound, MGM struck gold with its stars Gene Kelly, Debbie Reynolds, and Donald O’Connor. All three play off each other with both spirit and wit, while demonstrating unmatched technical ability: from the delightful tap routine of “Good Morning”, O’Connor’s pratfalls in “Make ‘Em Laugh”, to Kelly’s now iconic umbrella dance.Most memorable track: “Singin’ in the Rain”It’s a tough decision to determine which of the 10 musicals Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers co-starred in represents the very best of their work. The dance team are responsible for some of the most graceful, accomplished routines ever captured on film – and there’s no denying they made a perfect pair. As Katharine Hepburn is said to have noted: “He gives her class and she gives him sex appeal.” Yet, it’s Top Hat that remains their most fondly remembered collaboration, as a screwball romance of mistaken identities plays out across a series of glamorous locales in London and Venice.Most memorable track:  “Cheek to Cheek”520 Cabin in the Sky (1943)Cabin in the Sky has a complex legacy, and it’s difficult to judge how exactly it should be remembered. On the one hand, it’s a radical work, as a rare example of a musical with an all-black cast produced during Hollywood’s Golden Age. Although it was released by MGM and even nominated for an Oscar, the film was banned in several US cities on its release. However, as the product of a major Hollywood studio in the 1940s, the film is guilty of troubling racial stereotyping in its depiction of folksy, childlike black characters. Although this must be taken into account, the film remains a major part of film history, especially as it provides an opportunity to see some of the greatest black performers of the era – including Ethel Waters, Lena Horne and Louis Armstrong – in one place. It was also the debut film of Vincente Minnelli, who went on to direct the likes of Gigi (1958) and An American in Paris (1951).620 An American in Paris (1951)The height of class and elegance, An American in Paris rises to the top of MGM’s crop of musicals thanks to its George Gershwin score and its unforgettable 17-minute ballet sequence, which cost almost half a million dollars to film. Imagined as a fevered daydream of the film’s main character, Jerry (Gene Kelly), the sequence is a riot of colour and twirling skirts, as Jerry and his love (Leslie Caron’s Lise) traverse across a series of theatrical sets, each stylised to evoke a famous French painter. La La Land’s epilogue sequence is a direct reference to the film.720 The Sound of Music (1965)The third highest-grossing film of all time (when adjusted for inflation), Robert Wise’s adaptation of the stage musical has remained a source of great comfort over the decades. Drawing from the true story of the von Trapp family, who escaped Nazi-invaded Europe to continue their musical career in the United States, the film allows us to believe, even momentarily, in a world where kindness, joy and optimism is all that’s needed to shield us from the evils of the world, as exemplified by Maria (Julie Andrews) herself.Most memorable track:  “The Sound of Music”This wasn’t simply William Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet reheated for a new generation. West Side Story injected new blood into one of our greatest tragedies, exposing how relevant the story remained in a decade as ided as the 1960s, when America faced conflicts both on a global scale, in the Cold War, and at home, with continuing racial tensions within the US. As the Jets, the white American gang, and the Sharks, the Puerto Rican gang, fight for control of their New York neighbourhood, two lovers cross the battle lines to offer the hopeful message that love will save us all.The inarguable peak of Bob Fosse’s career as a director and choreographer, Cabaret exemplifies exactly what’s possible within the musical genre. Utilising the Weimar Republic’s booming nightlife scene as a backdrop for the rise of the Nazi Party, Cabaret could be sexy, glamorous, dark, and sinister in equal measure, exploring topics that were largely taboo at the time (including abortion) while still delivering the musical’s traditional exuberance, anchored in Liza Minnelli\u0027s magnetic lead performance.The ultimate cult musical, once described by critic Roger Ebert as more of “long-running social phenomenon” than a film, The Rocky Horror Picture Show now comes with its own rules and traditions – you can either be enlisted to dress up and perform alongside the film, or join in with one of the many callbacks that fans all know by heart. It’s a testament to the film’s glorious, schlocky embrace of B-movie history and its message of feel-good sexual liberation and gender fluidity.Bugsy Malone is an idea that never should have worked on film: would we really sit and indulge in a cast of children playing pretend cops and gangsters? Yet, under Alan Parker’s direction, and thanks to Paul Williams’s riotous lineup of songs, the film is not only a delight, but feels oddly subversive in the way its cast so gamely fill the roles of wisecracking ne\u0027er-do-wells – a smart way to parody the cultural obsession with the machismo of the gangster genre.While the film may have earned its place in the history books thanks to Marilyn Monroe’s now iconic performance of “Diamonds Are a Girl’s Best Friend” – frequently revisited, whether by Madonna or Moulin Rouge!’s Satine – Gentlemen Prefer Blondes also deserves to be heralded for including one of cinema’s greatest double acts.

asking for people’s views on whether to ban imports of body parts from hunted endangered wild animals such as lions, elephants, rhinos and tigers.Ministers are under pressure to crack down on the practice of bringing “trophies” such as skins, bones, tusks and heads into the UK, as public anger has risen over endangered species being killed.Earlier this year, The Independent exposed how British trophy-hunters legally killed and brought home the bodies of about 500 baboons and monkeys over 30 years.\u0026nbspBritish trophy-hunters are also paying to kill giraffes in Africa despite fears of extinction.\u0026nbspAnd the UK is one of 12 countries whose hunters have taken at least 1,000 trophies and brought home more than a ton of ivory according to the Campaign to Ban Trophy Hunting (CBTH).Created with Sketch.Protesters demand a UK ban on imports of \u0027trophy hunt\u0027 animal parts Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.115 Lobbying for a ban

hunters from profiting from trophies obtained abroad.The Conservatives have been promising since 2015 to ban lion parts imports unless the hunting industry cleaned up its act.Now the government has launched a public consultation and call for evidence on options to curb imports and exports of hunting trophies to the UK, including a potential ban.The consultation, which runs until 25 January, considers four options:a ban on all hunting trophies entering or leaving the UKa ban on imports and exports of trophies from certain speciesstricter rules to demonstrate “clear benefits to conservation and local communities” before hunting trophies can be imported or exportedcontinuing to apply current controls, which state the importer must show “there has been no detrimental impact on the endangered species and the trophy has been obtained from a sustainable hunting operation”.Eduardo Goncalves, founder and president of the Campaign to Ban Trophy Hunting, welcomed the consultation, saying: “Opinion polls show 86 per cent want all trophy hunting banned. The consultation exercise should take that into account.Protests against trophy hunting to be held worldwide“British trophy hunters are among the worst in the world when it comes to shooting lions in captivity and elephants. They are currently allowed to shoot and bring home trophies of a number of other vulnerable species including cheetahs, leopards, rhinos and hippos.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They get on the ground and say: “What the f**k happened here ”No one knew what it was like, as they have these ten-year-old perfect pictures, where it had a nice English lawn.The property’s present state makes a mockery of the realtor’s website descriptions and images.It mentions nothing about the wretched state of the twelve bedrooms and bathrooms, gym, swimming pool, basketball court, tennis court, and horse stables.Instead it states: The main residence is outstanding for its exotic pieces of furniture, originating from Morocco, India and other corners of the world.This is despite the fact that Berres says the previous squatters, headed up by an Italian called Pico, had looted all the expensive furniture and trashed the place.The website goes onto say: The Moroccan style pool house is next to the -metre swimming pool, and offers an ideal area for resting and relaxing. A sauna, a steam bath, a gymnasium and a changing room complete this splendid wellness area - an oasis of calm.The pool is now a green and brown sludge but the -year-old says he trying to maintain it using electricity run on two tiny solar .He says the wellness centre was ruined by the previous squatters, with the steam room’s tiles smashed to smithereens and expensive chandeliers left shattered on the floor.The tennis court is said to have the same surface as the one used in the Australian Open but in reality, the court is full of weeds and cracks, the net is threadbare.Although this hasn’t stopped Berres and friends from playing daily ‘Bimbledon, as he calls it in honour of Boris, with ancient s style racquets.Berres hit the headlines last year when he and his followers, called the ‘Intergalactic Health and Rescue Team’, took over the estate, which had fallen into disrepair after Becker was made bankrupt owing tens of millions.Now Berres has plans to live at the Finca for up to ten years and is starting to host dance parties and yoga retreats.He said: For me, this is a five to ten-year plan. I’m  years old. There’s no problem to imagine being here another ten years to make it flourish and blossom.We want to create a Neverland, like Peter Pan. This whole area, including the pool bit, is going to be Neverland.Berres says the last year has been a ‘poisoned chalice’ as he’s had to face other squatters trying to move in on the property, with it nearly coming to blows.He said: We had such big publicity from this place, they just sneaked in. We now know how to deal with them, get rid of them. They say they come in peace and then break it into pieces.Berres even looks after Becker’s old horses and goats, which were cruelly dumped onto the estate by an angry gardener after not being paid.He says: We have three horses. They are from the gardener, who was owed money by Boris Becker, so he dumped the horses on the finca, he did this maybe over four years ago.He also dumped seven goats, which we gave to the people next door.According to German media, Becker told bankruptcy handlers in London that the villa was sold in July , which Berres claims is now owned by two banks.The -year old was made bankrupt in  and ordered that his assets be disposed of to meet his debts, leading to speculation that he had squandered his personal fortune.Berres says: He’s probably not the brightest guy in the world, he’s a tennis player, he doesn’t need to be, he’s not a professor. He follows the same rules in a way as I do.He worked his a**e off to get where he was, I learned from him, it had an impact on my le when he won Wimbledon and I watched it as a child on the TV and he beat Lendl’s arse, especially when my father said to me: “See what you can do in le.Management of the tennis star was approached by the Sun Online but refused to comment."},{"url":null,"title":"constipated political class real bosses voters","story":"Yesterday we had the ­welcome news that our Brexit civil war could be settled by mid-December. Let’s hope history doesn’t repeat itself.For the past three years, our useless political class has pulled every trick to try to stop Brexit. PM Boris Johnson, desperate to end the gridlock, has now shamed these democracy-blockers into holding a general election. It’s a risky move.The electoral system is skewed against the Conservatives. Butopinion polls are right — andBoris can inspire ­voters with his optimism and brio — Brexit really might be unblocked by Christmas. At last!Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, after weeks of political constipation, took a dose of prune juice yesterday and, amazingly, reached a decision. Did you see his face afterwards  Pure relief. He hadn’t been that happy for months.Finally he had seen off the shroud-waving, do-nothing, block-everything Blairite Remainers in his parliamentary party — among them his ­deputy, Tom Watson.They had wanted to keep commie Corbyn swinging in the wind for a few more months. They were still ­moaning last night that he had blown this anti-Brexit ­Parliament’s last chance of securing a second referendum.Corbyn’s repeated refusals to go to the country were making him look like a politician who was scared of the people. Reaction on the doorsteps to his indecision was terrible. No wonder he finally caved.Butthe Labour leader ­yesterday seemed liberated, there were plenty on his ­Commons benches who were aghast at the idea of an ­election in December.“It’ll be too dark!” they wailed. “It’ll be too cold! People will be too busy preparing for Christmas! The students won’t be at university any more!”Too dark and too cold  Does that mean we should only ever have general elections in high summer It was even put about that Cabinet Secretary Sir Mark Sedwill had advised Boris against calling a mid- December election because church halls would have been booked for school nativity plays.Now I’m as soft as any ­doting dad about kiddies dressing up to play Joseph and Mary but sorry, a general ­election to free our country from this Brexit impasse really might be more important.Why were some MPs so ­miserable yesterday  Most obviously, it was because lots of them think they’ll lose their seats. Anyone with a majority of fewer than , will ­probably be feeling twitchy, particularlyhe or she spent the last three years resisting the ­public’s will on Brexit.Money was another factor. Fighting an election is ­expensive for MPs. They not only lose their Westminster income once ­Parliament is dissolvedbut they also have to dig into their pockets for expenses and ­election costs.All those leaflets, all that petrol and shoe leather, all those late-night takeaways with volunteers — the sums soon add up. A Tory MP once told me that an election campaign cost him £,.But Parliament needs rebooting. At the  election, both Labour and the Conservatives promised to respect the Leave vote — and they duly won most of the seats.But Labour broke that ­promise, as the antics of ­Corbyn, Keir Starmer, Hilary Benn and Co showed. Leave voters in Labour seats are less likely to be fooled a second time.The one unknown in the election will be Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party. Could it yet lose the election for Boris by taking votes away from the pro-Brexit Tories  What an own goal that would be.Ben Bradshaw, arch- Remainer Labour MP for Exeter, called yesterday’s ­election moves “outrageous”. We were at a “critical juncture for our country”. He plainly thought that only MPs should have a say.Keep the unwashed voters where they belong, eh, Ben  Barry Sheerman, another Remainer Labour MP, professed himself “puzzled and deeply disappointed” by Corbyn’s support for an election.Sheerman feared “the elderly” would not be able to get to polling stations on a December day. Mr Sheerman himself is . If we all took his patronising attitude, we might ask how the old dearie manages to totter down to Westminster from his Huddersfield constituency every week.At such an advanced age, how does Barry remember to tie his laces, let alone make his terrible speeches in the Commons  But no one does ask that, thank goodness, because we do not treat older people like ­simpletons.On Monday Labour MP Seema Malhotra fretted about students losing their right to vote in a December election because they might have ended their college terms by then and have moved back home.  She called this “voter ­suppression”.Oh come off it. She and her Remainer mates were the only ones trying to “suppress” voters — by trying to prevent a ­clearout of this rotten House of Commons.Former Labour MP John Mann shouted: “It’d solve you — you’d lose your seat.” And not just Soubry. Lots of these anti-democrats are now at the mercy of the real bosses of British politics — the voters.I think we’ll just about ­manage to get to the polling station, don’t you Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Their “people’s vote” would be history.Boris will then pump billions into our police, schools and NHS and keep taxes low enough to carry on creating jobs, as the Tories have since .Corbyn is the least popular political leader in UK history. A dangerous fool loathed even by many Labour MPs.Some have repeatedly denounced him as an anti-Jewish racist, yet they will now knock on doors urging voters to put him in Downing Street. Their “principles” were always a pose.As things stand Corbyn is only likely to win power with the connivance of the Lib Dems and SNP.Which means both a second Brexit referendum — unless they simply order him to revoke Article  — and a second Scottish independence referendum. A Corbyn era would guarantee horric ision for years.That’s before you consider the economic meltdown inevitable in installing a Marxist in Downing Street — impacting everyone’s job, home, savings and pension.Or the chilling threat to ­national security of a hard-left anti-nuclear pacist who considers Britain’s terrorist enemies his “friends”.That’s why Labour tried in vain today to secure votes for children and EU citizens. But polls don’t tell the whole story.Each seat will be split on Leave Remain lines as well as Tory Labour Lib Dem. Those the Tories could lose are easier to pinpoint than the dozens of new ones they must win.Nigel Farage has a huge decision. Only a Boris majority will deliver Brexit. The Brexit Party can be a help or a hindrance. If Boris loses, Brexit is lost too.He has no majority to fend them off or to govern. Parliament is beyond repair. Labour have been a wrecking ball long enough.They have finally realised they cannot hide from the electorate any longer.

But something even more important is at stake.Do we want to continue to live with the free-market economy that has given us wealth unimaginable a century ago  Or do we want to be sucked backwards into the failed socialist experiment that impoverished Eastern Europe in the second half of the th century and has laid waste to Venezuela Labour has yet to produce the radical manesto Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell promised yesterday but we already know there is going to be a hike in income tax for those earning over £, a year — and probably a swingeing wealth tax, given McDonnell’s past enthusiasm for the idea.McDonnell, too, has said he would expropriate ten per cent of the shares of every British company and put them in a fund supposedly for the benefit of the workers — although when you read the small print, workers would receive a maximum of £ in idends per year, with the rest going straight into the Government’s coffers.That measly £ would do little to compensate for the collapse in value of pension funds as Labour nationalised water and electricity companies at below the market value of their shares.Many of those shares are owned by funds on which you and I rely for our retirement.The Shadow Chancellor promises that under Labour, we will only have to work a four-day, -hour week, apparently with no cut in pay. We might as well put Alice In Wonderland in charge of the economy. His sums simply don’t add up.McDonnell says he will increase the National Living Wage to £ an hour. Butlow-paid workers were stopped from working  hours a week rather than the current average of , it would mean a substantial cut in pay for millions of people.That Theresa May was unable to win an outright majority against Jeremy Corbyn and his extreme economic policies in  is as astonishing in retrospect as it was at the time. What was meant to be a coronation nearly turned into a wake. Many Conservatives fear the polls could turn sharply again.But there is scant sign Boris Johnson will repeat Mrs May’s abysmal campaign. His three months in office have brought a change in the weather. We have a Prime Minister who exudes optimism rather than a sense of defeat.While May seemed almost embarrassed to be a Conservative and tried to out-do Labour for proposing the most unappealing tax rise — the “dementia tax” — Johnson has made the case for capitalism and conservatism.The first of those, he rightly points out, pays for the public services we all value so much.He has promised to rebuild hospitals and reverse the cuts in police numbers that took place on Mrs May’s watch.He knows the way to improve the lot of people on low incomes is not to boost benefits but to increase earnings through a higher ­National Living Wage.But he also recognises middle-income groups have suffered disproportionately from the tax system in recent years and has proposed raising the threshold for the  per cent tax rate.While Corbyn and McDonnell would undermine livelihoods by cutting working hours, Johnson’s Tories will encourage us to work and to invest — in our homes, in pensions and savings. Rather than threaten businesses with confiscating shares, he promises better infrastructure, especially broadband.Boris doesn’t just want to get Brexit done, as Remainer Mrs May did.He wants to turn it to Britain’s advantage, opening our economy to the world beyond the EU, with new trade deals to bring in investment.While Mrs May created a hostile environment for migrants, Johnson has indicated a more welcoming attitude towards those who want to come to Britain to work.But more than that, it is a battle between enterprise and overbearing State control, between having the freedom to invest for your future and having your assets confiscated, between the opportunity to work and having your working hours laid down by the Government.It is a cliche to say we face the most important election in decades.

No debate.This extremism is feeding into real-le events, including the campaign for next month’s General Election. Just look at the Labour Party and its leader Jeremy Corbyn.Despite presenting himself as a kind and compassionate old bean, Corbyn and most MPs in the current Labour Party thrive on presenting society as a fight between “good” and “evil”, the “few” and “many”, with people like bankers and Tories in the latter group.At every chance they demonise anyone who strays from the progressive orthodoxy.Labour’s shouty MP David Lammy even took this philosophy so far as to compare Jacob Rees-Mogg’s hard Brexit European Research Group to “Nazis” and “apartheid”.In reality, they are simply politicians who have dferent views to him.But such extreme rhetoric has become normalised among Labour. You are either on their side of the argument, or you are a fascist.Labour’s polarised world view is encapsulated in its utterly bonkers set of policies.Any sensible government knows that economic reform takes time, and is often about compromise and improving existing structures.But Labour wants to tear everything down and start again, with private schools being top of the list — no doubt because MPs have a vendetta against Etonians.Corbyn also wants to abolish Universal Credit, despite having no tangible plan for its replacement.Universal Credit is the perfect example of where Labour goes wrong. The system has had teething issues but the answer is not to burn it down, it is to make slow improvements.There are other huge, sweeping pledges the party has made, such as nationalising the railways, water, energy and mail, seizing a ten per cent stake in every private company with more than  staff and having a target of net zero for carbon emissions by .Experts have suggested this could lead to meat being rationed, cars confiscated and the wholesale closure of industries .Who cares, though,it gets Labour in charge!Much of the reason Labour has set upon these radical policies is because shaking up the system is always incredibly exciting for the young, particularlyit looks like it might bring about a few freebies.And let’s face it, it is no surprise that millennials and their younger counterparts can be enticed.They have had a rough ride since the  financial crisis, absorbing the shock of the recession and being decades away from home ownership.It is no wonder they think socialism is the answer, especially as it plays into the woke mindset of there being simple, binary solutions to everything.This is why it is so important that young people actually take on what Obama was saying about the world.The Government has to make large numbers of deeply complex decisions, where there cannot always be winners.Almost always someone will lose out in the intricate interplay that is political decision-making.There needs to be more acceptance of a Margaret Thatcher-style realism: That le is not fair.That is something youngsters do not seem to grasp these days, believing equalities can be remedied with the magic wand of socialism.Strong, long-lasting policies do not make sexy soundbites like “For the many”, nor can they be advertised in protests outside Parliament Square. Like Obama said, the world is messy.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Insects including ticks may also be responsible.The virus can survive after the animal has died, it can live on in processed meat for up to a few months and in frozen meat for up several years.Currently the disease cannot be passed onto humans, although there are concerns about future mutations potentially affecting mankind.US pork sales to bacon blighted China have doubled, while European pork prices have reached a six-year high.OIE Vice-president Dr Mark Schipp said the swine fever was the biggest threat to any commercial livestock of our generation.But take a look at what this virus is doing around the globe today.

Are these two really the brightest and the best  Obviously not. But with politics becoming ever more isive and toxic, they are all we have left.Let’s be honest. What normal human being would want to be part of such a cesspit  As we are all well aware, the past three years have seen a constipated parliament unable, or unwilling, to sort out Brexit, forcing us all into a nightmarish version of Groundhog Day.I believe the idea of a European referendum was the height of stupidity by a spooked David Cameron who wanted to neuter Nigel Farage. When the nation voted Leave, Cameron was the first to abandon ship.Never mind “women and children first”. He was rowing away from a Titanic mess in a leboat stuffed with like-minded, snivelling clowns, leaving poor Theresa May behind playing an out-of-tune piano with the rest of the ship’s doomed orchestra. Mrs May foolishly called an election that was a personal disaster, then was worn down until she had to step aside.Boris Johnson thought he could bluster and blag his way to a solution and promised we would exit the EU a couple of days ago, on Halloween. For all his blather about “dying in a ditch”, he couldn’t deliver.So here we are, facing a pre-Christmas election at a time when distrust of politicians has never been higher and our expectations have been never lower. It is easy to dismiss the whole bloody lot of them as a waste of time.But there ARE some decent MPs who want to make a dference. Sadly, some are unwilling to put up with the scrutiny and vilication the job now entails and many are heading out the door.Female MPs, in particular, have been subjected to online abuse that chills the blood. As well as death threats, they have had to deal with vile monsters threatening rape and other violent attacks. It’s horric to have to cope with such hideous abuse on a daily basis. I can’t blame them for quitting in despair.Their fears are real. We saw that with the tragic murder of MP Jo Cox in . She was a we and mother who wanted to make the world a better place and do the best possible job for her constituents.

Culture Secretary Nicky Morgan is leaving because the abuse towards her has had a “clear impact” on her ­family.The Tory and the Labour leaderships should hang their heads in shame at allowing such an appalling situation to develop. They should have called off their attack dogs and clamped down on cowardly online trolls.There have always been robust arguments and passionate debates in politics — but nothing like the sheer hatred and aggression Brexit has unleashed. MPs were used to attacks from opposing parties. But now some of the worst abuse comes from inside.Left-wing extremists threaten deselection for Labour MPs who even whisper about their discontent with Corbyn. Tories find themselves booted out for failing to toe the line. Sadly, the next six weeks will see even more of this aggression as we have to listen to hate-filled rants and ­ludicrous, undeliverable ­promises to secure our votes.It is strange to think that Westminster was respected and admired not so very long ago.

Nor is he remotely likely to hold the balance of power.There is no longer a route to the No Deal Brexit he wants.

Overall it is FAR more likely to prevent Boris winning the majority which is vital to delivering Brexit and without which it is lost. That is why Farage’s ultimatum to the PM delighted Labour.Two by-elections — in Peterborough and Brecon, both of which the Tories should have won — were gted to Labour and the Lib Dems by Brexit Party votes.

But oddly,  is one of the things that mean the Tories might win that majority this time round. They are determined not to make the same mistakes again. As one senior party figure puts it: “We screwed it up once. We’re not going to do that again.”When Chancellor Sajid Javid spoke to Tory MPs on Wednesday night, he reassured them that “this campaign will not be like last time”. He described Theresa May’s  effort as “the most incompetent election campaign in modern times”.In , the Tories assumed that their chunky poll lead would easily translate into a big majority. There was a complacency and cockiness about their campaign. There was no ­rationale for why Mrs May was going back on her pledge not to have an election and a belief that the Tories could use that lead to win a mandate for almost anything.This time round, the Tories are being much more cautious. The groundwork has been laid for this campaign. Conservative Campaign HQ has been getting election-ready for months. The Tories have heavy-hitters ready to join their ­campaign team, including Paul Stephenson, one of the key ­figures from Vote Leave’s  victory. In , Mrs May took her own party machine by ­surprise with her decision to go to the country.In another dference with the ex-PM, Boris Johnson has a clear argument for why an ­election is needed — the only thing this Parliament is capable of on Brexit is delay. It is hard to see how anyone who wants Brexit and has seen what has happened since the  election could disagree with that.This Tory desire not to screw up will also lead to more ­discipline. This time, the ­manesto will be a cautious document, not an attempt to gain a mandate for a series of deeply unpopular reforms. The fact that everyone knows this election will be close helps the Tories too. There’ll be much more scrutiny of what a Corbyn premiership would mean than there was in .Cabinet Ministers believe that the prospect of a Labour SNP deal which would see Nicola Sturgeon’s Scottish Nationalists help Corbyn into Downing Street in exchange for another independence referendum is already cutting through, and particularly in Scotland, where the Tories are increasingly ­confident they can limit their losses to five seats or fewer.But perhaps the biggest dference from  is between Johnson and May. May had never done a ­national campaign before, she disliked big events and preferred going door to door. Boris, by contrast, is a showman who has already ­successfully fronted one nationwide effort, the  referendum. Boris knows how to make himself the centre of attention in a way Mrs May never did.As one Cabinet minister puts it: “Boris is ­capable of stealing the oxygen from all the other candidates.”The most signicant threat to the Tories is pro-Remain tactical voting. The big question, frets one Cabinet minister, is whether Labour and the Lib Dems end up splitting the ­centre-left vote and letting the Tories win — as happened with Labour and the SDP in  — or whether there is anti-Tory voting that condemns scores of previously safe Tory MPs to defeat — as happened in .Butthe Tories avoid the pitfalls of , then even from a much less promising starting position they should be able to win a majority.THIS election will see the first ever head-to-head televised leaders’ debate between the two big parties. On November , Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson will clash in primetime on ITV. Both Labour and the Tories think they will benefit from this one-on-one format.On the Labour side, they hope that it helps them unite the anti-Tory vote behind Corbyn. The Tories think the question of who you want to be Prime Minister – Johnson or Corbyn – favours them.During the  campaign, Theresa May lost her lead on this question. But right now, Boris Johnson has a -point advantage over Corbyn. If he can maintain anything like this margin, he’ll still be in No  come Christmas.Downing Street also thinks that making this election a forced choice between a Tory government and a Labour government works to their benefit. Polling for Conservative Campaign HQ shows that half of voters want the Tories in government in some way, compared to just over a quarter for Labour.They calculate that making the election a choice between Johnson and Corbyn helps them squeeze the Brexit Party vote down – something which is particularly important given Nigel Farage’s determination to put up candidates right across the country.Influential Tories are also worried thatthe Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson turns in a barnstorming performance, her party could threaten the Tories in their shire seats.Johnson himself will not do the seven-way debate between the party leaders. The Tories are keen to downplay the importance of this event. I’m told they are considering sending Sajid Javid, Michael Gove, Priti Patel or Rishi Sunak.THE “moratorium” announced on fracking today is a sign of the Tories’ safety-first approach going into this election. They want to close down issues that could cost them seats.One minister defends the decision to abandon the effort to improve the UK’s energy security by saying: “The reality is, it wasn’t happening.”But a bigger factor was their desire not to go into the election with this as a potential vulnerability.I understand that, in stark contrast to , the manesto will be a cautious document designed to prevent handing ammunition to Labour.AT CABINET on Tuesday, Boris Johnson called the Scottish Secretary Alister Jack to speak.An embarrassed Jack explained that he wasn’t actually trying to get in, to which Johnson replied he thought his hand was up.Jack, a multi-millionaire who owns a large farm, then quipped to laughter: “That’s why my farm manager doesn’t let me go to auctions.”THE Tories are planning to accuse Labour of staging a massive raid on the pension pots of million voters.This would hurt the .million who contribute to a private ­pension. Afterwards, one Tory told me Javid’s message was clear: “Labour are coming after your money.”I understand the Tories are also preparing a “tax bombshell” attack on Corbyn.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is simple to get involved. Primary schools can register now at thesun booksforschools until Friday, November . On Saturday, November , we will start printing tokens in the paper for you to collect.Head teacher Frances Ward said: “The Sun’s free books have really caught the children’s imaginations. We can’t wait to start collecting tokens.”To mark the launch, we also speak to top authors, including Michael Morpurgo, about their love for books.  So, what are you waiting for  Join us.. Help your school collect , tokens from The Sun and The Sun on Sunday between Saturday, November , , and Saturday, January , . Once your school has , tokens, they will need tothem by Saturday, February , . Your school will receive the books in March “Stories give us knowledge and understanding. They teach us about our place in the world and we learn what happened in the past and how we can do better in the future. All of those lessons come from books. The gt of reading is the greatest enabling thing we can give a child. So, the fact that the Sun is giving children from all kinds of backgrounds more books is incredible.”The best-selling author, , who has written more than  books, remains one of the hardest-working writers around. He says: “I can’t see a time when I’ll ever stop writing.”Although we have more children’s authors than ever before, Michael says we have a problem. There are thousands of kids who  don’t enjoy reading. The former children’s laureate  says: “It could be for any reason. Perhaps there aren’t enough books at home, or the child hasn’t been read to enough.“Or they don’t have access to a decent library.  Or perhaps the adults in their le don’t have enough enthusiasm for books to make it a priority. Whatever the reason, it’s an issue. It takes one book to change everything. Whether it’s a story by Judith Kerr, David Walliams or one of my books, a child engages in a book they will read another one. But the books have to be there in the first place.Michael’s passion for books is obvious and he believes that, in the digital world, many of us have become lazier when it comes to  teaching children. He says: “Technology is overwhelming everything. It is so much easier to give a child an electronic device. Just by pressing a button, they are entertained without any parental or teaching involvement. But reading is about communicating with other people. And being read to by somebody who cares is so important for children.”The former primary school teacher  from Devon   adds: “Children have the right to have a great school library,   great parents and  great teachers. For a child to get lost in a book they must enjoy it. You will only read stories and poems for pleasureyou’re actually enjoying them. The minute you turn stories into comprehension and tests you wreck the whole thing.”Michael realises that boys in particular can struggle to enjoy reading as they get older, as he also stopped enjoying books as a lad. He says: “As a young boy, I loved Enid Blyton’s stories until I was eight and wanted to turn the page. After that age, there were too many school tests and so much pressure to be able to recite poems word-for-word, it took all of the joy out of stories for me. It wasn’t until I was ten and I read Treasure Island, by Robert Louis Stevenson, that I was hooked again.”In , Michael was awarded a knighthood for services to literature and charity. He remains a passionate ambassador for children’s books and believes that it is through literature that we can talk about sensitive subjects.He says: “The British have always been incredible storytellers and historically we do it very well. If we are to create literary adults who continue to write incredible stories, we need to create literary children. It’s the only way.”IN our tech-heavy world, it has never been more important to remember the huge part books play in a child’s le, says  Dame Jacqueline Wilson. The  Tracy Beaker author, who is backing The Sun’s Books For Schools campaign,  believes we need to  do everything we can to share the love of books.The former children’s laureate, , says: “Campaigns such as this show people care passionately about the importance of books and children reading. Hopefully, it will resonate with  people and act as a ripple-on-a-pond effect. In this day and age, where it is rare for a school to have its own library and librarian, it is  easy to forget about the part the books can play in a child’s le.“Many children grow up in warm, cosy homes and have lots of lovely outings and the latest devices. Although most parents want their child to read well, it seems as though reading together can sometimes be overlooked and not regarded as important. Even at my age, I can’t stop buying books. I’m not sure I’ll  even have enough time to read all of the books I’ve got.”Jacqueline has written an astonishing  novels, including the Tracy Beaker series which was turned into a popular television series for CBBC. She has never been one to shy away from writing about tough subjects such as adoption, orce and mental illness. She says: “I’m very  evangelical about the importance of sharing books with children so that they can learn that stories equal joy from a young age.“If we can encourage that love of books  when young, that will hopefully follow a child for their whole le. The love of stories often  comes after you’ve learnt the mechanics of how to read. That’s when you can become totally absorbed in a story.  Just ten minutes a day of reading a book to a child can make such a huge dference.“Even as a child becomes older, and can read themselves, it’s still great to share books together. I think it’s wonderful when unlikely people such as sportsmen, actresses and musicians talk about how much they love reading and write books. They have a particular power to be able to connect with children who might not relate to nerdy writers like me.“As a child, I adored What Katy Did, and Ballet Shoes by Noel Streatfeild.  I totally immersed myself in that world. I imagined I was going to stage school and my bedroom slippers were ballet shoes.” All I ever wanted to do was write stories and I wrote my first ‘novel’ when I was nine. To this day, books are still my passion.“We talk about the huge benefits for children when reading a story, but it’s such a treat for an adult to read to a child. I know that some parents are shy about reading aloud, but they don’t need to be. Children don’t mindwords are fluffed or mispronounced. Some children  struggle to sit still and listen to a story, which can make it become a chore.“However, parents need to allow the child to do what they need to do in order to be comfortable. They don’t need to sit still, quiet as a mouse, and listen. If they’re happy playing with their Lego or colouring, then let them do that and just read to them. It’s similar to an adult listening to the radio or a podcast. For some children, listening like that is much more enjoyable. Reading for pleasure is truly wonderful, it would be a very sad day indeedwe stopped.”For more information, pick up The Sun.Later this month we’ll start printing tokens in the paper for schools and parents to collect.Once they reach the target, we’ll send out a bumper pack of  Collins Big Cat books, suitable for kids in Reception and Year .Schools can register at thesun booksforschoolsEVERYBODY should have access to books because they help you achieve your dreams, says author Holly Smale. The writer of the hit Geek Girl novel series for teens is backing The Sun’s Books For Schools campaign. Holly, , admits she was obsessed with books from early childhood and where other kids had a favourite teddy, Holly would clutch her copy of Enid Blyton’s The Faraway Tree and take it wherever she went.Holly, from Hertfordshire, says: “Ever since I was a small child I knew I wanted to write stories and I pursued the dream relentlessly. I wouldn’t have achieved my le’s ambitionI wasn’t able to read as often as I wanted to.”As a little girl, Holly was taken to the library with her sister every week. She says: “We didn’t have any money for books and I read so many that my mum couldn’t keep up with me. We went to the library every Saturday and I would take the maximum amount of books, I think it was ten, every single time. My library card felt as though it was a special key which meant I could access anything.“My poor mum would stagger home under the weight of all our books then we’d be back again the following weekend. My little sister was very loyal to one particular book and borrowed Dogger by Shirley Hughes every week. My parents accepted my obsession with reading and the fact I’d hold a book with one hand while eating with the other. By the time I started school I could read and was lucky that there was a whole new selection of books for me. I still use libraries to this day.”School was tricky for Holly. She was badly bullied but was able to channel the experience into Harriet Manners, the heroine of her award-winning young adult novels. She says: “Books have always been there for me through good times and bad times. On a bad day at school, I’d hide in my bedroom and read Anne Of Green Gables. Every book you read becomes a part of you.”There are depressing statistics about the drop in children reading for pleasure, but Holly believes it’s about finding the right story. She says: When I was a girl, Netflix and YouTube didn’t exist. On long, boring days, it was natural to lose yourself in a book, but nowadays youngsters have more choice on how to spend their time.“Sadly, I don’t have time to read ten books a week any more but I usually have two on the go. There are times when I need to turn the telly off or come back earlier from the pub to finish a book. But losing myself in a great story reminds me I’m doing what I love . . . I’ve got the le I wanted as a kid.”IT’S simple to start.

The about face came after research from the Oil and Gas Authorityraised concerns over the ability to predict fracking-linked earthquakes.Jeremy Corbyn branded the move in the run-up to the December  poll an election stunt, and pledged Labour would go further by actually ending fracking. Speaking to reporters in Swindon, Mr Corbyn said: I think it sounds like fracking would come back on the th of December,they were elected back into office.Weaposre quite clear, we will end fracking. We think itaposs unnecessary, we think itaposs pollutive of ground water systems, and also all the evidence from Preston New Road in Lancashire is itaposs actually dangerous and has caused serious earth tremors.    He added: It seems to me like an election stunt and I think itaposs whataposs called euphemistically a bit of greenwash.The suspension is a reversal of years of support from the Tories, including from Boris Johnson who has consistently praised shale gas extraction and hit out at its opponents.Shadow housing secretary John Healey welcomed the move but noted that the Conservatives are playing catch-up now with Labouraposs opposition to the process, which was to feature prominently in the campaign. Speaking on BBC Radio aposs Today programme, the Labour MP warned: This appears to be temporary.  This may not be a real reprieve. Youaposve got to remember that Boris Johnson once said he wanted to leave no stone unturned and no stone unfracked, so this I fear could be a gambit at the start of the election and we may see that he does something dferent to what he says now.The Liberal Democrats raised similar fears, with former energy secretary Sir Ed Davey calling for an immediate ban now.But this belated, eve of election policy pause wonapost distract voters from the Toriesapos shocking record on the environment - not least the Prime Ministeraposs, when he lobbied to relax air pollution laws, he said.    The Government said on Friday that it would end its support for the process, which has provoked particular outrage in counties such as Lancashire and Yorkshire. Ms Leadsom defended the suspension despite praising the advantages of the process which she hailed as a huge opportunity. So, yes, itaposs a disappointment but weaposve always been clear that we will follow the science, she told Today. But she was clear that the moratorium was only in place until the science changes. Pressed on why a permanent ban is not being imposed, she replied: Because this is a huge opportunity for the United Kingdom. We will follow the science and it is quite clear that we canapost be certain. The science isnapost accurate enough to be able to assess the fault lines, the geological studies have been shown to be inaccurate so therefore unless and until we can be absolutely certain we are imposing a moratorium.

She originally claimed she was raped by a group of  Israeli tourists at an Ayia Napa hotel on July  but retracted the allegation  days later.

She said in the video call: The woman was constantly in a state of hyper stimulation, confused and because of the post-traumatic stress and medication she received, it was dficult to remember the facts. The defendant had suffered hallucinations, she could hear voices and it would have been improper for me to concentrate on a specic issue that did not concern me and would have made her feel worse. The woman is now facing a single charge of public mischief for allegedly inventing the attack. Michael Polak, defending, said: We look forward to the rest of the evidence, which we say supports the teenageraposs case that she was put under enormous pressure to sign the retraction statement. The case was adjourned and a forensic linguist Dr Andrea Nini is expected to give evidence on Monday.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA family of six say they are aposliving a daily nightmareapos, forced to stay in one filthy room of a shared house. Craig Simmonds and Roxanne Stamford, who have one disabled child and a young baby, are bringing up their family in the tiny room - which had blood stains on the bedding and mice droppings on the carpet. The couple told to Bristol Live they had to threaten Bristol City Council with an emergency court injunction just to get a room for the night. The family said they have fallen into the gaps, with two local authorities - Bristol and Cornwall Council - both attempting to deny they are responsible for housing them. Over the last few months, they say they have been moved around constantly, from a caravan in Cornwall to hotels and temporary accommodation until they ended up in a House of Multiple Occupancy in Southville, Bristol. Craig and Roxanne arrived at the room in Southville in the middle of October, after four days in an emergency tourist holiday let AirBnB in the city centre. They found the accommodation had a double bed and a bunk bed.The bedding was blood-stained, the room and the tiny en-suite shower-room was filthy, with mouse droppings evident and a dirty carpet, toilet and cooking area. The next day, after sending images of the state of the place to Bristol City Council, an emergency ‘deep clean’ was arranged.    And there, the family of six have remained, waiting in limbo while two local authorities  miles apart argue the other is responsible for housing them. The couple’s ordeal began last year when Roxanne suffered from serious post-natal depression and other mental health issues following the birth of her youngest child, Aimee. Roxanne and Craig lived in Cornwall, where Craig worked long hours as a chef.Roxanne’s illness meant he kept having to take time off work to care for her and his children, and so he lost his job, and the couple fell into rent arrears on their council house in Camborne. They were eventually evicted by Cornwall Council on May  this year, and have not had a permanent home since. Craig is born and bred in Bristol.When he was nine, escaping an abusive relationship, his mum moved the family to Cornwall, where he then lived. He grew up, met Roxanne, started a family and his mum Lou was a huge help as the couple - at that point - had three children, Catelynn, Freddie and Harry. Freddie, particularly, needed more help - he has a range of special needs, including cerebral palsy, and has to have his legs rubbed vigorously after any exercise. But three years ago, Lou ‘retired’ back to her native South Bristol, moving into an over-s flat in Stockwood, and when Aimee arrived last year, Craig and Roxanne struggled on their own. So when they were evicted by Cornwall Council on May , the couple didn’t know where  to go, but to put all their belongings into a family member’s car, and drive up the M to Bristol. “I didn’t want the kids to see the bailfs actually come and chuck us out, I couldn’t bear that to happen,” said Roxanne, who is pregnant. “So I left the keys with a neighbour and we left the day before, on April , before the bailfs came.” They squeezed in to Lou’s flat for a couple of nights, and presented themselves at  Temple Street, Bristol City Council’s housing department headquarters.   The couple were put into a three-bed house, albeit temporarily, in Bedminster.The three older children were enrolled into their local primary school and as a skilled chef, Craig got a job quickly at a local pub. “Everything was sorted, or seemed to be,” said Craig. “The school was amazing, the kids settled in really well, they loved going to school, and I got a job. The house was nice, and I thought we would be ok.” But behind the scenes, it appears a conflict was brewing between Bristol City Council and Cornwall Council. As the family went through the process of applying for more permanent housing, they were told there was a problem. Craig’s ‘local links’ didn’t meet the criteria. He hadn’t been an adult in Bristol. He and his family hadn’t lived in Bristol for more than six months.  His family link to his mum didn’t count either - any family member has to have lived in Bristol for five years for that to count, and Lou only moved back to the city three years ago. Bristol is a city still in the grips of a housing crisis, despite new homes being built in their hundreds.There are , people on the housing waiting list, and  families in temporary accommodation. As the summer began, the family were told they would have to go back to Cornwall, and present themselves as homeless there, not in Bristol. It was Harry’s sixth birthday, the day the children were taken out of Parson Street School and driven back down the M to be put into a single room in a shared house in Newquay. “It was awful. At am there were people drunk or on drugs, banging on the door, shouting they were going to kill us. The children were terried,” said Craig.    Cornwall Council kept moving them around places like that, including for a spell, into a caravan.By mid-August, the new school year was looming and Roxanne was desperate to provide some stability for her children. “Trying to get the kids into school was an absolute nightmare. Cornwall Council told us they would have to go to school, but allocated the three of them three dferent schools, which was just impossible,” said Craig. Then, Craig said Cornwall Council told them their efforts to find them a home had failed, and hit them with another bombshell. “They told us we had made ourselves intentionally homeless, because we left the day before the bailfs came,” Roxanne said, as she fought back the tears. “They told us that there was nothing more they could do, and we would have to find our own privately rented accommodation, and pay for it with our housing benefit. “I spent weeks searching for somewhere to live. It was impossible. We didn’t have a guarantor.There is absolutely nowhere in Cornwall that will take a family of six on benefits in private rented accommodation,” she said.    The day came - October  - when Cornwall Council’s temporary accommodation ended, and the family were out on the streets again.For the second time, they made the trip back up the M.On Monday, October , they presented themselves again at  Temple Street, and were told that,  Bristol City Council had no duty to house them, they were Cornwall’s problem. In desperation the kids about to leave school and with nowhere to stay that night, they went to the offices of homeless charity Shelter. Shocked officials there immediately summoned their legal department, and a stf request threatening an emergency court appeal meant that Bristol City Council’s housing staff accepted that they could not, after all, leave a family of six, with four children under the age of eight, including a baby, on the streets. A housing officer used a corporate credit card to book an AirBnB.    They were told they would be staying three nights, and again on Thursday morning, were waiting at the council offices to be told where to go next. Finding them a place to live appears to have been handed over to Connolly  Callaghan, which runs a huge number of temporary accommodation units in Bristol. CC initially told them to go to a two-bed flat in Fishponds, but then told them it was flooded. After telling CC that their children’s school was in Bedminster, they were sent to a room in an HMO in Southville. “We arrived and the front door was open, the door to the room was open and we were told this was it,” said Roxanne. “There was blood stains on the bed. The kids walked in and sat down on the floor and I looked at the floor and it was filthy,” she added. “The state of the little bathroom was worse - one of my kids looked at it and refused to go in it - we go to Asda when he needs the loo.” The family have applied to be accepted onto the waiting list in Bristol.

Mum-of-three Elvira Ferraii was staying at a remote beauty spot in County Galway when the violent Storm Ali battered Ireland and the UK with mph winds and heavy rain in September .Following a ferociously stormy night fellow camper Sally Forth got out of her tent at around .am on September  to spot Ms Ferrariaposs caravan sliding towards a clf edge, The Irish Mirror reported .She could see the Swiss woman desperately trying to get out of the mobile home through the open door before it disappeared over the clf edge.  Caleb-Amie Soltendieck, from Quebec in Canada, raced down to the beach after watching the vehicle fall  feet. He found the caravan partly submerged in water on top of Ms Ferrari’s body, which he managed to pull clear from the wreckage. Despite his attempts to resuscitate her it was immediately clear to Mr Soltendieck that she was dead, an inquest in Galway heard. Garda Shane Nally said the caravan was searched to checkanyone  was in it and that the body of Ms Ferrari was taken to University Hospital Galway for a post mortem. Her belongings, including a bicycle helmet, were scattered on the beach in the aftermath of the tragedy.    Although strong winds were predicted that day, the sheer strength of Storm Ali had taken those at the Eco Beach Camping and Caravanning Park in Connemara by surprise. The siteaposs owners Kris and Tatjama Acton had offered Ms Ferrari use of a mobile home in a more sheltered location night before the storm, which she had turned down.Coast Guard officer Michael Murray, who lives close to the camp site, said weather forecasters had underestimated the strength of the storm.He said: “The forecast was well off. It was near hurricane force, a severe storm.” Mr Murray added that he had to move his Toyota Landcruiser jeep, which he had parked close to where the caravan had been positioned, because it was being moved by the wind. Coroner Dr Ciaran MacLoughlin said the death was a tragic accident.    “There is no way this could have been foreseen, a storm of that nature is most unusual at that time of year, he told the court. The coroner said the wind swept the caravan away as Ms Ferrari tried to get out and that it came down on top of her on the beach, causing fatal injuries. Pathologist Dr Ramada Shatwan said that the cause of death was a severe traumatic head injury which led to a fractured skull and crushed brain tissue. He said there were no other fractured bones and that all organs were normal. Ms Ferrari lived in Steinmaur, a municipality north of Zurich, where she studied Alzheimeraposs disease.

Back in  Annie Leibovitz was asked to take four official photos of the Monarch to celebrate the Queenaposs visit to the US. However confusion around the logistics meant it was reported that the Queen aposstormed outapos after clips from the shoot featured in the trailer for a BBC documentary. It later became known as Queengate and the BBC ended up apologising. However, the bad publicity around the shoot stayed with the Monarch and years later she decided she wanted to do something to fix things with Annie. Nine years after the photoshoot, the Queen sat down with her dressmaker and close friend Angela Kelly to discuss how they could make things right.    Writing in her new book The Other Side of the Coin, Angela explains what actually happened. She claims that the Queen was due to just meet Annie and her daughter, but when she arrived there were more than  people in the room. She simply didnapost have time to speak to them all, so left to go to the photo shoot as had always been the plan.    Angela writes: One of the good things about working in the same job for such a long time is that it allows you to put things right that havenapost quite gone as planned in the past. I have always felt so bad for Annie about how this was late reported, as she really didnapost deserve to be misrepresented in this way. So Angela suggested that the Queen ask Annie to take the official photos for her th birthday - and the Monarch loved the idea. The Queen was more than happy and in full agreement that it would be the right thing to do to make amends for the earlier misunderstanding, and she said yes. After they had discussed what they wanted from the official photos, Angela travelled to New York to personally ask Annieshe would take the pictures. When I told her that the Queen had asked for her toto photograph her on or close to her ninetieth birthday, Annie was thrilled and humbled to receive such an honour. Annie and her team flew to the UK over the Easter weekend to take the photos while the Royal Family were all together for the holiday. They took four photos which were shared around the world to mark the landmark birthday - with one of her with her great-grandchildren, including Prince George and Princess Charlotte, getting all of the attention.    There was also a photo of the Queen with her daughter Princess Anne, one of her with Prince Philip and another of her dressed down outside with her beloved corgis. Angela writes: The great-grandchildren were all so well behaved, and I think even they were excited about having a group photograph taken with the Queen. But th real stars of the show that day were the corgis. They knew how to work the camera, looking straight at Annie while she was taking the photos. The Queen was delighted with the pictures, which were very special family photos to be shared with the public.    Speaking about the incident back in , Annie said: The morning of the shoot the Queen came walking down the hall very purposely. She was definitely in force. This is all being taped by the BBC for a documentary. I would never have agreed to them being thereI felt I had any choice. But they had been following her around for months. There microphone picked up her saying: aposIaposve had enough of dressing like this thank you very muchapos, as she marched down the hall.    It appeared the Queen was stomping out of the photo session, rather than going into it, the photographer added. Leibovitz said the Queen was  minutes late as she had to get into the complicated ceremonial outfit for the pictures. Once the Queen was in position Leibovitz asked to take off her crown. She said: I asked hershe would remove the tiara, I said it looked a little dressy.

Nicola Ward says she would catastrophise about ious situations that could happen to her while she was in her car.  The -year-old said she would feel like Iaposm in turmoil when in the car and that driving would leave her feeling absolutely exhausted.  The small business owner from Reading noticed her driving anxiety started when she moved out of London and away from city le to the suburbs, to start a family. She drives on a daily basis but since the birth of her daughter, Sydney, her anxiety in the car has signicantly increased and says sheaposs always ‘on high alert’ whilst driving. Nicola admits she does not trust other motorists to follow the highway code and panics when she gets stuck in traffic.  She told Mirror: I need my car on a daily basis to get to work and for childcare so itaposs not something I can stop doing. I always feel most vulnerable when my baby is in the car. Things got worse after I had a collision in Spring  when someone drove into me. After that I was extremely jumpy in the car. I started noticing and envisioning things happening and I would catastrophise situations. I would look in my rear view mirror and was certain that someone would drive into the back of me.   Iaposd have extreme thoughts like I would be driving under a bridge and I would be terried it would collapse. If I was stuck in traffic I would be extremely worried that Iaposd never get out of the jam and would plan my escape route. I was feeling constantly on edge while driving. I was unsettled and could never relax. I just wanted to get to where I was going.    Nicola shared her experience as it was revealed nearly a third of UK drivers have suffered a near miss on the roads due to feelings of anxiety, according to new research commissioned by ST CENTRAL Insurance and leading mental health charity, SANE. As many as  of us have experienced anxiety while driving, putting themselves and other drivers at risk. The research forms part of a new joint campaign launched earlier this month dedicated to raising awareness of anxiety and the threat it presents on our roads. SANE has also developed a suite of practical advice to address this problem, by helping motorists tackle feelings of anxiety. To help address this issue and improve driver safety, ST CENTRAL has partnered with SANE to provide advice for how drivers might tackle feelings of anxiousness both before and during driving: .     Before the journey ask yourself: are you safe to drive  Consider whether it’s worth taking the journey at all. If you must travel, could you take public transport instead, or call a taxi  .     Pull over and stop at the earliest and safest opportunity. If you begin to feel anxious while driving, breathing exercises and meditation techniques can help ease the feelings of anxiety once safely stopped. .     Be mindful of noise. Don’t be afraid to ask passengers to keep the noise down. If you listen to music, consider opting for songs with a lower tempo, or music you find calming. .     Think about your environment. Keeping the car clean and tidy could help create a calm atmosphere. You could consider putting lavender, which can be soothing, in their car to create a relaxed atmosphere. .     If you’re a passenger, and you feel unsafe due to a driver that appears to be feeling anxious, consider gently suggesting stopping for a toilet break or for a soft drink. De-escalation is important, because getting into an argument with the driver could make the situation worse."},{"url":null,"title":"madeleine mccanns parents thank public","story":"NewsMadeleine McCanns parents thank public after £k funding boost in global huntKate and Gerry McCann said the search for Madeleine will continue for as long as it takesShareByTfany Lo:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.dailyrecord incoming video video-madeleine-mccann-disappearance-timeline-,customFields:,suggestedData:,gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news madeleine-mccanns-parents-thank-public-\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Among the haul included gold bars and South African Krugerrand gold coins - along with some other precious metals - worth a whopping £,. Cops also found silver coins worth £,, a total of £, in cash as well as , euros, and five designer watches worth a total of £,. Officers also found  lottery tickets - two dodgy passports and a string of  documents, and he was jailed for just under four years at Isleworth Crown Court in September this year.    And on Wednesday this week, the crook, of Tunbridge Wells, Kent - but now serving time in jail - was ordered to pay a total of £, after a court confiscation order. A spokesman for Kent Police said: A money launderer has been ordered to give up more than £, worth of precious metals found inside his hotel room. Stephen Burton was arrested in London on February  as part of an investigation by detectives from the Kent and Essex Serious Crime Directorate into the whereabouts of a wanted man from Tunbridge Wells. The detectives suspected Burton had purchased the precious metals and watches in order to conceal money earned through criminal activity. He was arrested at the hotel and later charged with money laundering and the possession of  identity documents. Burton pleaded guilty to both offences and was sentenced to three years and  days in prison at Isleworth Crown Court, London, on Friday  September .    The spokesman added: At a hearing on October , the same court granted a confiscation order for the value of £, and approved the forfeiture of the  identity documents following an application by financial investigators using legislation under the Proceeds of Crime Act. Burton was also issued with a Serious Crime Prevention Order, meaning he will be subject to a number of conditions designed to prevent him from re-offending following his release from prison. Detective Inspector James Derham of the Kent and Essex Serious Crime Directorate said: Law-abiding members of the public do not carry almost £ million worth of precious metals around with them. The Proceeds of Crime Act has helped us to ensure the items seized from his hotel room last February will never be ed to him. He will instead have to earn an honest living and will be closely monitored following his release from prison under the terms of his Serious Crime Prevention Order.

Kimberley Davison, , works all of the hours she can in a bid to support her family but is still struggling to make ends meet.The constant budgeting and stress is now taking its toll on her mental health, the mum told Chronicle Live.It’s like a fight to survive every month, she said. “I work all of the hours I can and do everything possible to support my family, but it’s still not enough.” The nurse, from Hebburn near Gateshead, does not work during the work, instead picking up shts on weekends when she can. But even this source of work is unreliable with Kimberley working on a zero hour contract.    The mum-of-one says she cannot afford any extra childcare, mainly because she lost her mum and stepdad to cancer while she was a student. She said: “It’s dficult to work during the week as I can only work half days and hospitals don’t really want those shts.” Childcare is available through the Government, but Kimberley claims this would still not allow her to work a full -hour sht as the childcare is only offered between am and pm. Kimberley takes on weekend shts when her son is with his dad, but this earns her on average £ a month. This is not including the the £ a week in Child Tax Credit she receives. Each month her outgoings include £ rent, £ council tax and £ for gas and electricity. She also pays for her Royal College of Nursing union membership, TV licence, phone and credit card payments.    The mum then has to fork out £ for school meals and £ for travel to and from work, leaving her with £ a week to feed her family.  In the past, Kimberly has had to use food banks after surviving a full weekend without sufficient food. “I especially struggle during the six weeks school holiday, it’s horrendous, she said. The cost of food and new school unorm is so expensive.” Kimberly said she was heartbroken to realise her son had discovered she was struggling financially and watched her skip meals. She said: “A child shouldn’t need to worry about that. I thought I’d done enough to shield my family from my struggles.

The pair, who were reported to have left their balcony door open while having intercourse, were ordered by the crew on the ship to disembark in Barbados. They are now said to be launching legal action against TUI cruises after they were left aposstrandedapos on the island with their suitcases, according to the Reise Reporter . The couple, from Germany, said theyaposd booked the holiday abroad Mein Schf , which set sail on April . While the vessel was anchored off Barbados, Renate F, and her husband, Volker, told Reise they were having very loud consensual sex but forgot that their balcony door was open. Afterwards, Renate said the pair began arguing loudly, but claimed there was no violence and no damage to their accomodation.    Later, Volker was in the shower and Renate smoking a cigarette on their balcony when a manager, accompanied by a security guard, came to their room and told them the captain had ordered them to leave the cruise ship. After disembarking in Barbados, the couple say they were stranded, and were forced to pay thousands to catch a flight back to Paris, where they took a train home to Germany. The couple are now thought to be suing the holiday company for damages, including compensation for pain and reimbursement for travel expenses. They claim the tour operator and the captain violated their duty of care.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA woman has told of the moment she desperately tried to buckle her seatbelt as the vehicle she was travelling in spun out of control at mph. Ashley Waldram, , has been left with huge scars across her arm and torso after she became trapped in the all-terrain vehicle when it went over a ledge on January , . As Ashley then tried to buckle herself in, a dangerous turn caused the vehicle to roll over. The driver of the car, Ashleyaposs uncle, Jr, , was thrown from the vehicle in the terrying crash, but Ashley remained completely trapped inside the framework until it stopped rolling. Shortly after, Ashley was found with her head wedged between the seat and the external frame.Shocked bystanders, who had seen the crash unfold, rushed to pull Ashley from the wreckage and drove her back to the road where they waited for an ambulance.When paramedics arrived, they realised the extent of Ashleyaposs injuries meant she needed to be flown to a nearby hospital. Before flying, Ashleyaposs lung needed to be manually inflated after it was punctured in the crash.Once at the hospital , doctors discovered just how many injuries Ashley had sustained.   She spent the first  hours on ventilation, being monitored closely by doctors. Ashley had skull fractures, brain bleeds, a broken right humerus, collapsed lung, a grade four liver laceration, six broken ribs on her right side and an unknown amount on her left. The impact severely damaged her liver and the internal bleeding almost killed her, and she was placed on a ventilator for three days. Three days later, on February , Ashley needed surgery to insert titanium plates in her ribcage to stabilise her ribs, leaving an enormous scar across her torso.    The journey to recovery was long and dficult, with Ashley admitting she often found herself crying because of how helpless she felt. She was unable to wash or feed herself, and breathing was dficult too. Now, with over three years of physiotherapy behind her, Ashley wears her scars with pride and encourages others to remain hopeful through whatever theyaposre facing. In January , my uncle and I took the ATV out to the sand dunes outside Carlsbad in New Mexico, said Ashley. I remember trying to buckle in while we were racing fast down the stretch. We made a turn, went over a ledge and I donapost remember anything until we stopped rolling.    My uncle was ejected immediately, and he wasnapost buckled in either, but I tossed around inside. When it stopped moving, I was found unresponsive with my head between the seat and the side rail. My uncle was conscious and called for help. Luckily there were two bystanders who witnessed it and immediately came to our aid. They put me in their ATV and helped us get to the main road to wait for the ambulance. I remember that hard landing and then I remember sitting in someoneaposs ATV waiting for the ambulance. I kept pulling my knees to my chest. I donapost remember anything  until the day after I was off the ventilator. Before I could fly, they had to manually re-inflate my lung. Once I got to the hospital, I had a chest tube placed, multiple blood transfusions and I was placed on a ventilator for three days.  I had minor skull fractures including my maxillofacial bone in my cheek, minor brain bleeds, my right humerus was broken and later repaired with a metal plate, I had a grade four liver laceration that they treated with multiple blood transfusions, grade two kidney lacerations, six broken ribs on my right side, and an unknown amount on the left. I also had a minor chest burn and a deviated septum. When I woke up, I remember askingmy younger cousins had seen anything and I was really worried about them. The pain wasnapost too bad due to all the pain medication, but a few days later I had surgery to repair my arm and four ribs and the pain was unbearable after surgery. Initially, doctors werenapost sureI would make a full recovery, but after I made it through the first  hours the chances got higher. Amazingly, Ashleyaposs uncle came away from the wreckage with only a few scrapes to his hands and knees. For six months after the accident, Ashley had to be cautious and take care of her fragile body until sheaposd healed.  Later, in July  she had another surgery to straighten her septum which had made it very dficult for her to breathe for more than a year. Recovery was very long, physically and mentally. There were days when I would sit in the bathroom and just cry because I couldnapost bathe myself, feed myself, and it hurt to breathe. It was very overwhelming at times, Ashley said. I came out of hospital on February  and then I did a lot of physical therapy to get the use in my arm back over the years following surgery.I still face effects from the crash to this day. Physically, my lung capacity has decreased quite a bit and my arm and ribs ache a lot in the cold weather . Mentally, I struggle with PTSD when I think about it."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/10/5db80965c6c692.66385956.jpg ","title":"ayr was big step for dee alloa can be next one cammy kerr","story":"Cammy Kerr says Dundee’s win at Ayr United on Friday night was a big step forward in their league campaign – backing that up with a win at Alloa tonight will be another massive leap for the Dark Blues.The - success at Somerset Park came on the back of a devastating late collapse at home to bottom side Partick the week previously.And Kerr says the belief that victory over the Championship’s second-placed team has given Dundee is bigger than just three points.He told the Tele: “It was important to get past the Partick game straight away.“There was pressure on Friday night with where Ayr are in the league.“When you go to places like Ayr, with the conditions there and it being such an important game, to come away with a result is big.“It wasn’t the best of games and a good battle but to come away with three points and a good resilient performance is massive for us.”The Wasps may be at the wrong end of the table but have already shown they are a match for anybody in the ision, including a - win over leaders Dundee United just three weeks ago.They also ran Dundee close at Dens Park, missing a penalty to allow the Dark Blues to run out - victors.“Alloa showed they can play when they were up here and I saw the Friday night game against Dundee United and they played really well that night,” Kerr added.“I don’t knowUnited were off-colour that night but Alloa certainly played well.“Against us they missed a penalty and had chances so we have to be on our game.“We’re under no illusions how tough it is going to be but we need to show the same application we have shown recently, apart from the latter stages of the Partick game.“We need to show resilience, calmness on the ball and patience.“I think we are getting to that.“Being a team coming together at the start of the season we knew it would take a bit of time.“There is still a long way to go to where we want to be but we are taking strides towards that.”A part of that was winning their first three points on the road.Before the trip to Somerset Park, Dundee had just two points to show from their first four away trips.They’ve put that to bed – now they want their first back-to-back victories of the Championship season, according to Kerr.He added: “Getting our first away win in the league is a good wee hurdle to get over.“The longer those things go, the more its talked about which can be a distraction from what is actually important which is going on the park and performing.“Getting two in a row now is the aim.“Whether it’s a home game where everyone expects a win or an away game where you are going to have to dig deep, we go into it with only one thought and that is to come away with the three points. We have to have that mentality.“It’s also good to have a run of games close to one anotherthings are going well, especially after a win it’s good to bounce back with another game.”Set-pieces have been a problem area for the Dark Blues this season. Ayr’s goal from Luke McCowan came after Kerr was beaten in the air from a free-kick.The full-back, though, is honest enough to hold his hands up and says he’s doing all he can to improve that part of his game.“That’s something I need to get better at. I always look at myself and what I can improve on and that’s something I need to look at personally.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/10/5db97190652f23.70248995.jpg ","title":"dee boss mcpake lauds outstanding graham dorrans","story":"Dundee

Sean Mackie.James was delighted with his entire team’s display but had special praise for the talents of Dorrans.The Dens gaffer said: “Footballers with the pedigree of Graham Dorrans, Paul McGowan and Shaun Byrne are going to develop an understanding and I thought the game was played at Graham’s tempo.“When he wanted to speed the game up he did, when he wanted to slow it down and dictate that we should keep the ball, then he did that.“He was outstanding and you can see he is getting to a level of fitness that only games bring.“I know him very well and know he is over his injury and I’m delighted he’s at my football club.“The other players complement him well and I really don’t think they can be underestimated in what they bring.”Hemmings ended a seven-match barren spell but his manager was never in doubt about his frontman’s ability to find the net.“I was never worried about Kano scoring,” James added.“I said from the day he came in that when we got him right he’d score.“Since I’ve been at the club, he’s been the most effective player I played with.“He gets you up the pitch, bullies centre-backs and he’s quick and strong.“That’s why I wanted him here.“Throughout his career he has brought goals, so I was never worried about that coming.“He got two but he was gutted after the match he didn’t get his hat-trick because he should have – but that’s Kane being Kane.”On his team’s display, the Dens gaffer added: “It is the most complete performance of the season.“We have seen what Alloa can do already this season and it can be a very worrying

pleased.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/11/5dbc101be93bf1.48560038-e1572612030915-783x564.jpg ","title":"dundee developer seeks to convert victorian

working on the project to convert the late th Century building.He said: “We are really excited about it and it’s another great project for us to be involved in.“I always think it is nice to re-use an existing building rather than demolish.“The plans are to build nine flats inside the existing building, plus six new build flats at the side and two new build houses beside the old building.“We are providing quite a flexible campus with some large flats which may suit people with families and there are two bedroom flats which could maybe suit young professionals or even a retired couple.”He added: “Our clients Aberkell are currently working on a few similar projects in Dundee, including one in Rankine Road and re-developing an older, traditional building there which I believe may have been a care home.“Aberkell are very much going into this development wholeheartedly and have the same ethos as us to keep the existing buildings and convert.“The property at Downfield House, I think, used to be used by the council for their IT centre.“Once all the permissions are in place it will take maybe a year or so to develop the site.“So it could probably be finished in the spring, or summer

But I think we had more than enough chances to win the game comfortably.“Since then we have been a lot more clinical so we’re looking forward to tonight and we’re confident we will come away with three points.”Playing tonight also gives Dundee the chance to get a headstart on their rivals at the top end of the Championship table.Three points would put them above Inverness ahead of Caley Thistle’s home match with Dundee United and level with Ayr.With top and third playing each other it is a chance to make up some ground on at least one of them but onlythey can pick up the victory.Forster added: “It can be a good thing and a bad thing playing first, depending on which side of the fence you are looking from. For us, we are looking to go and win the game, get three points and try to put a bit of pressure on the other teams who are playing tomorrow.“We obviously had the game on Tuesday but we’ve recovered well and worked a bit on what we are planning to do on the pitch tonight through the week.“We are looking forward to it, we have a bit of momentum and we are looking to try to keep that going.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/11/5dbc105880b912.60235031-759x564.jpg ","title":"louis appere dundee united aiming for the perfect week","story":"Dundee United youngster Louis Appere insists they are targeting nine points from nine this week as they aim to open a gap at the top of the table.United sit three points clear of nearest rivals Ayr United at the Championship summit going into tomorrow’s clash at third-placed Inverness.Having come off the bench in wins over Dunfermline and Partick Thistle at Tannadice in the past six days, assisting Lawrence Shankland for the winner against the Jags, the -year-old striker is hoping to help United to another victory in the Highlands.“We’ve got to go there and try to get the three points again,” Appere said.“We beat them here earlier in the season but it’s a long time ago now and they’re looking like one of the strongest teams in the league along with us.“Nine points from nine was the aim. We knew we had three games in a week andwe can get all the points it would be huge.“There is starting to be wee gaps in the league, not huge ones but it was getting tight and congested not long ago. Everyone was beating each other.“To open a gap at the top would be huge for us.”Appere entered the fray on Tuesday night after just three minutes, with Peter Pawlett’s night cut short by a hamstring injury picked up with  seconds on the clock.Although he wasn’t expecting to be involved in the match so soon, the forward was ready to go out and play wherever he was needed.And the Tangerines kid was pleased to see them come through a testing game against the bottom-of-the-table Jags.Appere added: “I’d just sat down and was getting comfy to watch the opening part of the game and then, next thing I know, I’m coming on.“I had to adapt as quickly as possible to the game and, of course, you’ve got to be ready for the match.“I can play up top or off either side so it’s just whatever the manager tells me to play and whatever helps the team.“I’m happy to do that.“Just to get on and show what I can do by getting the assist, I was happy with that.“I think we knew it was going to be a tough game. You can’t look at it and think ‘they’re bottom of the table, this should be another win’ – it was always going to be a tough game.“To go out there, battle like we did and get the three points was really important for us.“It’s good to go out there and you have to be switched on, even after we got the goal.“It was a bit of a battle but we knew we needed the win on Tuesday. To get that was really important for us.“Obviously, the most important thing was the three points and moving on to Inverness tomorrow.”Appere provided a terric assist for Shankland to nod the winner in off a post but, rather than take the praise for his excellent delivery from the left, he was quick to praise Shanks for what he brings to the table, not only for the team but for Appere as a young player.“It was an alright ball in but it’s the header.

While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee. The aim is to transfer all serious patients to one of these centres following pre-hospital emergency care within  minutes.The value of a helicopter air ambulance is therefore obvious.Working alongside the Scottish Ambulance Service#s air fleet, SCAA relies entirely on public donations to keep this vital resource flying.Please consider supporting SCAA in it#s le-saving work during a week when the country focuses on the crucial work of air ambulances everywhere.For further information please visit www.scaa.org.ukDavid Craig, chief executive, Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance , Perth AirportSir,I get a magazine called #Clean Slate#.In it this month is an article where a -year-old girl, Greta Thunberg, along with  other youth activists, have issued this invitation to adults around the world: #Starting on Friday September  we are going to kick-start a week of climate action, with a world-wide strike for the climate.

Two men were paid to accompany Patrick the Fool on his journey from England to provide entertainment for the King and his guests while residing at Tarbert.Also recorded is a figure for #making a suit for the King at Tarbert#.  Bruce visited Tarbert on many occasions. His final visit was in the year of his death.Tarbert is believed to have been one of the earliest Royal Burghs in Argyll. An early reference as such was made in . It is also said to have had one of the earliest paved streets in Scotland.King James IV also had a close connection with Tarbert. The addition of the #keep# to the castle, part of which still stands today, was constructed at his direction. Whilst this work was underway, James summoned parliament to meet him here to discuss matters local to the area. This meeting took place on July  .Over the years, many travellers of note have passed this way and commented on Tarbert and its scenic surroundings.In  Thomas Pennant arrived by sea at East Loch Tarbert and described the scenery as #picturesque#.CGS Teighnmouthpassed through the Kyles of Bute in  and commented that #it offers no scenery worthy of notice#. He continued to note that #the romantic little harbour of East Loch Tarbert – with the overhanging keep of its ruined castle # form a scene singularly picturesque#. He became a frequent visitor to Tarbert.In  Lord Cockburndescribed the Kyles as #rugged and picturesque# but, arriving at his destination, exclaimed: #But Tarbert! East Tarbert! How is it that I had never even heard of that curious little bay. There it lay, calm and silvery, like a scene from a theatre.

The visual impact of this scheme as presently proposed will have a negative effect on the experience of everyone who lives in, or visits, Tarbert.Tarbert was designated as a conservation area in the s. Argyll and Bute Council imposes restrictions on works likely to have a visual impact on its appearance.But the council has apparently raised no objection to this visually damaging proposal. Similarly, Visit Scotland is reported as having raised no objection as well as closing all its tourist offices in Cowal, Mid Argyll and Kintyre in the past year.With the recent decline in the Loch Fyne fishing industry, Tarbert is increasingly dependent on tourism to provide employment.Other issues include the sterilisation of ground under the proposed line of overhead wiring. Opportunities to extend social housing will be restricted under the present plan.OFGEM administers a £ million fund set up to mitigate the impact of electricity infrastructure on national parks and #scenic areas#.Tarbert, along with its harbour and the isthmus linking it with West Loch Tarbert, without doubt, constitutes a #scenic area#.Reconsideration of this proposal is essential."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column october 4 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsTo an observer, it seems that Argyll and Bute Council is, at best, confused over its approach to autism.The people who know this best are those affected by the condition and their families and their view of senior council officials was made crystal clear when Autism Argyll gave up banging its head against a brick wall a year ago.Little seems to have changed since then.A council Autism Strategy Group is apparently being bypassed in the formulation of a strategy, yet the councillor in charge of health and social care says the strategy is the responsibility of the HSCP.Yet again, it is people affected by autism who are losing out.

A fantastic solo effort in a - win capped a great team performance. Tom would have run around with the customary shirt over the head celebration, however he found the snug fit just too much to pull over his head.By the time the final game took place the team had both done enough and run out of steam. Victory was secured and Captain Anderson#s coat was no longer on that shoogly peg.Ex Liverpool legends John Aldridge and Alan Kennedy were on hand to present the trophy.

And a reminder that Im not getting any younger as I try to grow old gracefully.JCCs, now a septuagenarian, style has remained a constant.His image of the suit, shagpile black hair and sunglasses remain intact. His social realism poetic constructs seem relevant today as they did during his inception, extrapolated initially from the often nihilism and tales of social decay that earmarked punk mark one.Poetry is often a barometer of an epoch or epochs. Combining observation and the written word. JCC has become a master of mind imagery, social commentary, surrealism, and semantics and above all story telling. We get it because it resonates with us.It is us or we know someone who it references. Sometimes dystopian, often hilarious and never dull. Add the heavy Salfordian brogue the chemistry set is complete.The performance was slightly peculiar to what I was expecting.Maybe my expectations were misguided or unrealistic. There were some long periods of stand-up comedy that laboured at times.It was only when \"Johnny\" ed to his natural home of poetry recital that he got back on track. Though his joke about Billy Bragg being in crisis because he hadnt released an album in two weeks, I found amusing.But when he got back to the poetry it was a reminder why most people were here.Most poems were from the back catalogue and instantly recognisable. A greatest hit set list.JCC proceeded with Hire Car and the sharply expletive named Get Back on Drugs You Fat F***.Well it was an adult show after all.Common language for common poetry. And it never did Billy Connelly any harm. The poem insinuating it was easier to lose weight being on drugs.Beasley Street, arguably his most well-known poem received one of the best reactions of the night. Imbued with the description of a rock bottom street, a dreg of society and where everything that could go wrong did in this street. A caricature of a threadbare existentialism. Mainly bought on by social and economic deprivation.And then a natural supersession in the form of an epilogue Beasley Street Bouled recital, as the street had now changed into middle class suburbia.Next up Ive Fallen in Love with My We. A reference to marriage, the vows and marital bliss. Tongue in cheek of course.The \"bloody song\" Evidently Chickentown, was greeted with widespread applause. More nihilistic scorn and deprecation of a town, that is in a state of dys.Funny how we tend to laugh at the misfortune of others. But we do.Twat was another poem that represented consistency in tonights performance. A crowd pleaser for all times. Twat being the ultimate character assassination and castout. Bringing sporadic fits of laughter within the audience.The closing recital I Wanna Be Yours, famously adopted by The Arctic Monkeys for one of their songs, represented a slight U-turn in the writing of JCC. More linked to a character who wishes to show an undying love for someone . The positives of the human condition. Did I detect some optimism!The MacArts performance had poetry that mixes modernity with the historical. Comedic in value.When we laugh, we are laughing at ourselves. With him, not at him.

Police Scotland has indicated it would prefer the first option, to ease the enforcement of the ban.Furthermore, councillors are asked to consider undertaking a pilot scheme in specic towns, which could then be used to gather further feedback from the public."},{"url":null,"title":"golden-granny-hilde-aims-fashion-success","story":"AN archery gold medal winning grandmother at the British Transplant Games is setting her sights on fashion.Hilde Paxton from Clovenfords, who had a liver transplant shortly after her th birthday, struck the bulls-eye at Newport earlier this year.And the -year-old is already preparing to defend her title next year by raising vital funds for her Edinburgh Transplant Sports Team.Hilde is hosting a fashion show on Saturday, November  in Galashiels.She told us: \"Edinburgh Transplant Sports Team has around  members from all over the east of Scotland who take part in the Transplant Games.\"An important part of being a member is helping to raise the funds required for sending members to the British Transplant Games.\"The Colours Fashion Team will take to the Focus Centre boardwalk on the Saturday for an evening of glamour and casual wear.Included in the pound ticket price is a complimentary glass of Prosecco on arrival.As well as the fashion show, there will also be a grand raffle and a licensed bar.Tickets for Hildes fashion show, which starts at .pm for pm, are available from the Salmon Inn and Focus Centre, Galashiels, the Bridge Inn and The Gt Shop, Peebles, or The Hub in Innerleithen."},{"url":null,"title":"top-up-tap-plans-galashiels","story":"GALASHIELS is set to become the first town in the Borders to receive an official top-up tap.Scottish Water has already installed the water stations in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen, Dumfries, Dunfermline, Ayr, Oban and Fort William as part of its Your Water, Your Le initiative.As well as providing healthy drinking water, the refill taps will also reduce the number of plastic bottles which are currently in circulation.Scottish Water now want to install the top-up tap in Market Place -

That race took place over the course of last weekend.The series featured five rounds at dferent venues, and each race was set up like a car rally, with untimed uphill transition stages leading to ious timed downhill sections, the results of which were amalgamated into an overall race time. The stages ied massively in , from as little as  seconds to an absolute behemoth we endured at Laggan in April which took us  minutes to ride! The topography and trail surface dfered wildly from venue to venue but also from stage to stage, and the taped trails we raced down last weekend at Fort William epitomised this eclectic set-up.Stage  was the easiest and least technical track we have raced on all year, an entirely man-made sprint through flowing banked corners coated in compacted quarry dust. Of course you had to be careful you didn`t push too hard, it is all too easy to wreck a race run by hitting the deck on an easy stage. We assumed that the organisers were trying to lull us into a  sense of security with stage #and we were so right!Stage  started halfway down the legendary World Cup track , channelling riders through some savage rock gardens before cutting off to the right along a lung-busting fireroad before descending into another sculpted hardpack track which then erted down a horrendously muddy, freshly cut chute that was littered with roots big enough to swallow a bike wheel whole. Even walking down it was impossible.A big transition ride towards Torlundy took us to the top of stage , which was the famous Blue Crane trail running into Ridgeline. Both of these tracks are black-graded on a good day, but there is a huge dference between trying to ride these ‘for fun’ and then trying to race on them once  people have spent a whole Saturday skidding them to bits in the tipping rain! A lot of people fell foul of this stage, but we survived and we absolutely loved it.Stage  was a dferent animal altogether. We had tackled it fairly early on practice day and hadn`t had any issues with it, but the swarm of maniacs who had ridden it in the rain since our earlier visit had turned it into an absolute swamp and the ruts were so deep that I found it almost impossible to negotiate with my limited skills. Dave telling me afterwards that he had romped it didn`t help my mood one bit!The last  stages were so high up the mountain that we needed a trip on the gondola to get to them. The black graded Top Chief track is a fearsome animal that follows the best twisty bedrock line around the hill before plummeting several hundred feet straight down off it into the tree line below, where it once again becomes sanitised into a flowing, twisty and utterly hilarious serpent of a trail that had riders drting and whooping all the way to the carpark. The organisers had cleverly split the Top Chief track into two stages, as there is a long section of perched wooden boardwalk high up on the mountain that is great fun to ride but would be far too dangerous to race on. Stage  was therefore very short -taking most riders about  seconds to ride- while stage  was a  minute monster. What a way to finish a season!So how did we do David was fastest of the three of us, as he has been all season. He finished in a time of  minutes,  seconds. He races in the Senior category , so it is a tough school littered with sponsored riders and crazy kids. He finished th in seniors on the day, and th overall out of an entry of  riders. Having failed to finish the race at Laggan earlier in the year due to a mechanical breakdown, David has been constantly playing catch-up but he still managed to finish in a brilliant nd place overall in the seniors category for the season.Alex has ridden consistently all year and has managed to tread the fine line between wrecking and ruling perfectly at every round. He had one of his very few crashes on the last stage at Fort William which cost him a few seconds, but he still ed a very respectable time of : to finish nd in the Masters category. The Masters section almost always attracts the largest entry and it is full of well-heeled chargers on very expensive steeds, so for Alex to finish in th place in that championshipin his first full season is a highly respectable result.I have continually been either on par or just slower than Alex on nearly every stage of the year, and nothing changed here. I knowI`ve kept within a few seconds of him I have done just fine, and I managed my ride to achieve this perfectly right up until the last stage where a cruel puncture right on top of the hill put paid to any chances of a good result to finish the year. With  top s already in the bag for the season though , I managed to hold onto th place in the Grand Veteran`s championship which was some consolation for a day that finished with me feeling, well, a bit deflated.Competing in this series has been a brilliant experience for us. We have had some hilarious times racing our bikes through some of Scotland`s very best scenery, and we have loved camping out of the back of vans. The organisers at No Fuss Events have done an outstanding job of setting up a professionally run race series in some dficult locations and have always managed to tread the right side of a precarious line, providing us with stages that have been just barely on the rideable side of ridiculous!David Muirhead leads Alex Dickson down the rocky Top Chief track during Saturday#s practice.

A high-energy showing in Paisley saw the McFadyens-sponsored side run out convincing winners.With the match going ahead at the Kibble’s grass park despite the heavy rain overnight and during the week leading up to the game, the surface was in surprisingly good condition, allowing the Pupils to get into their attacking flow early on.Up against a home side not lacking in height and physical stature, the Pupils had to be ready to contend with some lofted early balls from back to front by the hosts, whose game plan seemed to be to get the ball to their forwards as quickly as possible, but the Pupils# defence of Fraser Wylie, Ross Souden, Ryan McConnachie and Stuart Crossan, stood up to the task well.The Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils quick passing and inidual pace and skill in the final third caused the hosts problems early on, and Ryan Gilchrist and Gregor McFadyen, and both had almost identical attempts to score, but snatched at their shots at the vital moment.However, the Kintyre Park side would not be denied for long, and scored after  minutes through a sharp passing move that released Gregor McFayden, who buried an arrowed shot from the edge of the box to continue his excellent goalscoring form.Then, the visitors made it - after  minutes, when an enterprising move out of defence found right-back Crossan, whose ball through to Johnny McCormick allowed the right winger to cut inside onto his left foot and release a thunderous first-time drive into roof of the net for a great goal, his second of the season.After seeing their deficit doubled, Carlton for their part put their Kintyre visitors under a bit of pressure from several corners and free kicks, but the Pupils’ defensive discipline continued to win over.Into the second half, the Pupils made it - when Donald McCallum scored another great goal, in a move started by Liam Renton, whose in-swinging corner was cleared to the edge of the penalty box where the ex-Dumbarton man McCallum made space to drive a deflected shot into the top corner of the net.At this point in the match, all three subs were used, with Ellis Robertson and Michael McKinlay replacing the excellent deep-lying midfield pairing of Ryan Gilchrist and Liam Renton, and Ross Brown entering in the fray in a direct swap with winger McCormick.The youngster Brown quickly got involved to create the Pupils# fourth goal, outpacing the Carlton full-back to draw out the last defender and square the ball across for Scott Souden to cheekily chip the ball over the home keeper into the net.The rampant Pupils completed the scoring in the th minute after hesitation between a Carlton defender and his keeper allowed McFadyen to nip in, touch the ball round the keeper to score a simple but well-earned second goal, for his brace on the day, and his fourth of the season.At the other end, the Pupils were determined to get their second consecutive clean sheet in league action, and while young keeper Alistair Ferguson spilled a deflected free kick in the latter stages, he bravely ed at the feet of the striker to smother his effort. The Pupils management noted how Ferguson’s kicking and distribution was first-class throughout the match.A Pupils spokesman said: ‘It was a great team effort, with our attacking players working together to cause problems all game. At the back, we defended high balls and direct play really well.’The Pupils are in league action again tomorrowwhen they welcome Argyll rivals Lochgilphead Red Star.

George reminisced: ‘It was announced at a Town Council meeting that the Royal couple was scheduled to visit. It was all to be top secret, but that didn’t happen. The next morning the #secret# was ulged in a queue in one of the town’s shops and the news was out.’With a smile that showed how fond these memories are to him, George continued: ‘The Royal Yacht Britannia was anchored out in the loch and a small boat brought the Queen and Prince Philip to the quay where my father was delegated to catch and secure the rope. They were then driven to the Town Hall and there was a huge crowd present.‘Campbeltown Gaelic Choir, conducted by Mr M G McCallum who was also a councillor, had a lovely surprise for the Royal visitors. Prince Charles had just been made Prince of Wales, so the choir sang ‘God Bless the Prince of Wales’. This was very well received, and the Queen said that she had not heard it before.’George and Mrs McMillan were present at a reception given by the Town Council in the Town Hall. George remembers that he shook hands with the Queen and spoke with the Duke of Edinburgh. He said: ‘Only those invited could speak to the Queen, but the Duke moved among the gathering and spoke to some of the councillors. I was a coal miner at Machrihanish at that time and he asked me and some other miners about our work.’He continued: ‘The food and drinks were served on silver trays by waiters in tails and bow-ties. Afterwards, when the couple was taken on a tour of the town, the heavens opened and oh how it rained and rained.’A town councillor from May  to its disbanding in , and then a councillor on the District Council and the Strathclyde Regional Council, George was to meet the Queen and other members of the Royal Family on other occasions.

Despite signicant effort over the last  months, it has not been possible to conclude the sale of the Campbeltown Creamery.When it became clear that a sale to a third party was unlikely, the local Kintyre farmers launched a plan to take over the creamery. Despite considerable work to find a way to take the business forward, especially from their steering group, advisers, the Scottish Government and staff at Campbeltown Creamery, they have not been able to find a financially viable long-term business plan for the creamery.Commenting on the announcement, Shelagh Hancock, chief executive, said: #We are disappointed that it has not been possible to conclude a sale of Campbeltown Creamery. We fully appreciate that this decision has signicant consequences for colleagues at the creamery and the local community, but it is important that we act in the best interest of the wider business and our farmer members and continue with the solid progress we have made in strengthening and developing First Milk.#We regret the impact this decision will have on our colleagues and are committed to treating those affected fairly and with consideration during this dficult time.#Throughout the last  months we have been in regular dialogue with our local members on Kintyre about the future of the site. Nothing will change in respect to their co-operative membership of First Milk, and we will continue to collect and pay for their milk on the same basis as before.#James Barbour, chairman of the Kintyre steering group, added: #It was the right thing to investigate all avenues to seewe could keep the creamery open in Kintyre. There was widespread enthusiasm from the local farmers to try to secure the future of the site and genuine support from First Milk, the Scottish Government and the local community, along with a successful crowdfunding campaign.#Despite all of this we were not able to find a financially viable long-term solution for the creamery. I would like to thank everyone who has supported us through this period.#John Smith, NFUS dairy chairman and local Kintyre dairy farmer, said: #My heart goes out to all the staff that work at the creamery and it is regrettable that the Mull of Kintyre brand that we have passionately supported will now no longer be available. That is due to the harsh, economic reality of processing milk in an incredibly tough dairy industry that has witnessed so many casualties at both farm and processing level in recent times.#While this is very disappointing news, it is reassuring that all of the local farmers are members of First Milk and will continue to benefit from being part of a national co-operative with an evergreen contract and continuing to have their milk collected in the future.#"},{"url":null,"title":"harvest party reaps food bank donations","story":"At the group#s harvest party on Wednesday morning, each child, dressed in ious costumes, some spooky and some sweet, brought an item to donate to the food bank.Kintyre Toy Library meets every Monday and Wednesday from .am to .am, and on Thursdays from -pm, during term-time, in Springbank Evangelical Church Hall.For £ entry, children up to school age enjoy a range of arts and crafts, as well as songs and stories."},{"url":null,"title":"leader november 1 2019","story":"It is devastating news for the Kintyre economy that one of the area#s biggest employers looks set to lose up to  per cent of its workforce.It must be devastating news for all CS Wind UK#s staff, with the uncertainty surrounding jobs made all the worse in the lead up to Christmas.The company#s next potential order is due for production in , so there is a future for the factory and we are sure the company is doing all it can to secure that future.Our fingers are crossed that the talks with Argyll and Bute Council, the Scottish and Westminster governments and other organisations are successful in finding a solution to the shortfall in orders.By chance, the news of redundancies at CS Wind came the same week as Amazon revealed its power purchase agreement with a Kintyre wind farm.Attempts by the Courier to confirm the location of the wind farm were unsuccessful but,it comes to fruition, it is to be hoped it will bring jobs to the area."},{"url":null,"title":"springbank and machrihanish help graces pals raise cash","story":"Two nights’ accommodation, a VIP tour and tasting at Springbank Distillery, and a round of golf for eight people at Machrihanish Golf Club were the star lot at an auction in aid of the charity.This was part of an event held by Blairmains Farm Shop and Coffee Bothy in Blairlogie, near Stirling, run by the Logan family and Meg Filshie, who are friends of Kintyre#s David Allen.David and his we Cynthia moved to Campbeltown just over six years ago when David joined Springbank#s sales team.

What is it I always do riddles when I tell stories. I think of riddles and stories as close cousins which support each other.A good brain-teasing riddle is usually fun, and children in particular love the challenge of solving a riddle, as well as making their own ones up.Irsquom often greeted with pleas for ldquoTim, tell us one more riddle when I enter a school, and Irsquom often challenged to solve a riddle made up by one of the children.They are an ancient form of learning and entertainment.The first discovered written riddles are close to , years old. They were written in Cuneorm, the writing of the ancient Sumerians.A shortened and simplied version of one of these earliest riddles is: ldquoA house you enter blind, but come out with sight. What kind of house is it  The answer is a school, although some may raise an eyebrow at this answer.Perhaps the most famous riddle from antiquity is the Riddle of the Sphinx to Oedipus, recorded in ancient Greek around the fth century BC: ldquoWhat is the creature that walks on four legs in the morning, two legs at noon, and three legs in the evening The answer is a human being. When a baby we crawl on four legs, as an adult we walk on two legs, in old age we need a third leg .With my now continuous painful knee, this riddle has particular relevance for me, although Irsquom stubbornly resisting the stick!I use riddles as ice breakers in storytelling sessions and as an engagement technique because they quickly hook an audiencersquos attention since they are, by their nature, interactive.But they are also great fun to use with the children in your family.I use them to help distract and calm my younger ones when they are fractious. I use them in the morning when the kids are getting ready for school so they concentrate on them while they are getting ready.We make the riddles about the things we can see and the things we are doing, for example: ldquoTherersquos a big one and a wee one and three in between, we are two families of five, we are all going to nursery, but we are usually not seen. Who are we  The answer, of course, is my sonrsquos toes!For younger kids, itrsquos important to repeat riddles they already know the answer to. It helps them learn the riddle and how wordplay works. It also teaches them the rhythm of how they are told.My four-year-old is getting pretty good at this, although the answers to his own made-up riddles donrsquot always make sense.That doesnrsquot matter at this stage, whatrsquos important is hersquos developing an understanding of how they work and it encourages him to look for things to make riddles about.His nearly six-year-old sister likes to challenge him too.Her riddle ldquoI am short when I sit, I am long when I jump, what am I  had me thinking for some time before I got the answer: a frog.To make a riddle, think of the answer first. Then work the riddle up to the answer. It involves thinking about all the dferent qualities, uses of and parts of the answer and how they can be twisted or described dferently.For example, a shoe has a tongue but canrsquot talk, a clock has a face and hands but no body, a river has a bed but doesnrsquot sleep.Once introduced to riddle-making, children can get really engaged with it. A group of seven-eight-year-olds in a P class challenged me last week with a riddle they had made up themselves: ldquoI have a brain full of teacherrsquos knowledge, I crash without moving, I freeze while staying warm, what am I  The answer is a computer.Some riddles rhyme and it can be an extra challenge to think of a rhyming riddle, but they donrsquot have to rhyme.It really is a fun and rewarding activity to make a regular habit in the car, dinner table, on a walk or even a bedtime riddle.To help you out, there are literally thousands of examples of riddles in books, on the internet, in history, films and ones you hear. But the best ones will be those made up yourself, and the more you do it, the better at it you will become.And the benefits of riddling regularly with your family can be signicant, especially for children. It can promote critical thinking, encourage the observation of the world around us, help language development and can be a powerful bonding process with your child. And itrsquos fun!And so when next time you are with your kids, grandchildren, nieces or nephews and find yourself waiting for food to be delivered in a restaurant or have no time for a proper bedtime story, or you just want to spend some quality time together without a screen, try make riddling part of it. Trust me, it will be fun.Oh, and the answer to the well-known riddle at the beginning  Itrsquos a coffin."},{"url":null,"title":"positives-negatives-plans-haddington-town-centre-says-group","story":"Proposals were revealed by the Courier last month that would see a complete revamp of Haddington town centre.Dozens of spaces could be removed from High Street and Market Street, with the introduction of cycle lanes, wider footpaths and a communal space on High Street.The proposals have been met with concern by businesses in the town centre, who fear that the removal of up to  spaces ndash and the introduction of a car park of more than  spaces on Whittingehame Drive ndash could have a negative impact on their way of le.Haddington and District Community Council heard from both Haddington Business Community Partnershipand residents last Tuesday before asking non-community councillors, including the Courier, to leave to discuss the proposals in private.Now, a sub-group ndash made up of community councillors Jan Wilson , Fiona McEwan , Paul Darling , Pat Lemmon and Jack Worden ndash is to meet to draft a letter to East Lothian Council outlining concerns and any positives regarding the scheme.Mrs Lemmon said: ldquoAll community councillors managed to finally see the draft plan that has already been submitted to Sustrans.ldquoThere are some positives but there are also negatives.ldquoSo the community council has formed a sub-group, which is meeting on Tuesday to draft a letter to East Lothian Council.

The River Esk snakes around the edge of the course.Prof Crofts expressed concern that dogs could easily swallow them, resulting in ldquolarge vet bills for owners.After ing the balls to the club, he has issued a call for the flood protection scheme, currently being drawn up for Musselburgh, to include measures to slow down water coming off the Pentland and Moorfoot Hills where the North and South Esk rise.Prof Crofts, of Musselburghrsquos Eskside West, a geography expert who has worked as a research scientist in Scotland, said: ldquoAlong the golf course there are very soft banks and you can see where they have been cut back, and probably there was some rough at the end of the fairway where lots of people have lost balls.ldquoWe cannot stop leaves and tree trunks being brought down the river but the speed of rise of the water level and its velocity shows that any flood prevention scheme for Musselburgh needs to look hard at measures to slow down water coming off the hills and into the river. Without this, the erection of walls being proposed in Musselburgh will not be public money well spent.ldquoMany of us feel the importance of the amenity of this stretch of the river ndash it is very fine.He said a tree planting scheme using native species should be discussed with landowners in the headwaters of the Esk catchment area, as government grants were available for such work.He said: ldquoI am talking about hundreds of thousands of trees maybe. Careful hand planting of trees is best rather than using tractors to dig ditches to prepare the land for planting as this would aggravate the problem by increasing the rate of water running off the hills. The trees would take up water from the soil.ldquoThe use of the reservoirs on the North and South Esk and the temporary flooding of the flat land along the river should be seriously investigated to store water during heavy rainfall and therefore slow the release of water into the river.ldquoIf you look at the flood issue, itrsquos caused by the river rising very fast but itrsquos made worsethere are high spring tides and a storm surge in the North Sea, and also a northerly wind across the estuary which piles the water up high and stops the river water escaping for a couple of hours either side of high tide.Professor Crofts has raised his concerns with consultants who are drawing up the Musselburgh Flood Protection Scheme and he has also made local councillors aware of his views.As for the coast, he highlighted small sand dunes which formed a natural barrier with grasses, which, below the ground level, had yards of roots acting as a natural catcher of the sand.Jackie Lambert, captain of Musselburgh Golf Club, said: ldquoThe club was unaware of the issue regarding golf balls being found on the beach near the mouth of the River Esk.ldquoWhilst, the figure of  golf balls is signicant, it is unknown over what timescale these balls have accumulated andthey are all, indeed, from the course.ldquoNotwithstanding this, the golf club will happily participate in any working group looking at the wider issues of flood protection and the environment in and around Musselburgh.

This was inevitable as she had been travelling one hour each way to get to Dunbar and, even though subsidised by us to make the journey, a two-hour commute is simply not sustainable.Mr Bruneau warned of the impact of demands on private nurseries in April this year when his nursery in Haddington saw its grades fall in an inspection. He said: ldquoThis is a systematic problem which is causing a death spiral in the quality of nursery provision throughout the industry.The inspection report on Dunbarrsquos Pumpkin Patch rated its quality of care and support, staffing and management and leadership at twowith the environment rated a three .The report said that parents had contacted the inspectorate following its unannounced visit in August to discuss concerns.A high turnover in staff was raised by a number of parents, with one telling inspectors: ldquoOften when I drop my child off I have to introduce myself and my child to the agency staff.The report said: ldquoParents told us that they often did not know the staff when they dropped off their children in the morning, often resulting in their children being reluctant to attend.Mr Bruneau said that the introduction of mandatory SSSCregistration was creating recruitment problems throughout the industry.He said: ldquoBefore the advent of SSSC registration, our group of nurseries never used any agency staff as recruitment was simple. It included people of ying ages, experience and circumstance.ldquoIt was a healthy labour market now new staff are iniably under , inexperienced in le, work and certainly the care of children.ldquoNursery closures are inevitable as sites struggle to find staff, maintain standards and satisfy increased demand.He said his company had decided to rationalise itsservices, placing more experience in fewer sites, and called on the Scottish Government to reverse policies he said ruled out more mature staff from working in nurseries.He added that all five members of staff at Dunbar had been offered places at his other nurseries.A spokesperson for East Lothian Council, which used the Dunbar nursery as a partner provider, said: ldquoWe have worked with Pumpkin Patch as one of our partner providers, offering funded early learning and childcare for pre-school children for many years.ldquoOur officers have also provided extensive support to the Dunbar team to help them improve the quality of experiences following recent Care Inspectorate reports. Our assistance has been recognised and appreciated by the owners, who feel that we have done all we can to support them.ldquoWe acknowledge that this will have been a dficult decision for the owners and will have implications for their team at Dunbar. We also acknowledge the upset and disruption that the nursery closure will bring for parents using this service.ldquoOur staff will work with and support parents to find alternative early learning and childcare within the area that meets their needs.A Scottish Government spokesperson said: ldquoMore than , children are already benefiting from the expanded entitlement after we increased training opportunities and routes into the early learning and childcare sector, resulting in a record ,-strong workforce.ldquoWe are working alongside local authorities and providers to ensure the necessary workforce is in place ndash including running a national early learning and childcare recruitment campaign, increasing support for training places and modern apprenticeships, and enabling providers to advertise jobs free on the MyJobScotland website."},{"url":null,"title":"josh-taylors-girlfriend-says-boxing-star-dedicating-world-title-win-late-dad-means-world-me","story":"Josh, from Prestonpans, beat American Regis Prograis in the final of the World Boxing Super Series at super lightweight at Londonrsquos O Arena on Saturday.Speaking from the ring, he dedicated his win to Daniellersquos dad James Murphy, also from Prestonpans, who died on September  at the age of .Josh said: ldquoI want to dedicate this fight to my father-in-law, who passed away on September .

Teachers know there is no quick fix.Many respondents valued the additional resources that have come with PEF, but others questioned how much impact the relatively small amounts allocated have made in the context of broader funding, resource and staffing cuts across the education sector.Where concerns arose, they were often founded on decisions being taken without the involvement of teachers. In too many schools, the decision on how PEF is spent is often taken without appropriate consultation with the teachers working face-to-face with young people every day.:A poundm shambles -Questions grow over fund to help deprived Scots childrenAnd sometimes PEF is funding a service which should be mainstream funding - for example, to pay for campus police officer posts.

Teachers may be quite scepticalthey feel that PEF is just covering for cuts where.Whilst recognising that PEF is not perfect, however, the EIS regards it as valuable resource which can help to reduce the impact of poverty on educationit is spent wisely to achieve that, decisions on expenditure should involve the whole school community.Larry Flanagan,EIS General Secretary"},{"url":null,"title":"clutha-families-ever-satisfied-fai-outcome","story":"The findings of two important inquiries this week both into disastrous events that began with simple things sparking a series of reactions that then lead to harrowing outcomes.The first phase of Sir Martin Moore-Bickrsquos inquiry into the Grenfell Tower disaster described how the blaze began as an electrical fire at the back of a residents fridge freezer. Behailu Kebede, in flat , was found to be entirely blameless, having done all the right things on being woken by his smoke alarm and spotting the fire.:Clutha crash caused by pilots failure to check fuel pumps, inquiry findsHe called for help, closed the kitchen door, alerted neighbours and waited for the fire brigade. Hours later  people would be dead.What becomes more complex - and what is under dispute - is who was, then, to blame for the events of June , . There has been outrage at the suggestion the London Fire Brigade is responsible and pleas that fire fighters should not be made scapegoats for the fatal incident.At the same time there have been calls for the services chief, Dany Cotton, to resign after failures from the service to alter its \"stay put\" advice to residents inside the burning building. Sir Martins report makes clear that more could have been saved had the building being evacuated sooner.The inquirys second phase, expected to be finished in , five years after the fire, will be a deeper investigation into how the fire could have happened in the first place.Footage being shared earlier this week showed Boris Johnson in , responding to concerns raised about cuts he made to the fire service while Mayor of London, with the words \"get stuffed\". The video of the meeting, held not long before the Grenfell disaster, shows a colleague of Mr Johnson raising the issue of a lack of fire safety in housing as a result of the cuts. Get stuffed.It seems far too simplistic to blame the fire crews when, at the top, there was such utter disdain for the service and the resources needed for fire safety.:Inside Clutha pub after helicopter crash revealed as FAI rules pilot errorAt the Clutha Fatal Accident Inquiry it was clear from the start that families of the victims who died when the Police Scotland helicopter crashed through the roof of the Glasgow pub did not want the pilot to face sole blame.Instead, they wanted to know whether there had been systemic failings at the top - was there a problem with the helicopter  Had there been problems with training or management or maintenance It was a far cry from the last major Fatal Accident Inquiry in the city when automatic sympathy for the driver of a bin lorry that ran out of control on Queen Street and killed six people quickly turned to disgust as it became apparent he, Harry Clarke, had lied about previous health problems.Yet in the one case where blame did appear to sit with the man at the bottom, rather than come from the top down, Mr Clarke faced no criminal charges.While suspicion of pilot error had been an immediate suggestion and then constant explanation almost since the day of the crash, the Clutha families, and bar owner Alan Crossan, were clear that they did not simply want Captain David Traill to take the blame for the deaths of their loved ones.Captain Traills fianceacutee Lucy Thomas was represented at the inquiry, which ran from April to August this year, and her QC, Shelagh McColl, asked that Captain Traill - an \"extremely accomplished and experienced pilot\" - not be blamed for the crash.Sherf Principal Craig Turnbull could not give her what she asked for. His findings stated that the crash could have been avoided had Captain Traill followed procedure set down in the Pilots Checklist, realised that two fuel transfer pump switches were \"off\" and so not sending fuel to the supply tanks, and switched these on.Had the switches been turned on, there was enough fuel on board to feed the twin engines and the helicopter would have made it back to Glasgow Heliport.This is baldly put and stood out as unfair to the families who had heard evidence lead which gave reasons why Captain Traill might not have checked the switches and why he might not have responded as per the Pilots Checklist in response to low fuel warnings.Captain Traill was wrong to ignore the five low fuel warnings that sounded during the final flight but the court heard clear reasons - relating to issues with fuel sensors in the EC helicopter - why he might logically have ignored them.A less highlighted fact, and one important to mention, is that Sherf Turnbull also found that had Airbus included an aural attention-getter that sounded when both fuel transfer pumps were switched off, the crash might have been avoided.So, disappointment for the families with regards to blaming Captain Traill and not anyone further up the chain.Disappointment too at feeling removed from the process of the inquiry which they waited six years to attend.On behalf of Mary Kavanagh, the partner of victim Robert Jenkins, QC Donald Findlay said that those who died and their families had \"merited scarcely a mention\". It was a sentiment repeated by those loved ones who turned up day after day to the inquiry and sat, dignied, through what must have been evidence traumatic for them to hear.Some wanted questions put to the emergency services who had attended the victims. \"No evidence has been led to show what more,anything, could have been done to save them,\" Mr Findlay again. \"It is submitted that this is what people would wish to know and are entitled to know.\"Of course families wanted clear answers to their questions but, without a black box recorder in the helicopter, any answers were only ever going to be hypotheses. The sherf, too, cannot be solely motivated by pleasing the victims and relatives when conducting a fatal accident inquiry. That is not his role.For those intimately involved it is impossible to separate emotions from proceedings and emotions do not always guide us well.However, it has been acknowledged by James Wolffe, the Lord Advocate, that the FAI system must better involve the bereaved and survivors with improved information sharing. He had pledged additional funding to achieve this, and to speed up a system whereby y delays can further traumatise victims.Sherf Turnbull, in his Clutha conclusions, also highlight the issue of the impact delays have on those involved.The families of those who died in the Clutha accident are not satisfied with the outcome of this inquiry but they will perhaps be satisfied with these acknowledgements.One certainty, at the end of six years, is that the families involved deserve praise for the dignity with which they conducted themselves throughout.

He identied some of the capitalist criminals Labour is coming for, including Sir Jim Ratclfe of Ineos. Though its not clear under what law the polluting plutocrats could be prosecuted.So, is this class war in the UK  Are we on the road to Venezuela  Whatever the polls say, a Labour victory this Christmas is quite possible with Nigel Farages Brexit Party now splitting the Tory vote. There is a powerful mood for change in Britain. But what would a Labour government actually look like We have never had such an avowedly radical Prime Minister ndash not even in , when Labour was led by a small ldquoc conservative, Clement Atlee. However, Labour reality would be rather dferent from the rhetoric. Burrow into Labours policies, and what emerges looks more like reheated social democracy, circa, than a Bolshevik revolution.For a start, we can largely ignore the issue that ided the party so bitterly in recent times: nuclear weapons. Jeremy Corbyn may be a le-long member of CND, but Labour is no longer a unilateralist party. Its  manesto committed a Labour government to renewing Trident almost indefinitely.But Mr Corbyn will still enter Number Ten with a raft of left wing policies, from seizing corporate assets to abolishing private schools as well as taxing the rich till the pips squeak. However, many of the headline policies will never make it to first reading, let alone the statute book.Abolishing schools like Eton would involve y court action, not least from faith schools, and the home school movement, who might also be affected. Labour is more likely to confine its assault on educational privilege to axing tax reliefs worth about pound.billionSimilarly, seizing ten percent of the shares of companies with more than  employees would be fiercely resisted in the courts by share-holders. They have deep pockets. I suspect Labour would confine itself to increasing corporate taxes, ending zero hours contracts and restoring trades union rights ndash all of which are eminently doable.Indeed, looking behind the radical rhetoric, much of Labours policy agenda is surprisingly modest, viewed form Scotland. Measures like free personal care, abolishing university tuition fees, child care for  and  year olds, scrapping the right-to-buy, lting the benefits cap and the bedroom tax - these are all achievable.Indeed, the Scottish Parliament has already achieved them, bar the welfare cap. Nicola Sturgeon will no doubt remind the Labour leader of this repeatedly in coming weeks.Nationalisation is a policy that used to be seen as ldquoloony left but is no longer. Taking rail into public ownership shouldnt be too much of a problem, since Network Rail, which owns the track and signalling, is already in public hands. The service franchises could be replaced as they come up for renewal, without needing to hand billions in compensation to Virgin and the rest.Waterand energy would pose greater problems, not least because most of our energy companies are foreign-owned ndash often, ironically, by state-owned bodies. But with a good wind it should be possible for Labour to find a way. Public attitudes to public ownership of utilities have changed out of all recognition since the s.Similarly, there is broad public support for Labours Green New Deal. A majority of voters agree there is a climate emergency. Though they may not agree with the measures needed to tackle it.Labour is not going the full Extinction Rebellion route of making Britain zero carbon by . But its own policy, passed at conference, is still pretty radical. It commits a Labour government to making Britain zero carbon by . Thats only five years longer.We are talking about the most radical change to our lestyles since the industrial revolution. Labours policy would mean decarbonising transport, home heating and agriculture in a decade. Millions of cars would have to be scrapped along with millions of home heating boilers. Air travel would all but cease.Labour promises a huge investment in renewable industries, to compensate, but that is unlikely to replace the jobs lost in the car industry, oil and gas, road haulage, retail.So expect the Green New Deal to become somewhat lighter green in government. There is likely to be a rt between the Thunberg-supporting ldquode-growthers and Labour MPs, who traditionally see economic growth as the best way to address poverty and inequality.However, Britain already has a rather good record on eliminating greenhouse emissions, and this will continue, albeit with the  taget reduced to % net zero. In sum, Labour offers a practical social democratic programme which could be very attractive to voters, especially younger ones. However there is one very big problem: Brexit.Labour is committed to negotiating a new Withdrawal Deal to replace Boris Johnsonsand to putting this to another Brexit referendum. This will consume a vast amount of political capital and will surely dominate the first year of a Labour government.Mr Corbyn wants to reintroduce the Customs Union, and Brussels would probably agree to that. But Labour also want close regulatory alignment with the European Single Market, which the EU  would probably reject. If Britain wants to be in the single market, it will have to join the single market, probably via the European Economic Area, along with Norway.Labour could go along with that in the end, since it wants friction-free access to the EU markets. Single market membership would solve the Irish border problem, for sure. But it would also mean Britain continuing to contribute to the EU Budget, while having no say over decisions taken by Brussels. Customs Union membership requires oversight by the European Court of Justice, which will displease many.But that wouldnt be the main problem. If Labour got this wonderful deal, including workers rights and environmental standards, and got it through parliament , would it really then campaign against it in the confirmatory referendum Interviewers have largely stopped asking this question, because they never get an answer, but Europe remains a huge question mark hanging over Labours government agenda.Labour is still a Brexit party, though you wouldnt know to listen to most MPs. Many figures in the party are closet Brexiteers, like Jeremy Corbyn himself. Others are openly pro-Brexit, like the party chairman Ian Lavery and the MPs who voted for Boris Johnsons Deal.Equally dedicated Remainers ndash mostly Blairites and supporters of the deputy leader Tom Watson ndash would fight back, insisting that Labour effectively promised to back Remain in the general election. Brexit wrangling could delay the confirmatory referendum and ide the party, just as it split the Tories.Corbyns enemies will ignite further ision by condemning him as antisemitic. It will take immense powers of leadership to prevent a Labour government being halted in its radical tracks by Brexit. The question for voters is: does Jeremy Corbyn posses it "},{"url":null,"title":"herald-view-voters-deserve-derision-denunciation-deceit","story":"Thatrsquos because the central issue, Brexit, is by its nature isive. In Scotland, we have the additional but equally isive issue of independence. Current polling and conventional wisdom suggest that the Conservatives should obtain a majority across England and Wales, and the SNP will perform very strongly in Scotland. But as the last general election campaign and the current unreliability of polling have shown, those apparent positions could be quite dferent by December .There are the usual unforeseeable factors of any campaign: blunders by candidates, external events, issues other than those the parties anticipatecoming to the fore. Even without those, however, the arithmetic is fiendishly tricky to calculate. No one knows the degree to which, for example, support for the Conservatives ndash or, for that matter, many Labour MPs ndash may be undermined by the Brexit Party. Nor the extent to which tactical voting against Brexit may benefit the Liberal Democrats or the SNP.It is assumed that the strength of Remain sentiment bodes well for the Nationalists, but  per centis not a negligible proportion of the electorate ndash itrsquos more than the SNP secured at the last general election, when they took  per cent of the countryrsquos Westminster seats. Andthe focus turns from Brexit to a second independence referendum, it is as likely that Unionists will vote tactically as it is that Remain and Leave voters will. Given the number of marginal seats, how hotly they will be contested, and the first-past-the-post system, any of the parties could see gains being offset by losses.The picture is just as unclear where in the UK splits in either the Leave or Remain votes could allow unexpected gains for almost any party. Butpoliticians and their most vehement supporters can have no certainty about the results, nor should they claim a monopoly on the truth, or moral virtue, of their arguments.One expects candidates and activists to paint themselves in the best light, and their opponents in the worst, but ision should not be exploited to mislead and to coarsen public discourse. Even before the campaigns have begun, there have been unpleasant instances of abuse ndash and equally dangerous attempts to claim robust criticism, within the normal bounds of political speech, amounts to abuse. There may be little prospect of restraining the more extreme rhetoric which appears on social media, but the electorate deserve an effort from those who seek their vote to conduct themselves honestly, and to give consideration in their thinking, rhetoric and pledges to those who may vehemently disagree with their position.Division may be unavoidable we may also fail, in the end, to get a genuinely decisive result.

Stott said the site had expanded as it grew more popular with backpackers and tour companies.He said: ldquoIt had started to spread out to the point where it was taking over a huge section of woodland, as opposed to the actual Clootie Well site itself, which is, letrsquos say,  yards by  yards or something like that.ldquoThe cloots had actually extended out to  or  yards. It was just a huge expansion of the site.ldquoBut at the actual site round the Clootie Well itself, we didnrsquot remove anything other than possibly inappropriate stuff such as umbrellas, sunglasses, a pair of trainers.ldquoThere was a colossal amount of stuff around that was totally inappropriate.However, Mr Stott said those involved were careful to show respect to people who had placed genuine offerings around the well.He added: ldquoItrsquos peoplersquos wishes, peoplersquos hopes, obviously, that they are hanging on these trees.ldquoWe did it with as much respect and dignity as we possibly could.He continued: ldquoThe idea basically is you hang up a wee bit of cloth, and as that cloth biodegrades it draws away the illness of the person who you have hung it up for.ldquoSo thatrsquos the theory,you like, or the history of it. But things like sunglasses are clearly never, ever going to biodegrade.He said those who initially expressed concerns over the clean-up were reassured once the purpose of it was made clear.And he suggested an annual drive to keep the surrounding area tidy could be in order in future.He added: ldquoI wouldnrsquot quite say we havenrsquot scratched the surface, but Irsquom quite sure the same exercise could be done again and it still wouldnrsquot actually affectthe character.ldquoI would like to see some kind of annual event ndash done tastefully, done as a family thing, just to make sure that we keep on top of the non-biodegradables and we donrsquot end up back in the same situation.Clootie wells ndash or sites drawing on similar traditions ndash can be found where in Scotland and the UK, but few possess the unsettling atmosphere found in Munlochy.Its strange power even inspired elements of Ian Rankinrsquos novel The Naming of the Dead.While it is associated with a holy well, such healing traditions pre-date Christianityand the area has become an important site for those with a iety of beliefs and none.Maree Morrison, of Forestry and Land Scotland, said  volunteers took part in the clean-up from the local communities of Munlochy, Avoch and Knockbain, as well as from further across the Black Isle and Easter Ross.She said: ldquoThe site was expanding rapidly, with the surrounding woodland being badly affected by non-biodegradable items as they built up over the years.ldquoThere were cloots tied around trees and information posts in the car park.ldquoThe items had crept out from the well up to  metres out into the woodland, and the local community felt that it was getting too much and was detracting from the traditional nature of the healing well.Ms Morrison said volunteers removed a iety of unsuitable items including empty dog poo bags, entire pairs of jeans, a window blind and even an electrical sander.Forestry and Land Scotland is now requesting that any offerings left at the site are restricted to natural cotton or wool. Any plastics, polyesters or other materials will be removed."},{"url":null,"title":"tom-gordon-sturgeons-pitch-voters-may-not-survive-spotlight","story":"But elections are like the old joke about making God laugh. How to do it  Tell him your plans. This election, already as flaky and unpredictable as any I can remember, will not be dictated by the crossed fingers of party leaders.Try as they might to plot a particular course, they will be buffeted and blown about. Events, the Kryptonite of politics, come thick and fast in elections, and this one promises events galore.Mr Johnsonrsquos decision to press ahead for a Christmas poll already looks ropey. Nigel Farage and the Brexit party threw him for a loop yesterday with a choice between a pro-Brexit pact endorsed by Donald Trump or a split Leave vote.The PM has also had to grin weakly through multiple TV interviews about his failure to get Brexit done by October  despite his do-or-die bravado.The doubters, the doomsters, the gloomsters, they got it right. He failed. He may try to blame parliament, but itrsquos the same parliament that was there when he made his promise. His sales pitch in the Tory leadership contest was that he, uniquely, could break the impasse. Boris the Bold was supposed to wrestle MPs into submission or toss them out the ring and get some new ones. Instead they gave the gloating grappler an octave-raising wedgie.The relentless nature of election campaigning means party leaders are never able to retreat from their mistakes and let a storm blow over. There is always a camera or a microphone barrelling towards them. There will be a price for such an enormous flop.Pledges and policies are also inspected and dissected in the public square in a way they seldom are outside of an election. What starts the day on paper as a tidy soundbite can end it a disheveled mess. Positions that at first appear reasonable can turn to nonsense when chewed over at .Take Ms Sturgeonrsquos comments yesterday on having a democratic double-dip in . Out campaigning in Leith, the First Minister predicted a Labour government would grant a second independence referendum.Mr Corbyn has said he is open to it, subject to a few years delay to let Labour get underway in office, and provided it follows a democratic process, perhaps a fresh mandate in a Holyrood election. Ms Sturgeon seemed very confident.Talking to the media, she said: ldquoEveryone knows, you all know, therersquos going to be an independence referendum. The opposition parties might not yet have got round to conceding that point but they and know and everybody knows it.Ms Sturgeonrsquos dream scenario is a minority Labour government that needs SNP support to survive, giving her the leverage to secure Indyref.Labour counters that the SNPrsquos hand would not be as strong as it thinks. It has no nuclear option. Ms Sturgeon could hardly swing behind the ToriesLabour refused to oblige, or let the government fall and the Tories in. The SNP would be accused of another , when it helped oust Jim Callaghan and along came Margaret Thatcher.But a minority Labour government would not really be in a position to play hardball with the SNP. To legislate for the transformation Mr Corbyn promises, it would need the votes of SNP MPs. A deal between the SNP and Labour,not a formal coalition, seems a credible bet in such circumstances.But then Ms Sturgeon was asked a series of follow-up questions. The more her position was interrogated, the shakier it became. Would she compromise on her timetable of Indyref in the second half of   ldquoNo, Irsquove set out my timing. Is there a public appetite for two referendums in   ldquoYes. Is there a risk a Remain vote would diminish support for independence  ldquoNo, I donrsquot think so.Mr Corbyn claims he would get Brexit done in six months by having a Peoplersquos Vote. Which should come first - EU referendum or Indyref  Here Ms Sturgeon said something extraordinary. Apparently the order doesnrsquot matter.ldquoThe most important thing is not what comes first, itrsquos about why these things are important, ldquo she said.ldquoA second EU referendum is about giving the whole of the UK a chance to escape Brexit. A second referendum is about giving Scotland the chance that never, ever again, on Brexit or anything , do we find ourselves in a position where our future is being decided by the likes of Boris Johnson, not the people who live here.But the order is so obviously important itrsquos almost asthis stuff is being made up on the hoof. If Scots voted first for independence they wouldnrsquot get a vote on Brexit. The die would have been cast. Itrsquos also obvious Labour would prioritise its UK-wide promise on Brexit ahead of Indyref.So , in line with Ms Sturgeonrsquos plan, there were two votes in , it would be EU first then Indyref. But what would that look like  The SNP would have to campaign for Remain despite Brexit being the grounds for Indyref. Activists might be a bit queasy about unpicking their lsquotriple-lockrsquo mandate.Andthe result was Remain - and assuming Indyref wasnrsquot axed off as a consequence - the SNP would have to go back to the country immediately and argue it didnrsquot matter. Remain, Leave, whatever, we still need independence.That would echo early , when Ms Sturgeon first called for Indyref because of Brexit. She was ahead of public sentiment then. The two issues didnrsquot seem sufficiently linked to justy a new referendum, and the SNP was punished a few months later at the election for indecent haste.Since then, sentiment has moved in the SNPrsquos favour and independence and Brexit are seen as closely linked, the former offered as the way out of the latter. Ms Sturgeonrsquos efforts to fuse the two has paid off, with support for independence rising due almost entirely to No-Remainers becoming Yes-Remainers. Butshe gets her Remain result next year, she must convince a knackered nation to separate then again. Itrsquos a muddle.Ms Sturgeon might argue that, evenit is Remain, Scotland darenrsquot risk another Brexit-like disaster inside the Union. But whatrsquos like Brexit  Is there another white whale out there  Would voters be irresistibly drawn to more constitutional upheaval after settling four years of it just in case If thatrsquos the plan, I donrsquot think itrsquos only God whorsquoll be laughing."},{"url":null,"title":"fleabags-hot-priest-inspired-new-influencers","story":"A vicar influencer who has been compared to Fleabags \"hot priest\" has said he is trying to \"invade social media\" with a message of hope.The Rev Chris Lee, , has more than , followers on an Instagram account on which he mixes snapshots of his home le featuring his we and daughters with \"-second sermons\" and theological musings.\"Social media is a tool, its neither good nor bad, but a lot of the time its used for a very vain pursuit in a superficial way,\" Mr Lee said.\"Im trying to invade that space with faith, with positivity, with hope.\"Most of the time what people see on Instagram is someone saying, look how beautul I am, look how good I am, and Im trying to say to the person watching, youre beautul or youre valued or youre loved.\"Mr Lee, who is the vicar at St Saviours Church in west London, came to the job by an unusual route.With a house, a mortgage and career in business by the age of , he found himself looking for something dferent and moved to Tanzania initially to teach English at a mission.With the Bible as his main teaching tool, he began \"thinking more about God and hearing his voice\", so he stayed and did a distance learning degree to become a priest, eventually being ordained a deacon in the diocese of Mount Kilimanjaro at the age of .At the time he moved to St Saviours four years ago, his brother-in-law was also setting up a couple of YouTube channels -

I have done that during the time I have been Deputy Speaker. I have exerted authority with kindness and courtesy and the attitude and atmosphere I have generated from the Chair is one of keeping things calm rather than whipping up aggression.Throughout the interview, the MP for Epping Forest since  chose her words carefully and one had to read between the lines to get a sense of what she really thought of Mr Bercowrsquos Speakership good on modernity, not so good on his sometimes forceful treatment of MPs.ldquoI believe in doing things properly I believe in the rule of law, she insisted, adding: ldquoThe way in which we make our laws should not only be fair but be seen to be fair.The Scot, who has been Deputy Speaker for six years, explained how in some ways Parliament had developed a split personality.ldquoIf you have MPs from all dferent parties in the queue in the tea-room, everyone is absolutely lovely. People are laughing and joking with one another and having nice conversations about their families. The atmosphere is great.ldquoWhen you have same group of people on a quiet Thursday afternoon debating something to do with autistic children, you still get a group of people working well together for the common good, acting in a courteous and pleasant way.ldquoThen we come onto PMQs or the Budget debate or Brexit. Aggression takes the place of argument. High octane, unpleasant interaction. Thatrsquos a point where we have to take action to calm things down.Dame Eleanor, who this week was at the sharp end of a Government whip shouting aggressively at her from just a few feet away during the early election debate, suggested it was an ldquoage-old reality that women did things dferently from men.ldquoThe less testosterone the better the behaviour, she declared.Askedshe was suggesting Westminster had become something of a Jekyll and Hyde Parliament, she replied: ldquoYes. We have. Thatrsquos right. It is almost Jekyll and Hyde. Itrsquos so sad we are observed to behave in a certain way when  per cent of the time we behave decently. I want that to be  per cent of the time. Itrsquos a challenge but itrsquos not impossible and it could be achieved in pretty short order.ldquoWersquore going to have a new Parliament and a new Speaker andI were in the Chair I could get this new Parliament off to a good start.As well as calling for a ldquocomprehensive review of how the Commons works, including how to improve relations between Westminster and Holyrood, Dame Eleanor also made clear that one policy adopted following the  independence referendum was not fit for purpose: English Votes for English Laws or EVEL for short.This law, which requires matters affecting just England to have a majority of English MPs to pass, has proved controversial with a charge of creating two classes of MPs and another that it politicises the role of the Speaker as he or she determines when EVEL should be applied.ldquoItrsquos not working well. I never liked it, I never supported it. I see it working from the Chair in a way which people have not paid attention to. It ought to be reviewed.Askedshe personally believed it should be abolished, the Scot replied: ldquoYes. Itrsquos a very good principle that you shouldnrsquot make long-term laws to solve short-term problems. Another good example is the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act. A long-term law to solve a short-term problem in  which has backfired badly.She pointed out thatthe FTPA was not scrapped, then ldquowersquoll have to have every General Election in December.Having spent another afternoon schmoozing with colleagues in the Commons tea-room, Dame Eleanor seemed upbeat, saying how colleagues had been pledging support for her candidacy.ldquoI have had such good reactions from colleagues over the last few days I have been touched by the support I have had and how lovely people are being, she purred.But there was a rider. ldquoCome on, this is an election within Parliament not everyone who said they would vote for me will do so. But itrsquos very nice for people to come up to you and wish you good luck and say: ldquoIrsquom with you.rsquo Why botheryoursquore not Askedshe was confident she could win, there was an extended pause which might have given the game away. ldquoIhellipthink there is every chance I can do it.Dame Eleanor and the rest of us will know on Monday afternoon just how MPs have really voted.

Indeed, they still do in benighted foreign lands. But, here, we complain that it might be too dark or a bit nippy and, evenit isnrsquot, we canrsquot be bothered because wersquove got busy schedules of reality TV to watch.And all this in the run-up to Christmas tae. The Dailycartoonist Matt quipped: ldquoAt least a December election will put paid to all that lsquoSeason of Goodwillrsquo nonsense.The cry also went up: ldquoBut what about the nativity plays  The what now  I havenrsquot been to school for a while, and never paid much attention when I was there. But are they seriously still forcing the inmates to re-enact scenes from the Middle East , years ago  Come to think of it, I canrsquot remember having these at my primary school. Maybe that was just Leith, right enough. I think we only did May Day and Leninrsquos birthday.It would be finethe election was all about Leith Man but the doughty old port suffers from the disadvantage of being Scottish and so could never be representative of Britain. Instead, theyrsquove decided that itrsquos Workington Man who should be the successor to previous incarnations of electoral barometer such as Essex Man and Worcester Woman, not to mention ious vehicular representatives such as Mondeo Man and White Van Man.The Pebbledash People were also adduced at one point, but the least said about them the better. In Leith, theyrsquod have been put up against a wall.The Workington Man concept comes from centre-right think-tank Onward, and is predicated on targeting older working-class Leave voters without degrees in gender studies or vegan sociology, who are worried about crime and immigration, which liberals living in prosperous, all-white areas say they ought just to thole.Itrsquos currently a Labour seat with an unrepresentative Remainer MP, which has led many stout proletarians to say theyrsquore going to vote Conservative this time. Thatrsquos well weird. But itrsquos the same in other northern English towns like Warrington and Wigan where, as one psephologist said, most voters would normally never give the Tories the steam from their tinkles.But now, feeling alienated from and despised by the haut-liberal establishment, many are thinking of going further than offering not just the vaporous by-products of micturition but also their votes.Not all of them are saying this, of course. Some Workington citizens have taken offence at the stereotype pinned to them, and many proletarian Leavers simply could never vote Conservative, even with clothes pegs on their proboscises.Itrsquos the latter vote that the Brexit Party of Mr Nigel Farridgeis banking on picking up. Yesterday, at the launch of their election campaign, the spiv-style statesman said that,the Tories thought they were going to win northern English Labour seats, they needed to get out of the office more.He believes his party are better placed to take the Labour Leave vote because, unlike the Tories, they donrsquot yet have a history of being horrible. The Brexit Party might plausibly claim also to be a broader church, apparently including even some ex-Communists, and as far as I can make out, it hasnrsquot overtly extolled the virtues of the enslaving free market as Boris Johnsonrsquos Tories do at every turn.Of course, a few people in Workington and where will continue voting Labour on a tribal basis, believing it still to be the party of the working person . The partyrsquos launch this week showcased several attractive proposals for punishing the rich, with even some encouraging talk that there should be no billionaires in Britain, and itrsquos possible that decent people everywhere might support this.But maybe not in Workington, which has had enough of Labour promises. Irsquom guessing that old industrial Leith, meanwhile, will stick with the SNP, particularly with its attractive policy on trans-gender issues.As for how Irsquom going to vote, Irsquom afraid itrsquos not my place to say.++++IF you were genuinely open-minded, and not a liberal, you might concede that there are some things to admire about Boris Johnson. Well, two: the humour and erudition.And, of course, there are a few things to dislike, including the not inconsiderable fact that hersquos a Tory. However, a clinching factor against him for many decent ratepayers is the fact that hersquos a cyclist. And,the account of one former journalistic colleague is anything to go by, he typies the breed.Stephen Robinson recalled: ldquo[Following] Boris on a bike is a very dangerous undertaking indeed. When traffic is gridlocked, Boris shimmies along the inside lane, propelling himself with his left foot along the kerb. He crosses red lights, he cuts up the largest lorries.Textbook stuff. Voting is an important business and, when weighing up candidates, it is important to consider several factors: their hairstyle, football team, alcohol intake and mode of transport.Few people beyond the pedalling narcissi themselves would knowingly vote for a cyclist. My own view is that, as with bald people, cyclists should not be allowed to vote never mind stand for election. However, Irsquom aware that this policy is not popular among the closed-minded.++++A SURVEY of , adults found the majority wouldnrsquot dream of going to the cinema or dining out on their own. The study, commissioned by hotel brand Staybridge Suites, also found many wouldnrsquot attend the pub or the football or a museum on their own.How peculiar. The only one I concur with is dining out. I used to do it when younger, not knowing it was problematic. But I soon noticed I was getting stared at by other diners, most often those couples who never exchange a word.Chinese restaurants were the worst. In two establishments, I looked up to find the entire staff staring. And they donrsquot flinch when you stare back.Of course, I cannot discount the possibility that I look bizarre. Somebody once said I resembled a character from The Lord of the Ringsand itrsquos true also that I used to be a martyr to red-face disease rosacea .But none of that is an excuse for such bovine staring. So,dining alone is called for, Irsquoll do it in rather than oot, thanks.++++WE live in fast times. By the time I finish this sentence, many of you online will already have moved on, to find something bilious about Brexit or fitbarsquo or dancing cats. Losers.However, I cannot say Irsquove been bothered by the furore over a new Netflix feature allowing viewers to speed up or slow down films and TV shows.Itrsquos mainly film-makers and actors whose underwear has been formed into a bent, curling or distorted shape by the development. They say the move has a similar effect on the artwork and resent such interference.But itrsquos long been available on DVDs, and I canrsquot remember using it much.

The opinion polls, putting the Scottish Tories on just  per cent, down almost eight points since their impressive performance in , point to losses among their  seats where the SNP is the main challenger in all of them.But Mr Jack was having none of it, insisting that in fighting hard to retain all  Scottish seats, the Conservatives, by promoting themselves as the party of Brexit, could win more, possibly by getting supporters of Nigel Faragersquos party to switch to them.ldquoIf they back Brexit, the only party that is going to deliver Brexit out of this General Election is the Scottish Conservative Party. If you want Brexit, vote Conservative, declared the Secretary of State.He acknowledged: ldquoWe do start from  per cent but we also have the Brexit Party with six or seven per cent. We are the party that can deliver Brexit. We have a Brexit deal which we will be putting into our manesto and we will be the only party going to the electorate and saying give us a majority to get Brexit out of the way, get Brexit finished.But, of course, while Brexit might dominate the battle for No  south of the border, the perennial constitutional question is once again set to be at the forefront in the political fight north of it.With the SNP making clear that ldquoScotlandrsquos right to choose will be the central plank of its campaign, Mr Jack indicated that ldquostanding four-square against a second independence referendum would be at the heart of the Conservativesrsquo.A recent snapshot placed Scottish independence on  per cent support, causing the First Minister to claim that tide for Scotland breaking with the Union was on the rise.Askedshe was right to make the claim, the Scottish Secretary declared: ldquoI donrsquot accept that because the poll, which the Andrew Wilsonrsquos Commission suppressed, showed  per cent of those who voted to leave the UK in  have now changed their mind and the Survation poll that came out on the fth anniversary of the Scottish referendum on independence showed  per cent of the Scottish population wanted to remain in the United Kingdom.ldquoWe have a really strong case to put on that. Separation would be a terrible thing for Scotland. As we leave the EU we need to strengthen the Scottish economy and we will do that by taking away uncertainty, explained Mr Jack.Ms Sturgeon has insisted thatthe SNP got a majority of Scottish MPs at the election, then that would be an ldquoirresistible demand for indyref and the UK Govt would be dutybound to facilitate a second vote.ldquoNo, she absolutely would say that, wouldnrsquot she, declared the Cabinet minister.He argued that the Nationalist leader ldquopersistently finds reasons to promote independence and her call for a second vote to ldquodistract people from the real problem in Scotland, which is, after a decade in power, they have failed to improve our NHS, failed to improve our education service, failed to improve public services. So, they distract us by constantly harping on about independence.But askedhe was saying that evenMs Sturgeon and her party succeeded in getting a majority of Scots MPs at the election, they would not have a mandate for indyref, Mr Jack replied: ldquoIrsquom absolutely saying they would not have a mandate.ldquoTo me, itrsquos very simple. We had a once-in-a-generation, her words, once-in-a-letime, she and the First Minister at the time Alex Salmond used those expressions, referendum in , we had that, the people of Scotland decided to stay in the UK and they should respect that referendum and they should respect the referendum in , which was a UK one.He went on: ldquoWe do not need and we do not want to have another independence referendum. We should take separation right off the agenda, deliver Brexit, which got a majority of  votes in Parliament, the Second Reading of the Bill, come back, deliver Brexit and start focusing on the good things wersquore doing for Scotland the City and growth deals, bringing COP to Glasgow next year. Letrsquos start delivering on the good things we can do for the Scottish economy, growing that economy, growing peoplersquos prosperity as part of the UK.The Secretary of State stressed how Scotland had suffered the ldquodouble whammy of ision with the  and  votes and the task for a new Tory government would be to seek to heal the nation under Mr Johnsonrsquos premiership.ldquoBoth those referenda have been very isive but not just in terms of politics but in terms of families, relationships it has not been a good period in our history but we have to get Brexit sorted, push back the independence question, and start pulling together. We are all in the same rowing boat and letrsquos pull on the oars together. Thatrsquos my message.Last night, Ian Blackford for the SNP made clear thathis party did secure a majority of MPs in Scotland the UK Government could not stand in the way of indyref.ldquoAlister Jack has to recognise we already have a mandate for an independence referendum from the  elections. This time round we will be asking people to support Scotlandrsquos right to choose. The Conservatives cannot ignore democracy, he declared.In the interview, Mr Jack also said:*a new Tory Government would not seek to rush through a Withdrawal Bill in December as there would be ldquoenough time in January to do it*the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act, that restricts Governments in how to call an election, had ldquonot served us well in the last month and I would suggest we revisit it when we *eventhere had to be a ldquoflextension to the December  Implementation Period, the UK would leave the Common Fisheries Policy in  monthsrsquo time and*getting Brexit done would open up the ldquosunny uplands of potential trade deals with other countries."},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-independent-scotland-within-touching-distance","story":"She said \"another clear win\" for the SNP at theGeneral Electionnext month will \"bring it even closer still\".The SNP leader is the headline speaker at the event in George Square, her first speech at an independence rally since the  independence referendum campaign.Ahead of the event, she said: \"A vote for the SNP is a vote to escape Brexit, and to put Scotlands future in Scotlands hands - not Boris Johnsons.\"This election really is the most important one Scotland has faced in modern times.\"So much is on the line - people are completely fed up with the mess at Westminster.\"But George Square will be packed today as people from all backgrounds join together to demand a better future for Scotland.\"An independent Scotland is closer than it has ever been.

Our ersity is our strength.\"Those people who are still to decide need to be offered a positive, hopeful vision about how we can live in a fair, equal, sustainable country, and why independence will help.\"But Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard insisted: \"The last thing Scotland needs is another isive independence referendum.\":Nicola Sturgeon says Labour will grant IndyrefMr Leonard, who will be campaigning in Coatbridge on Saturday, said: \"While Nicola Sturgeon is speaking to her own supporters, Labour is out on the streets of Scotland speaking to voters.\"We are putting forward our positive case for a Labour government that will scrap Universal Credit, introduce a pound-per-hour real living wage and deliver pound billion of extra investment in Scotlands public services.\"Scottish Secretary Alister Jack meanwhile said the SNP would \"absolutely\" not have a mandate for a second independence referendumwins the most seats north of the border on December .The Tory MP told The Herald newspaper: \"Im absolutely saying they would not have a mandate.\"To me its very simple.

Just over  pairs of bike lights have been purchased using funding from Police Scotland Safer Communities for this purpose.#Visibility is key to keeping cyclists safe on the roads and I would encourage cyclists to ensure they wear bright reflective clothing and illuminate lights on their bikes, both front and rear, in order to make themselves more visible to other road users,# said chief inspector, Matthew Webb.#This is equally applicable during the day, but more important at dusk and when it#s dark, to avoid collisions and warn other road users to their presence.#Some cyclists wear dark clothing and particularly on faster roads they can be almost invisible to drivers until they are close to them.#He added: #I recognise in this rural community that a lot of the measures are equally applicable to the equine community and they are more than welcome to make use of the same free offer.#This initiative has been supported by the Orkney Road Safety Forum who will assist with the distribution of these lights, which in addition to the police office, are available from the OIC hubs and Scottish Fire and Rescue Service Community Safety Advocacy.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

especially by the police.Academics raised concerns about \"deficiencies\" in such new technology, and also claimed it was \"intrusive\".In submissions to MSPs on the Scottish Parliaments Justice Sub-Committee on Policing, they argued for a moratorium to be put in place.In its submission, Police Scotland was clear the force has \"no current plans to introduce live facial recognition software or any other new biometric technology\".But Angela Daly, from Strathclyde Law School, urged the committee to \"become an international leader in ethical technology policy by recommending a moratorium on the use of facial recognition technology in Scotland, especially by police forces\".: First look: Wooden sculpture which robots helped make for VA Dundee unveiled as they are honoured in new exhibition: Hundreds of jobs created at Edinburgh Marinas new waterfront tech hub She argued for that because of \"the deficiencies of facial recognition technology, the intrusive ways in which facial recognition technology is already being used to monitor indiscriminately the general publicand the less-than ethical conditions in which facial recognition technology is being researched and developed\".Dr Daly stated: \"I urge the committee to consider deeply the impact on the privacy and other human rights of the general public in being subjected to invasive mass-monitoring by facial recognition technology used by police.\"Public place face recognition Dr Garfield Benjamin from Solent University in Southampton also argued Parliament should introduce a moratorium on the use of facial recognition technology in public places.\"This should ideally be permanent, or at least until signicant regulatory frameworks have been put in place,\" he said.He added: \"Should facial recognition ever be deployed in Scotland, an independent review and commissioner should be established.\"Police Scotland should focus their already constrained resources on supporting officers more directly to perform their duties and build trust with communities.\"He spoke out against the use of such technology, saying: \"There is an inversion of innocence with facial recognition.\"When a member of the public enters a space monitored by facial recognition, they are automatically placed in a police line-up.\"This fundamentally changes the role and power of the police, from one in which evidence is a case must be built to prove guilt into one in which everyone is assumed guilty all the time.\"Should Police Scotlandgo ahead with the use of facial recognition then they are making an active choice to sht policing into a state of constant surveillance, forcing citizens to live beneath a constant machinic gaze.\"Another submission, from Joe Purshouse of the University of East Anglia, together with Professor Liz Campbell of Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, and Dr Marcin Betkier and Dr Nessa Lynch, Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand, argued: \"Any use of facial recognition searching on the UK Police National Database may violate human rights laws, and has particularly serious implications for non-convicted persons, whose images are retained on that database.\"Mitigating concerns first They recommended facial recognition technology \"should not be deployed in a policing context until concerns over the technologys effectiveness and potential bias have been confronted and mitigated\".They went on to suggest a moratorium be put in place \"until statutory provisions specically regulating the use of FRT have been introduced and an oversight and evaluation system has been established\".Gillian MacDonald, Assistant Chief Constable with Police Scotland said that \"fundamentally, opportunities exist to use new technologies, such as facial recognition, to enhance police and law enforcement capabilities\".Police Scotland already has the capability to carry out retrospective facial matching for the prevention and detection of crime using the Police National Database, she said.She stressed: \"We have no current plans to introduce live facial recognition software or any other new biometric technology.\"But Ms MacDonald also said: \"To ensure Police Scotland operates efficiently and effectively it is vital that we continue to explore, scrutinise and adapt by embracing new technologiesand, subject to regulatory parameters, invest for the long term.\"She said the force welcomed plans to establish a Scottish Biometrics Commissioner, adding that Police Scotland would await the decision of MSPs on the legislation for this before proceeding with any proposed use of such biometric technology.Meanwhile sub-committee convener John Finnie said MSPs would \"closely study\" all the submissions they had received.He said \"While the police service need to be able to fight crime effectively, any intrusion into citizens privacy must be proportionate.

They weren’t just losing but being ground into the south-west London soil.We know now the miracle very nearly came off, with Scotland leading - on the last play of the game, only to let in England once again to close out a - draw. I doubt I will ever experience such eye-popping, man-hugging drama at a rugby match again. It was my team, my country, and I still get goosebumps thinking about it.: South Africa captain Siya Kolisi ready for shot at history: Defence coach says England can pile pressure on South AfricaBut whisper it up here, Scotland’s shock treatment might just have sparked England’s progress to the Rugby World Cup final in Tokyo, because since that March day they have only lost once, in August when a second string side including only six of today’s starters lost a World Cup warm-up - to Wales in Cardf. A week later, a team featuring  of today’s opening line-up thrashed Ireland -. The chances are anyone reading this column will already know whether Owen Farrell has held the Webb Ellis Trophy aloft orhe was down on his hunkers in despair as the honour fell to a victorious South African captain Siya Kolisi. And I should want the Cup to be raised for the first time by a black Springbok skipper.Pipe band member in But I don’t. I want to see the Veldt Leviathans cut open by the skills of Farrell and George Ford, honed on dimly lit rugby league grounds at Wigan St Pats and Bradford, because I’m supporting England. Always have. Ever since that collection of Esso  Mexico World Cup football coins was completed, I’ve backed England when they aren’t playing us.I was in the pipe band in  when Kenny Dalglish stuck the ball through Ray Clemence’s legs, my mates came back from Wembley the following year with tufts of grass and bits of wood they said were from the obviously tubular goal posts, and in  alongside everyone  I laughed along with Andy Cameron and ‘We’re on the March with Ally’s Army’ and sat stunned as we were undone by Cubillas and Peru. But it was striking how the rest of the country seemed to want Scotland to do well in Argentina, in contrast to those blokes who head to the pub wearing the football shirts of countries they can’t locate on a map when England play.In  I was playing for Preston Grasshoppers when the Grand Slam was won, where Wade Dooley was still learning his trade and couldn’t know he’d experience what it was like to lose to Scotland in a title decider six years later. That day I turned out for Furness RUFC from Barrow, the only Scot in a packed clubhouse where afterwards everyone patted my back and shook my hand asI’d actually been playing at Murrayfield. This morning I’ll be texting a couple of my team-mates from that day.A gun to Zeffirelli’s headYears living in England, playing rugby union and covering professional rugby league has made me feel as much part of their game as ours. The rest of the house is solidly behind England too, but at least my we can justy her support on account of actually being English. So the rest of the gang can claim red and white blood, but even so my hockey-playing daughterstill gets asked by some team-mates how she can support “them” when “we’ll never hear the end of it”. Well we never tire of Archie Gemmill’s goal or  and I’ll never forget Twickenham .There will of course be those who will say that it’s only to be expected from a Conservative, and a lot worse, although there are plenty of our persuasion who are in the Anyone-but-England camp. But I’ve never seen the need to wallow in every set-back suffered by English teams to demonstrate pride in my heritage and culture or the dferences between us, and I’m as quick as the next Scot when abroad to correct anyone who thinks I’m from where. Like the woman in Arizona who saw me in a kilt and askedI was Irish.I am reminded of the story told by Italian film director Franco Zeffirelli when he was a partisan fighter during the War. Trapped between Allied and German forces he gave himself up to what he hoped were friendly troops. “English ” he called, and thought his le was over when a soldier shouted back “No” in a guttural tone he didn’t recognise and put a gun near his head. The soldier hissed, “We’re f***ing Scottish.”Seven ministers in seven yearsTalking of culture, seven ministers in seven years is not a musical based on government departments, but it should be at the Department of Culture, Media and Sport, where this week Nicky Morgan announced she will be the latest Secretary of State to depart since Jeremy Hunt’s elevation to health in .For us in the news business, it’s a key appointment, but no sooner had the industry got to know what Maria Miller, Sajid Javid, John Whittingdale, Karen Bradley, Matt Hancock and Jeremy Wright were all about, than it was usually time to move on.Ms Morgan has only been in the job three months, not even enough time to pop into the News Media Association offices for a spot of lunch. Nowhere will her departure be more keenly felt than amongst the senior civil servants she leaves behind who have seen them all come and go but in such a short space of time were thoroughly impressed by the speed with which she mastered complex issues and her ability to absorb a brief instantly.If Ruth Davidson can be offered £k for two days work a month, the ex-education secretary and treasury select committee chair won’t be short of offers.Edinburgh Christmas market: Treatment of memorial benches a disgraceAsthe mesh of steel currently spreading across Princes Street Gardens wasn’t shocking enough, the pictures circulated on social media of memorial benches carelessly heaped up in a corner by construction workers like an abandoned game of Jenga symbolised an equal lack of concern behind Edinburgh council’s decision to let it happen.It would be going too far to say the council officers who allowed the Christmas Market operator Underbelly to proceed with their scheme without submitting a planning application couldn’t care less about the benches, but the evidence strongly suggests they didn’t care enough to make sure it didn’t happen.Administration councillors were quick to respond on Twitter to tell the public how terrible it was, that immediate action would be taken, that it shouldn’t have happened, but the fact is it did.At every meeting of Edinburgh council, we on the Conservative seats listen to one SNP councillor after another boasting about the fantastic job they are doing to protect the city centre, but on this occasion they are responsible for the despoliation one of Edinburgh’s most treasured places.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"interview scottish tory mp eleanor laing on her bid to replace john bercow","story":"Tory Eleanor Laing, the only Scot seeking to be Commons Speaker, is courting SNP votesFollow the road out of Paisley towards the Ayrshire coast at Largs, and you’ll pass a sign at the edge of the first village along the road.“Elderslie,” it reads, beneath some medieval heraldry of a sword wielding knight. “Birthplace of Sir William Wallace.”You’d be forgiven for believing it was the product of municipal nationalism. But as Tory MP, deputy Commons Speaker, and daughter of Elderslie Dame Eleanor Laing explains: “William Wallace is not the exclusive property of the Scottish National Party.”It was her father, a former district council chairman, who arranged in the early s to have the sign put up and raised money for a monument to Wallace in the village to be restored. One of Laing’s sons has Wallace as his middle name, and with a hint of mischief, she adds: “If I’d been around in the th century, then I would have supported William Wallace.”Laing, elected in  as MP for Epping Forest in Essex, is the only Scot in the other election - the race to succeed John Bercow as Commons speaker. Her west of Scotland upbringing, she says, is central to how she would approach the job.Like most of the candidates, Laing has pledged to take some of the drama out of the Speakership, and avoid Bercow’s flamboyant, often hectoring style. She has called for a comprehensive review of the governance of the Commons, which has been plagued by accusations of bullying and sexual harassment that outdated employment and complaints procedures have failed to tackle.Laing, who worked around Parliament for eight years before becoming an MP, has seen things improve, but not enough. “It’s based on a hierarchy, an old fashioned hierarchy, where there’s a man at the top with lots and lots of power, and then everyone  falls in under that,” she says. “Well, that’s not how I see things.“Of course it’s not the Scottish way, is it  Our constitutional heritage is that power comes from the people to Parliament. Power comes from the bottom up, not from the top down, and so should the way in which the House of Commons is governed.”While insisting she doesn’t want to be overly critical of Bercow, Laing adds: “We’ve had a series of Speakers who I think have rather liked having enormous power… it is extraordinary that the office of Speaker of the House of Commons is totally unaccountable. It’s accountable to nobody.”On being elected the first female president of the University of Edinburgh Students’ Association, Laing was described by the student newspaper as “a cross between Margaret Thatcher and Scarlett O’Hara”. “I was delighted,” she says.She describes being “quite shocked” after coming to work in London as a solicitor “at how static everything was, at how some people talked down to other people”.“There was an attitude thatyou weren’t from London or the Home Counties, and you haven’t been to Oxford or Cambridge, then there was something a bit inferior about you.“And of course, that just makes you fight back. I’m a feisty Scot – that just makes you fight back.”She has not been afraid to appeal to fellow Scots for support. When MPs gather on Monday to elect a new Speaker to chair the House of Commons, Scottish Nationalists will be likely to represent the swing votes.There are several high-profile Labour candidates, but she is the most prominent Tory as the hopefuls are whittled down in successive ballots, her supporters believe party loyalty and a few SNP votes could see her beat Labour favourites Harriet Harman, Chris Bryant or Lindsay Hoyle in a head-to-head.That’s why Laing has written to SNP MPs to ask “personally and directly” for their vote, and telling them she understands their “frustrations with the way things are done in the Chamber, based on the outdated two-party system”.Laing has pledged to “give greater weight to the third party” as Speaker in debates, and has said she will look into the problems faced by the parents among the Scottish MPs, whose children have dferent term times from parliamentary recess dates that are set by the English school calendar.When she sits down with The Scotsman, she suggests other reforms designed to appeal to Scots. Laing doesn’t support electronic voting, saying it’s important that ministers can be cornered by backbenchers during votes. “I have always taken the view that walking through the ision lobbies is an important part of a member of Parliament’s job, because that’s where you meet other people,” she says.But votes that take  minutes each and run late into the night could be made more practical, “possibly by having them at a fixed time, like in the Scottish Parliament. That works in Edinburgh. It might well work in London.”Laing is also highly critical of English Votes for English Laws, controversially introduced by David Cameron immediately after the  independence referendum to stop Scottish MPs from voting on devolved matters at Westminster that only affect England.“I have never liked English Votes for English Laws,” she says. “Everyone who is elected to this UK Parliament should be an equal representative of the constituency for which they were elected. And I don’t believe in having two classes of employees.“Of course, it wouldn’t be up to the next Speaker to change it. But it might be up to the next Speaker to point out to the government the failings of the system.”©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"nicola sturgeon scottish independence dream now within touching distance","story":"An independent Scotland is \"within touching distance\", Nicola Sturgeon will tell a pro-independence rally in Glasgow later.She said \"another clear win\" for the SNP at the General Election next month will \"bring it even closer still\".The SNP leader is the headline speaker at the event in George Square, her first speech at an independence rally since the  independence referendum campaign.Ahead of the event, she said: \"A vote for the SNP is a vote to escape Brexit, and to put Scotlands future in Scotlands hands - not Boris Johnsons.\"This election really is the most important one Scotland has faced in modern times.\"So much is on the line - people are completely fed up with the mess at Westminster.\"But George Square will be packed today as people from all backgrounds join together to demand a better future for Scotland.\"An independent Scotland is closer than it has ever been.

If Edinburgh and Skye do suffer from overtourism, what can we do about it  In a free country, we cannot stop people from coming here, evenwe wanted to.It should also be recognised that folk visit those two places for dferent reasons. Edinburgh is an architectural jewel which is at its most crowded during the annual festival. People come to Skye for the scenery — most notably in recent years to the Trotternish Ridge and the Fairy Pools, two undeniably beautul spots in an island which is full of other undeniably beautul spots.Edinburgh cannot be expected to cancel its festival, any more than we want to drain the Fairy Pools or blow up the Old Man of Storr.And we do not want to stop them coming. They bring money, which provides jobs and kickstarts enterprises and improves the island#s economic wellbeing even outside the realm of the local tourist industry.Professor John Lennonof Glasgow Caledonian University#s Moffat Centre is presently commissioned by another independent body, SkyeConnect, to carry out a major survey of the impact of tourism on Skye.Professor Lennon and his colleagues are not due to deliver their report until next spring. But he will offer a taste of its findings so far to the autumn conference of SkyeConnect next month.We look forward to both the sample and the full report. We can hazard a guess at some of its content.Skye has been #discovered# by the rest of the world, like a Caledonian Machu Picchu.Unlike the Peruvian Inca site, however, Skye is a very big island. Unlike Machu Picchu, it is not yet collapsing under the weight of its visitors# feet.Skye can — and Mark Crothall congratulated the Skyetime campaign for pointing this out — accommodate half a million visitors, and continue to benefit hugely from their spending, particularlycertain adjustments are made to the tourist itinerary.More people should be encouraged to spend a quiet and infinitely rewarding week in Elgol or Waternish, in all four seasons, than take a whistle-stop, bucket list summer tour of the Storr, the Fairy Pools and back to the bridge.And of course, local and national government should do much more to improve the basic infrastructure of the island, from roads and parking areas to public transport and public toilets.Skye has bucked the trend of the rest of the north-western Highlands and Islands by growing its population and its economy in recent years.That has chiefly been because of the tourist industry. After  years of steady and apparently irreversible decline, the growth quite naturally took everybody by surprise. We should now learn to adapt to it, rather than call it #overtourism# and hope that it goes away."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/001WH2510NCA-web.jpg","title":"west highland free press audio files friday 25th","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineEvery week, Skye  Lochalsh Council for Voluntary Organisations http:www.slcvo.org.uk  produces an abridged audio version of the West Highland Free Press.

Instead, it leads to the booze aisle in thelocal supermarket and to a drinking den out on the moor.In this, the maincharacter in Kevin MacNeil’s novel ‘The Stornoway Way’ is depicted as havingmuch in common with his fellow islanders, whether or not they absorb their localminister’s thunderous moralising. Theplay of the same name, which MacNeil also wrote, pulls no punches so far asdevastating social critique is concerned.There’s a lot in a name. RomanStornoway can be read as romance torn away. He is also R Stornoway. He is a religiouscuckoo in the nest and the key in a roman a clef. The character himselfacknowledges all this. As an everyman outsider, Mister S is meant tocommunicate a great deal about Lewis.Calvinism, alcohol and climatecombine in a pernicious cocktail that permeates people and place. Depression, repression and addiction are endemic.So are dreams of escape.If this is the desolate reality in which MacNeil’s characters are immersed, the play of the novel # staged by Dogstar Theatre at Sabhal Mor Ostaig last week # sugars the pill with scabrous wit, hilarious minor characters, and some truly moving songs, among them a traditional Gaelic lament rendered with crystalline clarity by Lewis-born actor Rachel Kennedy. It is a sublime moment where Roman reconnects with the culture he scorns. But the moment passes, and the song of loss and love is soon replaced with cynicism and tomorrow’s hangover.All good writing, whetherfor page or stage, interweaves the personal, the local and the universal. Roman’s war is with himself and with Lewishis dreams are of finding love and self-fulfilment. The universal arrives inthe shape of Eva, a Hungarian student who initially succumbs to Roman’s scatterguncharm, but who later comes to see him as self-obsessed and manipulative. Roman is certainly that. Heis also vulnerable, funny, and capable of great profundity.Self-fulfilment comesthrough music, and when Roman’s long-suffering best friend Eilidh organises asession for him in a recording studio in Edinburgh, the road to salvationopens. But Roman is a master at self-sabotage. Matters don’t quite go to plan.Naomi Stirrat as Roman,Rachel Kennedy as Eilidh and Chloe-Ann Tylor as Eva are all fine actors, and adeptat lively theatricality. As an ensemble,they tick like a Swiss watch, darting here and there without missing a beat. Andthey can’t half belt out a tune. As with all adaptations,there are issues concerning the episodic aspect of narrative fiction and how thisworks on stage, in real-time. In ‘The Stornoway Way’ scene transitions areheralded by brief drum patterns that wouldn’t sound out of place in an Americansitcom. But that is to cavil. MacNeil’s play is at least as good as his novel, and the novel was very good indeed."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MOD-GLW-19-LEARNER-JENNY-BLACK-1.jpg","title":"competition underway to create a flag for","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoinen.This weeksees the launch of a competition to design a flag, which will be recognised by the Court of Lord Lyon — the body responsible for recording and protecting all heraldry, flags and national symbols in Scotland — and will be flown and displayed as an emblem of the island at home and abroad., Highland Council ward members and tourism body SkyeConnect petitioned the court with the idea for a flag following the example of several other island areas and regions which have, in recent years, adopted a flag.Philip Tibbetts, honorary vexillologist with the Court of the Lord Lyon, is to visit schools on the island next week to deliver a series of workshops and presentations detailing his interest in flags, and discussing the themes which could potentially inspire a flag for Skye.It is hoped youngsters and adults will be keen to have a go at designing the flag, and enter the competition which will run from st November until st December, after which a  — made up of representatives from throughout the community — will compile a short list of final entries which will then become subject of a public vote in February of next year.or by post to Skye Flag Competition, c o West Highland Free Press, Unit B, Pairc nan Craobh, Broadford, Isle of Skye IV AP, the potential for both the design and subsequent usage of a flag for the island is incredible.”In addition to the information provided on this page, these links will be helpful:"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/LOVAT-STUART-MACDONALD-2-adj.jpg","title":"shinty hurling to take centre stage as scotland visit face ireland this","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineTwo Kinlochshiel players, Finlay MacRae and Donald Nixon, are in the Scotland squad for the senior shinty-hurling match.At under- level Alan MacRae has named a -man squad seeking to seal a second win in succession against the Irish.Skye#s William MacKinnon is in line for his debut, while there is also a place in the squad for Johnnie MacAskill, the ex-Kinlochshiel player, now playing for Glasgow Mid Argyll.

Anyone that met her - she took a piece of their heart straight away and they never forgot her.Ruby had to battle a lot day to day, but she did it with huge strength, she was fully depended on us   for all of her care. This was huge for us as a family.Ruby did not sleep at night. She had a lot of cerebral irritation and suffered from frequent seizures daily We, as her parents, were the only ones able to provide this care.This is where the Hospice played a huge part in our lives, Ruby attended the hospice for respite from the age of six months. The hospice is a home away from home that provides the most amazing care and love to the children and their families with full : medical care  .We, as a family, felt completely comfortable that Ruby was being cared for to the highest standard, in a place filled with love and joy. This gave us time to refuel to keep going that bit longer.The Hospice were also there for us in Ruby’s end of le care, we spent our final two days with her there, in the comfort of a home setting with the support of the nursing staff around us.This gave us precious time that we would never have got anywhere .We made memories that we will cherish forever and we are truly indebted to the Hospice for having such a signicant impact in our final days with Ruby.We decided to host Rubys Birthday Fundraiser last year and it was a huge success, raising an amazing pound,.

I continue to tell my story of grief and Ruby’s le on my blog Chasingladybirds it has been a good way help journey through grief and to also reach out to others in the same situation.Everyone that knew Ruby knew that ladybirds was her wee thing.When she was only a few months old a ladybird landed on her toes one summer day and thats where it all started.In my journey of grief I decided that blogging might be a good outlet and a good way to share my story and journey of grief.Chasing ladybirds came from our connection of ladybirds with Ruby, and Chasing was down to we will always chase Ruby’s memory.We will never forget our memories and love for her - we will always chase every moment we had with her.Lisa and her family would love ityou can make it to Rubys Birthday Fundraiser.Admission costs pound for adults and children go free.

The event will also see launch of a groundbreaking new report that outlines a framework for community development.The paper, entitled ‘We Must Dissent’, is the result of a community survey that assessed the human rights of local residents against the major issues facing the area. Amongst the issues identied were concerns around road safety, housing, health, education, and unemployment.Another key issue was the pressures of commercial land speculation in the area, which has presented an obstacle to the community development of the Lanyon Tunnels.Despite planning permission and £.million being granted for the development, plans have been stalled by owners of an adjacent piece of land – which was subject to plans to build a £million office block.In , residents won a legal victory when the High Court ruled that planning approval for office block was unlawful. However, the potential for future plans to develop the land could impede access to the tunnelsgiven the go-ahead.Speaking ahead of next Wednesday’s event, Fionntán Hargey from the Market Development Association said the tunnels development would provide a “massive boost to people’s self esteem”.“It would physically reconnect them to city centre and it would also reconnect them into the economic, social and cultural le of Belfast. “The tunnels got planning permission in , and there is £. million in funding sitting there ready to go, and there are three groups of residents trained up and they’ve got business places developed. We also have updated drawings that have recently been commissioned. “The issue is that there is a private developer who is refusing to grant access to allow the project to go ahead.”He continued: “Next Wednesday will refresh people on the latest concept drawings and give people wider overview of the Redeveloping the Local Economy programme. Our aspiration is that by January we will be launching a report, and we will have several groups of residents with business ideas that are on course for development.” Next Wednesday’s event will take place at pm in the Market Community Centre where guest speaker, Dr Sean Byers, will discuss the economics of community empowerment. There will also be a full project update on the Lanyon Tunnels."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ballotbox_pr8qo2.png","title":"north set for december","story":"POLITICAL parties in the north have put their general election machines in gear after MPs voted for a December  poll.The legislation is expected to be approved by the end of the week when it goes through the House of Lords. MPs votedfor the election by a mammoth margin of  votes to .Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he is ready to fight a “tough” election while Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the snap poll is a “once-in-a-generation” opportunity to transform the country.DUP Leader Arlene Foster said it is right the people of Northern Ireland have their say through the ballot box.“The DUP will use this opportunity to campaign strongly to send a message that Northern Ireland is better in the Union of the United Kingdom and we cannot be separated economically from Great Britain,” she said.“We have a record of speaking up for Northern Ireland in Westminster and delivering for everyone in Northern Ireland.“At a time of great uncertainty as to who will form the next government how Northern Ireland votes will matter as never before.“Unionists need their strongest team ed to so that Northern Ireland’s interests are protected in the next Parliament.That team is the DUP.“This election will matter and we will be campaigning for every vote as we take our message to the people.”Reacting to news of a pre-Christmas election, Sinn Féin Leader in the North Michelle O’Neill said it is an opportunity to reject the DUP, reject the Tories and reject the destructive role of Westminster on the north. “It is a welcome opportunity for the people of the north to have their say on the looming disaster of Brexit,” she said.#It is a chance to reject the DUP and the Tories, to reject Brexit and the Westminster chaos and its destructive influence on the north of Ireland.#Sinn Féin has strong candidates who work tirelessly on behalf of their constituents, and we stand ready to fight this election. “Sinn Féin has successfully made the case to the Irish government and Europe that the north’s special circumstances needed to be recognised to protect our economy against the Brexit catastrophe, to avoid any hardening of the border and to protect the Good Friday Agreement. “The DUP have ignored the democratic wishes of the people of the north, of business, of farmers, of retailers. The people of the north did not consent to Brexit. “There is no good Brexit for Ireland. “Westminster is in chaos. It has no answers and no solutions.“The Brexit debacle has shown that Westminster cannot, has not and will never act in the interests of the people of the north. “Your interests in this election are best served by voting Sinn Féin for a dferent future by sending a clear message to the British government that we want control of our own future through a referendum on Irish unity.#Alliance Leader Naomi Long said her party is best-placed to unite Remain voices.“This election will be mainly focused around Brexit and Alliance has always been clear there is no such thing as a good or sensible Brexit,” she said.“Therefore it will be an opportunity for people to have their say and elect MPs who want to avoid a hard border, protect the Good Friday Agreement and attend Westminster to represent their interests. “We are uniquely placed to do that, as the Alliance surge seen in May’s local government and European Elections showed the party could reach across all sections of our community and gain support from everywhere.“We have been preparing for an election for some time, as it is clear this Parliament is hopelessly ided and the Government has no legitimacy. Northern Ireland voted to Remain. “If people vote for Alliance candidates, we can increase the representation of progressive, pro-Remain MPs and articulate that voice loudly at Westminster.”"},{"url":null,"title":"former boxer brian magee limbers up for marathon in the big apple","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We have a very simple saying, Happy pupils, high expectation, high achievement and thats it in a nutshell.\"The school is well led by a supportive board of governors.\"Principal of Loreto Grammar, Omagh, Grainne OHanlon, said she was \"delighted\" at its joint top ranking, the first time it has topped the league table.\"It is the result of the professional relationship and trust which the teachers establish with the pupils,\" she said. \"Theres a strong, supportive pastoral Special Educational Needs and safe environment surrounding the pupils and thats fully endorsed by the parents.\"Its the overriding belief that our young girls are creative, talented and able, and with a lot of self belief and hard work they can achieve.\"Lumen Christi College principal Siobhan McCauley said her schools academic success is largely due to \"the excellent relationships that exist between students and staff\".She added: \"The strong support of parents coupled with the hard work and dedication of the staff enables our students, who are well-motivated and enthusiastic, to perform at the highest level and thus achieve outstanding exam results.\"Principal of Rainey Endowed Mark McCullough said the results were enabled by a \"three-way partnership between the school, parents and pupils\".\"Its a great accolade - we just work and do the best for them that we can,\" he said.\"Im absolutely delighted and would like to thank everybody for all their hard work.\"Principal of St Dominics in Belfast Carol McCann said that % of all GCSE grades achieved in her school were A* A.\"Our performance at GCSE is the highest it has ever been in the A* A grades,\" she said. \"We are very proud of the achievement, which is down to the hard work of the pupils, staff and parents, who have worked together.\"Our Lady and St Patricks College principal Deborah McLaughlin said her schools joint sixth position was \"testament to the positive attitude of our students, who are supported by our committed staff and our parent body\".\"Were very much a team,\" she said. \"It is a balance between academic and extracurricular activities for students.\"Principal of St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena Sean Rafferty paid tribute to the work of pupils, staff and teachers.\"I would like to congratulate the pupils, teachers and parents for their magnicent effort.

Theres not a chance he will split the vote.\"He would be committing political suicide,\" he said.\"He will eventually say that he has considered all the soundings that have been taken from his membership and he will give way, with the proviso that there should be a reciprocal move from the DUP in other areas.\"Mr Dodds is defending a majority of just over , and Sinn Fein voters in the constituency were hoping yesterday that the UUP would put up a candidate and enhance the chances of victory for their man, Belfasts Lord Mayor John Finucane.At Yorkgate shopping centre Jean Johnston from the New Lodge area said she thought a split vote could help Sinn Fein but she added that she wanted all politicians to do more to help ordinary people.Two other local women agreed. Kathy White said: \"The real priorities should be social issues like better housing. I am fed up hearing about Brexit.\"Geraldine Moore said: \"I will be voting for John Finucane.\"But I think the DUP and Sinn Fein will get their backsides warmed in this election. I think the changes in the law over abortion that Stormont couldnt stop were disgraceful.\"Back on the Shore Road, voters were hoping that Mr Aiken would plot a new course.\"He should up periscope and see the real world around him,\" said one DUP supporter.Another man, Alan Ritchie, said: \"Mr Aiken should take the UUP out of any potential race here in North Belfast..png\" title\"Alan Ritchie\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Alan Ritchie\"Splitting the vote wouldnt help unionism.\"Resident Ann Jones said: \"I have nothing against Mr Aiken.

In Dublin city in the mid-s, there were more than , Orangemen - comparative to north Armagh, the home of the Orange Institution. data-dfpadtargetingThe bookletsMr Dougan, who lives in Markethill, said: \"Orangeism had been in decline prior to the Great War, but the turbulent times of the Anglo-Irish War and the Civil War, when there were ious attacks in the early s, made it very dficult for Orange lodges to meet.\"It was a chance event that inspired Mr Dougan to begin researching the \"lost and forgotten\" unionist and loyalist history.\"There was a medal that came up for sale at Whites auction house in Dublin for Achill Island Orange Lodge and I was asked about it. So, that prompted me to start some research and suddenly I began to uncover lots of undocumented facts,\" he said.Mr Dougan regularly travels south of the border to give talks.Just last week he addressed members of Achill Island Historical Society about Co Mayo Orangeism which \"went down really well\", and other trips this year have taken him to Mayo, Cork, Meath, Dublin, Donegal and Dun Laoghaire.He said: \"Almost universally I get a reception of immense interest and a positive line of questioning. \"The history aspect is very eclectic, % of people have no idea what Orangeism is about.\"The booklets have been translated by Irish language scholar and university professor Dr Ciaran OCoigligh.Mr Dougan explained: \"They should be and are of interest to anyone who has a true, agenda-free interest in discovering Irish history. \"The Irish language is a part of le for many people and this is an attempt to bring this subject matter to a new audience.\"However, Mr Dougan, who has worked as a columnist for the Orange Standard, the newspaper of the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland, said that while he respects the Irish language, he is not in favour of an Irish Language Act, because of his concerns over how it would be \"imposed\" by Sinn Fein.\"One of the most sensitive issues at the minute in unionist and loyalist communities is that of an Irish Language Act,\" he added. \"It isnt really about the language directly, it is that our experience of Sinn Fein just does not trust them not to exploit itthey were given legal cover to do so. \"I fully intend to address the audience at the launch. I will tell them that I respect the language ... I will also tell them why I personally oppose an Irish Language Act, and why unionism in almost its totality opposes it.\" "},{"url":null,"title":"boy with leukaemia fulfils wish to find loch ness monster","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

They called on their peers to jointhe programme.Bloc Blinds in Magherafelt is one of those companies. Mark Wilson, IT Director with the town centre business, said: “Since our establishment only eight years ago, Bloc Blinds has become a leading employer in Mid Ulster. Our technology underpins our success. We are pleased to be a founding member of this Career Encode initiative to develop and nurture the talent we need to continue to grow.”Alan Davis from Magherafelt, who secured a Career Encode apprenticeship with Bloc Blinds, praised the scheme.Hed said “I found Career Encode to be a better alternative to university as it gives the ability to learn and work in a real workplace.”FP McCann was another high profile company involved with the apprenticeship scheme.The Knockcloughrim-based companys IT Manager Brian Law said: “FP McCann is one of the largest employers in the mid Ulster region. Our bespoke IT infrastructure and software is critical to the sustainability of our enterprise.“We were so impressed with the high calibre of the applicants that we offered two apprenticeships as opposed to one. We are looking forward to continuing our investment in a skilled IT team with the Career Encode initiative and would strongly recommend it to any business that is experiencing dficulties in recruiting staff with technology skills.”Ronan Rafferty from Dungiven secured a Career Encode apprenticeship with FP McCann.Ronana said: “I was very interested in the ability to earn money whilst getting experience within the working environment.”Working in collaboration with Northern Regional College, the schemehas already appointed  newIT apprentices who will build careers within a rapidly growing sector, which, according to the Skills Barometer Report , compiled by Ulster University Economic Policy Centre, will grow by % over the next decade.With this in mind Career Encode is seeking more Northern Ireland businesses to sign up to the scheme to ensure the IT talent resource here is not outpaced by demand.Camilla Long, Director of Bespoke Communications, which specialises in training and leadership development, is acting as an independent facilitator for theexisting  employers on the scheme.She said: “One of the biggest hurdles for businesses today is sourcing staff, particularly IT staff. This scheme allows participating companies to take the IT skills gap into their own hands by developing a future workforce for their business.“We had a phenomenal response to the first initiative with  young people of exceptionally high standards vying for  apprenticeships. We anticipate that the demand for next year’s intake will be so much higher.“The benefits for participating companies are about much more than alleviating technology staffing needs. Being part of Career Encode sends out a message to the next generation that you provide a workplace with a positive working culture that nurtures long-term career goals all while allowing you to develop employees with the skillset that you need for your future.”For further information log ontowww.careerencode googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He was jailed for three years in December  for causing death by dangerous driving and spent another three years on license.Marty’s parents, Martin and Elizabeth, have had to live with the consequences of the driver’s actions for the rest of their lives. It has also impacted on the lives of his brothers Richard and Ryan, and sisters Michelle and Anne.This week the Department of Justice launched a public consultation into a Sentencing Review. One of the offences up for debate are those “which may result in death, including causing death by dangerous driving”.It seeks the public’s views on whether the current maximum sentence of  years should be increased to le imprisonment or increased to a higher fixed number of years.The Department confirmed to the Derry News that a decision can be taken on these legislative changes in the absence of a minister.The Gallagher family are supportive of le imprisonment being introduced for such offences.Speaking to the Derry News yesterday, Marty’s father described him as a “great son” who got on with everybody and raised a lot of money for charities through his running.Martin said his son would’ve been a good footballer and got involved in competitive running when he was  or -years-old.On the day Marty was killed, his father was working and didn’t see him before he went into town but said he was joking about with his mother before he left.Martin and his we slept on the third floor of the house with Marty and Ryan on the bottom floor. About am Ryan burst through the door saying, “he’s dead, he’s dead”, and when they asked who they were left in a state of shock. “The man killed Martin at am and then went on to a party,” Mr Gallagher said. googletag.cmd.push  Photo: Marty Gallagher with friend Barry Smith after London marathon No closure Martin and Elizabeth were initially asked to call to the Racecourse Road to identy him but a PSNI sergeant then said it wouldn’t be possible because it was a crime scene. The police sergeant, who still keeps in touch with the family and whom Mr Gallagher described as a “good man”, wanted to spare them the trauma of seeing Marty’s injuries.The following day they were also advised against seeing their son at the morgue but when the coffin was brought home Mr Gallagher said they were in disbelief and it brought “no closure”. “You’re wondering was that Martin and waiting for him to walk through the door,” he added.The man responsible for his death appeared in court for the first time on Martin’s birthday, February . He was sentenced in December  with police saying it was one of the quicker cases of its kind to pass through the courts.“First of all we tried for murder and they wouldn’t give it to us,” Martin recalled. “Then we tried for manslaughter and they wouldn’t give us that either, why, I don’t know.“I think the reason it went through so quick was because the girl testied who was in the back and actually shouted to the driver, ‘Jesus, there’s a fella crossing the road’. Martin was about a foot away from reaching the footpath.“That person who killed Martin was full of drugs and drink but the police couldn’t say when he took the drugs.“We were hoping that he would get at least fourteen years. What they’re trying to do now in England, Scotland and Wales is bring in le for le, but they’re not bringing it in in Northern Ireland.When told the news of proposals that are now on the table in NI to Increase the maximum sentence to le imprisonment for the three serious driving offences resulting in death or grievous bodily injury, Martin was fully supportive, believing it may be the deterrent needed to make drivers take more care.This would mirror the current maximum sentence available for offences such as manslaughter, rape, shooting or wounding with intent to commit grievous bodily harm. Public support Two months ago the same man responsible for their son’s death was convicted of a number of driving offences but was given a suspended sentence.“Ten years later he has never said he was sorry,” Martin stated, “I will never forgive him.” An emotional Martin said, “it’s like part of our le is gone,” as he implored anyone ever considering drink-driving to think about the suffering of families affected by such tragedies.“You live from day-to-day for your other children. You might’ve seen the ad on TV about the man living with depression who pulls the mask off at night, you just put a front on for people.“It gets no easier over ten years, people say it gets easier, it doesn’t, you learn to live with it just that’s it. If you didn’t have a good family and marriage, it would wreck your family.”And every time he crosses paths with his son’s killer it makes it worse, he added.Support from the local community has helped to lt the family’s spirits over the years. Last weekend  members of Foyle Valley Athletics Club ran the Dublin marathon in memory of Marty.One of the founding members of the club, Harry McNulty, ran his st and final marathon on the day – Marty was a prodigy of Harry’s when he joined Foyle Valley.“With Marty’s run every year we’ve raised about pound, for Derry charities. Over , people turned out at the start of the month.“It’s great to see what they thought of Martin and the money going to charity.“Last year we gave Altnagelvin a bed and it has Martin’s name on it but we try to spread it out. “The support gives us a lt and it just shows you what people thought of Martin,” Mr Gallagher concluded. .

Olivia ranks at number eight on the complete list.Interestingly, it’s Emilys that children in the country expect to be the naughtiest, demonstrating the dfering opinions between the generations.When it comes to well behaved children, boys named Harry top the list in Northern Ireland, according to the research commissioned byMy Nametags, a leading manufacturer of durable sticker and iron-on name labels.It’s Isla that comes out on top of the behaviour chart for girls, with none of those surveyed expecting children with this name to be misbehaved.Boys named Harry are considered to be shyest in the class, with their peers agreeing children with this name tend to be amongst the most introverted.By contrast, girls named Ella are seen as the most confident children in the country, with none of the children surveyed considering them to be shy. For boys, it’s Leos who are assumed to be the most self-assured.The study, which analysed the opinions of , teachers, children and parents in the UK, found that Brits are quick to make assumptions about a child based on their first name, with strong stereotypes associated with each of the names featured in this year’s top  baby names list. googletag.cmd.push The national results found that children named George are considered by both adults and their peers to be the most intelligent in class, with over one in  believing this is the most intellectual name from this year’s top  boys names list. They also associated it with kindness, with teachers and children regarding boys named George as kind-hearted.According to teachers, Isabella tops the list for girls when it comes to intelligence. However, children’s attitudes of Isabellas dfer drastically, with over one in  children assuming those named Isabella will be spoilt, based on their first name alone. For boys, its Harrys that children expect to be spoilt, whereas teachers consider those named Oliver to be the most indulged.  Norths Top  Naughtiest Boys Names . Charlie. Muhammad. Oliver. Oscar.

Seventeen Down senior titles have yielded no success at provincial or national level.Not many,any, would have tipped Magherafelt to claim John McLaughlin this year and even less will tip them to beat a Mickey Moran-minded Kilcoo.But Magherafelt are here on merit, they’ve held the underdog tag for all but one of their championship games this season.It appears that they thrive off, of it but, for selector Paul Quinn it has been one game at a time, one challenge before the other from the outset.“The target at the start of the year was to win the first round. Everything just snowballed from there.Whenever you get drawn against Coleraine in the first round you, don’t look much further than that. So, all of our energy went on trying to win and get over the line on that first game and everything has just snowballed after that.”If there was ever a worry of the Rossa men freezing on the big stage, any such thought was obliterated by a performance that both players and management alike have deemed as one of their best.“For a lot of the build-up we were just worried that the players might freeze bit, they didn’t and they actually produced what we have thought to be their best performance of the year.“That is something that is very satisfying for not only us as the management but, for the players too.“We’ve a good celebration but, we got back out to training on Thursday evening and we were back out yesterday morning .“There is just your usual knocks and niggles but we are hoping to have everyone back for next week but, aside from that we’ve a full bill of health.” googletag.cmd.push AmbushBut attentions have definitely turned back to football and their eyes are firmly set on ambushing the Magpies in the Marshes.“Attention has definitely turned back to football, lads were still going into primary schools and things there on Thursday and Friday and they’d a few similar events on Saturday but, that is something they are embracing and they’re enjoying it.“But, now they’re in an Ulster Championship, you never know when you’ll get the chance to represent your club in Ulster again,ever.“Derry clubs have a really proud tradition in this competition and that is something that we are hoping to carry that on.”Like almost the every round of the Derry championship, Magherafelt will go into this one as heavy underdogs with little or no expectation.For many, they will claim that Kilcoo’s season only begins at the provincial stage.“I was actually chatting to a lad about this the other day and he told me that home advantage is massive in the first round of Ulster.“We are away from home they’ve played in seven of the last eight Ulster’s, they’ve two Derry managers that will know us inside and out, the preparation for us we’ll be the same as the final, as will the build-up.“Neutrals will look at all the iables and they’ll will write us off but, we are not afraid going up here. Looking at it and the match-up we think that it will be a close game.“Like I said we are the Derry champions and we want to go on and represent Derry well.“We’ve gone into almost every game as underdogs and the only game with expectation on us was the Banagher semi-final and looking back at it, we didn’t get enough credit when you see how fiercely competitive it is in the championship.”“That point was hammered home to me when I was sitting watching Thomas Davis’ knock Kilmacud Crokes out of the Dublin championship on Saturday night.”Quinn himself has some familiarities with Kilcoo lads through his time managing Fulham Irish in London, a club now managed by none other than Tyrone’s Owen Mulligan.“If I needed to know what this meant Gaelic Football was all about in Kilcoo these four emphasised it.“They were fiercely strong and put in a serious sht, real serious natural talent and damn good footballers.“Through that friendship I have been going and watching Kilcoo in the Ulster Championship and they are a serious outfit and I’m sure they haven’t appointed men of the calibre of Mickey and Conleith to just win the Down title.“It’s a game that we are really looking forward to, it’s like a new competition for us and we will be looking to represent Derry well.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A gun battle was raging between the military and paramilitary. He was an unwilling, innocent spectator. This personal experience, in Belfast’s Ballymurphy, was a snapshot of a society bereft of civil rights and constantly consumed with relentless violence. His interview with former Deputy First Minister, the SDLP’s Seamus Mallon, perfectly encapsulates both the tragedies of ‘The Troubles’ and the hopes for a better future. In ‘Born to Lead’ Seamus narrates a comprehensive overview of the historical triumphs of two ‘half parish’ GAA clubs – Slaughtneil, one of the greatest all-round clubs the Association has ever seen and the mighty men of Mullinalaghta, the outstanding  Leinster Senior football club champions. googletag.cmd.push This book is essentially a cameo of seventy years of Irish social, political and cultural le. It ranges from the showband era of the ’s to the splendid contribution of two present day Country music stars. Their current status emphasises the inherent value of “singing the songs of the people for the people”. Likewise, the y careers of two recently retired GAA players illustrate the importance of total dedication towards achieving personal goals. The author examines the mind set of some of his fellow alumni of St. Patrick’s College, Armagh. Insightful profiles of the legendary scoring exploits of Hogan Cup winner, Iggy Jones, and the versatility of Horslips’ Barry Devlin, are a microcosm of twelve, other gted SPCA luminaries who are also featured. All of them help immensely to make this superb book a wonderful and enjoyable read. Seamus will be launching Born to Lead in Slaughtneil Hall on Saturday, November ,  at .pm. The event is open to all and everyone is welcome.

There was controversy in the final seconds when Feargal Higgins looked to have grabbed victory for Dungiven. His kick, which appeared to curl inside the post, was ruled out. After the final whistle there were unsavoury scenes, lasting a minute, involving players and subs from both teams. Once order was restored, management and officials from both clubs entered discussions with referee Gavin Hegarty and a decision not to play extra-time was agreed. The game was played in incessant rain and both teams deserve credit for their endeavour over the hour. googletag.cmd.push Ballinascreen played with Reece McSorley as a sweeper. Dungiven counteracted by putting Odhraacuten McKeever on Noel Rafferty, leaving Sean McKeever free at the other end. Early points from Pauric McNicholl, Feargal and Cahir Higgins had Dungiven - to - ahead after seven minutes. A run from midfield by Marty Bradley split the Dungiven defence, before Jon Paul Devlin slotted ‘Screen’s first score of the game. When Conal Logan turned over possession in the face of Dungiven’s defensive wall, Sean McKeever broke at pace, leading to a second point for Cahir Higgins. An outside of the boot Niall Doyle point gave ‘Screen some brief respite but Fergal and Cahir Higgins, the latter from a free, opened a four point lead. Odhraacuten and Daire McKeever combined for Sean to come surge forward and open a - to - lead after  minutes. Just when they were threatening to fade out of the game, Ballinascreen found the net. Caoilte McAlinden had the bravery to flick over the final Dungiven defender and when he rushed on the loose ball, he had the composure to slot an inch-perfect shot across ‘keeper Hasson to the far corner of the net. Marty Bradley added a fisted point after a Ronan McKenna run from deep but it was Dungiven who finished stronger. Hasson’s short kick-out found Eoin McKeever, who built a move up the right wing before Daire slotted between the posts. Feargal Higgins passed to and took apass from Conor Kelly to kick between the posts, putting them - to - ahead at the break. The third quarter became a non-event, with a series of failed attacks as both teams carried possession into the tackle. In the rd minute Aaron McBride began a move up-field that led to Emmet Duggan being dragged to the ground by Sean McKeever. No card was brandished but when Devlin’s penalty hit the bar, he pounced on the rebound to level to force over the line and level the game. Darragh McGilligan began to come into the game and he began a move that led to a Conor Kelly score from the wing, after Cahir and Feargal Higgins both kept their composure. McGilligan doubled Dungiven’s lead but Michael O’Kane’s men played second fiddle for the rest of the game. With seven minutes to go, Cathal Donnelly turned over a move from the Dungiven defence before being dragged to the ground by Thomas McClarey but astonishingly no black card was shown, with Donnelly correctly later seeing black for a cynical foul. Devlin tapped over the free and with Ballinascreen in control, a draw looked a likely outcome. Goalkeeper Ryan Scullion scuffed a th shot to the left of the posts but made up for it with pressure kick in injury time to draw the game. Dungiven will have to plan without Conor Kelly for the replay, after he was dismissed on a straight red card, for an off the ball incident late in the game.

Quigg to the rescue for Kilrea Glen -Kilrea - There was also a stalemate in the other semi-final, when Paddy Quigg rescued Kilrea with a late free to draw with Glen in Loup. Three seasons ago, Kilrea went all the way to an Ulster Final at St Paul’s only to be beaten by Burren at St Paul’s. There was torrential rain from start to finish but Quigg opened the scoring with a goal after linking up with Daithi McLaughlin to beat ‘keeper Caolan Convery at the near post. It was point for point for the rest of the half. Quigg, Gearoid and Daithi McLaughlin were on target for the Pearses. Alex Doherty , Conleth McGuckin and Eunan Mulholland were the Glen scorers but they trailed - to - at the break. In horrendous conditions, the second-half, it took  minutes for first score of the half from Paddy Quigg. Glen got a penalty in the th minute and Alex Doherty converted to put them a point up and Quigg equalised from a free with the last kick.

The companies travelling from Derry and Strabane are O’Neill’s International Sportswear, Humanity Cosmetics, Learning Pool and Visual Edge while EKO Chute, MMG Welding and Wild Fuschia Bakery from Donegal will also be taking part. The trade and iInvestment mission will be led by Derry City and Strabane District Council and Donegal County Councils and will include third level and further education providers and development organisations including the Ulster University, Letterkenny Institute of Technology, the North West Regional College, Donegal ETB and Catalyst. The mission will run from  to  November. It will build on the strong political, economic and cultural linkages already established in Boston and Philadelphia with the North West City region and will be an opportunity to further reach out to the Irish diaspora.  Speaking ahead of the visit and welcoming the confirmation of the seven local companies, Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Cllr Michaela Boyle, said the visit was particularly timely for the companies and partners to promote the North West city region’s unique strategic cross border location. She said: “This trade mission is a real opportunity for us to focus on our strengths in terms of location, talent and skills and support. It is our chance to really sell our location to the business community in the US, by educating them to the fact that post Brexit they can locate in our region and access both the North of Ireland and the EU. We will be very positive in our approach to emphasise to potential investors the strong selling points we have in terms of our location, our talented skills base, our cultural compatibility and quality of le, During the visit the participating businesses will meet with key contacts, explore and understand opportunities in the US market, develop in-market networks and develop relationships with potential customers. The civic delegation will engage with industry influencers and leaders, meet with Philadelphia Council and attend a Philadelphia Diaspora event. While in Boston they will visit the Irish Immigration Centre, meet State representatives at the State House and attend the official launch of the Hard GSD Visit Atlas for a City Region project as well as engaging with senior business executives. In addition to attending bespoke business to business meetings and engaging with potential investors and business connections, the delegation will attend a reception hosted by the Irish Consulate in Boston and be guests at the Golden Bridges Conference. Last year, Joule, a locally based fire engineering consultancy business, was one of a number of companies that took part in the trade mission. The company’s founding director John McColgan said he trade visit was a fantastic opportunity to look at new markets in the United States and his company’s participation was a very positive experience. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The companies travelling from Derry and Strabane are O’Neill’s International Sportswear, Humanity Cosmetics, Learning Pool and Visual Edge while EKO Chute, MMG Welding and Wild Fuschia Bakery from Donegal will also be taking part. The trade and iInvestment mission will be led by Derry City and Strabane District Council and Donegal County Councils and will include third level and further education providers and development organisations including the Ulster University, Letterkenny Institute of Technology, the North West Regional College, Donegal ETB and Catalyst. The mission will run from  to  November. It will build on the strong political, economic and cultural linkages already established in Boston and Philadelphia with the North West City region and will be an opportunity to further reach out to the Irish diaspora.  Speaking ahead of the visit and welcoming the confirmation of the seven local companies, Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Cllr Michaela Boyle, said the visit was particularly timely for the companies and partners to promote the North West city region’s unique strategic cross border location. She said: “This trade mission is a real opportunity for us to focus on our strengths in terms of location, talent and skills and support. It is our chance to really sell our location to the business community in the US, by educating them to the fact that post Brexit they can locate in our region and access both the North of Ireland and the EU. We will be very positive in our approach to emphasise to potential investors the strong selling points we have in terms of our location, our talented skills base, our cultural compatibility and quality of le, During the visit the participating businesses will meet with key contacts, explore and understand opportunities in the US market, develop in-market networks and develop relationships with potential customers. The civic delegation will engage with industry influencers and leaders, meet with Philadelphia Council and attend a Philadelphia Diaspora event. While in Boston they will visit the Irish Immigration Centre, meet State representatives at the State House and attend the official launch of the Hard GSD Visit Atlas for a City Region project as well as engaging with senior business executives. In addition to attending bespoke business to business meetings and engaging with potential investors and business connections, the delegation will attend a reception hosted by the Irish Consulate in Boston and be guests at the Golden Bridges Conference. Last year, Joule, a locally based fire engineering consultancy business, was one of a number of companies that took part in the trade mission. The company’s founding director John McColgan said he trade visit was a fantastic opportunity to look at new markets in the United States and his company’s participation was a very positive experience. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

British Prime Minister Harold Wilsons oft-quoted aphorism proved true once again this week, with the EU granting Britain yet another Brextension.March  came and went, October  the same, then, on Monday past, British Prime Minister Boris Johnston accepted Friday, January , , as the day Britain would, maybe, finally leave the EU. Undeterred by the interminable political machinations, multi- disciplinary artist, Duncan McKellar, on Simdau ast staged his “Giant Artwork Against Hard Borders” fields adjacent to Killeas Church of the Immaculate Conception.Speaking before the event, Mr McKellar said he was “very happy” with the support from the gathering local communities. He had plotted out a -metre-wide circle in two fields taking in both sides of the border with participants standing beside little bamboo markers he had placed in the ground.“It is at the same time, a protest against hard borders and a celebration of the communities around the hard borders. “Hopefully, we will end up with some nice video from the drone and some nice photographs,” he said.Mr McKellar arrived in Killea  days before the “Giant Artwork” took place and said the local “engagement” had been “fantastic.”He said: “People are enthused by the novelty of the idea. There is a palpable warmth. The Irish stereotype holds up very well.“I have been getting lots of help and lots of advice. People have been bending over backwards to help. Just this morning, Ive laid sawdust at the entrance of the field to cover up the mud and Miacuteċeaacutel, who runs the timber merchants, took it round on a truck and said, Anything I can do just let me know.”Introducing himself to the assembled crowd, Mr McKellar explained his work often used mirrors and often took place in border communities. He said: “Last year, I managed to organise a long line which stretched for  kilometre on each side of the US   Mexico border.“We also had a huge group of people on the White Clfs on March , the day Brexit was originally meant to happen. “We sent a giant SOS call to mainland Europe with our mirrors.“With the focus turning to the Northern Ireland border, I thought it was an appropriate time to come here. We are going to form a big circle, to symbolise the strength within the community here and also to show the strength of feeling against hard borders because obviously it used to be right there, the checkpoint.“We will walk to the brow of the hill. The border itself is the Liberty Burn at the bottom of the field. The sun will hit the mirrors and, as well as adding a bit of fairy dust to the images and drone footage, they symbolise the human spirit,” said Duncan.Patrick ODonnell who owns a garage in Killea said he got involved in Duncans Giant Artwork Against Hard Borders to support the artist.Patrick said: “I came along this morning to support Duncan and to protest against Brexit. The artistic aspect of the protest appealed to me.“The idea of hands across the border appealed to me. We dont want a hard border again, we dont want a border at all, basically.“As a business person, I think a hard border would be a disaster, a disaster totally,” said Patrick.The next thing Duncan has in the pipeline is maybe an installation in Palestine. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

New projects this year included social prescribing mdash helping people who present to their local GP to get out and about in their local area.New investment in multi-disciplinary teams in GP practices in Down was now being rolled out to the rest of Newry and Mourne. He said the Network was central to that roll-out and CDRCNrsquos experience of social prescribing made the organisation a great source of referrals to local community activities.Cllr Casey said CDRCN along with Community Advice and other umbrella support organisations were key to the delivery of Council services.

We are being terrorised in our homes and our property is being damaged.Mrs Smyth said it was almost impossible to report incidents to the police.ldquoIf we can get through the police often donrsquot respond, she continued. ldquoThese temporary gates have been being put up for almost two years now. Torn down and put up again. Itrsquos the residents who suffer, not the council people for delays in signing off on the workthat needs to be done.The residents are being supported by local Independent councillor Cadogan Enright, who accused the council of being ldquonot exactly on top of their game.He said: ldquoThe need for fences and gates to make the area into a cul-de-sacs was triggered by an emergency situation where pensioners were and still are under siege by a small number of nersquoer-do-wells, culminating with the actual burning down of a pensionerrsquos cottage.ldquoThe council have not been treating this as an emergency. Were it not for the Housing Executive repeatedly replacing the eight temporary steel and wood barriers week after week when they are torn down, the area would be unviable as an area where pensioners can live.He added: ldquoI have proposed a workshop between the social partners led by the PSNI, Housing Executive, council and other partners to agree in detail a step-by-step process for gating orders in writing so that we never again have such a series of dreadful delays.A spokesman for the council said last night: Newry, Mourne and Down District Council can advise that the Northern Ireland Housing Executive has applied to the council for gating orders in the Model Farm area and that the Council is currently following gating order guidance produced by the Department of the Environment.ldquoThis process requires consultation with the Department for Infrastructure and members of the public in the area.

We will eventually cover all old estates, subject to continuing funds and satisfactory contracts.Movements have already been made with the awarding of a number of pre-paint repair contracts and work on all contracts should begin by March or April next year.More programmes of maintenance work are being prepared and will be starting in the - financial year, subject to the approval of the Executiversquos Board.CASTLEWELLAN mdash Uncertainty has surrounded the recent proposals to establish units for educationally sub-normal pupils at Castlewellan.The South Eastern Education and Library Board give approval in January for two new units to be set up at the local controlled primary school.However, plans were revised when the neighbouring school, St Malachyrsquos Primary, decided it wanted to have special ESN units.Board officers decided thatan ESN unit is established at St Malachyrsquos the demand for ESN facilities at Castlewellan Primary mightand therefore only one unit might be necessary at each school.But confusion arose when the Board placed advertisements in a local newspaper about the plans to establish the units.Castlewellan councillor, Mrs Ethel Smyth, a Board member, was unsure about whether or not the Board had changed its policy and was intended to establish the units at St Malachyrsquos instead of at the controlled school.Mrs Smyth, who has raised the matter on several occasions, told Board members, this week that she was aggrieved about the whole affair and thought that Board officers had acted in a ldquovery surreptitious manner.ldquoThis sort of thing raises suspicions in the community and itrsquos just not good enough,: said Mrs Smyth.However, she was assured by Board chairman, Mr Cecil Kirkwood, that Board officers had not acted in an underhand manner and that there had only been a misunderstanding.KILLYLEAGH mdash A Killyleagh priest had called this week for people to follow the example of friendship shown by more than  Protestants and Roman Catholics who joined together in a special Halloween dinner and concert organised by his church.He is Fr Hugh OrsquoHagan and he was speaking hours after  senior citizens had enjoyed a dinner and concert in St Maryrsquos Hall, organised by the hall management committee.Speaking afterwards Fr OrsquoHagan said that Killyleagh and Shrigley had a unique community, ldquo everywhere has like here, Northern Ireland would be a more peaceful place.Invitations to Thursdayrsquos dinner and concert went out to both sides of the community and Fr OrsquoHagan stressed that he hoped no senior citizen had been forgotten, either Protestant or Roman Catholic.The idea of the dinner mdash which was such a success last year, when he was held for the first time mdash has been widely praised in the town, especially by the senior citizens and Thursday nightrsquos was no exception, with many voting it a big hit.Before the dinner began, Fr OrsquoHagan mdash who has been priest in Killyleagh for over  years and who is the longest serving priest ever in the town mdash welcomed everyone and thanked them for coming.He welcomed especially, the three ministers in the town, the Rev J C Boggs, Rev J D Mark and Rev R E Conn.

preparing to import the generic drug from South America as part of a CF Buyers Club of families.In a desperate attempt to start their son on the drug as quickly as possible, the couple and their family fundraised around pound, to buy Lorcaacuten three months treatment.ldquoWe were so close to getting the generic drug ourselves and that would have been great as Lorcaacuten would have started on it, but we would have still been campaigning and pushing for it, said Jen.ldquoWe have been told that the Department of Health want to copy what NHS England did and get the drug into peoplersquos

and will feature classic songs such as Any Dream Will Do and Close Every Door To Me.Such success has been long on the cards for the Crossgar man who distinguished himself as one of the upcoming stars in local musicals with the St Patrickrsquos Choral Society in Downpatrick.Mark has been a constant help and support to his older brother, Declan, and parents John and Brenda after Declan suffered a

Declan has lived with locked-in syndrome ever since.A video of Mark singing Take Him Home from the musical Les Miserables to Declan went viral in , landing him a spot on The Nolan Show.The emotional rendition of the song, which touches Declan and his parents every time they hear it, and the simple story of the brothersrsquo love and devotion, led to further performances for Mark on RTE.However, it wasnrsquot until this June that he won hearts as the runner-up in Britainrsquos Got Talent.His performance wowed judge Simon Cowell who told him it was the best performance of the series.Despite losing out to  year-old Cha Pensioner Colin Thackery, Markrsquos showcase on the hit show led to musical producers noticing his talent and superb voice.The McMullan family managed to keep the exciting news quiet until last week.Father John explained: ldquoMark was approached by the producer several months ago but we couldnrsquot really say anything.

The choral society gave me a taste for musical theatre and my mum really pushed me to do it.

Leading a presentation on Agriculture and Agri-food, Craig Humes highlighted how dairy farmers will be one of the main farming groups to be ldquostruck by Brexit.ldquo. billion litres of milk are collected from across Northern Irish farms each year.  per cent of this milk produced is then exported south to be processed.ldquoThis could make le extremely dficult for farmersexport tarfs are to be introduced, Craig shared, adding that Dr. Mike Johnston, Chief Executive of the Dairy Council Northern Ireland believes that milk prices could drop by  pence per litre should a no-deal Brexit proceed with such excessive tarfs announced.ldquoIn my opinion, to put it quite simply, dairy farmers will not survive in Fermanagh unless there is a deal, commented Craig.In her presentation on Tourism and Hospitality Rebekah Starrett noted how Fermanagh had over , visitors last year who spent an average of pound. million.ldquoThis is a massive amount of money being spent in this local economy. The tourism and hospitality industry here supports , jobs ndash one of the biggest employment sectors in the county.ldquoIf Brexit happens it could mean some businesses may need to let some staff go and leave people without a job, said Rebekah.Stating that in her opinion Brexit offers the tourism and hospitality sector many innovative opportunities to potentially grow and expand, Rebekah shared some examples.ldquoThere has been a rise in lsquostaycationrsquo ndash the number of UK residents that have been staying and holidaying at homehas shown a three per cent rise in  and is continuing to grow something which would be good for Fermanagh Tourism, explained Rebekah, who also highlighted how Fermanagh is renowned for its celebrity chefs, award-winning restaurants and local produce which will continue to attract visitors to the County.Presenting facts on Business and Cross Border Trade, Nicole McFarlane and Oran OrsquoLoughlin shared how Enniskillen has the lsquotop performing ASDA store in the UKrsquo which was the th best store in Walmart Worldwide Group in  and that an average shopping trip spend by Republic of Ireland shoppers to Enniskillen is euro to euro.ldquoCross Border trade stands at pound. billion for  and Northern Ireland makes up between  to  per cent of total exports from Ireland to the UK and accounts for seven to eight per cent of imports, stated Nicole and Oran, adding that the flow of trade between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland will depend on what kind of agreement replaces the current one which is free market trade within the EU. Sharing a positive outlook on how Brexit could impact business trade, the studentsrsquo stated: ldquoBrexit could actually result in more opportunities in more vibrant markets across the world becoming available. Some argue that Brexit could liberate the UK government to sign fresh trade deals with more dynamic markets outside the EU and therefore bolster trade.Whilst presenting his research on how Brexit could impact Student Le, Jordan McClure shared: ldquoStudent le is a vital part of growing up where we learn many things. Brexit has taught me the importance of ensuring that my opinion and voice is heard, especially, when I wasnrsquot the age to vote in the  referendum.ldquoWhilst much of what happens around Brexit is beyond our control one thing for sure is that the potential impact will affect all of our lives.

With that close to being achieved we want to emphasise that we never sought an Irish Sea border and we want to see Stormont . ‘To that end, we now accept that in a system of mandatory coalition no one party should set red lines before theof devolution. ‘We realise that previous comments by the Tanaiste suggested that we think an Irish language act is needed for Stormont to .‘As a Brexit resolution nears, we can see things more calmly, and now concede that any Irish government would be outragedunionists collapsed power-sharing and issued terms for its . So we will now support the UK restoring Stormont without preconditions’OK, so the chance that Mr Varadkar will say that is almost zero.But is there anyone in Ireland’s Department of Foreign Affairs, which has sway over this province, or in Dublin’s political establishment, who can see how much anger would be alleviated by such a statement To grasp unionist frustration, go back to David Trimble’s  plea to Sinn Fein, the year after the Belfast Agreement: ‘Mr Adams, it’s over to you. We’ve jumped you follow.’The Ulster Unionist leader was endorsing setting up power-sharing with SF ahead of IRA decommissioning, hoping that the latter would follow .Ian Ellis: Ending welfare mitigation payments could mean , households in Northern Ireland will see their incomes fall suddenly Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Remember also how in  direct rule was imposed by London after IRA spying at Stormont and the Castlereagh break-in , because Tony Blair refused specic sanction against SF.Recall March  after the Northern Bank robbery and the murder of Robert McCartney, when all Northern Ireland politicians were dis-invited to the White House on St Patrick’s Day, instead of just republican ones.Go forward to autumn , after the murder of Kevin McGuigan, and security force assessments of an intact Provisional IRA structure.The DUP would have been justied in refusing to continue to share power with republicans then but would not have dared, knowing that global opprobrium would follow.A widespread sense within unionism that republicans are allowed to do things that unionists are never allowed to do is why even many moderate pro Union voters want Nigel Dodds to defeat Sinn Fein.When Martin McGuinness wrote a letter explaining SF’s decision to collapse Stormont in January , disrespect to Irish culture was mentioned in passing, but his big complaint was Arlene Foster refusing to stand aside over RHI.This newspaper long ago made an editorial decision that the cash for ash scandal was worthy of daily scrutiny, via Sam McBride’s excellent coverage. We saw off critics who said a unionist paper was making things hard for unionists.But RHI was never a reason to collapse power-sharing, particularly after a public inquiry was agreed.It soon emerged that Sinn Fein’s enduring red line towas an Irish language act . Sure enough, hospitals and schools have been rudderless for three years and will remain so until such legislation is in place. The DUP agreed an ILA in February , but was unable to sell it to unionists.Many people sombrely say that all MLAs need a pay cut but get confused as to the source of the stalemate. All parties, goes the criticism, must “drop their red lines”, asunionists saying no to ILA blackmail is equivalent to the demand itself.If anyone is still under this misapprehension, consider it like this: Think of an imaginary ided society in which the political aspirations of that society can be scaled from  to , with  the status quo.Side A would like society to move to point  in the scale, while Side B would like it to be at point .But they agree to disagree, and stay at the compromise of point .Side A then says, right, we’re unilaterally moving the status quo to , but Side B says, no you’re not.Side A has issued a non negotiable red line demand. Side B has resisted that non negotiable demand.It is not the same thing.For both sides to be equally culpable, Side B would have had to say: we are unilaterally insisting that the status quo moves to .But it has not done that.Some people will be outraged at a journalist writing an article such as this against an ILA. Yet I see no criticism, or even concern, at the way that the media class has accepted there has to be an ILA, despite the fact that Irish already enjoys positive discrimination such as Irish language schools with far lower pupil numbers than larger schools that have to close.A respected commentator wrote recently that an ILA was viewed as “pivotal” to Stormont’s . It is often said that an ILA is harmless, yet even last year’s watered down proposal included a language commissioner. AsNI needs another commissioner!Does anyone think that, evenIrish is visible everywhere, such a person will be issuing reports five years from now, or , saying all is well with language provision  Or that such reports won’t be seized on to justy legal actions for even more widespread use of Irish Isolated Protestants in the west of NI believe some councils are being triumphalist when they use Irish as the first language in signage, despite the fact it is spoken well by a tiny minority of NI’s population. It is often said that Protestants should appreciate Irish as part of their heritage, but the fact is that many unionists are uncomfortable with how they perceive it is used. Similarly there are aspects of unionist culture with which many Catholics are uncomfortable, and there would be unremitting uproarunionists demanded protection for such culture before Stormont could sit.Sinn Fein had ample time after  to reassure people as to its intentions. Instead it used an ILA in a way that fanned fears. If Stormont s on the basis of ILA, it is a precedent for a future collapse based on fresh demands. If it is restored without pre-conditions, MLAs can debate the merits and de-merits of such legislation without the lasting rancour there will bean ILA has been achieved by ransom.• Ben Lowryis News Letter deputy editor©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"people","story":" getRequiredClientIdforjpiconsole.log requiredClientIdcatch]EV.Core.updateUserProfile]EV.Core.updateUserProfile....... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast News Letter and agreeing to JPIMedia Ltd#s Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive any of the following newsletters from Belfast News Letter, via email Daily news, news features and service updates\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". ss+s+  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+]]]]]]]]]]]]]] initInArticleOnlySiteText, initArticleSiteText, isInArticleOnlyTemplateReady. s isArticleTemplateReady. s addCustomTextToSiteTemplate addSiteName.html  -- -- People   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business Subscribe#jp #login-widget #login-flip.flip RegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News People Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Politics Business Education Health Opinion Read This News Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Politics Business Education Health Opinion Read This Sport Football Rugby Union Motorcycling More Sport Sport Opinion Whats On Arts  Entertainment Things To Do Nightle Lestyle Retro Cars Homes Must Read           People      Festival provides November tourism boost to NI seaside townsA festival which has proven to be a boost to off-season tourism in the towns of Portrush and Portstewart is to celebrate the work of one of the area#s greatest musical sons.

Among those signing the letter were PUP leader Billy Hutchinson and DUP councillor Dean McCullough, although the fact he is a DUP politician was not mentioned and he was instead described as chairman of Rathcoole Neighbourhood Renewal, a publicly-funded cross-party group involving everyone from Sinn Féin to the UUP.Sam McBride: U-turning even before he has taken over could be devastating for Steve Aiken Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Mr Agnew said it was “naive” of Mr Aiken to pledge to stand in all  seats and said of the incoming leader: “He’s only been in the party a handful of years”.The veteran unionist said he feared that “the party is slowly leaving me at the moment”.It is understood that senior UUP figures are meeting this weekend to decide on whether to back Mr Aiken’s stance or agree a pact with the DUP.Mr Dodds’ seat is the most vulnerablethe UUP does not agree a pact. Although the DUP’s deputy leader is widely respected at Westminster and is one of the DUP’s most capable figures, his majority has been shrinking in North Belfast as demographic changes, a shrinking unionist vote and a consolidation of the nationalist vote behind Sinn Fein has left him with a majority of just over ,.He is facing a challenge from the Sinn Féin Lord Mayor of Belfast, John Finucane, who is being positioned as a more moderate and modern republican than past candidates such as former IRA bomber Gerry Kelly.In a statement last night, Mr Dodds said that it was “essential that there is respect on all sides for the democratic process”.The former Stormont Finance Minister said: “There have been some reports of intimidation and threats issued towards members and activists from the UUP.“Any such incidents are deplorable and must be totally condemned. The only appropriate way to express your views and the most effective way to send a message in our society is through the ballot box.“For our part the DUP has a positive plan for Northern Ireland to deliver more for everyone building on the extra billions of investment we have already delivered in the past two years for health and education, roads and broadband.“We will be putting forward that clear message over the coming weeks.”At the time of going to press, the PSNI had not responded to a request for comment.The PSNI’s Belfast District Commander, Chief Superintendent Jonathan Roberts, said: “Police received a report yesterday morningabout telephone calls received by staff in an office in the Belmont Road area of east Belfast.“Some of these calls have been described as abusive and threatening in nature. “Enquiries are ongoing.”Sam McBride: U-turning even before he has taken over could be devastating for Steve Aiken©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"sam mcbride u turning even before he has taken over could be devastating for steve aiken  ","story":" getRequiredClientIdforjpiconsole.log requiredClientIdcatch]EV.Core.updateUserProfile]EV.Core.updateUserProfile....... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast News Letter and agreeing to JPIMedia Ltd#s Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive any of the following newsletters from Belfast News Letter, via email Daily news, news features and service updates\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". ss+s+  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+]]]]]]]]]]]]]] initInArticleOnlySiteText, initArticleSiteText, isInArticleOnlyTemplateReady. s isArticleTemplateReady. s addCustomTextToSiteTemplate addSiteName.html  -- -- TriggerPrompt url  https:survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site_oqfshupypyivmsxzqude + url +  +:  + random + .getTime + afterel.setAttribute head  document[]  document[]headChildTriggerPrompt   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business Subscribe#jp #login-widget #login-flip.flip RegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News Politics Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Business Education Health Opinion People Read This News Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Business Education Health Opinion People Read This Sport Football Rugby Union Motorcycling More Sport Sport Opinion Whats On Arts  Entertainment Things To Do Nightle Lestyle Retro Cars Homes Must Read           Sam McBride: U-turning even before he has taken over could be devastating for Steve AikenIncoming Ulster Unionist Party leader Steve Aiken floundered in an interview on The ViewSam McBrideEmail Published::Saturday  November Share this article window.onload  .sharetool \"m.\" index  .indexOf \"ContentId\" pointIndex  .indexOf articleID  .substring.article-sharetool.article-sharetool--mobile Share this article window.onload  .sharetool \"m.\" index  .indexOf \"ContentId\" pointIndex  .indexOf articleID  .substring.article-sharetool.article-sharetool--mobile Sign Up To Our Daily Newsletter ipaddress.getJSON .keypress.focus.on email  .val.ajax\",source_url: location.href,source_website_category: \"Politics\", \"text\".done .removeAttr  .htmlThanks,  + email +  has been added to our newsletter..

We’re going to fight all  constituencies.”\u2028There was an immediate and predictable backlash from the DUP, whose deputy leader and North Belfast MP Nigel Dodds would be most vulnerablethe UUP was to contest every seat.Arlene Foster accused him of doing something which would “hand seats to Sinn Féin”.Mr Aiken was clear and unapologetic about his stance evenit meant Mr Dodds losing his seat. He told the News Letter that the DUP has been undermining the Union and therefore it was natural that his party would not stand aside in favour of such a party.PSNI called in as UDA tells UUP to step aside Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"He said that “the DUP, the supposed supporters of the Union, have been one of the biggest detractors from it”.Pressure came on Mr Aiken from ious sources – including one sitting UUP councillor, Frazer Agnew – and the Grand Master of the Orange Order in Belfast, Spencer Beattie, to reverse his position.However, while privately there was unhappiness within sections of the UUP, the party’s small band of big beasts were publicly restrained about expressing their unease.But, appearing on The View on Thursday night, Mr Aiken came unstuck. Although it was obvious that the pressure for a pact would be the main line of questioning, the incoming UUP leader appeared unclear about his policy.Initially said “we’re committed to running candidates everywhere”.But within moments, when pressed by presenter Mark Carruthers, he was refusing to say whether that would mean standing in all  seats.In an interview which at points defied logical analysis, Mr Aiken suggested that he had been surprised at Sinn Féin’s century-old policy of abstentionism.When asked to explain why he had changed his stance on North Belfast, he said: “One of the things that has changed, of course, is that yesterday Sinn Féin have decided to put forward a candidate who’s not even going to stand in Westminster.”In passing, later in the interview, he said that there had been threats made to UUP staff, but he did not indicate that his apparent change of position was based on that development.There are UUP members unhappy at the position articulated by Mr Aiken. But they have little reason for complaint in that he is being handed the leadership of their party without a contest and any one of them could have challenged him for the post.Although Mr Aiken is a former commander of a Royal Navy nuclear submarine, he is still new to politics, having first been elected to any political post when he entered the Assembly as an MLA just three-and-a-half years ago.However, the South Antrim MLA has always been clear that he is on the liberal wing of the party.The UUP knew that when not a single other party member put their name forward to be leader. Yet some of those people who chose not to contest the leadership appear shocked that a liberal unionist has said something which is consistent with his ideology.In remarkable circumstances, Mr Aiken now faces what may be the defining moment for his leadership – before he has even taken over as leader.If Mr Aiken presses ahead with standing in every constituency, he can expect to face the wrath of many unionists – including the Orange Order, members of his own party and UUP voters.However,  he reverses a policy which he set out with such conviction and instead adopts a position with which he does not agree, Mr Aiken will not only appear weak, but also incompetent.Over recent years, several senior DUP figures have privately said that they believe there is a need for a distinctively liberal unionist party – a recognition that the DUP, no matter how successful, will never be able to mop up all of the votes lost by the UUP, and something they believe would free the DUP to pursue policies without fear of being outflanked by the UUP from both left and right.Yetit is ultimately in unionism’s – and even the DUP’s – interest to have such a party, the DUP’s actions have undermined that, by robustly denouncing UUP leaders, and the short-lived NI, who have struck out in a liberal direction.Within the DUP, there are people who realise that whereas in days gone past there was an expectation from both the UUP and DUP that anyone who was pro-Union would vote for a unionist regardless of their other policies, the world is changing.Young people in particular are more enthused by issues – anything from environmentalism to gay rights to the question of abortion – than by party or constitutional politics.The idea that a gay unionist who is pro-choice, anti-Brexit and believes that the world is facing a climate emergency should automatically vote for a DUP candidate simply because they are unionist is as out of date as the idea that an opponent of same-sex marriage who is pro-le, pro-Brexit and opposes green taxes should vote for a UUP candidate simply because they are a unionist.Part of the explanation for the growth of the Alliance and Green Party vote in recent elections is that some voters who are constitutionally unionist – in that they would vote for the Union in any border poll – have felt disrespected by the mindset behind pacts which is implicitly that they should simply do their duty and vote for whoever their political leaders have decided is ‘their’ candidate.There is therefore a strategic logic to Mr Aiken’s attempt to dferentiate the UUP from its larger rival evenin the short term it costs unionism in a marginal seat.But by appearing unprepared to face down what was always going to be vocal – and heartfelt – opposition to anything which could see Sinn Féin benefit, he has undermined his leadership before it has even begun.try catch  TrendingCounsellors brought into NI school to help pupils after teen killed and four others hospitalised in horror crashTeenager killed in NI road traffic collision -

Any proposals would be subject to full consultation, meaning all interested parties would have an opportunity to share their views before any decision is made.ldquoShould proposals progress, they would also be subject to separate planning consultation.ldquoThis would include consideration of highways and traffic concerns. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But our role as judges in this case is limited.\"The wider issues raised by the claimants, about whether these choices were right or wrong or good or bad, are not for us they are for members of the public and their elected representatives.\"There was no direct discrimination on grounds of sex, because this legislation does not treat women less favourably than men in law.\"Rather, it equalises a historic asymmetry between men and women and thereby corrects historic direct discrimination against men.\"In a statement after the ruling, Unison general secretary Dave Prentis said: \"This is a terrible blow for the millions of women who will have been hoping for a very dferent outcome today.\"The decision to hike the state pension age with next to no notice didnt just throw their retirement plans up in the air, it also left many women on lower incomes really struggling to make ends meet.\"Campaigners have now called on the UK Parliament to intervene on their behalf.A DWP spokesman welcomed the judgment, adding: \"It has always been our view that the changes we made to womens state pension age were entirely lawful and did not discriminate on any grounds.\"The court decided that arguments the claimants were not given adequate notice of changes to the state pension age could not be upheld.\"This follows the extensive communications that DWP made to publicise these changes over many years.\"He added that raising the state pension age in line with changes to le expectancy had been the policy of successive governments over many years. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

His home has lost its parking space to the redevelopment. He said: ldquoItrsquos frustrating that we didnrsquot know the extent of developments until Saturday evening when the Vale tweeted plans.ldquoRoadworks have happened here before but theyrsquove not been as fundamentally le changing - the council didnrsquot say how big the impact on us would be during the survey or the consultation period.ldquoThey havenrsquot given any alternative parking provisions. We have had nine spaces taken away, which means  cars will be battling for spaces.ldquoWe understand the need to reduce cars and danger in the area but the way itrsquos been done will lead to reductions in house prices and make parking dficult for current residents. There are elderly people here, people with kids, how are they going to park all the way uphill  I had to go to casualty recently and this can make the dference between getting in the car outside and being in pain while my we gets the car several streets away.ldquoOut of the councilrsquos survey of  only  people replied, and  picked this option. I agree we need change, but going by the small number of people who actually wanted this it strikes me as something pushed through.ldquoFrom my perspective - and that of other residents here - the council could have been far more open and communicative during the process.Mike Clogg, Vale council operational manager for neighbourhood services and transport, said: ldquoThe council consulted widely on these proposals from May  to July  last year, a process that allowed residents to have their say by responding to the online survey, writing to the council or attending one of two drop-in sessions held at Belle Vue Pavilion.ldquoFour potential routes were proposed before this one was selected, a decision that was reached after  per cent of survey respondents identied this as their first or second choice.ldquoThe views of other interested parties were also considered, while there was also signicant media coverage on the matter.ldquoIt is dficult to please everyone when it comes to highway improvement schemes, but this project should be of major benefit to Penarth, improving traffic flow and reducing congestion.ldquoIt is part of a wider scheme of work involving building a new skate park at Penarth Leisure Centre and improvements to The Dingle Park.ldquoIt is hoped the scheme will encourage more people to walk to these locations and provide children with a safer route to the leisure centre and local schools.ldquoImprovements to the junction will also create a more attractive entrance to Penarth, while new plants, railings and public art will improve the appearance of The Dingle Park. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

A former head of two other schools in Gwent, he is clearly proud of his school and all they have accomplished.ldquoItrsquos a wonderful school and everyone here has worked so hard to make it that way, he said. ldquoBut it does face challenges.Like other head teachers in Penarth, Mr Rees had signed the open letter to the Welsh Government calling for fairer funding for Vale schools earlier this year. He had discussed coming in to the school on weekends to clean the toilets himself to help balance budgets. But he is firmly optimistic.ldquoBetween kind donations and fundraising efforts from our PTA, renting out the school hall, and younger members of staff taking on some extra burdens we are just about able to balance our budgets, he said. ldquoTo be honest, next year might start looking grim, but wersquore keeping our heads high.ldquoWith that said, wersquove been working hard on incorporating new initiatives and the new curriculum, we have a great crop of pupils and staff morale is high. We are very positive here.ldquoItrsquos also our th anniversary this year, so we have loads of ex-staff and pupils coming through the doors to say hello, a celebratory PTA barbecue and more planned.Taking a tour around the school, this positivity is reflected in students and staff alike. Children seem genuinely excited to learn, smiling, waving and saying hello to Mr Rees.Evenlode Primary School itself has an interesting history.It was opened in  as the first open plan primary school in South East Wales.The population of the school has risen dramatically over the last  years, from  on roll in  to the present .The building itself, a maze of classrooms and corridors plastered in colours, has also changed to accommodate more pupils.Much of the semi-open plan design has disappeared, making way for more conventional classrooms.The school benefits from having a superb site with two playgrounds as well as a large playing field, a designated play area for Reception children, a wildle area, open access to the local tennis club facilities, a newly constructed lsquooutside classroomrsquo and adventure trail.One of the first stops was a hall used by its lsquoSaplingsrsquo Out of School Care, the pre and after-school club for children.Saplings provides childcare for around  children from all year groups, providing breakfast in the morning and looking after children from .am to pm when needed.There, the children can access a wide range of activities, switched up on a regular basis.These have included cooking, gardening, art, crafts, sporting activities, outdoor play and plenty more.A couple of pupils, part of the Saplings, are called through. They happily talk about their favourite part of the clubs. One says arts and crafts another, going outside and playing sport four more say the food.Saplings isnrsquot the only place the students can indulge in a little food.Pupils have set up a fruit tuck shop in the school yard, a group endeavour that students control all aspects of - from placing orders for snacks, selecting the products, handling finances and, of course, selling to their friends.A small group of budding merchants were excited to show me their wares, selling oranges and bananas at break time.There was plenty more to do outside, as well.Mr Rees himself taught fire-making lessons in their fire pit, while the school also made use of rope courses, and a newly refurbished gazebo.Bike racks could be found at the front and back of the site, with students encouraged to cycle to school.Sport is very high on the schoolrsquos agenda.ldquoWe have kids from the school representing us in cricket, rugby and tennis at a county level, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore also fielding regular football, rugby and netball teams, and we are pushing plenty of other outdoor activities - like our new ropes and outdoor assault course.ldquoWersquore lucky to have parents in this area who are incredibly supportive of sports, and we have some shining examples of sporting prowess in our children.ldquoWe think itrsquos a very important part of being a rounded and healthy inidual.The school doesnrsquot just focus on sport - they aim to nurture minds and souls too.ldquoExpressive arts is a major area of focus at the moment, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore lucky enough to have a drama specialist supporting us, helping coach the children through both acting and production.ldquoWe are even working with the Welsh Government on a production of H.G. Wellrsquos The Time Machine, to be held in our school hall.The hall had been built with money raised from selling off surplus land, with a further loan from the Vale council.It is tidy, modern, and neatly decorated, with a sophisticated looking lighting system - built with help from parents.ldquoWersquore very proud of the relationship we have with parents here, said Mr Rees. ldquoThey have been enormously helpful with our budgetary concerns.Evenlode is a school with a cheerful outlook, a happy student body and a strong working relationship between staff, students and parent alike.It deserves to go far. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In the past he chaired the all-party Parliamentary group on nuisance calls and secured changes to the law to restrict cold telephone calling.ldquoThere have been a number of complaints about the increase in nuisance callers and the rise of the doorstep economy in the Vale of Glamorgan. Ahead of the clocks going back, Alun wants to provide constituents with a proven means of reducing the number of doorstep callers.Welsh Labour parliamentary candidate for the Vale, Belinda Loveluck-Edwards said: ldquoIt appears that Alun Cairns is using public money to try and block his political opponents from speaking to voters. This must be investigated.ldquoThis is a deliberate attempt to present a  equivalence between genuine political canvassing and those who would wish to scam vulnerable people.ldquoMany people will be deeply unsettled by this behaviour from Cairns at the same time as the Tories are attempting to suppress votes by making it a requirement to show ID at polling stations- a move that will disproportionately affect working class, ethnic minority and young voters.ldquoThis is not how politics should be done. In contrast, Welsh Labour is opening up politics by extending votes to  and  year olds in future Assembly elections.

It would require the removal of seven of the  ancient trees in the Conservation Area.Many of the trees had been assessed in September  as deserving of a Tree Protection Order, which would prevent them from being cut down, though the Vale council has said they are in the process of securing the protection orders.Residents say one ndash Ash Tree , crucial to development ndash has already been removed. John Lean, a resident of Kymin Terrace, said: ldquoAround a week ago, the first ash tree was sawn down. It was painted as a routine tidying up of their grounds, that it was sick, and was carried out not by the architects who made the main application, but by the warden. We do not believe there was anything wrong with that tree.ldquoAn application was made under Section  of the Planning Acts for the removal of Ash Tree , another tree not in the wood but next to the house, and the removal of a fallen tree. No notice was given to local residents the Vale council did not inspect the site before permission was given, and the first we knew of it was when we heard the chainsaws.Ash Tree  would have to be removed for any development to take place, to allow construction traffic to pass.David Burnett, a resident, said: ldquoThis creates a dangerous precedent for further development here.ldquoWhen the construction of Homeside House was permitted on appeal in , the inspector at the time made it clear that it should not impinge on the woodland. The woodland was described as lsquoinviolatersquo ndash itrsquos at least  years old. What was true then is true now. Other residents had further complaints about the proposed development, and the methodology used to carry out inspections.The large footprint of the dwelling occupies over half the site. The access road would also have to be able to take construction traffic, which residents fear would further damage the site and could limit parking.One resident described a bat survey as lsquocompletely inadequatersquo, as the resident said the survey carried out on behalf of the applicant noted observation was made on two occasions only.William and Karen Stonehouse said: ldquoThe development would involve the destruction of a valuable natural habitat without any benefit to the community whatsoever.ldquoPenarth is not short of expensive properties. It is affordable housing that is desperately needed to prevent the continuing drain of its young people who can no longer afford to buy any property here.ldquoThis proposal does nothing to address that.Joanna Masters said: ldquoI am very concerned about the proposed plan to fell the wood.ldquoI thought the world was becoming more environmentally aware, particularly regarding the value of trees, but it seems the Vale council is, in its own way, as irresponsible as Brazilrsquos Bolsonaro.A spokesman for the Vale council said: ldquoThis planning application has yet to be determined and will be considered in exactly the same way as any other, with the views of all interested parties taken into account.ldquoThat will involve reviewing all letters of representation and consultation responses on the matter. IldquoIt has been resubmitted after a previous one for a similar development was withdrawn as it failed to provide full details of the impact on nearby trees.ldquoWe are in the process of arranging Tree Preservation Orders for trees there that meet the criteria for that protection.ldquoThe council did approve an application to fell an ash tree from Homeside House as, after inspection by an officer, it was deemed to have a fungal bracket, which can structurally weaken trees to the point of breakage. That being the case, it was decided a TPO was not appropriate.The freehold for the woodland was purchased by Proxima GR Properties in  from McCarthy  Stone, who had built an unsheltered accommodation around the site.The Penarth Times has attempted to reach Proxima GR Properties for a comment. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Their sole motive has been about blocking Brexit.I have long thought the only way out of this is a general election.The British people need to be given the opportunity to have a clear out of those politicians who said one thing to get elected and have done another in office.All Labour and Conservative MPs were elected on manestos explicitly promising to respect and honour the referendum result.The people of Penarth deserve better than this.Earlier this month, I was present on the steps of the Senedd as the petition to save the Sam Davies ward at Barry Hospital was presented to the Assembly.I joined other local representatives and campaigners from Unison to receive the petition, and send a clear message on the health boardrsquos proposals.Under the plans, the -bed older persons rehabilitation ward will close, with services transferring either to the community or Llandough Hospital.Local opinion in Barry is quite clear that the ward should stay, while in Llandough, further expansion of the hospital will cause further pressures on the village.You wonrsquot often catch me standing alongside Unison, but on this we completely agree.These plans need to be dropped.The Royal British Legion have officially launched the  Poppy Appeal, and as ever, I am delighted to pledge my support.It is crucial we commemorate those who made the ultimate sacrice to defend our freedoms, including those from Penarth.Wearing a poppy is an understated yet clear way of demonstrating that, and it also raises vital funds to support current and former servicemen and women and their families.It is often misunderstood as condoning or celebrating war, and that could not be further from the truth. It is respecting those who have fallen.Irsquod like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the Royal British Legion for their work. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals. What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you  Believe in yourself, be flexible and above all when opportunities present themselves to you, grab them.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/2_web.jpg","title":"top  voice of business never stronger or more important","story":"Posted on Friday  September  by Ulster Business John Mulgrew, Michael Neill, Sarah Little and Len OHagan The voice of Northern Ireland’s business community has never been stronger and more important as industry attempts to avoid a hard Brexit, a gathering of top business leaders has heard. The Top  Northern Ireland Companies  dinner, with AL Goodbody, brought together some of top business chiefs making the list, to the grand backdrop of Queen’s University’s Great Hall. The event heard renewed calls for securing a deal on Brexit, and the restoration of Stormont, as we approach , days without a devolved government here. John Mulgrew, editor of Ulster Business, told those gathered: “On the precipice of Brexit, the voice of business has never been stronger or more important – further enforcing the need for a deal. Avoiding a hard exit.

Ulster Business speaks to Northern Ireland managing director Ian Sheppard, and learns more about how colleagues are being empowered to play an active role in the local communities where they live and work Bank of Ireland UK sees developing its colleagues and helping customers and communities to thrive as part of its DNA, according to Ian Sheppard, managing director in Northern Ireland.From key charity partnerships, to fundraising, volunteering, sponsorship and more, Ian says the desire for Bank of Ireland UK is to make a positive impact by empowering colleagues to make a dference.“When I speak to my colleagues, I hear how really active and involved they are in their own community,” Ian says. “There are so many examples and I never cease to be amazed by their passion and commitment.An important partnership for the bank is with Alzheimer’s Society, its flagship charity for the last two years. In that time around £, has been raised in Northern Ireland, but as Ian explains it’s about more than fundraising.“We realised that not only can we help them financially, but there are resources we can share and opportunities we can offer which can help to signicantly raise the charity’s profile and raise much needed funds.”One example in which the bank has supported Alzheimer’s Society in this way is through its own long-running partnership with Ulster Rugby.“We donated our advertising and promotion activity for a televised game at the Kingspan Stadium making the charity ‘Sponsor for a Day’. This included using their logo on the back of the Ulster Rugby jerseys, taking over the pitch side boards and inviting a group of people living with dementia, their family and carers to the game – helping to get their brand message out to not only a stadium with capacity of , people but to a much wider TV audience.”Alzheimer’s Society sees some fantastic people giving their time to help others. That’s no clearer than its Side by Side programme, which Bank of Ireland UK helps to fund.The photograph on the front of this edition of the magazine taken at the Grand Opera House in Belfast features Mary Dalzell a Side by Side volunteer, alongside Hazel Whiteside, who has been living with dementia for two years.They share a love of music, theatre and cinema and the Side by Side programme, which re-connects people with dementia to their communities by doing the things they love, has not only put a smile on both their faces but has had a positive impact on their lives.There are so many people impacted by dementia and Alzheimers in our local communities, and its touching so many people’s lives, taking this as our motivation, the bank now has almost , staff trained as Dementia Friends.The bank’s ‘Give Together’ programme means staff can take one day a year to spend the time working with a charity or community organisation of their choice. “This day can involve anything from gardening work to painting a youth centre,” Ian says“Beyond Alzheimer’s Society, colleagues are helping many other organisations such as Macmillan Cancer Support, Cancer Research UK through its Relay for Le Legenderry, the Wooden Spoon children’s rugby charity, and Space NI, which offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community.” You canabout some of the good work colleagues have done further on in this feature.“We are also committed to reflecting the community by developing a erse and modern workforce – which is part-and-parcel of a progressive company,” Ian says. “It’s something that current and future employees expect in their employer. For us its part of our DNA, something that’s always been there but we are now putting a clear and visible structure around it,” Ian says.This has included being a founding member of FuSIoN – the Financial Services Inclusion Network which drives to support and promote LGBT+ professionals across the sector, becoming JAM Card members – allowing staff to knowcustomers with a communication barrier need ‘just a minute’, as well as recently being awarded the Diversity Charter Mark.“Our community involvement is something we are very clear about - something I’m passionate about and it’s an easy ask to get staff engaged. It’s very natural, and it has always been developed from the ground up,” Ian says.He believes this contributes to the huge numbers of staff doing their bit – enabling their own local communities to thrive.  ALISON MITCHELLA customer service manager for Bank of Ireland UK in Londonderry, Alison has worked for the bank for  years, but her motivation for fundraising and support for Alzheimer’s Society began in , following her mother-in-law’s diagnosis with dementia. Alison trained at her local hospital to become a dementia volunteer and learned so much she asked Alzheimer’s Society to run similar sessions in her own branch to enable staff to better assist customers with dementia.Sadly, Alison’s mother-in-law passed away in May of this year but to mark her passing and to raise vital funds in her memory, Alison took part in Alzheimer’s Society Cupcake Day. Initial plans to simply sell cupcakes within her own branch changed rapidly as colleagues from nearby branches heard of the event and wanted to support both Alison and the charity.  Faced with orders for more than  cupcakes, Alison requested a Give Together day, which is time given by the bank to both iniduals and teams to give back to their communities. Alison says: “I was in the kitchen from am to pm baking and icing but it was worth it. The event raised £, which Bank of Ireland UK matched doubling the amount raised to £,. “I could not have achieved that without the support of family, colleagues and the wider business. I was proud to raise the funds in my mother-in-law’s memory and I am proud to work for an organisation that not only values our role in the wider community but supports it too.” CHRISTINE GRAHAMChristine Graham has helped to raise funds for Cancer Research UK through the Relay for Le “Legenderry” event held in St. Columb’s Park, Londonderry.The Derry-based senior business manager for Bank of Ireland UK has personally been touched by cancer as she lost two close family members to the disease. Her young great niece was also diagnosed with a rare form of cancer in  and is now doing well, but seeing the impact a cancer diagnosis has on a family inspired Christine to get involved with the Relay for Le event.“Our event truly is ‘legenderry’,” she says. It is a -hour relay race that brings the whole community together to celebrate the lives of cancer survivors, to remember those lost to the disease, to fight back by increasing our knowledge of cancer and by raising money to fund le-saving cancer research.”In just three years the event has raised over £, for Cancer Research UK with Christine helping to raise £, in  – not only the most successful Relay for Le event in the UK this year but all funds raised in Northern Ireland stays here.  Christine values the support she has had from the bank who promote the event to the wider community and from her colleagues who enter teams.“Relay for Le is for all ages and stages, all shapes and sizes,” she says. It’s cross community and intergenerational and the atmosphere every year is electric.”Plans are already underway for Relay for Le  which promises to be another massive event. PAUL MAGEEPaul Magee, associate director of the corporate banking team, became involved with the Ulster Region Committee for Wooden Spoon, the Children’s Charity of Rugby, five years ago after he successfully completed the charity’s Four Peaks Challenge, reaching the summits of the UK and Ireland’s highest peaks. He is now an active committee member for Wooden Spoon, helping to raise funds to provide le-enhancing experiences for disadvantaged and disabled children. “All funds raised in Ulster stay in the region and benefit the children here,” Paul says. “For instance, we provided £, to the Mae Murray Foundation to buy specialist equipment for the first fully accessible beach in Ulster at Benone Strand. When we created the access to the beach, one parent was very emotional as he watched his teenage daughter in the sea for the first time. It’s those occasions where we’re responding to a need within the community that makes the effort worthwhile.”Wooden Spoon has funded numerous charity projects, most recently £, for a new multi-sensory room at Parkview Special School in Lisburn and purchasing a horse for Riding for the Disabled Association in Coleraine, a charity that enhances children’s lives every day.  With his passion for and involvement in Wooden Spoon, Paul is grateful for the support Bank of Ireland has given him in his role with the organisation, specically the corporate banking team who value his dedication to making a dference. He says: “The bank has been fantastic – I appreciate the flexibility the team offers in the lead up to events and my colleagues often attend Wooden Spoon fundraisers. I’ve also benefited from the bank’s Give Together initiative, which offers days of paid leave that employees can use for volunteering. The bank’s support has helped facilitate my commitment to Wooden Spoon, where I can really see and be a part of the impact the charity has on the local community.” SALLY IRVINEOver the last  years Sally Irvine’s coffee mornings have become a highlight in the office calendar, in turn raising more than £, for MacMillan Cancer Support and funding  days of specialist nursing care for cancer patients across Northern Ireland.Sally, a business lending and credit governance manager at Bank of Ireland UK, arranged her first Macmillan Coffee Morning in  following a colleague’s cancer diagnosis. She found herself wanting to do something to help people living with cancer and so took the plunge and decided to be a host as part of Macmillan’s biggest coffee morning fundraising event. From the outset, Sally had tremendous support from her team members and the wider business, and this has contributed to the ongoing success of the event.The bank plays a huge part in ensuring Sally can deliver the event each year by giving her support through their Give Together scheme.Sally says: “The coffee morning has become a very special occasion and a great day of fun where people from across the bank come together to have a wee cuppa and a cake and take time to catch up while raising money for a really important cause. One in two of us will face cancer at some time in our lives and I am passionate about continuing to fundraise to provide the specialist nursing care that’s so vital for those living with cancer.”Plans are already underway for this year’s Macmillan Coffee Morning and Sally is hopeful the annual fundraiser will continue to hold a special place in the office calendar. PAUL SLEVINBranch manager at Bank of Ireland UK in Newry, Paul Slevin is someone who embodies the bank’s ethos of community involvement through his role with the charity Space NI.  Space NI offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community. Through its service Home to Hospital, the organisation has helped  elderly people travel to crucial hospital appointments, while its Family Support Hub offers vital assistance to families in distress. Paul joined the charity in  and has just completed five years as chairman of the Board of Directors. He is proud that his background in finance has enabled him to support the charity through its repositioning process to ensure that its activities best serve the community.  Since Paul’s involvement with the charity began, Space NI has won the ‘One to Watch’ award at NI Social Enterprise Awards and the ‘Community Wellbeing Initiative’ at the All Ireland Pride of Place Awards. The organisation has also grown and opened a third premises in Newry and launched a range of volunteer made soy wax candles to raise crucial funds. “Bank of Ireland UK encourage all staff to give back,” Paul says. “Every manager I’ve had was very active in their community, so they were both great role models and great motivators. I think it’s really important to give our time, our expertise, and to do whatever we can to help and support the communities we live and work in.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/12312323.jpg","title":"novosco sold to global services giant for m","story":"Posted on Monday  October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland IT services firm Novosco has been bought by a German-based global industry giant for around £m, it has emerged.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: \"We’ve got a great new deal that takes back control — now Parliament should get Brexit done on Saturday so we can move on to other priorities like the cost of living, the NHS, violent crime and our environment.\" Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, said: “This agreement is a fair compromise between the EU and the UK. It is testament to the commitment and willingness of both sides to do what is best for EU and UK citizens. We now have a newly agreed Protocol that protects peace and stability on the island of Ireland and fully protects our Single Market. I hope that we can now bring this over the line and provide the certainty our citizens and businesses so deserve.” Michel Barnier, the European Commissions chief negotiator, said: “We had dficult discussions over the past days. We have managed to find solutions that fully respect the integrity of the Single Market. We created a new and legally operative solution to avoid a hard border, and protect peace and stability on the island of Ireland. It is a solution that works for the EU, for the UK and for people and businesses in Northern Ireland.” The DUP has said it could not support the deal brokered by Mr Johnson. So, what deal was agreed  A statement from the European Commission says: “In terms of regulations, Northern Ireland will remain aligned to a limited set of rules related to the EUs Single Market in order to avoid a hard border: legislation on goods, sanitary rules for veterinary controls , rules on agricultural production marketing, VAT and excise in respect of goods, and state aid rules. “In terms of customs, the EU-UK Single Customs Territory, as agreed in November , has been removed from the Protocol on Ireland   Northern Ireland, at the request of the current UK government. EU and UK negotiators have now found a new way to achieve the goal of avoiding a customs border on the island of Ireland, while at the same time ensuring Northern Ireland remains part of the UKs customs territory. This agreement fully protects the integrity of the EUs Single Market and Customs Union, and avoids any regulatory and customs checks at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. “Finally, the EU and the UK have agreed to create a new mechanism on ‘consent, which will give the Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly a decisive voice on the long-term application of relevant EU law in Northern Ireland.

We hear about the firm’s plans for growth hereBelfast City is changing and its transportation network and parking strategy have a key role to play in supporting its growth. Innovative use of technology to make parking ‘smarter’ and promoting better use of city centre space will contribute to creating the right environment for business investment and the lestyle of residents, commuters and visitors. The need for effective parking planning reaches beyond Belfast city though as parking issues are common in towns across the country. Parking planning is not just about the provision and management of spaces – the majority of parking acts require some sort of enforcement system to ensure effectiveness. As an experienced parking operator, APCOA can work with the public and private sectors to contribute knowledge and expertise to the planning and implementation of effective parking strategies. An on-going investment in developing parking technology also offers new ways of improving services to clients and the public.In August, APCOA acquired the business of Nationwide Controlled Parking Systemsin Ireland, including subsidiaries Parking Enforcement Solutionsand Mobile Research Solutions.The combined operation resulting from the acquisition sees APCOA’s business in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland double in size to cover more than , site locations and it will enable them to service all counties in both countries.APCOA’s existing business in Northern Ireland operated a number of sites including two city centre multi storey car parks in Belfast city centre. The NCPS subsidiary PEA brings a further c. locations, primarily in the greater Belfast area with key sites such as the Titanic Quarter, numerous NHS hospitals and trusts and the Odyssey.

We’re really excited about the opportunities ahead.”Neil Cunningham, managing director of APCOA in Ireland, explains why he sees the acquisition as a positive move for the business in Northern Ireland.“This investment strengthens APCOA’s ability to offer countrywide services and gives us a stronger base for future growth. Colleagues in both companies have a keen focus on customer service and we’ve brought together two experienced management teams.“I’m also delighted that Jason Ballard, founder and chief executive of NCPS and PEA, will continue to work with us for the next six months to support the smooth integration of the business.
