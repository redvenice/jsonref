I’ve had offers of numbers and stuff like that – they come to gigs with their kids and put their number on the table.I think it’s just a lot of banter, really, because parents sit in front of CBeebies – and want to sit in front of CBeebies most of the time – so you see enough of someone, and it’s just a bit of online mum and dad banter.Funnily enough, it’s the porcupine in Andy’s Wild Adventures.Their defence mechanism is basically to turn around and back into you with their spines – and it did it quite a lot.And you’d think ‘oh, it’s all right, it’s not a huge animal, you just get out of the way’, but when you’re in a small enclosure it was quite difficult. So I got sparked a few times.And there were a couple of meerkats that bit me.You don’t, and they’re not vicious, but they’re certainly not as sweet and innocent as they’re portrayed on TV.The thing is, their instincts are to defend. They’re always on guard, because they’re small creatures.But they’ve got good sharp teeth and long claws… It’s like all wild animals. Even if they’re hand-reared, the instincts are still there.No, I’m generally up for most things, to be honest.I don’t know if that’s a good or bad thing!I’m a bit, kind of, ‘yeah, I’ll do that!’ and then when I’m in the situation I might be a bit ‘hang on a minute, should I have done this?’.But generally it’s been cool – nothing I haven’t enjoyed.In CBeebies, it has to be one of two – Scrooge and Captain Hook.I love playing a baddie. I think it’s more interesting to play a baddie.I mean, Scrooge isn’t a baddie – he’s quite a tragic character. And he’s an iconic character, and he’s a character I’ve grown up with, because I’m a massive fan of A Christmas Carol.So they’re two good really fun and meaty roles to play – and popular stories.Oh, I loved it! I was really into it, because the kids are great. I just loved the whole thing.I cannot hide myself, even if I tried. I’m six foot four and a half, with massive hair.I don’t mind – I see it as part of the job. I don’t get hounded that often, and I don’t see it as being hounded.There are times when you’re with family and friends that you think ‘I’d like to wait a bit’, but generally I think it takes two seconds to say hello, and generally people are really respectable – it’s all good, really.I’d eat it with the cast of Back To The Future.I’m obsessed with Back To The Future. And I like all the stories of what happened when they filmed it back in the 80s.There’s a lot that went on – there was one actor, Eric Stoltz, who was there for six weeks, and then they re-filmed it. I’d like to question them on everything about the film.Although I probably know most things about the film these days.I think probably, yeah! We love the janitor, and we haven’t got the heart to get rid of him, but he’s not the greatest.But then, he does cause problems so I can go back in time, and that’s always a good thing.No, I leave them random. You can’t pair the socks up – no way! It’s against all rules in the Odd Socks.Well, it was written with a music production team called Bunkersonix, who are friends of mine – they wrote all the music for Andy’s Dinosaur Adventures – and we wanted to write an album that wasn’t just good for kids, but good for parents as well.I used to watch a lot of family-based entertainment when I was younger, so I wanted to bring that back, and I wanted kids and adults to enjoy listening in the car.So for every song, the scope was a Mighty Boosh for Kids  Monkees  Scooby Doo feel.We noticed the songs were based on these odd characters who just get on with things, because they’re themselves, so there’s a strong underlying message – it’s good to be yourself, we’re all different, we’re all unique, embrace it.But there’s a lot of comedy, and a lot of good music for kids to listen to.Well, we’ve got a pig that gets struck by lightning and turns into a ninja…You can find out all about Andy and the Odd Socks and the next dates on their tour from their website – and their CD, Who Invited This Lot?, is available from all good retail outlets.MORE: Liam Gallagher says he will read CBeebies bedtime story: ‘If I can curb my tongue’MORE: Why does Pando remove his pants on Bing?

If you’re desperate for a meaty burger but keen to reduce your meat intake, maybe the flexitarian burger could be the answer.(Picture: Byron)But rather than rejoicing over the meaty mushroom mashup, people have been a little stuck on the name.Because to most of us, being a flexitarian means you eat vegetarian options for some meals, or on some days, but occasionally eat meat or fish for other meals, or on other days.Surely, if you’re a flexitarian, that means the entire menu is already open to you. If you fancy being vegetarian on the specific day you’re at Byron, you get one of the veggie options. If you’re gagging for some meat, you get a meat burger. Right?Exec: “Mushrooms. In the beef. We can say it’s flexitarian?”Other, smarter exec: “That’s not what th-“Bigger Exec: “I love it.”And of course, along with confusion came some shady references to Byron’s past.To be fair to Byron, the Flexi burger probably is a good idea for anyone who’s flexitarian in the sense that they want to cut down on their meat consumption without giving it up entirely.Clearly they’re trying to do a nice thing.‘The Flex and the Reflex burgers have been created because our customers want them,’ said Paul Mason, head of food at Byron. ‘Whether it be for health or sustainability reasons, there’s lot of people who are more conscious about the amount of meat they’re eating right now.‘The Reflex comes topped with house-made red pepper ketchup, fresh tomato, red onion, baby kale, roasted garlic \u0026amp rosemary mayonnaise. Both burgers can be cooked to your liking of either medium or well done.‘These burgers are just one of many new products that we’re launching across the UK to offer proper burger ersity. Whether you’re a meat-lover, veggie, vegan or simply having a meat-free Monday, you’ll find yourself at home in a Byron.’See? They’re trying to be nice. It’s just that they have incurred the wrath and mockery of the internet, and are now doomed.Sorry, Byron. Perhaps don’t hop on a dietary trend to market an otherwise interesting burger next time.MORE: A beer company is looking to pay someone to drink beer and travel to AmericaMORE: Cheeseburger Pringles exist and they sound incredibleMORE: Attention, Pink Ladies: A Grease-themed slumber party is coming to London"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/sei_77747561.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"rent jess 580 room deptford","story":"(Picture: Alexander Crawley)To help us all navigate the hellscape that is the London housing situation, we’ve launched a new series called What I Rent.Each week we’ll be taking you around a different Londoner’s home, showing all the nooks, crannies, and grotty sinks to give us all a better understanding of what’s normal.Because it’s tricky to make sense of renting when we swing between seeing people’s Pinterest-y pads and depressingly tiny studio rooms.What’s a normal amount to pay each month? What should you be getting for your money? Is everyone else putting up with a shower in the kitchen?Second in our series is Jess, 24, who lives in Deptford.(Picture: Alexander CrawleyusSo, how much are you paying?I pay £580 a month which includes all bills including council tax.And what are you getting for that princely sum?The flat is in Deptford in South East. It’s zone 2 but a wee bit out of the way so no tube line unfortunately.There’s four bedrooms in total, and since I moved in a few months ago one of the rooms has been empty. A new girl just moved in recently, so perhaps it’s going to be a fight to get to the shower in the mornings, but I reckon a house of four is not too bad.There are two bathrooms, but one of those is just a toilet and a sink.The groundfloor bathroom is just a toilet and a sink. (Picture: Alexander CrawleyusHow long have you lived there?I’ve lived here since the end of February after a fire at my old flat meant I had to move pretty sharpish. I’m still kinda in that in-between place where I’ve got to buy stuff for my room and the kitchen, so not fully at home yet but getting there.How did you find this place? Every flat I’ve lived in since I moved to London two years ago was from SpareRoom.It’s pretty hit and miss, and plenty of dodgy agents, but not all bad. I’m really careful now after some bad experiences – including a creepy landlord who used to call me at night ‘just to chat’.I am happy here, but because of the circumstances of moving it’s not quite ‘home’ to me. I love the area so much (great markets, lovely people, a really good local) that I’d struggle to live anywhere else in London.My housemates are nice too, striking the balance between cool and chatty but not all up in my personal space. I also think I’ve managed to put a bit of a stamp on my room so it feels like my own – so many people I know just have a white box with their clothes in. That sounds like hell to me.Do you feel like you have enough space?Space isn’t really an issue, but there definitely isn’t enough storage for me.There are no drawers in her room, so Jess makes do with some small shelves. (Picture: Alexander Crawley)At the moment my underwear is all in some Ikea shelf because there are no drawers, and I’ve got loads of storage containers full of shoes. Get me a wardrobe like Kylie Jenner’s and I’ll never complain again.I’d also want space to put a TV in my room. Netflix on my laptop makes me feel like a teenage boy.And the people you live with. Did you know them before you moved in together?Nope, all new people.I’ve considered living with my best friend, but being a bit of an introvert I’m not sure they’d cope with my need to be by myself a lot of the time.Also I’d rather not fight with an IRL friend over blocked sinks and who took the bins out last.Are there any major issues with your renting situation that you have to put up with?The glaring issue with this flat is that there’s no bath. I’m not quite sure how I’m surviving without one as it used to be my way to relax after a hard day, and I’ve nearly died a few times trying to stretch in the shower cubicle when it’s time to shave my legs.There are also some issues with mould and ants (I promise I’m a clean person, but they both just KEEP COMING BACK) and although the landlord is supposed to come over to clean once a week I don’t ever notice anything being clean – sorry, landlord.The bathroom sink. (Picture: Alexander CrawleyusIt’s just an old flat so no matter how much you clean there’s still rusty bits and broken things. In an ideal world it’d get renovated and be boujee as hell, but for under £600 all in I can’t see it happening any time soon.As you can see in the photos, the thermostat is in a weird locked box. There’s a locked cupboard with stuff in it that we could really use sometimes (like a mop and basic tools).I’m not sure if the landlord doesn’t trust us or he’s had issues with people in the past, but it takes away from any comfortable vibe the flat might have had – like a constant reminder it’s not ‘our place’.Oh, also, not to be a grass, but none of the windows work properly which freaks the sh*t out of me since my housemates nearly died in the fire at my last flat. It does keep me awake some nights worrying I wouldn’t be able to get out if anything happened, but there’s not much I can do about it.The thermostat is in a locked box. (Picture: Alexander CrawleyusAny plans to move?I’m planning on moving in the next few months but trying not to rush it and find something I love rather than moving for moving’s sake like last time.I want a bath in the next place and perhaps more of a homely vibe with somewhere I can stay for a few years. Also, a cat. If there’s a cat involved I’m signing that lease ASAP.And, um, any plans to buy?Hahaha what a cute question. No, on a journalist’s salary I’m not looking into buying anywhere, but if anyone wants to PayPal me £100k for a deposit after seeing how I live I’ll send you my deets.Feel free to give us £100k while you’re at it. In the meantime, let’s have a look around Jess’s place:But other than that, she’s pretty happy. Even when she is lurking in the corner.

Labour\u0027s David Lammy told fellow MPs it was a \u0027day of national shame\u0027.Campaigners insisted that at least one person had already been wrongly sent back to Jamaica. It emerged at the weekend that Government officials had refused to meet Caribbean envoys to discuss the cases of those who came from the late 1940s to the 1970s to help rebuild post-war Britain.            Miss Rudd faced a call to resign and was summoned to the Commons to apologise for the fiasco. Labour\u0027s David Lammy told fellow MPs it was a \u0027day of national shame\u0027Despite living here for decades, many have now mistakenly been told they are illegals under a Home Office crackdown on immigration paperwork. Some have lost their right to work, rent property, receive pensions, access bank accounts and have NHS care. Others have been told they risk detention and deportation.The row turned toxic yesterday when immigration minister Caroline Nokes suggested there had been deportations. As ministers were branded \u0027inhumane and cruel\u0027:- Miss Rudd said the Home Office was \u0027too concerned with policy and strategy, and sometimes lost sight of the inidual\u0027 - Commonwealth countries will be contacted to check whether anyone had been wrongly removed- A taskforce will speed up the regularisation of immigration status for tens of thousands of citizens- Cases will be resolved in two weeks and the £229 fee will be waived- Theresa May performed a U-turn by agreeing to meet Caribbean leaders who have been raising concerns- A cross-party group of 140 MPs wrote to the Prime Minister demanding \u0027immediate and effective\u0027 action.Miss Nokes made her comments in an interview with Channel 4 News. She said: \u0027Potentially they have been deported and I\u0027m conscious that it\u0027s very much in error and that\u0027s an error I want to put right.\u0027Then she told ITV News that some people had been booted out of the UK \u0027horrendously\u0027, adding: \u0027I don\u0027t know the numbers, but what I am determined to do going forward is to say we will have no more of this.\u0027In the aftermath of her interviews, officials insisted no one had been deported in the immigration crackdown.But then in the Commons, Miss Rudd said she was not aware of any cases but was investigating and conceded some members of the \u0027Windrush generation\u0027 may have been wrongly sent back to the Caribbean.          Leaders from Caribbean countries who wanted to discuss with Theresa May the plight of those who have lost their everyday rights as Britons have been told there will be no formal meeting with the Prime Ministers (pictured: the SS Empire Windrush which brought the first generation of workers to Britain from the West Indies in 1948)          New rules require documentary evidence of the right to be here, which many Windrush children do not have as anyone who arrived in the UK from a Commonwealth country before 1971 was given indefinite leave to remain, meaning many did not apply for a British passport          Communities Secretary Sajid Javid took to Twitter to voice \u0027deep concern\u0027 about the situationShe added: \u0027That is why I have asked the high commissioners if they know of any, that they should bring it to me.\u0027Last night, the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants said at least one person had wrongly been sent back to Jamaica. Satbir Singh, who is the charity\u0027s chief executive, said: \u0027It is true, but it is very difficult to know how many people have been removed. What\u0027s shocking is that the Government admits that it has no record of the numbers.\u0027Downing Street said Mrs May wanted to ensure that \u0027no one with the right to be here will be made to leave\u0027.     Albert Thompson, who has been denied life saving treatment on the NHSAlbert Thompson, 63, has lived in London for 44 years - but told he must pay £54,000 for life saving treatment on the NHS.For three decades Mr Thompson worked, supported a family, and was a head mechanic for a string of garages, and paid his taxes.His mother arrived in the UK from Jamaica in the Sixties to come and work her as a nurse. He had surgery for prostate cancer in January last year, before NHS eligibility rules were tightened, and was to begin radiotherapy at the Royal Marsden Hospital, London, last November. But when he arrived for his first NHS radiotherapy session following the removal of his prostate, he was told he was not entitled to free treatment. It is because the Home Office can find no record of Mr Thompson, who was born in Jamaica, in its files. He lost the Caribbean passport he arrived in the UK with some years ago. And without a British passport - which he\u0027s never had and cannot not get because there is no documentary proof of his arrival here as a teenager in 1973, landlords will not house him and the NHS have told his he can\u0027t have treatment. He said: \u0027At present I\u0027m left in limbo. It feels like I\u0027ve been left to die because the job hasn\u0027t been finished. I get depressed, stressed out, anxious.\u0027I used to have a life, to work, to go out, enjoy myself. I had a nice car, a home. I went to the cinema, dancing. But that\u0027s the past. I have to think about the present and it\u0027s hard to come to terms with. I\u0027ve got no money.\u0027I\u0027m very angry with the Government that I\u0027m in this position. I\u0027m here legally, but they\u0027re asking me to prove I\u0027m British.\u0027 Mr Thompson worked until 2008 when he was diagnosed with the blood cancer lymphoma and an acute back problem since then he has been too ill to work. He was evicted from his rented flat because his landlord wanted to sell it. Tenants must now produce a British passport in order to rent accommodation. As Albert — not his real name — does not have a passport, he could not find a home.\u0027I was on the streets for three weeks. I had to beg for food. I felt ashamed. I just asked people in shops if they had anything spare.\u0027After three weeks, Albert had managed to secure a room through a homeless charity, St Mungo\u0027s. He still lives in that accommodation now.                                                     "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/12/07/4B12542000000578-0-image-a-17_1523513785551.jpg","title":"Sewage plant completely blocked granny pants","story":"The huge pants, were discovered by workers at the treatment plant who found thy contained a label with the name \u0027Eileen\u0027Down the toilet bowl!

It did catch me off guard.\u0027He added: \u0027She kissed me. She made the move. And I think I was like, OK – we\u0027re at that phase of our relationship right now, we\u0027re kissing. That was what happened.\u0027There were other kisses after that moment. She definitely made the first move and initiated the first act of affection in that way.\u0027Silverstein, who still lives in Los Angeles, said the duo had previously hugged and held hands but had never gone further until the actress, now 36, took matters into her own hands.Meghan later recounted the moment during a 2013 interview with Larry King, telling the veteran host: \u0027I was 13, it was a summer camp and I kissed him!\u0027Silverstein added: \u0027We had already become a couple. We had held hands prior - I\u0027ve always been affectionate, so we\u0027d already hugged. But the kiss was definitely her, her initiative absolutely.\u0027The teenage romance began after the pair met at a drama-focused summer camp organized by the Agape International Spiritual Center.Silverstein has grown up to be a star in the US as he is an actor, comedian and rapper who appears on The Late, Late Show. He is now a married father-of-two young children still living in Los Angeles, but he still remembers his romance with Meghan           Meghan and Silverstein met at a drama summer camp at their local Agape Spiritual Church.

Silverstein said that he believes Meghan will continue her activism work once she marries Prince Harry.

International Mother Earth Day 2018 therefore falls on a Sunday.What is International Mother Earth Day?According to the UN, ‘International Mother Earth Day is celebrated to remind each of us that the Earth and its ecosystems provide us with life and sustenance’.The Day calls for the recognition of our collective responsibility to promote harmony with nature and the Earth ‘to achieve a just balance among the economic, social and environmental needs of the present and future generations of humanity’.Harmony with Nature is the UN\u0027s initiative to get people and societies to reconsider their relationship with the Earth and the natural world to improve \u0027the ethical basis of the relationship between humankind\u0027 and our planet.          International Mother Earth Day coincides with another event raising awareness, Earth DayThe UN says the Day should be treated as an opportunity for people to raise public awareness about the challenges surrounding the well-being of the planet and all the life it sustains.In the UN resolution recognising the day, it says member states should acknowledge ‘that the Earth and its ecosystems are our home, and convinced that in order to achieve a just balance among the economic, social, and environmental needs of present and future generations, it is necessary to promote harmony with nature and the Earth’.Last year\u0027s theme was \u0027Environmental Climate Literacy\u0027 - whose aim was to establish a global citizenry that was \u0027fluent in the concepts of climate change and aware of its unprecedented threat to our planet\u0027.                                                    Why is it called International Mother Earth Day?The day is named so because Mother Earth, as it says in the resolution, is ‘a common expression for planet earth in a number of countries and regions, which reflects the interdependence that exists among human beings, other living species and the planet we all inhabit’.How did International Mother Earth Day start?The Day was created in 2009, when the General Assembly wanted to add another dimension  to, and way of achieving the balance between economic, social and environmental needs of current and future generations.Recognising that Earth Day was already celebrated in many countries on the same day, the UN decided to assign April 22 to International Mother Earth Day through resolution ARES63278. When is Kardashian Family Feud on TV?

Anyone of that age, anywhere in the world, can join and get discounts in Tate’s cafes and shops as well as £5 entry per person for themselves and three friends.Currently, 16-25-year-olds make up less than a tenth of the audience for Tate exhibitions. Balshaw said she now expects that figure to increase quickly, without it costing a great deal. “Nothing in life is free but because this is about growth in audience we anticipate it will pay for itself.”Tate also plans to appoint a trustee to represent the views of young people. Balshaw said: “We are acting on what 16-25-year-olds say they want so that we can make the changes needed for future generations. Our sector should be shaped by their creative energy and their message to us is clear: arts institutions should plan with, not for them.”Ticket prices for exhibitions have crept up over recent years. In 2012 it cost visitors £16 to see the big Leonardo da Vinci show at the National Gallery. Weekend tickets for its current Monet show are £22. Standard entry to Tate Modern’s Matisse show in 2014 was £16.30, while it current Picasso show is £22.Balshaw said affordability was an issue and Tate had other shows with cheaper tickets as well as discount schemes for older people. “Larger exhibitions are more expensive to make and have a higher ticket price,” she said.For legal reasons, Tate cannot specify an age range for the new trustee, but they will be expected to have a “commitment, connection and real insight” into the generation born after 1978, Balshaw said.Tate’s initiative has been supported by the culture secretary, Matt Hancock. He said: “Young people are the cultural leaders of the future and it is important we do all we can to support their creativity and ideas.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5a85d63585edccf6ef0c24a9dbb1493b3332c07/212_159_5777_3466/master/5777.jpg?w=5750\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1bf2ee47961bfe7ddacc4a6679e269de 11500w","title":"post pop art portugal calouste gulbenkian foundation","story":"Post-pop, Beyond the Commonplace features more than 200 works made in Britain and Portugal between 1965 and 1975.

It focuses on the travails of an honest man sent to wade through the muck and slime of America’s political Babylon. The exemplar is, of course, the 1939 classic film Mr Smith Goes to Washington, with Jimmy Stewart as the lone man of integrity on the Potomac. But the archetype recurs at intervals in the culture, with the West Wing’s Jed Bartlet a more recent incarnation. And now we can add a new, non-fiction addition: the memoir of James Comey, the FBI director fired a year ago by Donald Trump.Perennially cast as a boy scout – and in Washington that’s usually an insult – Comey establishes his goody-goody credentials early and often. We learn that, when he was in his 20s, people would clap eyes on the 6ft8in lawyer and instantly offer smalltalk about his presumed past as a player of college basketball. As it happens Comey hadn’t played, but in his youth he would let people think he had. “This was a seemingly small and inconsequential lie told by a stupid kid, but it was a lie nonetheless. And it ate at me. So after law school I wrote to the friends I’d lied to and told them the truth,” he writes. Later he gives the director of national intelligence a necktie. Or rather, “I regifted to him a tie my brother-in-law had given me … Because we considered ourselves people of integrity, I disclosed it was a regift.”There’s plenty in that vein, including a declaration that Comey made a habit of using the staff canteen at FBI headquarters and that “I never cut the line … even when I was in a hurry.” Acting pre-emptively to ensure the reader is not left “mildly nauseous” – to quote Comey’s description of how he would feel if he had tipped the election to Trump – by all this virtue, the introduction warns us that the author has long struggled with flaws in his character that include being “stubborn, prideful, overconfident, and driven by ego”. The word “sanctimonious” appears in the book’s first paragraph.All this moral goodness can make Comey an occasionally cloying companion. Nor is the book helped by its apparent dual function as a leadership manual aimed at those who tend to turn left when they board aircraft. There’s lots of management tips for the inspiration-hungry CEO, advice about getting the best from your team and an unfortunate tendency to describe anyone in even a vaguely senior organisational role as a “leader”.Fortunately, though, Comey has quite a story to tell – and that’s even before we get to the Clinton and Trump chapters that have made this book an instant bestseller. His life has been full of drama. As a teenager, he and his kid brother were held at gunpoint in their home by an intruder who turned out to be a wanted serial rapist. He and his wife lost a baby to a preventable infection nine days after the child was born. In his early career as a prosecutor, Comey took on and defeated the Gambino crime family.Yet the temptation is strong to read all this through the lens of what we know will follow. Indeed, the author pushes us in that direction. When he recalls some unhappy childhood memories and offers his thoughts on the psychology of the bully, we know who he has in mind. And he is not afraid to make the connection explicit. Cornered into a dinner a deux with Trump at the White House, and asked to profess his personal loyalty, he is reminded of “Sammy the Bull’s Cosa Nostra induction ceremony – with Trump, in the role of the family boss, asking me if I have what it takes to be a ‘made man’”.For liberal Trump-haters, reading A Higher Loyalty will be a conflicted experience. Comey was both hero and villain in 2016, on the one hand closing the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of unsecured email and, on the other, revealing he’d reopened it again less than a fortnight before election day. He both saved her candidacy and buried it.Accordingly, the Hillary chapters will be hard going for those who hoped she would become America’s first woman president. Yet Comey makes a good defence of his actions, showing how he was repeatedly confronted with a series of lose-lose choices. On the late October disclosure that the email probe was active again, he writes that he faced two doors: one marked Speak, the other Conceal. Had he failed to reveal that investigators were looking anew at Clinton’s emails, and had she been elected, Americans could justifiably argue that they had not voted in full possession of the facts. The FBI’s silence would have rendered Clinton an illegitimate president. (You can imagine what the Fox-Republican complex would have done with such a revelation.)Even those who follow Comey’s logic – and most readers will, I suspect, conclude that his motives were pure – are likely to struggle nonetheless with the other crucial decision he took in 2016. If disclosure was right for Hillary, why was it not right for Trump? Why did the FBI not announce that it was also looking at Trump’s possible collusion with Russia? Here Comey’s reasoning is much less persuasive. He explains that the TrumpRussia investigation was at a much earlier stage, that they did not want to tip off possible suspects and so on. But given the stakes, and the consequences, it’s not really good enough.The truth is, and Comey admits as much, he and others, including Barack Obama, were swayed by their assumption that Clinton was cruising to victory. That led Obama to keep back what he knew about Russian meddling in the election: why undermine Americans’ faith in their democracy when those Russian efforts were apparently making so little difference? And that same assumption shaped Comey’s decisions: he allowed himself to be more worried by questions of future public faith in a Clinton victory than by the risk that his actions might derail that outcome.The Trump win and what followed provides the material for the book’s most riveting chapters. Comey has a keen eye and his observations of Trump and his enablers are sharp. He shows us attorney general Jeff Sessions, for example, under pressure, eyes down, darting from left to right. But it’s Trump we’ve paid to see.Comey cannot disguise his loathing for the man, and the portrait he paints could not be uglier. He has Trump speaking in monologue, leaving no space for anyone else to say a word, a silence the new president takes as assent and complicity. Trump is ignorant – he blanks at Comey’s use of the word “calligrapher” – incurious and casually dishonest. And his ego is unbound. When Comey attended Oval Office meetings with Obama or George W Bush, the president would take a seat with the rest of the group: primus inter pares. But Trump remains seated behind his big desk, as if on a throne attended by courtiers. Comey puts that down to insecurity. A more confident man would not need to demonstrate his status so crudely.Comey records such details throughout, noting who has emotional intelligence and who lacks it. He describes “the Washington listen”: not so much listening as waiting for your turn to speak. And he offers some fascinating observations on presidential humour. Bush could crack a joke, but it was usually at someone else’s expense. Obama laughed easily and never once used humour as a putdown. Trump, meanwhile, never laughs, not even once: to do so would require acknowledging the existence, and successful conversational play, of another person.If the book has a hero besides Comey, it is Obama. A one-time registered Republican, Comey is bowled over by the Democrat who made him head of the FBI. In Obama he sees the wisdom and human sensitivity he aspires to himself. He recalls how, at a reception to mark Comey’s appointment, Obama posed for a photograph with Comey, his wife, the couple’s two daughters and their then boyfriends. At one point, Obama gestured to the boyfriends and said, “Hey, why don’t we take another without the guys. You know, just in case.” It was done playfully, but it was also wise. With all that must weigh on a president’s mind, he nevertheless had room to imagine the awkwardness such a photo could cause several decades later.In Comey’s telling, Obama was something of a saint in the swamp. Obama valued what Comey himself cherished and regarded as near-sacred: the independence of US institutions and, more important still, the obligation to tell the truth.There was a time when we might have teased such a man, mocking him as an earnest altar boy. But we don’t have that luxury now. In today’s world, truth has become a precious commodity and those ready to risk their careers to defend it are few and far between. Comey may be self-righteous, but in 2018 and given the alternatives, that has come to look like a rather tolerable vice.• A Higher Loyalty by James Comey is published by Macmillan (£20).

His affair with advertising began as Saatchi \u0026amp Saatchi’s first finance directorSorrell made his first step toward global domination at the age of 40, investing in a small Kent-based maker of wire baskets called Wire \u0026amp Plastic ProductsSorrell announces himself on the global stage by buying J Walter Thompson, the world’s oldest ad agency and an iconic US brand for $566m.

He stepped down on 14 April“Sir Martin Sorrell’s resignation comes at a time when the company is already facing a number of operational challenges and introduces uncertainty over the strategy and ultimately the structure of the group going forward,” said Azzi.Moody’s said that WPP was already weakly positioned before Sorrell’s departure, performing significantly below its peers such as the US groups Omincom and IPG and the French firm Publicis.WPP’s board meeting, the first not to include its founder and chief executive in years, was expected to include Mark Read and Andrew Scott, the senior executives promoted to run the company day-to-day during the search for a new chief executive. They are also considered the two leading internal candidates.The board member Sol Trujillo, a former chief of companies including the French telecoms firm Orange and Australia’s Telstra, is understood to have been one of the most vocal about the issue of succession at WPP.A number of names have emerged as potential runners and riders to succeed Sorrell, including the chief executive of the publishing and exhibitions group Informa, Stephen Carter, who has worked at Ofcom, the cable firm NTL and WPP’s ad agency JWT Adam Crozier, whose pedigree includes running ITV, the Royal Mail, the Football Association and Saatchi \u0026amp Saatchi the Sky chief executive, Jeremy Darroch, and Andrew Robertson, the chief executive of Omnicom’s global BBDO ad network.Sorrell has said he was available to assist with the transition.The 73-year old has “unreservedly denied” misconduct allegations and WPP’s board has said it would not be publishing the outcome of the investigations into them by an independent law firm.The influential shareholder advisory firm Glass Lewis said it would prefer WPP to publish the report but that it accepted this was unlikely to happen.“In the interests of transparency, we would prefer if the report was made available to shareholders, though we view that outcome as unlikely,” said Martin Mortell, Glass Lewis UK \u0026amp Europe’s director of research. “Some investors may be willing to forego transparency in lieu of achieving overdue change at the top and the opportunity of a new strategic vision.”Sir Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, has said there was a “real lack of transparency” and “any investigations done by the company should be made public”.

However, the AA says he is no longer entitled to the shares after his dismissal for gross misconduct on 1 August.Announcing results for the year to 31 January 2018, the board said it had not set aside any sum for damages and expected to be able to recoup legal costs of about £1m.“The group has not made a provision for these amounts, as the group expects to be successful in rigorously defending these claims,” the AA said.“However, the group will incur legal costs of approximately £1m to defend these claims during the next two financial years, which it would seek to recover from Bob Mackenzie when the litigation concludes.”Mackenzie’s late-night altercation with the AA’s Mike Lloyd took place last summer in the bar of the five-star Pennyhill Park hotel in Surrey, and was captured on CCTV.Mackenzie’s lawyers are understood to be claiming he was wrongfully dismissed, having been under extreme pressure, and should be entitled to damages. They will also say that the company had excluded him from talks over a proposed merger between the AA’s insurance business and rival Hastings, which they say was a factor in the incident.Friends and family members have said the company had placed extreme pressure on Mackenzie, who was “not well” and had mixed the prescription drug diazepam with alcohol before the attack.He had been executive chairman of the AA since 2014, when he was instrumental in the stock market flotation.Simon Breakwell, the AA’s chief executive since September, said the sacking ad not overshadowed the company’s “solid performance” during the year.The company is hoping to capitalise on its “car genie” device, launched in August with the potential to predict up to one-third of breakdowns for customers before they happen, according to the AA.

The plane, a Boeing 737 bound from New York to Dallas with 149 people aboard, made an emergency landing in Philadelphia just before noon.“I just remember holding my husband’s hand, and we just prayed and prayed and prayed,” said Amanda Bourman, a passenger from New York. “And the thoughts that were going through my head of course were about my daughters, just wanting to see them again and give them a big hug so they wouldn’t grow up without parents.” The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) chairman, Robert Sumwalt, said one person was killed, the first passenger fatality on a US airline since 2009.Seven other people were treated for minor injuries, the Philadelphia fire commissioner, Adam Thiel, said. He said there was a fuel leak in one of the engines when firefighters arrived and a small fire was quickly brought under control. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said the plane landed after the crew reported damage to one of the engines, along with the fuselage and at least one window. The NTSB sent a team of investigators to Philadelphia. Bourman said she was seated near the back and was asleep when she heard a loud noise and oxygen masks dropped from the ceiling. She said the plane was fairly quiet because everyone was wearing a mask, while some passengers were in tears and others shouted words of encouragement. “Everybody was crying and upset,” she said. “You had a few passengers that were very strong and they kept yelling to people, you know, ‘It’s OK, we’re going to do this.”’ Another passenger, Marty Martinez, did a brief Facebook Live posting while wearing an oxygen mask. He posted, “Something is wrong with our plane! It appears we are going down! Emergency landing! Southwest flight from NYC to Dallas!” After the plane landed, he posted photos of a damaged window near the engine. Bourman said that everyone had started yelling to brace for impact when the plane started to land. Everyone clapped and praised the pilot after he set the aircraft down. Bourman said she saw emergency medical workers using a defibrillator to help a woman who was taken off the plane. Bourman said she also saw a man in a cowboy hat rush to cover the broken window and that the man had a bandage around his arm after the plane landed. Passengers did “some pretty amazing things under some pretty difficult circumstances”, Thiel said. Tracking data from FlightAware.com showed Flight 1380 was heading west over New York’s southern tier at about 32,200ft and traveling at 500mph when it abruptly turned toward Philadelphia. Southwest has about 700 planes, all of them 737s, including more than 500 737-700s like the one involved in the emergency landing. It is the world’s largest operator of the 737. The Boeing 737 is the best-selling jetliner in the world and has a good safety record. John Goglia, a former NTSB member, said investigators would take the Southwest engine apart to understand what happened and would look at maintenance records for the engine. Goglia said the Boeing 737 was a safe plane but engine failures occurred from time to time. “We’re pushing the engines to produce as much power as possible,” he said. “We’re right on the edge. Sometimes they fail, and that’s why the containment ring is there.” The engine failure was reminiscent of a similar event on a Southwest Boeing 737-700 jet in August 2016 as it flew from New Orleans to Orlando, Florida. Shrapnel from the engine left a 5in-by-16in hole just above the wing. Passenger oxygen masks dropped from the ceiling. Pilots landed the plane safely in Pensacola, Florida. NTSB investigators said one of the engine’s fan blades had broken off from the hub during the flight. The broken edge of the blade showed crack lines consistent with metal fatigue.

But many more are suffering from the ‘hostile environment’ Theresa May createdAfter five months of shocking revelations about the treatment of Windrush generation citizens, the UK government has apologised. This dramatic and welcome U-turn is nonetheless too little, too late. Lives have been wrecked. Members of a generation who arrived at Britain’s invitation – proffered not from generosity, but because their labour was needed – spent decades working and paying taxes. Then their jobs were snatched away, their homes lost, their treatment for cancer withheld. At least two were sent to detention centres and\u0026nbspthreatened with removal to countries they left 50\u0026nbspyears ago, as children.Legally, they have every right to remain. But, as the Guardian has exposed in a series of stories, an increasingly harsh immigration regime abruptly required them to justify their presence by producing decades-old paperwork. Now it emerges that officials actually destroyed landing cards which could have helped support their cases, despite warnings from staff.Until now, the government has been dismissive when challenged over this scandal. The prime minister refused to intervene when it emerged that one man was being denied radiotherapy unless he could pay a £54,000 bill upfront. Downing Street initially snubbed Caribbean countries’ request for a meeting to address the problem. As outrage over the grotesque injustice grew, the home secretary made an unusually forthright apology in the House of Commons on Monday. Amber Rudd described her own department’s actions as “appalling”. A new taskforce has been created and is supposed to resolve cases within two weeks. Application fees will be waived. On Tuesday Theresa May went further, promising compensation to anyone left out of pocket many have lost work and benefits and face daunting legal bills.The toll has not been merely material. Jobs and homes are part of people’s identities. The stress and trauma are likely to engender an enduring sense of insecurity in those who never previously doubted that this was their home. And the fear reverberates far and wide. Most immediately, these cases fuel concern over how EU citizens will be treated after Brexit. Others are already suffering, with families cruelly split by complex income requirements, an illogical and inflexible policing of other rules and frequently by official mistakes (for which iniduals pay, with expensive applications, appeals and legal fees).Though Mrs May says she is “genuinely sorry” about the anxiety of Windrush citizens, this is not a\u0026nbspmatter of random administrative errors but part of a systematic issue created by her choices. As\u0026nbsphome secretary, she boasted of creating a “really hostile environment” for illegal immigrants. This\u0026nbspwas the necessary concomitant to the arbitrary cap upon immigration. Setting a number, rather than establishing principles, led officials to focus on keeping out or removing as many people as possible, instead of handling cases fairly, equitably and humanely. Setting a number so unrealistically low – and including overseas students, reportedly at Mrs\u0026nbspMay’s insistence  – means that it has not been met seven years later, even with this punitive approach.Scrapping the “go home” vans (under legal pressure) and changing terminology (the home office now prefers the Orwellian euphemism “compliant” to hostile) were cosmetic measures. The government pursues the same course with a disastrous mixture of grim determination and incompetence. The vote for Brexit was read as a legitimisation of this hard line – or, more cynically, a spur to pursuing it as a political strategy. The Windrush scandal is the result: “If you lay down with dogs, you get fleas, and that is what has happened with this far-right rhetoric in this country,” the Labour MP David Lammy told parliament.When Mrs May first spoke of a hostile environment, she presented it as a matter of fairness: making sure that all abided by the same rules. But treating people as guilty until proved innocent, making mistakes at the cost of those applying, and handling lives so callously sits oddly with the sense of decency and fair play so often claimed as inherently British – whether those involved arrived from the Commonwealth half\u0026nbspa century ago, or much more recently."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a094e63bba2c9bb70f0dde657e9adf84972d33fe/0_0_650_392/master/650.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02f355469e40978c0c2846133e8a0e36 700w","title":"shawn mendes webchat interview","story":"The 19-year-old pop star answered your questions about his pre-show routines, how he deals with stress and anxiety, and what he likes to rock out toHey guys, thank you so much for submitting all of your wonderful questions.

Could Oxford and Cambridge universities opt to break free from state control and go private?The government launched its review of post-18 education in February. With the Tories keen to woo young voters, following Jeremy Corbyn’s commitment to end tuition fees, a reduction of the £9,250 fees cap is widely expected. But vice-chancellors say quality could be threatened if the government does not plug any gap with new funding.Unlike other universities, Oxford and Cambridge say fees, even at £9,250, do not cover the costs of the tutorial-led teaching for which they are famous. A spokesperson for Cambridge would not comment about going private, but said each student costs an average of £18,500 a year to teach.It has been on the cards since the\u0026nbspConservatives\u0026nbsppromised a major review of funding across tertiary education in their election manifesto. With graduate debt running at £50,000 upwards, there has been growing concern about the cost of going to university and whether it represents value for money. Fees in the UK are among the highest in the world, and some doubt there will be a return on such a huge investment in terms of graduate earnings.The government is\u0026nbsppromising a wide-ranging review\u0026nbspof the whole of post-18 education and funding, including the ide between vocational and academic qualifications and the decline in lifelong and part-time study. Most of the interest will be in undergraduate tuition fees, which stand at a hefty £9,250 a year at all but a handful of universities.The government will not seek to match\u0026nbspLabour’s promise to axe tuition fees\u0026nbspaltogether, which the Conservatives regard as unaffordable and regressive. The review could recommend cutting or freezing fees. One of the most controversial options is the introduction of variable fees for different courses, depending on the cost of putting a course on, potential graduate earnings and the economic value to the country. So some universities might for example cut their fees for social science and humanities courses, which generally attract lower graduate earnings than engineering or maths.Not very. With the review set to run for a year, reporting in early 2019, the government has been accused of kicking the issue into the long grass. If you are applying to start university this September, nothing will have substantially changed.If they declared themselves independent, they could set their own fees and not have to endure state regulation, which requires them to prove the quality of their research – and what they do with it – plus that of their teaching and the amount their graduates earn.Matt Robb, of EY-Parthenon, a consultancy that advises universities, says: “Oxford and Cambridge are currently in the top five institutions in the world. If that status were threatened by loss of funding or other factors, and this was the only solution, I think they wouldn’t blink in pushing to go private.”Some experts argue that this could solve a conundrum for ministers, who want to cut fees but don’t want to damage two such stellar British brands.Butler adds that other elite universities might follow. A senior Oxbridge college figure agrees: “It would really only work if Oxford and Cambridge, Imperial College London, UCL, Kings College London and the LSE all went together.”Speculation about what the top two could charge students varies, but several insiders suggest around £15,000. They insist this would allow Oxbridge to follow Harvard University and offer “needs blind” admissions. One academic manager says: “Perhaps just one third of students might pay the actual sticker price.” But such high fees would still stir up huge controversy.Lord Butler says: “I think the government might be anxious that independent universities would become like private schools and would be largely confined to the well off. However, that needn’t be the case as universities with strong brands could ensure that access could be completely means tested, with bursaries for families who could not afford the fees.”However Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute thinktank, says: “If they walk away from the regulatory system they are basically the same as private schools. No one chases Eton hard about needs-blind admissions.” If admissions were scrupulously fair, the private universities would be less likely to spend as much time and money on going into state schools and searching for talented students, he says.“People often talk about admissions in America in a very positive light, but although there are needs-blind admissions, Ivy League universities also give places to the children of donors and alumni. Part of moulding a class is handpicking the wealthy.”Money is not the only driver behind the latest rumblings. There is also resentment about the government’s drive to treat students as consumers and to assess the value universities offer them.Stephen Toope, Cambridge’s vice-chancellor, blogged last month: “For a generation now, politicians of all stripes have talked as if UK universities are broken, and hence in need of ‘market discipline’. They talk as if our students, smart and energetic people, are in need of protection. This is an own goal.”Another vice-chancellor, who has asked not to be named, says: “We are seeing a real threat to institutional autonomy from ministers. I think right now we must be the closest we’ve ever been to a point where Oxford and Cambridge will turn round and say, ‘Sod this, we are fed up with being criticised, we’ll go private’.”But many in the sector think this is a leap too far. Prof Simon Marginson, director of the centre for global higher education at UCL’s Institute of Education, agrees that deregulation is one “obvious answer” for Oxford and Cambridge, but says that changing the relationship between universities and the state would be hugely problematic.“In political terms, giving these universities what they want is the opposite of what the government needs to do at the moment,” he says. “It needs to show it is supporting poor people, not elite universities.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e38f500b48f513de5b69c42997b7b2e559e4800/0_397_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?w=300\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2bdaf896e8f580bcf9f639922ca22028","title":"everton fans assess sam allardyce abilities manager zero hero","story":"• Respondents asked to mark questions on scale of zero to 10• Manager again barracked in Saturday’s lifeless draw at SwanseaEverton have sent a survey to season-ticket holders and club members asking them to rate Sam Allardyce’s ability to “get the best out of the team” on a scale of zero to 10.The question about the team manager is part of a wide-ranging survey designed to shape the club’s engagement strategy with supporters. A questionnaire has been emailed to members of the fans’ panel seeking opinions on the direction of the club, match-day experience, the team and the senior management at Goodison Park.On Allardyce supporters are asked to rate his performance on the basis of: “I have a high level of trust in the current manager and coaching staff of Everton eg, in making the right decisions to get the best out of the team.” Ratings range from zero – “completely disagree” – to 10 – “completely agree”.The survey also asks fans to rate their trust in Everton players “being loyal and performing at their best” and the club’s leadership in “making the right decisions for the club’s future”. Belief in the direction of the club, whether or not Everton are portrayed fairly by the media and how strongly fans feel connected to the club are additional questions.Everton have endured a dreadful season having embarked on the biggest spending spree in their history last summer and, while the club’s reversal predates Allardyce’s appointment in November, Ronald Koeman’s successor as manager has attracted fierce criticism. Allardyce was again barracked by Evertonians during the 1-1 draw at Swansea City on Saturday and, despite planning for next season and being under contract until 2019, doubt surrounds his position at Goodison.The club sent the same questions to the panel at the end of last season in response to the Premier League reducing the range of questions in their fans’ survey.

Similarly agents are prohibited from having “a material influence” over the affairs of a club.Last summer Wolves confirmed that the club’s owner since July 2016, the Chinese conglomerate Fosun, does own a stake in Mendes’s company, Gestifute. “Fosun have a percentage stake in the Gestifute company headed up by Jorge Mendes,” the club said.Having acquired the stake in Mendes’s agency in January 2016, the Chinese owner “canvassed advice” from Mendes before buying Wolves six months later, the club’s managing director, Laurie Dalrymple, said on Sky TV this week. Since the takeover Mendes has been involved in recruitment as the manager of his longstanding client Nuno Espírito Santo and Portuguese players who have transformed the quality of the Wolves squad.Public disclosures have stated the stake is owned by Shanghai Foyo, a company majority owned by the Fosun chairman, Guo Guangchang. Gestifute and Shanghai Foyo have since January 2016 been involved in a joint agency and marketing venture in Chinese football the launch in Shanghai was attended by Mendes and officials from Benfica and Monaco, where Mendes has been highly influential.The EFL has said it believes the rules have been complied with after Wolves gave undertakings and put “appropriate arrangements in place” following Fosun’s takeover from Steve Morgan in July 2016.Wolves are compiling a further written explanation of Mendes’s position for the EFL, following complaints last month by the Leeds owner, Andrea Radrizzani. He tweeted during Leeds’ 3-0 defeat by Wolves: “Not legal and fair to let one team owned by a fund who has shares in the biggest players’ agency with evident benefits (top European clubs giving players with options to buy) … why the other 23 teams can’t have the same treatment?”Radrizzani followed that with a letter to the FA, EFL and Premier League seeking clarification of Wolves’ relationship with Mendes. He told the BBC that when he was preparing to buy Leeds last year, he sold his shares in an agency, on advice from his lawyer: “I did because obviously there is a conflict of interest and I always pay attention to staying within the rules.”Dalrymple confirmed this week that Mendes “has advised us on players we have taken but equally he has advised us on players we have not continued to take” and that: “There are some players that are connected with him who have come in and done a really good job for us.”Despite that acknowledgment, and widespread reporting that the standout signing from Porto, Rúben Neves, and other Portuguese recruits, are Mendes clients, neither Mendes nor Gestifute is declared as any of the players’ agents on the FA’s record of Wolves’ signings published this month.Neves signed for Wolves for £15.8m in the summer his agent, recorded in the FA’s document based on filings by Wolves, was another Portuguese intermediary, Jorge Pires Serralheiro. The same agent acted for other young Portuguese players signed by Wolves who are commonly cited as Mendes clients: Pedro Gonçalves, Rúben Vinagre and Boubacar Hanne. The midfielder Diogo Jota, 21, who has excelled on loan from Atlético Madrid, was represented by a Spanish agent, Carlos Bucero Gómez, according to the FA’s document.Gestifute appears only once as an agent in the signings Wolves are recorded to have made last summer: another Gestifute director, Andy Quinn, an accountant based in Dublin, is stated to have acted for Wolves when Jota was signed.Those signings followed the acquisitions the previous year of other Portuguese players, including Hélder Costa, Ivan Cavaleiro and João Teixeira, who were represented by a lawyer, Carlos Osório de Castro, or an agent, Valdir Cardoso, understood to do work for Gestifute.A Wolves spokesman said neither Serralheiro nor Bucero was associated with Mendes or Gestifute. The club has consistently played down Mendes’s influence. Dalrymple, despite confirming the signing of players “connected” to Mendes, described him again this week as an adviser and close friend to the chairman, Jeff Shi, who “can use him as a sounding board”.Wolves are “still completely comfortable with their position,” Dalrymple said, and will provide the same information to the Premier League as they have given to the EFL and FA.“We don’t believe, and I don’t believe the authorities believe, that we’ve stepped outside the rules,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58482b9cd6ccd094e99c857f6a2a9e11da946a81/0_0_1837_1102/master/1837.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=aedc3394b707d82ec75a4d15c05706c5 1240w","title":"brighton v tottenham hotspur premier league live","story":"A very good point for Brighton, as the fans’ reaction shows.

Ryan catches it, to hearty cheers.90+1 min: We’re in the first of three added minutes, by the way.90 min: Ulloa chases a long ball after some brilliant defensive work from Knockaert, and Lloris sets hearts aflutter by slipping as he comes out for it ... but still has time to correct himself and clear.90 min: One corner leads to a second, which is punched away well by Lloris.88 min: A sight for Lamela, who seizes onto a Dunk error and surges into the box. In the end his shot is a decent height for Ryan, who es in mid-air and catches too, which is always an impressive sight. Something low and crossways might have paid off rather more for Lamela. At the other end Brighton win a corner, as the game finally looks stretched ...86 min: Ulloa lays off a throw-in to Gross, who leans back and goes for a spectacular volley but it soars over and isn’t really as close as the “oooohhhs” suggest. Good effort all the same.85 min: Kane tries for a second goal but it’s well wide. That’s all from him for tonight – he’s not looked near his best but still snaffled a goal. On comes Llorente.83 min: Eriksen dances down the left tramline after some swift distribution from Lloris, and you wonder if he has some magic planned, but in common with his wider evening he seems to run out of ideas and ends up dribbling the ball behind. Lamela, to his right, felt he might have received a pass.82 min: It’s the 82nd minute but Brighton are still launching themselves into everything – to the extent that Kayal and Stephens pretty much tackle each other in midfield.80 min: I suspect this will now be 10 minutes, plus added time, of Spurs probing away – but they’re showing few signs of success thus far.78 min: Aurier beats March immediately but floats a really wasteful cross out of play.77 min: Now a second Brighton change. Izquierdo is off and March will now take that left-sided perch.I shall look out for this.74 min: A sub for the hosts and two for Spurs. Ulloa replaces Murray Lamela and Dembele replace Moura and Sissoko.73 min: A lengthy spell of Spurs possession around the box now, ending in a vicious Eriksen cross-shot from the right that clips an outstretched Duffy’s foot and *somehow* flies wide of the far post with most of the goal unguarded. Duffy is a lucky boy! From the corner, Alderweireld shoots into the side netting.71 min: Brief excitement as Izquierdo, for a split second, seems to have a chance of latching onto an Aurier header back but it transpires that the right-back did well.69 min: Aurier goes on a run, continues it and almost, rather inadvertently, is found by a Son miskick. But Brighton clear the danger.67 min: Knockaert gets on his first real run of the half but has to wait for Murray to get in the box and eventually fires the cross way over his head.65 min: Brighton remain compact, disciplined, quick to the interception and diligent at retaining their shape. That Bong error for the goal apart, they’ve not done a lot wrong and are yet to really get stretched.63 min: Spurs knocking it around to little effect. Will Pochettino opt for a change or two soon, I wonder ...60 min: Lucas half-heartedly shouts for a penalty after Bruno ushers him away from an Eriksen cross but he’s not getting that.59 min: And again Eriksen, not at his best so far, clatters it into the wall. Kayal takes a blow from Davies’ follow-up and takes time to get up – that was a bit of a whack to the ribs.57 min: Kane wins a handball from Kayal, seemingly more by appealing for it than anything else, although the midfielder did slide into it with his arms out. It’s a free-kick 25 yards out ...56 min: It’s Moura, though, who shoots a little wastefully wide of the near post after finding himself in space on the left – his new position as of half-time.55 min: Brighton’s tails have been up since the penalty. Unsurprisingly so you wouldn’t have fancied them without a smart response but now it’s wide open again ...53 min: “Like I said, starting Kane was a gutsy and brilliant call by Poch. What a soldier!” laughs Evan Crocker. Other correspondents are noting archly that Bruno, who got the final touch to Kane’s goalbound shot, may insist on claiming that as an own goal.51 min: Phew! I didn’t get a great glimpse of the foul on Izquierdo, who danced in from the left pretty much straight after the restart – 18 seconds in fact – but the consensus is it was fairly clear.Not the best pen but who cares – Gross goes low to the right of Lloris, who gets a hand to it but can’t keep out. Brighton’s celebrations show just how important a quick response was there. What a start to the half!Aurier fouls Izquierdo and parity is close!Maybe he was onto something with that golden boot thing! It’s awful defending from Brighton, Bong turning into trouble just outside his own area and being dispossessed by Wanyama. Son takes possession, wriggles along the byline, outfoxes a limp Dunk challenge, cuts back to Kane and he blasts it in via a defender! But then ...Spurs get us going.OK, we’re nearly ready for the second half ... will Spurs sharpen up?Fairly watchable but not the best if we’re honest, despite that late excitement. Spurs look a bit off-key Brighton have defended excellently on the whole and have had a couple of threatening periods, led by Knockaert in particular, without really looking like scoring. I’m sure this one will open up – stick with us! Send your emails!45+4 min: From the half’s last action, the half’s best chance – and it’s a super save from Ryan, who gets a firm hand on a whipped 12-yard effort from Son, who’d been set up by Kane. Brighton weren’t happy at the amount of time added on there, but can at least reflect that their goalkeeper has made an outstanding stop there. It was heading for the corner.45+3 min: Oh dear. Eriksen makes to shoot but taps to Kane, who slips as he runs up and dribbles an easy shot straight at Ryan. What’s with all this slipping, eh ...45+1 min: A slack Knockaert pass presents Kane with the ball 20 yards out. Kane, who looks short of his best today, can’t get away and make the chance but is fouled by – I think – Stephens in another Eriksen-favouring position. This would be a blow for Brighton after such a lot of hard work ...43 min: The veteran Bruno, recalled today, wins a one-on-one with Son thanks to an excellently-timed tackle. Brighton are snappy and switched-on all over the pitch.41 min: And Son again goes for the line, again finding three defenders quickly around him. He reverts to Davies but the left-back’s cross is dealt with.39 min: Davies almost contrives a chance for Son but the Korean, and then Kane, and then Eriksen, are all squeezed out by diligent defending. Spurs aren’t at their slickest.37 min: It’s an almost-good game, this, Brighton playing well and Spurs looking a bit like a team with six changes. There are bits and pieces going on but not too many big chances yet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e65f676da3c33daa5ea13a5503b6c2cccf5bc364/0_547_3617_2170/master/3617.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=d52132ac0838201978989a0f677b89cb 1240w","title":"held back from promotion too honest","story":"Have you got a work-related problem?

On Monday the Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz told Hannity: “I want to say that I really think that you should have disclosed your relationship with Cohen when you talked about him on this show.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b77269941a9e027b36dbb7a3de45604e3ac8dc92/130_1002_4720_2832/master/4720.jpg?w=1300\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=dde7b3773d9a6b558288ecf20be4512a 2600w","title":"netflixs new world order a streaming giant on the brink of global domination","story":"The online entertainment company, which boasts 125 million subscribers, has become so powerful it can even afford to snub Cannes. Are cinephiles – and conventional broadcasters – right to fear for the future?At the Berlin film festival last February, Clare Binns took her seat for the premiere of a Spanish film that was generating a quiet buzz. She hoped it might play at Picturehouse Cinemas, the British chain of cinemas she runs. In the film, La Enfermedad del Domingo (Sunday’s Illness), an abandoned daughter confronts her well-to-do mother in a remote mountain village. The film’s director, Ramón Salazar, has a knack for epic melodrama that has drawn comparisons with the work of Pedro Almodóvar.“It was a fantastic film, and one that is made to be seen in cinema,” says Binns. “But it was only when I was sitting there watching it that I noticed the logo.”Alongside the name of the film’s Spanish production company, there rose the ubiquitous – and increasingly isive – mark of Netflix. The streaming giant, which this week announced it has more than 125 million global subscribers, had financed the film. Binns immediately knew this drastically reduced her chances of getting anywhere near it. “We went straight to the producer to try to work out a way – in Spain, they are doing a theatrical release – but Netflix didn’t want to do anything else,” she adds.Instead, Netflix will add La Enfermedad del Domingo to its dizzying carousel of content in June, where users may enjoy it at home. “I don’t object to Netflix as a business,” says Binns, who is a subscriber herself. “But for a film like that to show just on a platform and not the big screen is just so depressing. It’s a disgrace.”Binns’ feelings echo an epic tussle in the global film and TV industries. Last week, a spat between Netflix and the European cinema establishment erupted a month before the Cannes film festival. The company, which declined to answer questions, only occasionally shows its movies in handfuls of cinemas, partly to make them eligible for awards. Even then, the films are made available for home viewing at the same time, a sacrilege in the world of cinema. Now the industry fears for the future of a business model – and an art form.Last week, Ted Sandaros, the chief content officer at Netflix, breezily announced that Netflix would skip Cannes rather than show films out of competition. The festival had “set the tone”, he told Variety. “We are choosing to be about the future of cinema. If Cannes is choosing to be stuck in the history of cinema, that’s fine.”Cultural chasms have opened along the Croisette before, but this time the old guard is facing a rapidly evolving digital beast that can afford to dismiss the most prestigious festival in the business. Sandaros was so relaxed withdrawing that he found time to needle Frémaux. After the festival chief had also banned selfies on the Cannes red carpet (they “tarnish the quality and tempo of the ascending of the steps”), Sandaros wondered “what other advances in media Frémaux would like to address”.But to what extent is Netflix’s tightening grip on our screens irresistible, and how does the company’s culture – built around its sage-like founder and CEO, Reed Hastings – explain its success? Because, apart from the protectionist cries of cinephiles, Netflix is facing a coming onslaught from new- and old-world rivals. Streaming services, such as Amazon, Hulu and Apple, are investing fast, while – perhaps most significantly – Disney is pulling its own content from Netflix before its planned launch of a rival streaming platform late next year.“He is why I wanted to write the book,” Keating says of Hastings. “I had watched him consistently make call after call that nobody on Wall Street thought were good ideas – and he just knew. He just didn’t care when his share price tanked and I’d never seen a CEO like that.” Keating says the data Netflix has amassed – what its viewers like, how long they watch, when they watch – is “everything”. She adds: “They constantly have a finger on the pulse, and the demand curve that they have observed allows them to project into the future in a way that I don’t know anyone in any other industry can do … I just don’t think anybody knew what effect this model would have on how that content is created.”Gareth Neame has watched that transformation during more than 20 years in British television, having worked at both the BBC and independent production companies. He commissioned series including Spooks, State of Play and Hustle. In terms of funding, he says, “one way or another, a producer usually got to about £1m an hour”.The model shifted again when Netflix and others began bulk-buying content to satisfy its subscribers. Producers had yet another revenue stream and they began financing shows in anticipation of a streaming deal, pushing budgets and quality higher still. This increased Netflix’s subscriptions – and its own spending power once it began making its own shows. (The Crown, made for Netflix by the British production company Left Bank Pictures, has a budget of more than £10m an episode.) The centre of gravity has shifted and, for TV and film-makers, Netflix has become an attractive home.In 2015, BBC Two and BBC America showed the first series of The Last Kingdom, a big-budget drama based on Bernard Cornwell’s Saxon Stories. Neame had made it for the BBC, but Netflix came calling and found the show an enthusiastic global audience. “The first season didn’t break through on BBC America, but it did on Netflix in the US,” Neame says. So Netflix replaced BBC America for the second series, co-producing it with the BBC and Carnival. This month, Carnival announced that the third series of The Last Kingdom will be an exclusive production for Netflix. “Their mission seems to be to back storytellers and let them get on with it,” Neame says.For fledgling film-makers, that support can often be the difference between making a film and not. For years, Adam Randall, a British director, struggled to find funding for iBoy, a sci-fi teen thriller adapted from a 2010 young adult novel. By 2015, he and his producer had raised just $600,000. Then Netflix got hold of the script. “We got on the phone in early 2016 and an hour later they were on board,” Randall says. “They raised the budget to roughly $1.5m.”iBoy, released on Netflix in January last year, was the first British Netflix Original film. Had he made it without Netflix, with half the budget, Randall thinks the film, a London-set genre piece for teens, might have struggled to win the interest of distributors or festivals. “To get to a young audience with Netflix was perfect and it has been seen by a much wider international audience than I could ever have hoped for,” he says.Disney’s streaming service, for which it is making Star Wars TV shows, appears to set the studio against Netflix in an epic battle for eyeballs, not least after its planned acquisition of 21st Century Fox. But not every industry observer sees it that way. “The reality is that Amazon, Hulu and even Apple are already further along than Disney,” says Rich Greenfield, a Silicon Valley analyst at San Francisco trading firm BTIG. “I think it’s a highly entrepreneurial culture that’s about a willingness to sacrifice near-term profits to win long-term.” Legacy media companies have neither the stomach nor culture to truly take on that fight, Greenfield believes.Nor do they have Netflix’s data, which will require a big additional investment in old-school marketing for Disney and others. And Netflix is big in that game, too. In January, the company said it would increase its marketing budget to $2bn. This month, it was reported that Netflix is bidding more than $300m for a billboard company in the heart of Hollywood. The reported move, which neither party commented on, appeared to reflect Netflix’s rampant growth strategy – but also the devil-may-care attitude that was evident in Cannes.“If it’s true, it would seem to confirm the idea in Hollywood that Netflix is taking over the world,” Keating says of the billboard ploy. The company’s culture has been an object of speculation for years, fuelled in part by its publication, in 2009, of a “freedom and responsibility” slide show for would-be employees (in January, the company had 5,500 employees globally). Last year, it updated and shortened the document, setting itself apart from the Silicon Valley archetype of free lunches and ping-pong tables with a tougher, more grownup atmosphere. Managers frequently judge teams against a “keeper test” if Jim, say, were planning to leave, would you fight to keep him? If not, employees are “promptly and respectfully given a generous severance package”. “They describe themselves as being like a pro sports team,” Keating adds.Several former Netflix employees declined to contribute to this article. But where will Netflix’s win-at-all-costs mentality take it – and audiences? Hastings himself has committed only to doing more of the same, but many watchers see an eventual route into live TV, news and sports broadcasting as streaming services continue to grind down old broadcasters and channels. Netflix and other streaming services will become TV as we know it. “I also think we’ll see more experimentation with virtual reality and user-generated plot twists,” Keating says, pointing out the advantages a tech-first company would have in doing so.In the meantime, Netflix has work to do if it wants to make friends in the industries it is shaking up. The company’s logo may not be featuring at Cannes next month, but its executives will be there, buying yet more content. “I think everyone is frightened about the new world order,” says Binns at Picturehouse Cinemas, who will also be at the festival. “I just hope people start to recognise that we need to be talking to each other and working out a way of making sure we’re not killing the cinema.”"},{"url":null,"title":"kendrick lamar has brought pop to pulitzer","story":"By becoming the first non-classical or jazz winner of the Pulitzer prize for music, the rapper has created US history – appropriate, given his unwavering gaze at American lifePerhaps the most obvious question provoked by the news that Kendrick Lamar has been awarded the Pulitzer prize for music for his 2017 album Damn is not “why?” but rather “what took you so long?”It has been 60 years since the birth of modern pop music, a period of time during which said modern pop music has established itself, in its multifarious configurations, as being an unquestionably important art form. Clearly no one expected an august institution like the Pulitzer to start handing out gongs to the Backstreet Boys or Mötley Crüe, but the notion that not a single work by any American pop artist over the last seven decades has been thought worthy is mind-boggling. They gave an “additional citation” to Bob Dylan in 2008, and to Hank Williams in 2010 – a mere 57 years after the latter’s death – but the prize itself has remained almost exclusively the domain of classical music. In its history, there have only been three jazz winners: Wynton Marsalis in 1997, Ornette Coleman in 2006, and Henry Threadgill in 2016.Then again, the Pulitzer has a longstanding reputation for being quite extraordinarily stuffy. The most celebrated example of its snobbery may have come in 1965, when the jury decided that no current music was worthy of an award, and attempted instead to give a special citation to Duke Ellington, in recognition of the groundbreaking body of work he had amassed over the preceding 50 years. Not, one would have imagined, a particularly controversial decision: by 1965, Ellington was rightly regarded as a straight-up, no-further-questions genius who had elevated jazz to an orchestral art form worthy of comparison with more “respectable” musical genres decades before. But the Pulitzer board refused to give out the award. Indeed, it wasn’t until 1996 that an African American, George Walker, won the prize itself. In 2004, then Pulitzer administrator Sig Gissler said they would be “broadening the prize a bit” so it could be awarded to music not from the European classical tradition it no longer became obligatory for entrants to submit a score. Even so, there was no mention of pop music in their idea of what constituted “distinguished American musical compositions”. The official announcement of the new policy involved everything but: “The contemporary classical symphony to jazz, opera, choral, musical theatre, movie scores and other forms of musical excellence.”This clearly makes Kendrick Lamar’s achievement all the more striking in its break with the prize’s dusty traditions. This year’s award hasn’t gone to some rarefied piece of electronica with classical pretensions, but to a double platinum-selling hip-hop album by an artist who packs out arena venues. Still, if you were going to pick a contemporary pop artist to storm the Pulitzer’s barricades, Lamar is an obvious choice.They’ve chosen someone both at the top of his game and at the forefront of a post-Ferguson renaissance in righteously angry, politically engaged black music that genuinely bears comparison to soul music’s revered early 1970s golden era. Furthermore, he’s proved that it is possible to make a huge mainstream impact with music that never panders to the lowest common denominator and never underestimates its audience’s intelligence. It is frequently complex, knotty, contradictory, claustrophobic and disjointed it regularly nods towards black music’s history – referencing everything from the lusciously soft soul of the Chi-Lites to Outkast’s psychedelic take on rap – but never feels comfortingly familiar. Perhaps the commercial success of such ostensibly uncommercial material is down to the fact Lamar makes music that perfectly reflects its era. He may have claimed that Damn represented a step back from the sociopolitical fury of its predecessor To Pimp a Butterfly, an album that ended up being lauded by the outgoing president of the United States – it even contained a backwards message complaining of “the pain in my heart carrying the burden for the struggle” – but Damn never shies away from addressing serious issues: black empowerment, protest, the Trump presidency, violence, inflammatory right-wing punditry. Anxious, scattered and disquieting, the musical backing sounds like living through 2017 frequently felt. You could argue long into the night about whether or not the approval of an institution like the Pulitzer prize is antithetical to the messages contained in Damn, but an award that’s frequently courted accusations of rarefied, snooty irrelevance could hardly have picked a more relevant and impactful album to give its approval to.• This article was amended on Tuesday 17 April, to add Wynton Marsalis and Henry Threadgill to the list of jazz winners of the Pulitzer prize for music."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b366e2e9b3442cd6953687c11d976405cb01fbb5/78_7_1046_628/master/1046.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=e2f44b0da0a3c0e433741525396a2983 1240w","title":"snail ballet dancers slow pixel elizabeth saint jalmes cyril leclerc","story":"Raised to be sauteed in garlic butter but freed by French vegetarian art anarchists, meet the unlikely stars of a mindful music performance Only minutes after meeting Elizabeth Saint-Jalmes and Cyril Leclerc at their Paris apartment, I’m invited into their darkened boudoir. Several snails are crawling on the floor next to the bed. Each has a little light-emitting diode attached to its shell that activates sensors on a nearby speaker designed by Elizabeth that is pumping out soothingly drone-like music composed by Cyril.What I’m witnessing is a teaser for a six-hour, 176-snail ballet called Slow Pixel that the two artists are bringing to London later this month for its UK premiere as part of Cryptic’s Sonica festival. For only £4.50, you can watch illuminated snails crawl around a darkened room to challenging music. Don’t tell me you’re not tempted.“These snails were raised to be eaten,” Elizabeth whispers. It’s striking how all three of us change our behaviour in this chambre des escargots – we speak more quietly, walk gingerly around the room (none of us want to hear the crunch of calcium carbonate shell) and find ourselves kneeling to get a closer view. We, as much as the snails, are performers in this ballet.Can you assure me, I whisper, that no gastropods were harmed in the making of this artwork? “Absolutely,” replies Elizabeth, thoughtfully placing one on my notebook, the better to illuminate my shorthand.She tells me that these eight snails, and the hundreds more she and Cyril keep in the cellar, are from the gastronomically prized species gros-gris (fat greys). “We are vegetarians and in a sense we have freed them from their destiny.” That destiny, most likely, was to be sauteed in garlic butter.Cyril produces a plant mister and sprays the snails with water. “They like humidity and showering them helps simulate that,” he says. Don’t the snails get stressed with diodes strapped to their shells? “Snails don’t get stressed,” he says. “Their heart rate is always 35 beats per minute. You know when they’re upset, though. They retreat into their shells.”Cyril, 43, and Elizabeth, 40, have been using snails in their art for eight years. Their first gastropod-based interventions involved feeding snails paper of different colours. Cyril recalls: “We would feed them red paper and they would shit red patterns. And if we fed them yellow and blue paper, what colour do you think they would shit?” Green? “Exactly.”The French couple’s art has an appealingly daffy, anti-commercial tenor. To clinch the point, Elizabeth takes a hunting horn from its case and blows a few notes so loud as to give any urban foxes in the 20th arrondissement the willies. Not to be outdone, Cyril starts strumming his tampura, an Indian stringed instrument often used to create droning, meditative effects. As I sit on the sofa drinking Japanese tea and snacking on cheese and nuts while they blow and strum, I wonder what the neighbours think.“We’re very much influenced by Fluxus,” says Elizabeth. That group of 60s artists, musicians, performers and even chefs often created art happenings involving chance, factors that provoked interactions between artist and audience. Elizabeth and Cyril’s work is neo-Fluxus, combining music, choreography and drawing, plus free-roaming snails.They hope to seduce visitors into a new relation with space and time. In a world where, as Parisian philosopher Paul Virilio has argued, technological change destroys space and compresses time, what a beguiling existential corrective it is to slow to a snail’s pace for a few hours. “Remember when you were a kid and you could sit and look at an insect for hours? Or watch a snail crawl across a path?” asks Elizabeth. Cyril hopes it will give visitors a Proustian rush, provoking bittersweet meditation on impermanence and lost time.During the performance, Elizabeth and Cyril place the light-bearing snails on the walls, creating effects that simulate the night sky or city lights. While the snails crawl up and down, the artists project video footage behind them shot from the window of the Trans-Siberian Express – as if to emphasise the difference between the human and gastropod pace of life. “What we both found amazing was how on the train, which actually only goes at about 80kmh, you can do nothing but eat, sleep and read – so your mind and body are in a different temporal relation to the world,” says Elizabeth. “That inspired much of what we’re thinking about with Slow Pixel.”Do many visitors stay for six hours? “It varies – some stay for just a few minutes,” says Elizabeth. “We insist only on one thing – people leave their phones outside.” They’ve both noticed how some visitors will try to smuggle their phones into the performance space, furtively taking selfies with snails.“It’s a shame when they do that, because we’re hoping to encourage mindfulness,” says Cyril. “Be in the moment, not always photographing it.” Such mindful art is a growing cultural tendency, embracing things from colouring books, to Rolf Hind’s opera Lost in Thought, to the TV shows that court viewers who want to get a real-time reindeer’s eye view of crossing the Arctic. “These can be immersive experiences for iniduals, liberating them from the everyday world,” says Elizabeth. “Just for a few hours.” Minutes later when I’m strap-hanging on the Métro, hurrying to catch the Eurostar home to meet a deadline, I realise these two French artists are right: us heedless humans have much to learn from the wisdom of snails.

Almost none of the staff there knew anything about political campaigning. A lot of what I said to them and what I presented to them was novel. They had never heard of any of these tactics. They had never participated in politics before, and openly said: ‘I work for an insurance company, so: help.’”Kaiser said she and a Cambridge Analytica colleague gave advice on how to improve the survey methodology. “I was under the impression, by what they told me, that every single inidual that they were pulling up to call was actually a lead or a current customer of Eldon Insurance or Go Skippy.”She added: “They had probably already been doing that around a month or two.”The disclosure raises further questions about comments made by Andy Wigmore, Leave.EU’s former communications director, in which he described how the campaign used insurance actuaries to identify prime locations for political campaigning.Wigmore told the Guardian that no actuaries had been employed by the campaign. Kaiser also told the committee that Banks set up a company called Big Data Dolphins, which she said was working with a data science team at the University of Mississippi, after he ceased negotiations with Cambridge Analytica. Kaiser questioned whether the data of British citizens “was sent abroad, specifically to Mississippi” for processing by Big Data Dolphins.Leave.EU attacked Kaiser’s evidence as “a confused litany of lies and allegations” and said that Eldon Insurance did not share data with anyone. “No data has been sent to Mississippi. The unit is still in the planning stage, it employs no one and is not operational,” the group said.An invoice of the same value was issued to Ukip, and Banks told the Observer that he had made a donation to the party to cover the cost of the bill. However, Ukip said it never paid Cambridge Analytica. It is unclear whether the invoice was ever settled.Kaiser also told the committee she had seen documents in which Nigel Oakes, the co-founder of the SCL Group, and the head of its defence ision, revealed the company’s audience-targeting methodology was for several years “export-controlled by the British government”.“That would mean that the methodology was considered a weapon,” she said. “Weapons-grade communications tactics – which means we had to tell the British government if that was going to be deployed in another country outside the United Kingdom.” She said the designation from the UK government was removed in 2015.Among the documents provided to the committee by Kaiser is a legal opinion drafted in support of a proposal for Ukip to share data with Cambridge Analytica.One of the authors of that opinion, Philip Coppel QC, last month represented Cambridge Analytica in an unsuccessful attempt to prevent the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) from obtaining a warrant to raid the company’s premises.Kaiser’s testimony also threatens to raise further questions for Facebook after she said that far more people than previously understood may have had their data harvested from the site.Lawyers for Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica who was suspended from his position last month, told the committee that he would not appear because he was a subject in an active ICO investigation.The information commissioner said: “We have written to Mr Nix to invite him to be interviewed by our investigators. Our investigation is looking at whether criminal and civil offences have been committed under the Data Protection Act.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ea1f93858b2a86bfbe847e1c24c60a3bdb6743a/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=5697bdbf0a52964c389819d3b58d7ac0 1240w","title":"brexit legislation caught in parliamentary logjam","story":"Almost half the bills needed to pave way for leaving EU have yet to be introduced to parliamentA parliamentary logjam will mean the government is likely to struggle to pass vital legislation paving the way for leaving the EU before the parliamentary vote on the final Brexit deal.Almost half of all the legislation that is needed has yet to be even introduced by ministers.MPs returned to parliament on Monday after the Easter recess – the 123rd day that parliament has sat since the general election – but the government is still to pass a single piece of Brexit legislation. Parliament will only sit for another 80 days before MPs are expected to vote on the final Brexit deal struck between Theresa May and the European Union, scheduled for October.The shadow Brexit minister, Jenny Chapman, said there was now “a real danger” that MPs would be ask to vote on the final Brexit deal without having approved crucial legislation, such as the immigration bill, and would be voting blind.The prime minister has promised the UK parliament will be the first to ratify the deal, before it goes to the EU parliament and the other 27 states, though the timeline may slip.Last June, May said this parliament would be a “busy legislative session.” In total, the government has only passed four bills from last year’s Queen’s speech. By comparison, the 2010 coalition government had passed twice as many laws at this stage of the parliament. The general election delivered a hung parliament, leaving May able to pass bills only with the support of Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist party and dependent on the discipline of Conservative MPs. In December, pro-EU Tory MPs defeated the government to guarantee parliament a meaningful vote on the final deal. The Lords is currently debating the bill and may yet inflict another defeat on the government by passing an amendment to keep the UK in a customs arrangement with the EU. The amendment, sponsored by former Conservative party chair Lord Patten, calls for the government to negotiate an arrangement “which enables the United Kingdom to continue participating in a customs union with the EU”.Several other key pieces of legislation have been delayed, in part because of concerns about the possibility of Conservative rebellions.Chapman said MPs may be expected to vote on the final Brexit deal before they have even had the chance to scrutinise important details such as the government’s immigration plan. “Take back control didn’t mean running away from parliament,” she said. “It’s frankly embarrassing that, more than 10 months since the general election, the government hasn’t passed a single piece of Brexit legislation. Ministers have delayed crucial votes and failed to introduce vital bills.”MPs have not voted on Brexit in more than two months, while crucial votes on the customs bill and trade bill have been delayed for more than two months – and are now not expected until after the local elections next month.Conservative MPs in favour of a soft Brexit, including two of the party’s select committee chairmen and three former ministers, have put their name to amendments that would force the prime minister to put Britain’s membership of a customs union back on the negotiating table. Jeremy Corbyn has said Labour’s policy is to support such an arrangement, raising concerns in No 10 that May could be defeated on a key plank of her Brexit strategy. However, it remains unclear whether the Tory MPs behind the amendment would go as far as pushing for a vote if there was a real possibility of fatally undermining the prime minister. A government spokesperson said: “Brexit is an issue of national importance and clearly it is important that parliament is given the proper opportunity to scrutinise the legislation that will underpin it. “We are making good progress and we are confident that we can pass the necessary legislation in good time. For example, the EU (withdrawal) bill has already moved through the Commons and is now at report stage in the Lords while the nuclear safeguards bill and sanctions and anti-money laundering bill have made good progress through both Houses.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80eed0716406710752fd421e0a3c27eaeeb1f687/32_0_1548_929/master/1548.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=ea1cfd2234556de2ad025c274796aa0b 1240w","title":"may revels as tory mps shout down trigger shy syria sissy corbyn","story":"Parliament agrees with the prime minister that she only needs its approval for a really big warAfter the war-war, the jaw-jaw. Which was precisely what Jeremy Corbyn was so concerned about. Though the Labour leader was deeply grateful to the prime minister for sparing six hours of her time on a ministerial statement and a token debate the previous evening, he would rather the government hadn’t presented the Syrian strikes as a fait accompli to parliament.Not that many MPs seemed to care that much. They were all jaw-jawed out and had got bored with the war-war. It had been standing room only during Monday’s proceedings, but the chamber was less than half full for the emergency debate on whether the government should have consulted parliament before Saturday’s attack.Even so, there were more than enough Tory backbenchers – for whom there is no greater crime than being a trigger-shy sissy – to jeer and shout Corbyn down at every opportunity during his opening speech. It made for slow progress when the Labour leader was allowed to speak, but his case was generally well made. He wasn’t saying there were no circumstances in which the prime minister should act without a parliamentary vote, just that these weren’t them given there had been a clearly established convention since the Iraq war that parliament should be involved.On Monday Theresa May had appeared tentative, as if nervous of what sort of reaction she might get from the Commons. But now she knew she had widespread support throughout the house, she looked demob happy. The picture of someone who is having a good war. Bombing Syria has done wonders for her self-esteem. A welcome respite from dealing with the Brexit nightmare and a Home Office that was busy deporting British citizens. A woman who, for once, felt secure in herself and was determined to enjoy every moment. However brief.The prime minister began by paying lip service to the sovereignty of parliament – no one could doubt her willingness to make herself accountable after the event – but quickly went rogue. Yes, the government was aware there was a convention on consulting parliament, but personally she thought its importance was overrated.She was in charge and she could do what she liked. If she was going to have a big, big war then she might – only might – get round to getting parliamentary approval, but for the odd bombing raid she wasn’t going to go through the hassle of asking permission. The so-called convention was dead to her. And even if it wasn’t, then she had been right not to recall parliament because the whole operation had to be conducted in absolute secrecy.Several MPs intervened to point out that the US president had been busy tweeting his bombing plans well in advance of the strikes and that everyone in the country – apart from the UK parliament – appeared to be having their say on whether Britain should join in. The prime minister shrugged. What everyone was failing to understand was the classified nature of the targets. The decision to take out the Syrian regime’s chemical weapons dumps in reprisals for using chemical weapons had been a sensational double-bluff. Targets so obvious that the Syrians would never believe we would choose them. No one expects the totally expected.Job done, the prime minister tootled off to meet the South African president, leaving her backbenchers to defend her honour. They needed no second invitation. It made for a bizarre spectacle. Hardline Brexiters, who had spent the past few years arguing passionately for the sovereignty of parliament, now saying that maybe they had been a bit hasty and it was totally fine to do a little bit of ad hoc recreational bombing, just so long as you had a Conservative prime minister you could trust. Sycophantic lobby fodder admitting they were far too stupid to be allowed to make their own minds up on such serious matters.A few voices continued to make the case for the convention of parliamentary approval, but the vote was never in doubt. The Commons was happy to bow to Theresa. She had been right all along. Back in No 10, the prime minister was kicking herself. Why the hell hadn’t she bombed someone months ago?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c404e6c36f033ddb0a33f41fdbb676affb13911e/311_77_1281_769/master/1281.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=9c3e3d3cb986a19c49f3e81fd1af32c8 1240w","title":"mps should take back control of military action jeremy corbyn","story":"Despite tabling motion, Jeremy Corbyn whips Labour MPs to vote against in protest over treatment of parliamentParliament must “take back control” of military matters by passing a law requiring the government to seek MPs’ approval before launching military action overseas, Jeremy Corbyn has argued, though Tory MPs won a symbolic vote on a Labour motion.Corbyn whipped Labour MPs to oppose the motion, suggesting parliament had been given the chance to scrutinise the UK missile strikes in response to the chemical weapons attack in Douma, Syria.Introducing a second day of debates afterthe strikes, the Labour leader said Theresa May had shown flagrant disregard for the post-Iraq war convention that parliament should be consulted.May said she fully supported the principle for major action or a ground offensive, but that to debate the most recent attack in advance would have allowed Syria’s military to prepare missile defences or move the chemical weapons infrastructure targeted.The debate took place after the Speaker, John Bercow, allowed a Labour motion saying MPs had “considered parliament’s rights in relation to the approval of military action by British forces overseas”. Labour whips urged the party’s MPs to vote against the motion to indicate they did not believe parliament had been able to fully consider the idea.However, Conservative MPs turned out to back the motion, and it was passed by 317 votes to 256. The parliamentary gymnastics meant Tory MPs were in the unconventional position of voting for a motion that the leader of the opposition proposed, while Corbyn opposed, but meant Labour were denied the symbolism of MPs implicitly criticising the prime minister’s approach to parliamentary approval of airstrikes. Introducing the debate, Corbyn said there had been parliamentary votes in recent years over UK involvement in military action in Libya and Syria, including in 2013 when MPs voted against it.“I’m sorry to say that the prime minister’s decision not to recall parliament, and to engage in further military action in Syria last week, showed a flagrant disregard for this convention,” he said. “It seems the convention established in 2003, and in the cabinet manual, is being tossed aside as simply being inconvenient.”It was “necessary and urgent” for parliament to discuss its rights and responsibilities, and whether there should be a law compelling ministers to seek advance approval, he said. “It’s for this house to take matters into its own hands and back our control, as some might put it.”The Chilcot inquiry into the significant intelligence and political failings before the Iraq war should be “a salutary lesson to all of us on the importance of there being total scrutiny of what goes on, and the government being required to come to the house in advance of major decisions”, Corbyn said.A new law should, as a minimum, let MPs ask ministers in advance of any action that was planned, whether it was necessary and legal, and what it would achieve, he said.“It’s difficult to argue that requiring governments to answer those questions over matters of life and death would be anything other than a positive step.”May responded by saying she too agreed MPs “should be able to debate the deployment of British military forces into combat”.But, she added, that “does not mean it is always appropriate. It therefore cannot and should be not be codified into a parliamentary right to debate every possible overseas mission in advance.“For as the exception makes clear, there are also situations where coming to parliament in advance would undermine the security of our operations or constrain the ability of our armed forces to act quickly and decisively. In these situations it is right for the prime minister to take the decision and then to be held accountable to parliament for it.”On the specifics of Saturday’s strike, Syria had “one of most sophisticated air defence systems in the world”, May said. “To counter such a system it is vital to confuse the enemy as much as possible, and to conceal the timing and targets of the planned attack.”Even to allow questions in advance would have ulged vital information, May said: “All of this would have provided invaluable information that would have put our armed forces at greater risk and greatly increased the likelihood of the regime being able to shoot down our missiles and get their chemical weapons away from our targets.”Corbyn was backed by the Scottish National party’s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, who said parliamentary approval should be needed in all but exceptional circumstances.However, the Tory backbencher Jacob Rees-Mogg argued that while MPs must scrutinise the decision, this could happen retrospectively. “The executive is being held to account today,” he said. “The prime minister has spent six hours yesterday in this house being held to account, and a further hour today.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/290ee002335d943582e276d700a55b18a62358f2/0_0_946_710/master/946.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=f0a890792bf28af627ff748ac6a49d2d 1240w","title":"diamonds in sudan meteorite are remnants of lost planet","story":"Scientists say rock fragments that hit the Earth in 2008 contain evidence of a lost planet that was part of the early solar systemDiamonds found in a meteorite that exploded over the Nubian desert in Sudan a decade ago were formed deep inside a “lost planet” that once circled the sun in the early solar system, scientists say.Microscopic analyses of the meteorite’s tiny diamonds revealed they contain compounds that are produced under intense pressure, suggesting the diamonds formed far beneath the surface of a planet. In this case, the mysterious world was calculated to be somewhere between Mercury and Mars in size.Astronomers have long hypothesised that dozens of fledgling planets, ranging in size from the moon to Mars, formed in the first 10m years of the solar system and were broken apart and repackaged in violent collisions that ultimately created the terrestrial planets that orbit the sun today.If the latest findings are confirmed, the Almahata Sitta meteorite will be the only known remnants of one of these long-lost planets. The material will give scientists a unique window into the cosmic conditions that prevailed in the deep history of the solar system.“Simulations have suggested that the early solar system had tens of these embryonic planets that collided with each other to form the terrestrial planets, but having evidence of one of them? I wasn’t expecting that,” said Farhang Nabiei, who studied pieces of the meteorite at the Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, Switzerland.Philippe Gillet, a senior author on the study, said: “We are doing archaeology, looking into the past, and trying to decipher the story of the solar system.”The Almahata Sitta meteorite was the first to be tracked by telescopes as it sped towards Earth and exploded over the Nubian desert in 2008. The event prompted a recovery effort by the University of Khartoum, which gathered 480 pieces of the meteorite amounting to 4kg of battered material.Early inspections of the meteorite revealed it to be a ureilite, an unusual composition that does not match other space rocks known to have come from the moon or Mars. The finding led some scientists to speculate that it may have had a more exotic origin.That suspicion grew when researchers noticed little diamonds in the meteorite material. While other meteorites are known to contain diamond crystals, they are generally far smaller. Typical meteorite diamonds are only a few millionths of a millimetre across and are thought to form in collisions with other space rocks that send brief but intense shockwaves through the carbon-rich asteroids.Writing in the journal Nature Communications, the Swiss team now describe fresh analyses that show that diamonds in the meteorite contain specks of an iron-sulphur compound that is thought only to form at pressures greater than 20 gigapascals. They conclude that the diamonds formed with the specks inside them, deep beneath the surface of an unknown world.“We are probably looking at an object that was one of the first planets to circle the sun before they collided with each other to create the actual planets we have today,” said Gillet. James Wittke, who runs the meteorite laboratory at Northern Arizona University, said the scientists’ conclusions were reasonable. “We think that there were probably many larger ‘parent’ bodies in the early solar system, which have since been destroyed, so a since-destroyed body the size of Mercury is reasonable,” he said. “One as large as Mars seems a little surprising, but this paper presents the best, and perhaps only, type of evidence for determining the sizes of these parent bodies.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/645ed6c4f688cd4feb2a0ded2c25df801e77c654/0_43_960_576/master/960.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=e968abf9ae272ecfa696c766d08f5a6e 1240w","title":"cornish pirates stadium council funding","story":"A new stadium for Cornish Pirates rugby club is a significant step closer to being constructed after Cornwall council agreed to pay £3m towards the £14.3m project.Another £3m still needs to be raised, with pressure being put on the government to honour a commitment made by David Cameron, when he was prime minister, to make up any shortfall.Planning permission has already been granted for the 6,000-capacity, multi-sport Stadium for Cornwall complex in Threemilestone near Truro, which will be used by Cornish Pirates, Truro City FC and Truro and Penwith college. The site will house a health club and have conference facilities. The aim is to have it built before the start of the 2019-20 rugby and football seasons.Tuesday’s vote on funding was not overwhelming – 69-41 with eight abstentions – reflecting an issue that has ided opinion in the county. Those who opposed the plan questioned not only the significant investment of public money but whether the stadium would prove a drain on resources. “I am relieved and elated,” said Paul Durkin, the chairman of Cornish Pirates. “It has been a long haul but we got our message across that this was a stadium for Cornwall, not just the partners. Councillors have voted to make life better for the next generation and give them opportunities some people have not had so far.”The council was approached at the start of the year after the partners found themselves £6m short of the money needed to finance the stadium. A local MP, Derek Thomas, is meeting government officials on Wednesday to persuade them to honour Cameron’s promise. “We met with secretaries of state and ministers after David Cameron’s commitment, but we did not have a firm proposal then,” said Thomas. “We do now and I have been doing a lot of to-ing and fro-ing between MPs and various groups in relation to this. The council’s decision makes it much easier for us to make the case for government funding to make up the shortfall.”Bristol’s plan to rebrand the club to mark their return to the Premiership, meanwhile, led to them being them mocked on social media. As part of a bid to attract a global audience the team will be known as Bristol Bears. But fans who clicked on the Bristol Bears website after hearing the news were directed to a page run by a gay club in the city, the Bristol Bear, based in Old Market.“It’s hilarious,” said one member. “I have been checking out the rugby website and I am sure the players will be welcomed in Old Market.” Bristol said they were aware of the Bristol Bear club before the rebranding and anticipated a happy co-existence."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7aec6ad21bde100b45bf8149dafcab2ca5106432/0_164_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=14be4c2a7c178b598383e900595c61fa 1240w","title":"mo farah london marathon","story":"Mo Farah believes he can compete with the very best during Sunday’s London Marathon despite failing to deliver during his first attempt at 26.2\u0026nbspmiles in 2014.The 35-year-old dramatically hit the wall in London four years ago, gritting his teeth as early as the 17-mile marker before finishing eighth in a modest 2hr 8min 21sec.This time, however, Farah intends to stay with a stellar field, even if they start at world record pace, and says he is targeting Steve Jones’s 33-year-old British record of 2:07:13, as well as Sondre Nordstad Moen’s European best of 2:05:48.“This is the biggest race,” said Farah. “And there is only one way to run it – mixing with the guys and seeing what I can do. But it’s an amazing field. It’s got Eliud Kipchoge, who has run two hours, Kenenisa Bekele, who has run 2:03 and Daniel Wanjuri, who won last year.”Farah, who has spent the past three months in Ethiopia, says he feels revitalised and relaxed under his new coach, Gary Lough, and, surprisingly, believes he has the ability to run 2:03 – not far off the world record of 2:02:57 – once he has adapted to the uniquely punishing demands of the marathon.“I think I am capable of running 2:04 or 2:03 in the right race with the right pace,” he added. “But Sunday’s race is going to be different. There are many, many guys who are there to fight, so it’s going to be a difficult race.”When asked whether he would be prepared to go at world record pace on Sunday, despite the high temperatures forecast, he nodded. “If that is what the guys are doing, why not?”Certainly Farah appeared more relaxed than last year where barely a press conference went by without him having to fend off questions about his former coach Alberto Salazar, who is still under investigation by the US Anti-Doping Agency.Farah still faced them – insisting that he had not spoken directly to Salazar about running London or to the Nike Oregon Project coach David McHenry since last October – but no longer did he appear burdened by the association or the pressure of having to deliver gold medals over 5,000m and 10,000m.“On the track people expect you to win but now there are a lot of guys who can run a lot faster than me,” he said. “It’s a good feeling. I have found a new challenge and this is something I always wanted to do.”Farah explained that much of his confidence came from working with Lough, who had focused on his weaknesses and freshened up his training by running intervals with shorter rest periods. “There are things he has given me that I have not done before, so I am getting better at getting stronger,” said Farah. “Gary is a genius and I believe in him.”Organisers say they are monitoring the weather forecast – temperatures are projected to be 21C on Sunday – with the race director, Hugh Brasher, warning amateur runners they need to “listen to their body” and “change their plan” because of the heat.It is understood that extra water will be provided and over 1,000 medical staff will be on hand. But Farah insists he is not worried about running in the heat, despite seeing his fellow British athlete Callum Hawkins collapse during the final stages of the Commonwealth Games marathon.“I was obviously devastated seeing that,” said Farah. “Callum is a great fighter – he will go as hard as he can, and try and break the guys. But Sunday will be completely different. Hugh has told us there will be enough staff and doctors on hand.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a44832c9bb02966cede6fe65b4ec1e0db8271ded/0_811_3750_2250/master/3750.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=32606c086fcf03f1db5962db4c6ccee1 1240w","title":"selling twitter handles big business identity","story":"The perfect @ identity is a must-have accessory for big companies and brand-conscious celebrities – at any costEverything has a price, even the top Twitter handles, and if somebody does not want to sell then they may be forced to relinquish their account.“We have a marketplace which allows the sale of Twitter handles,” says Philly, a subversive marketer who founded ForumKorner, an online gaming forum. “Unlike some websites, however, we do not allow the sales of stolen accounts that some people phish, or hack, to obtain before reselling them.”It’s the same across the whole of social media. Last month a teenage boy was given a £5,000 cruise in exchange for his Snapchat username while accounts on Instagram are sold openly on online marketplaces. Shady brokers stalk the web searching for the most potentially lucrative handles, convincing their owners to part with them before reselling at a significantly higher price.“It’s funny some people don’t know the true value of a handle,” says another trader on condition of anonymity. “For example, I used to look for three-letter acronyms. The handle would generally go for around $30 but little do they know people look for specific @’s correlating with their business. I’ve flipped $20-$40 to $700 on multiple occasions.”Elsewhere, people allege their accounts have been phished, and their handles stolen and sold, yet Twitter has apparently not implemented robust systems to prevent the practice.“Twitter has yet to go after the hackers or phishers, let alone the legitimate account sellers, like myself,” says Philly. “Phishing an account is as easy as downloading an infected program, ticking a couple options and hitting run.”“They used social engineering strategies with multiple other services and sites (like Amazon),” says Josh Bryant, a designer at a digital product firm, who documented how he almost lost his handle in a blog post.“The why is just money. I own both @jb on Twitter and Instagram and there’s a huge economy for desirable usernames right now. If a hacker can get them, list and sell them before the site responds they stand to make a pretty healthy profit.”Another user claims their username was taken by Twitter itself. “A broker kept approaching me, and when I declined his final offer, a formal complaint was made to Twitter, by whom I don’t know, and the handle was handed over to JPMorgan,” says Chase Giunta, a software developer who previously owned the handle @Chase.“I always assumed JP Morgan would want it since they’re the largest bank in the US, but I also assumed they, or maybe even Twitter, would contact me directly to set up some kind of exchange – not some shady broker.”Twitter, however, does not permit the trading of usernames. It explicitly states: “Attempts to sell, buy, or solicit other forms of payment in exchange for usernames are also violations and may result in permanent account suspension.” This does not seem to have stopped them changing hands, though.“After his last offer, I received action from Twitter,” says Giunta. “The steps they took to take my account down were incredibly unsettling. They sent me automated emails claiming I was impersonating Chase Bank, which I wasn’t, before they took the username from me.”“Of course, in hindsight, I would’ve accepted his last $20,000 offer. But I thought I was doing the ‘right thing’ by turning it down at that time.”This sentiment was echoed by Patrick de Laive, the founder of The Next Web, who was offered $20,000 for @patrick by an athlete.Accounts may be permanently removed due to prolonged inactivity to prevent handle squatting. In the early days of the social media giant, this meant people could contact the administrator and request inactive handles.A former Twitter employee told the Guardian how they could request unused usernames for themselves and family. Others have since demonstrated the relative ease in which enterprising people can secure their desired handle.“I got my first name as my Twitter handle after a six-month campaign that included some light Internet stalking, badgering staff at Twitter, $250 and a visit to the patent office,” says Haje Jan, a director at Bold, a venture capitalist company, whose first name was taken by an inactive user.“I registered a web domain for my first name to strengthen my case (in case the trademark people decided to look any deeper), then forked over my £170 to the Intellectual Property Office, registering Haje™ as a trademark.”“Armed with the trademark I contacted Twitter’s support team and about a week later, I received an email saying that I could either create a new account or move the username to an existing account. Mission accomplished – and it turned out to be easier than I anticipated.”It’s not just iniduals who have bought up desirable usernames. The state of Israel bought the @israel handle for reported six-figure sum in 2010, while CNN employed the owner of @cnnbrk as a consultant in exchange for transferring them the account.“Twitter has always been very clear that it’s against their terms and conditions to sell usernames but that hasn’t stopped people trying,” says Sue Llewellyn, who trains journalists to use social media. “They also frown upon people squatting on usernames – ie creating an account and not using it.”“Frankly I think if a big name celebrity wanted a specific name that wasn’t being used then they could probably get it.”"},{"url":null,"title":"virtual reality by the guardian","story":"Experience a whole new world of Guardian journalism in two simple steps.  1.

So, take a seat in the mighty arena alongside 12,000 spectators (togas optional)The first gladiator is down, flailing his gladius towards the emperor before being pummelled by a giant hammer (thankfully, into a furrow of sand left by one of the racing chariots). Two “slaves” rush on and drag his body off towards the spoliarium. Suddenly, everyone is up out of their seats: the retiarius (net man) has dropped his trident and the mirmillones (fish men) are closing in.Nîmes’ Les Grands Jeux Romains (Great Roman Games) is one of the biggest re-enactment spectaculars in Europe. Sitting among 12,000 handkerchief-waving spectators in the city’s first-century Roman amphitheatre last year, I realised it makes for a mesmerising and charmingly-brutal event. Having already featured Hannibal (2015), Cleopatra (2016) and, last year, Boudicca, this year’s games, which take place from 28-30 April, is devoted to Spartacus.“The first Great Roman Games was held in Nîmes in 2010 with little publicity,” says Valérie Espin, in charge of the games’ organisation company, Culturespaces. “The idea was just to have some chariots parading around the arena and people dressed up as Romans. But it has captured the public’s imagination and now there is a cast of 500 performing in front of 32,000 spectators over three days.”In the corner of Espin’s office is a giant scutum (curved Roman shield) and on top of her filing cabinet, a pair of gladiator helmets. “Participants take it very seriously,” she says. “Most of the re-enactors meet weekly, dress up as Romans and spend the weekend on camps, training for battles, preparing Roman food, testing equipment and living as Romans.”This year there are 28 different Roman associations taking part: 11 from France, 16 from Italy, one from Croatia and, for the first time, a group from Britain, Legio Secunda Augusta.“Seven of us are going to Nîmes from our gladiator group based in Portsmouth,” says dental nurse and weekend gladiatrix, Alisa Vanlint. “All the names we use are authentic the Second Augustus Legion was based in Britain for a while.”It’s also the first time female gladiators will fight at the games. “I am Achillia and will be fighting Amazonia – the names come from a marble relief in the British Museum.”Vanlint teaches stage combat and also re-enacts medieval and “1805” battles but her favourite is Roman. “I love sharing an amazing piece of history.” She will appear in the oval arena straight after the horse chases and then as a slave in Spartacus’s army in the second part of the show. Other members of Legio Secunda Augusta are soldiers and civilians.“The helmets are heavy but once you’re fighting, the adrenalin kicks in and the longer you wear it the easier it becomes. I don’t notice it after a while, it’s the same with cuts and bruises,” says Vanlint.Outside the arena, the city’s street’s will also be hectic with Roman revelry. There’s a Roman market selling asses’ milk cosmetics, oil, grapejuice and honey followed by a night-time parade with flaming torches. A Roman galley is on the esplanade and local restaurants will serve Roman-style food, while children solve clues in a treasure-hunt-enigma game.Restoration of the arena will continue for another 12 years. “Repairs of the terraces have given us another 130 seats this year,” says Espin. “Many of the local buildings contain stones looted from the amphitheatre and replacements come from the same Nîmes quarries as they did in Roman times.Besides the arcaded amphitheatre, Nîmes also has the Maison Carrée temple and the Tour Magne. All three can be visited on a combined ticket (€13 adult, €11 child, family ticket €40). Nîmes’ will also see its spectacular new Musée de la Romanité open on 2 June, with 3,500 square metres of multimedia exhibition space dedicated to Roman mosaics, sculptures and everyday objects. Its first exhibition, Gladiators: Heroes of the Colosseum, runs until 24 September 2018.There are also the ruins of the Temple of Diana, as well as two Roman city gates and the Castellum that collected water carried in from Uzès across the Pont du Gard viaduct.• Adult from €15, child from €5, Les Grands Jeux Romains, 28-30 April, arenes-nimes.com"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b59221629a955ac31157ebfca07459a99a98b0dc/0_125_1532_1260/master/1532.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=414e0a55a9d5b21139f2360261fedcf9 1240w","title":"aubrey plaza legion interview weird exhausting not being human","story":"How do you play a gender-fluid psychotic figment of a mutant’s imagination? The star of the superhero psychodrama reveals all – and explains why her friends can’t watch itAubrey Plaza finds it hard to describe her character in the TV superhero drama Legion. Is she alive or dead? Good or evil? Human or mutant? Real or a figment of the lead character, mutant David Haller’s imagination? “That’s a really, really good question,” says Plaza, before saying that Lenny Busker began as a human woman, then became trapped in a dimension of Haller’s mind, and has now been stranded by the evil Shadow King on the “astral plane”. It’s “a total mindfuck”, says Plaza. “It’s mentally and physically exhausting to not exist as a human. At the end of the day I would just feel like nothing, just this rag doll that’s been thrown around.”Legion’s strangeness might be stifling, but the 33-year-old has long specialised in disconcerting kooks. She is best known for playing April Ludgate in Parks and Recreation, a sardonic and contrarian member of the low-level local government department who spends her days spouting morbid soundbites and making people feel uncomfortable. It was a part written especially for her after a casting director told the show’s co-creator Michael Schur that she had met “the weirdest girl” and he should work her into the sitcom.Soon, it would become obvious to everyone that Plaza’s strangeness wasn’t confined to the screen. In 2013, for reasons she would later refuse to explain, she stormed the stage at the MTV Movie awards and attempted to wrestle Will Ferrell’s award from his hands. On YouTube, people began making compilations of her eye-wateringly awkward chatshow appearances, characterised by eerily deadpan jokes and a thousand-yard stare. Plaza’s oddball shtick has been convincing enough to earn her some high-profile gigs: over the past decade she’s brought her singular sensibility to a swath of comedies, from Judd Apatow’s Funny People to the frankly alarming Robert De Niro vehicle Dirty Grandpa. Last year, however, Plaza took her eccentric persona to new dramatic heights in the comedy-drama Ingrid Goes West, which she also produced. As Ingrid, a lost and lonely young woman who obsesses over and eventually infiltrates the life of an Instagram influencer, Plaza was both peculiarly amusing and hauntingly sad.Ingrid Goes West is a brilliant distillation of the compulsion and deceit hardwired into platforms like Instagram for Plaza, it was a message that really hit home. “In Ingrid, you have someone who already has enough trouble having normal healthy relationships, then you give them a device that lets them play out their most toxic impulses,” she says over the phone from her home in Los Angeles. “And I think on a smaller scale that’s what’s happening with everyone on social media.”Plaza briefly deleted her Twitter account in 2016, signing off with the message: “Dear Twitter it’s been fun but I’ve realized you are wrong for me and maybe the world.” She explains that she has “such a hard time” with social media. “Most of the time it just makes me feel bad. I know the feeling of being scared not to engage with social media because you feel like ‘I’m going to lose these connections and lose this awareness of myself’, but it’s all bullshit. I haven’t been on Facebook in over 10 years. It’s changed nothing in my life, I don’t think about it at all.”Though it’s adapted from a Marvel comic, Legion, which returns for its second series this week, certainly isn’t your average superhero fare. With Fargo showrunner Noah Hawley at the helm, it’s set in a retro-futurist 1960s universe, and spends less time on deafening fight scenes and more on goofy dance routines. Another thing that differentiates Legion from the rest of the Marvel universe is its depiction of mental illness. Haller, played by Downton Abbey’s Dan Stevens, and Plaza’s character Busker originally meet in Clockworks psychiatric hospital, where the former has received a schizophrenia diagnosis as a result of the “voices” he is able to hear. Once Haller is rescued, however, he is told that those voices are not symptoms but telepathic powers. In a world where television shows from Mr Robot to Crazy Ex-Girlfriend are tackling mental health with increasing sensitivity, Legion’s equation of mental illness and superheroism has ided critics, with some praising Legion’s detailed depiction of the condition, and others criticising the show for using schizophrenia as a flimsy way to court thrills. Busker begins (and, in some senses, ends) her life in a psychiatric ward, so I’m interested to hear Plaza’s take on the issue. Yet while she acknowledges her character had “addiction problems”, Plaza sounds unclear about Lenny’s precise ailment, claiming “it wasn’t something that was ever labelled”. For that reason, she says, she didn’t do much research into the subject of mental illness in preparation for the role. Instead, she stresses the way the show mines horror from the disorientating nature of mental distress. “What is real, what is not real – it’s the overall question,” says Plaza. “Going mad is one of the scariest ideas for me. To not trust your own mind is a really frightening idea.”Legion is indeed frightening. A sense of nameless horror pervades every scene, as the grotesque monsters that plague Haller’s memories shift in and out of focus (“I have some friends who can’t watch it because they’re so disturbed by it,” says Plaza). Lenny was initially written to be played by a middle-aged man, with Plaza insisting all the original dialogue remained intact, meaning Lenny ends up both crass and subtly androgynous.It’s something that becomes especially apparent when Lenny is viewed in the context of the show’s other major female character Syd, a wide-eyed, girlish mutant who begins a romantic relationship with Haller. I ask Plaza how it feels to play a character whose gender seems so ambiguous. “I love it,” she says. “There’s a fluidity to Lenny and I just think it’s more interesting playing a character that’s not so identifiable. It’s really fun to decide how someone like that moves and looks - it’s allowed me to do whatever I want.” Sporting a curly bob and a selection of suits and dungarees, Plaza spends most of Legion physically unrecognisable - swaggering and manspreading, as well as cajoling and threatening Haller with a blokey air. But as time goes on and the Shadow King becomes more desperate, Lenny uses intimidation tactics that feel sexually loaded and sinister. “I think it’s really interesting when you have a character like that pitted against someone like David Haller,” says Plaza. “That dynamic was always really interesting to me because I feel like Lenny has a sexual energy to her, but it’s not always a feminine energy, it’s more kind of masculine.”Despite being possessed by the embodiment of evil, throughout all of this Lenny also remains Haller’s close pal from the psychiatric hospital, and Plaza interprets the original characters’ relationship as sexual too. “At times it feels like they’re just friends and at times it feels like there’s some kind of attraction there,” she says. Plaza’s next project is unsettling in a different sense. She stars in An Evening With Beverly Luff Linn, a film by Jim Hosking, whose gross-out debut The Greasy Strangler proved to be one of the more curious films of 2016. Plaza describes it as a “quadrangle love story between four freaks”, and the film, which also features her Legion co-star Jemaine Clement, has already disturbed critics on the festival circuit (the Hollywood Reporter called it “strenuously weird”). It’s another eccentric addition to her CV, but Plaza still feels as if she doesn’t get enough odd scripts. “I like them strange,” she says. “I want more of them. I’ve always been drawn to weird movies, I loved John Waters and Christopher Guest growing up, and I’m always looking for stories you just can’t believe someone would think up.” Considering a dimension-hopping, mutant-baiting creature wasn’t enough to sate Plaza’s appetite for strange stories, you suspect that where weirdness is concerned, the astral plane’s not quite the limit.

And in a lengthy interview with ABC on Sunday night, the former director of the FBI said Donald Trump was morally unfit to be president. But his high-profile commentary has upset former colleagues who had held him in high regard both personally and professionally.“It’s tasteless at best. There is a total lack of dignity. He, and a number of other FBI employees who worked directly for him, have damaged the agency,” Nancy Savage, executive director of the Society of Former Special Agents of the FBI, said of Comey’s book and interview.Savage, who was an agent for 30 years and was president of the FBI special agents association while serving, before she retired in 2011, told the Guardian it was highly inappropriate for Comey to talk about matters relating to the president that are currently under investigation.In his interview with ABC on Sunday, Comey discussed topics such as whether Trump may have obstructed justice by pressing him, while he was still FBI director, to drop his inquiry into the former national security adviser Michael Flynn’s links to Russia. Comey repeated his assertion that Trump asked him for his loyalty, and he aired unconfirmed allegations that Russia has compromising personal material on the president.These issues are among those under investigation by the special counsel Robert Mueller and two Senate committees.She also criticized some Comey colleagues such as Andrew McCabe, who was fired  last month over accusations of leaking to the press.Serving agents generally shy away from speaking publicly about FBI matters or politics but there has been plenty of talk behind the scenes. Savage and other former agents said they had heard from FBI staff in the hours since Comey’s interview on ABC aired, and they were not happy.Former senior agent Bobby Chacon said: “The majority of people I have spoken to since Sunday night think it’s unfortunate timing. They are rolling their eyes it’s not good.”Chacon retired in 2014 as head of the FBI underwater forensic e team based in Los Angeles, after being an agent for 27 years. He said there were “still plenty of people” in the agency who supported Comey but many were upset at him “standing on a soapbox”.Chacon is also concerned that Comey, by talking about issues involving Russia and the Trump administration and election campaign, is opening himself up to a tough cross examination if he appears as a witness in any criminal proceedings arising from the investigations.“Comey knows these things, so he may have made the judgment that he’s being careful, but he is playing a dangerous game,” said Chacon, adding: “I worked for him. He did a lot of good things at the FBI. He was popular and I didn’t like the way the White House sacked him ... but he made mistakes and now has been overtaken by his emotions. I’m surprised he has been dragged down into street-fighting with Trump.”Ron Hosko, former assistant director of the FBI’s criminal ision, said he thought Comey had been out of the FBI for long enough that his public comments were less likely to compromise the work of Mueller or Congress. But he said that he believed, and had heard from serving agents, that Comey’s speaking out was only fuel to Trump’s criticism of the agency.“I’m very confident that Robert Mueller knows how to conduct his investigation. But by talking like this Comey is not helping the FBI’s ability to fight back against the attacks on its reputation that have been coming from Trump,” he said. He said it would exacerbate the rift between Trump and the FBI.“I expect these wounds to remain open for a very long time,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e00b0eb2ab4a4fc390ffae9992939da860f07f18/0_157_3020_1812/master/3020.jpg?w=3000\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f88fc658ffd3a850fcbf1846311d8b7 6000w","title":"a bomb silenced daphne caruana galizia but her investigation lives on","story":"The Daphne Project reveals the story so far behind the murder of a Maltese journalistby  Juliette Garside in MaltaThe explosion was so loud it shook the windows of the family home.In a cold panic, Matthew Caruana Galizia ran to the front door, barefoot. “That moment, opening the door, the dogs barking, the light, I just thought I was going to collapse on to the floor.”The neighbours were already outside. He sprinted past them, down the dirt track that leads to the village road, barely aware of the stones cutting into the soles of his feet. Halfway down he saw the column of black smoke.In front of him were the remains of a burning car, his mother’s. She had been inside it.The murder six months ago of the journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia sent shockwaves around the world.In Malta, the prime minister, Joseph Muscat, and his party stand accused of allowing corruption to go unpunished, of weakening the police and the judiciary, of allowing an environment in which her killing became possible.But it goes deeper than that. The European Union must now decide how to deal with its smallest member state – an island that appears to have become a magnet for criminals and kleptocrats, and that some MEPs fear has become a gateway for dirty money into the rest of the continent, including the UK.The profound questions raised by Caruana Galizia’s murder have become the focus of a new collaboration: the Daphne Project.With the support of her family, a group of 18 international media organisations, including the Guardian, Reuters and Le Monde, has come together. Led by Forbidden Stories, whose mission is to continue the work of silenced journalists, the group has spent months piecing together Caruana Galizia’s story and pursuing the investigations she was working on when she was killed.Today, the project launches with the story of her murder, of the men facing trial for the crime, and the enduring mystery of who ordered it, and why.Daphne Caruana Galizia had spent her last morning working at the dining room table opposite her eldest son, Matthew, 32. The air was still and heavy with the scent of wild fennel. The densely planted garden of her hilltop home in the northern village of Bidnija muffled any noise from the road. She was absorbed in her work, and the hours passed unnoticed.Just before 3pm Caruana Galizia hastily gathered her things – she was late for an appointment at the bank. She rushed out, came back for some forgotten cheques, then climbed into her car.As the charcoal grey Peugeot 108 headed south out of the village, she was being watched. For her killers, the moment had come a bomb placed under the driver’s seat was detonated by remote control.A neighbour, Francis Sant, who was driving in the opposite direction, recalls a first explosion, which sent out white smoke and debris. Moments later, there was a second, much larger blast and the vehicle caught fire, before careering off the road into fields.In an interview for this project, Sant said: “I am going to say something that I have never said before. Because I felt that I shouldn’t say it … I even heard her screaming … But as soon as she screamed she became a ball of fire.”As Matthew sprinted towards the scene, he remembers seeing a crater in the road. Trees were on fire. He could see glass, and plastic, and pieces of flesh.He couldn’t see the car but he could hear it the horn was blaring. He followed the noise and the smoke, all the while hoping it was not his mother’s vehicle.But then he recognised the licence plate. Circling, looking inside, there was nothing but orange fire. No sign of a body, no silhouette.He searched the ground for a stick to prise open what was left of the doors when he heard police sirens. “I was looking on the ground for something, and then I saw a leg. And I remember thinking to myself like OK … there is a leg on the ground, there are body parts up there, obviously no one could have survived this, so it’s pointless.”Soon, his mother’s sister arrived, and then, after some frantic phone calls, his father and two younger brothers. The family hunkered down in Bidnija, staying indoors for two weeks, avoiding the television crews. The days passed in a blur.But it was Matthew’s precise recollection of what his mother was doing in the minutes before she was killed that led to an apparent breakthrough in the murder inquiry.On 4 December last year, in an early morning swoop on the seedy port area of Marsa which involved soldiers arriving by boat and a Swat team storming in from the road, police arrested three men widely reported in Malta as being known to the police: brothers George and Alfred Degiorgio, aged 55 and 53 respectively, and their associate Vincent Muscat, 55.The brothers were ordered at gunpoint to lie on the ground. Muscat was handcuffed to an iron railing. Footage of the raid, shot from a soldier’s head camera, was released to the press.The focus of the operation that day was a large, rusty shed overlooking Valletta’s Grand Harbour. Known locally as the potato shed – it was once used for storing vegetables – the structure now shelters the colourful rowing boats of the Marsa Regatta Club.One end is fenced off. It contains weightlifting benches, a barbecue and a secure room with a metal door and shutters. Suspended from the ceiling are a Spider-Man toy, fishing tackle, and the severed heads and tails of marlin fish.This is where officers arrested the men – and where they suspect the murder was planned.“They used to come here at the beginning or the end of the day,” said one man who knew them. “Sometimes, they had visitors at night. They were the kind of people who, even in the middle of summer, they give you a chill.”The evidence that led police to suspect these men was compiled by Insp Keith Arnaud, a homicide detective who knew Daphne and had once tried to arrest her.His case has been set out in meticulous detail in testimony for an examining magistrate, who is deciding whether the accused should stand trial.Reviewed by the Guardian, the testimony shows how police zeroed in on the arrested men with help from the FBI and a team of forensic specialists from the Netherlands.They assumed the bomb had been triggered remotely, and had probably been linked to a mobile phone, so the question was: who was making calls that day, and from where?The evidence was provided by a major piece of FBI computer processing, undertaken in the US, and complicated by the fact that the Vodafone mast in Bidnija was “off grid” at the time of the murder.Thousands of calls redirected to other masts had to be sifted through before investigators believed they had found what they were looking for: the numbers of two devices that appear to have been used to detonate the bomb.Detectives believe the sim cards for the phones were bought almost a year before the murder, on 15 November 2016. The two numbers only ever communicated with each other.Further analysis revealed one of the sim cards was used in a basic Nokia handset the second, which Arnaud calls “the god device”, was attached to a circuit board like those used to switch on lights or central heating by remote control. Or, in this case, it seems, to detonate a bomb.Having apparently found the method for triggering the device, Arnaud’s team was unsure who had pressed the button.The intelligence services were already monitoring George Degiorgio’s personal phone, in connection with another investigation.Arnaud told the magistrate he was able to match the location data from George Degiorgio’s personal number with another device, thought to have been one of three “burner” phones acquired for the job. Over a period of weeks, they found the burner phones signalling to the network from the same masts as personal numbers used by the three accused.The data provided by the FBI showed that the night before the killing, all three burner phones were active in Bidnija. And at 1.41am, the circuit board sim was switched on.After that, the suspects headed their separate ways, Arnaud told the court. According to his account, Alfred Degiorgio spent the night in Bidnija and the other two left the village. By 6.15am on the day of the murder, George’s phones were allegedly signalling from the potato shed in Marsa. Shortly after that, they were said to be transmitting from the coastline around Valletta.Police matched the locations with CCTV footage and spotted a small cabin cruiser with a distinctive green hood. The boat, called the Maya, was registered in Alfred’s name, but the phone data led police to believe it was George at the helm that afternoon.At 2.55pm, the Maya stopped, idling along a sheltered stretch of water beneath a neoclassical whe ar memorial known as the Siege Bell. Minutes later, it is alleged, there were two phone calls to the boat, both from Bidnija. The first lasted 44sec the next, 1min 47sec.Arnaud’s testimony to the court explains: “If you look into why there were two calls, it matches perfectly with what Matthew Caruana Galizia said when he told us that when his mother left the house, she forgot the cheque book.“In our opinion … the spotter saw the victim come out, he informed the person at sea to prepare himself, the victim went into the house again, the call ended, but two minutes later it took place again.”At 2.58pm, a text message was sent to the “god device” containing a code designed to activate the circuit board in the bomb.Within minutes of the blast, Arnaud told the court, George was messaging his girlfriend: “Buy me wine, my love.” She replied: “OK.” At 4pm, CCTV shows the Maya cruising back towards its mooring.The police case relies upon the evidence provided by the phones, and more information may be forthcoming.A sweep of the harbour floor by army scuba ers led to the recovery of eight phones said to have been used by the accused.The Guardian understands that all the devices were sent to Europol in the Netherlands for analysis several weeks ago.Alongside the examining magistrate hearing police evidence against the alleged bombers, another magistrate, Anthony Vella, is investigating the murder. Europol, the FBI and a Maltese telecoms expert are reporting directly to him.The family’s hopes of discovering who ordered the killing rest with Vella, because they fear police will not pursue evidence that might lead to politicians. A source close to the investigation said police were focused on finding the bomb maker, and tracing any possible links to organised crime.Vella is “a very thorough, meticulous, no-nonsense person”, says the family’s lawyer, Jason Azzopardi. “The fact that these international experts are answerable to the magistrate is the way it should be because this case has reverberations that go beyond the shores of Malta.”The three suspects have said nothing since their arrest. George, known by the street name ic-Ciniz (the Chinese), simply pulled out his identity card and placed it on the interrogation room table during police questioning. Alfred, or il-Fulu (the Bean), would not even confirm his name.The Guardian understands that detectives suspect the men had been tipped off before their arrest. When officers came for them in Marsa, the phones they had allegedly used were already on the seabed, and George had his partner’s mobile number written on his hand.The Nationalist MP and former opposition leader Simon Busuttil is concerned that the raid appeared staged: “The assault was fully filmed and everything looked pre-set for maximum propaganda effect. Footage of the assault was quicky circulated on the media and looked like something out of a Marvel action film – theatrical.”All three men entered not guilty pleas and accepted legal aid, but declined to speak to their lawyers.They have yet to stand trial, and any suggestion they were acting on orders remains speculation.Certainly, Caruana Galizia had many enemies and many critics. She took aim at anyone she believed needed to be held to account – mobsters, business people, even the current leader of the Nationalist party, with which she had been closely aligned.Caruana Galizia’s second son, Andrew, lays the blame at the feet of the ruling Labour party.“Maltese citizens are completely naked when they interact with their state,” he said. “There’s no independent institution in between the citizen and the government. Her assassination became possible for that reason.”In the aftermath of the attack, and without the consent of the family, the government offered a €1m (£870,000) reward for information leading to the killers. Despite the arrests, it remains on the table.In a statement emailed by his spokesman, the prime minister said: “An investigation is ongoing into those who ordered the killing. I trust the Maltese police will investigate this case with full professionalism, and without fear or favour.” Muscat added that the murder had “shocked and outraged” him. “No prime minister would want a journalist to be murdered under any circumstances. This was an attack on our society and such a senseless act particularly affects a country our size. This murder does not reflect on the Maltese people, who enjoy a liberal, open and democratic society. The government is clear that the police will have whatever resources they need to pursue and prosecute those responsible.”The stakes for both Malta and the EU remain high.And for a family torn apart by the murder, there is anger, bewilderment, and an overwhelming feeling of loss.Matthew’s brother Paul, 29, flew in from London on the night of the murder and was confronted by a sight he will never forget.Their peaceful valley was, he says, unrecognisable: the familiar fields were floodlit, the road choked with police and television crews.As Andrew puts it: “It felt like the world had collapsed and no one was safe any more. Apart from my mother being taken away I also felt that my country had been taken away.”15 November 2016: Sim cards for mobile devices allegedly used to trigger the bomb are purchased.10 January 2017: The trigger sims are activated for the first time, in the area of Żebbuġ. One is placed inside a Nokia handset and used to send four text messages to the other, placed in a circuit board. After 20 minutes, the sims are switched off.19 August: Three burner phones believed to have been used by the bombers are activated within 20 minutes of each other.21 August: Trigger sims are switched on for the second time, and two text messages are sent between them. This appears to be a second test run.End of September: White rental car seen for the first time in the vicinity of Bidnija. Over the coming weeks it is spotted many times, parked near a lookout point.15 October: All three burner phones are located in Bidnija.

In a remarkable and previously unheard recording, the journalist described arson attacks on her home, attempts to cut off her income, the freezing of her bank accounts, dozens of libel suits brought by ministers and business people, and attacks online and in the street by critics who branded her a “witch”.By turns fearful, defiant and darkly amused, the journalist set out in her own words the danger she was in. Six days later she died in a car bomb.The interview in October 2017 was for a study by a human rights group, the Council of Europe, in which she was asked to detail decades of threats and harassment.“They have made me into what in effect is a national scapegoat. And this has gone on for 30 years now, almost,” she said.“I am in a situation where people who can’t even read English, and therefore have never read anything I’ve written, at the same time are aware of who I am, know that they are meant to hate me … and react to me on that basis. Totally irrespective of what I write, but as the person, as the figure, that they are told to hate.”A fearless anti-corruption journalist, Daphne Caruana Galizia’s reporting came to international attention with her exposes in the 2016 Panama Papers project.On 16 October the following year, the Maltese reporter was murdered by a bomb placed under the driver’s seat of her car.The Daphne Project was created to continue her investigations. It is a collaboration of 18 media organisations in 15 different countries, including the Guardian, Reuters, Le Monde and the New York Times.The project is the first to be led by\u0026nbspForbidden Stories, an international network of journalists who stand ready to take over when colleagues are silenced through imprisonment or murder.The project will publish a series of fresh revelations, setting out the dangers that alleged political corruption and poor controls on money laundering inside Malta pose to law and order in Europe.Shared by her family as part of the Daphne Project, the recording paints a haunting picture of how the world had closed in on Caruana Galizia during the last four years of her life.Well-known in Malta since her mid-20s, when she became a columnist, Caruana Galizia had helped launch an English language newspaper, the Malta Independent, published her own lifestyle magazine, and then the blog Running Commentary. A mixture of news, scoops, and coruscating opinion pieces, it earned her many enemies. In true gonzo journalism style, Caruana Galizia never hesitated to place herself at the centre of the story.Her involvement in the 2016 Panama Papers investigation brought her blog to international attention – and led to even more intrusive scrutiny of her in Malta.She described how members of the public were encouraged to film and photograph her, and post the results to social media. Many of the pictures appeared on a blog run by Glenn Bedingfield, a communications adviser in the office of the prime minister, who published hundreds of pieces on the journalist.“In one year, in one year, there were 380 posts about me. More than one a day … I’d be in my local coffee shop having a cup of coffee and they’d encourage people to take photos of me and send them in. I mean, there’s no news value in that, you know. It was just harassment.”Caruana Galizia said she had not been to the beach for four years, after an incident in which a group had followed her, uploading photos in real time to Facebook.She compared her life to Arthur Miller’s play The Crucible, about the persecution of women as witches in the 17th century. “You watch it and you think: ‘Madonna, this is like Malta but with different clothes.’”Clearly aligned with Malta’s right of centre Nationalist party, Caruana Galizia’s criticism of the opposition Labour party and its supporters could also be merciless. Asked by the Guardian to respond to the criticisms Caruana Galizia made of him and his party, Bedingfield said she would often use her blog to encourage readers to post photos of Labour politicians in private moments with their families. “She was more of a political commentator than a journalist, with her own agenda,” said Bedingfield, now a Labour MP. “She used her blog on the net to target and hound iniduals. There was a feeling among Labour supporters that only a taste of her own medicine would deter her.”The MP said he had never advocated violence against Caruana Galizia, or any other Maltese citizen. He said Malta had a “very lively media”, which was often critical of government.Caruana Galizia married young and had three children by her mid-20s when she was hired as a columnist by the Sunday Times of Malta. Until then, she recalled, comment pieces had been written anonymously.“Malta got its first named newspaper columnist and it was a 25-year-old woman. And this thing was a double shock. And I used to have people actually telling me: ‘But does your husband write them for you? Does your father? Does your brother?’”Becoming well known at a young age prepared her for what was to come, she said. “I literally know no other way of life. I got used to it, like, you know, like a scar forms around a wound.”The attempts to silence her began early on, according to a list of attacks compiled by the family. In 1995, after reporting on the activity of a drug trafficker, their dog’s throat was slit and its body left at the door of their home.In 2006, truck tyres were piled up and set on fire against their back door in the middle of the night. During the 2008 general election, Caruana Galizia and her youngest son, Paul, then a 19-year-old student, attended a political debate at the University of Malta. Throughout the event they were filmed and photographed at close range, before Labour-supporting media broadcast the footage on television and online. By then, Caruana Galizia’s support for the Nationalist party had made her a target in Malta’s tribal, two-party system. The Labour campaign plastered her face on billboards, depicting her as a member of the ruling elite.In 2013, the mayor of a Maltese town led a mob that followed Caruana Galizia through the streets, insulting her and chanting slogans, until she sought refuge in a convent. The nuns bolted the door and called the police.When Labour won power five years ago, the harassment intensified. It now appeared to be, in effect, government-sanctioned harassment. Caruana Galizia feared for her family. Her husband, Peter, saw government contracts withdrawn from his law firm. Last year her son Andrew, a diplomat, was recalled from India with two weeks’ notice. He has since quit his job. Responding to questions about Andrew’s departure, the prime minister said in an email from his spokesman that he did not involve himself in inidual staffing matters, and that he had been assured “nothing irregular occurred and that all proper and correct procedures were followed”. Caruana Galizia’s biggest fear was that her example might discourage other journalists, women in particular, from speaking out. She described a “climate of fear”, saying “all journalists in Malta know that they are operating under the goodwill of those they write about”.Before Caruana Galizia was killed, there were 47 libel suits outstanding against her, but she remained defiant. Towards the end of their interview, she told the researcher: “There isn’t one politician in parliament now, on either side of the house, who was there when I started working. I’ve seen them all off, you know, and I am still here, being targeted by the same machine.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dcee9834254e928805c39c8ae51665966a55bec0/0_186_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=9a1abb1b37b2bf010fefdeb4625823fd 1240w","title":"face transplants jerome hamon first french man two","story":"A French man is recovering in a Paris hospital after becoming the first person in the world to undergo two face transplants. Jérôme Hamon, who suffers from a condition which causes disfiguring tumours, underwent his first transplant in 2010, but his body eventually rejected his new face which had to be removed.He is now in a Paris hospital, three months after undergoing an unprecedented second transplant carried out by Laurent Lantieri, the same professor of plastic surgery who carried out the first procedure.Hamon’s new face remains smooth and motionless, with his skull, skin and features yet to be fully aligned – a gradual process reliant on immunosuppressant drugs which, it is hoped, will prevent his body from rejecting the transplanted material. “I feel very well in myself,” Hamon, 43, told reporters. “I can’t wait to get rid of all this,” he said.Hamon suffers from neurofibromatosis type 1, a genetic mutation which causes severe disfiguration and related complications. His first face transplant in 2010 was a success. But that same year – in order to treat a common cold – he was given an antibiotic incompatible with his immunosuppressive treatment. In 2016 he began to display signs of transplant rejection, and his new face began to die, leading Lantieri to remove it. That left Hamon without a face, a condition that Lantieri described as “the walking dead”. Hamon had no eyelids, no ears, no skin and could not speak or eat. He had limited hearing and could express himself only by turning his head slightly, in addition to writing a little. “If you have no skin, you have infections,” Lantieri told the Associated Press on Tuesday. “We were very concerned about the possibility of a new rejection.”Hamon remained in hospital without a face for two months, while a compatible donor was sought. Eventually, a second face donor became available, and Lantieri and his team performed a second transplant in January. Before undergoing the second transplant, doctors had to replace all of the blood in his body in a month-long procedure, to eliminate some potentially problematic antibodies from previous treatments.“For a man who went through all this, which is like going through a nuclear war, he’s doing fine,” Lantieri said. He added that Hamon is now being monitored like any other face transplant patient.Hamon’s first face was donated by a 60-year-old. With his second transplanted face, Hamon said he managed to drop a few decades.“I’m 43. The donor was 22. So I’ve become 20 years younger,” Hamon joked on French television on Tuesday.Despite all the anxiety and suffering, Hamon said he was a happy man again. “The first transplant I accepted immediately. I thought ‘this is my new face’ and this time it’s the same,” he told AFP. “If I hadn’t accepted this new face it would have been terrible. It’s a question of identity … But here we are, it’s good, it’s me.” There have now been about 40 face transplants throughout the world since the first partial transplant was performed on Isabelle Dinoire in 2005. Her nose, lips, chin and parts of her cheeks had been removed after she was bitten by her dog.This article includes material from AP and AFP"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce336712643553b02b346f4b06255c0040075960/0_0_5472_3648/master/5472.jpg?w=5250\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e528a9f9964e906a14d9e802bc6db6ee 10500w","title":"destruction in douma latest photographs from the conflict in syria","story":"Images from eastern Ghouta taken after Syrian forces reportedly defeated opposition fighters in the area "},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"\u0026lsquoMy four-year-old daughter said \u0026ldquostop daddy, mummy can\u0026rsquot breathe\u0026rsquo\u0026rdquoSinger who provided soundtrack for a generation was the most humble man in the businessOireachtas committee hears concerns from principals over delays in school buildingsDecision by human rights commission to examine killing of Michael Dwyer seen as breakthroughSinn F\u0026eacutein leader claims attempt being made to \u0026lsquosilence\u0026rsquo the ODCEThree years imposed for \u0026lsquounprovoked attack\u0026rsquo in which the assailant \u0026lsquoparticipated fully\u0026rsquoLeo Varadkar to hold an event calling for a \u0026lsquoYes\u0026rsquo vote in Eighth Amendment referendumLowry warns Government to increase road funding \u0026lsquoif it wants to be re-elected\u0026rsquo\u0026lsquoHe was hitting me all over with the hammer,\u0026rsquo woman tells Central Criminal CourtHetty Lawlor takes overall prize 34 years after her father Jimmy took home top prizeYury Filatov tells reporters Moscow losing \u0026lsquolast bit of trust\u0026rsquo for western partnersReceiver appealed inclusion of 900 social and affordable homes from total build of 3,500Belgian fitness centres are in an uproar as the medic is cleared over the incidentData watchdog tells Oireachtas committee of the issues created by Facebook scandalAnne Marie Donovan (40), caught with drugs in her flat, had been targeted and attackedChairman comments on former commissioner\u0026rsquos move following McCabe complaintRiver Basin Management plan will overhaul management of 190 bodies of water nationallyFrench surgeon says he has performed a second face transplant on the patientGarda\u0026iacute are investigating following the discovery of child\u0026rsquos remains in a vehicleRiver Basin Management Plan \u0026lsquolacks ambition\u0026rsquo and political will, critics sayThank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3464516.1523973465!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"actor confronts man removing yes posters in limerick","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMan removing campaign posters in Co Limerick. Image: Screenshot from Facebook videoAn online video of an Irish actor confronting a man removing posters, erected by campaigners for a “Yes” vote in the abortion referendum, from telephone poles in Limerick has been viewed thousands of times.Kevin Kiely jnr, who appeared in The Dark Knight Rises and World War Z, recorded a man taking down the posters and posted the footage on his Facebook account. The posters carry the emblem of the socialist feminist movement Rosa, and bear the slogan “Stop Shaming Women!”. When Kiely asks the man why he is removing the posters, he is heard replying: “None of your business”. The man does not reply when Kiely asks him: “Do you disagree about stopping shaming women, in 2018, that you have to tear the posters down off the wall?”Kiely then says: “C’mon, I’ll put you on the internet and you can tell the internet why you tore them down . . . You’ll go on Facebook tonight.” The man is filmed apparently trying to prevent Kiely from recording him. He asks Kiely to “stop filming” him. Kiely replies: “No I won’t. You’re in a public place. You just did something that is destruction of somebody’s else’s property in a public place, and I filmed you.” The man then removes two more posters from a pole and walks off. Asked why he confronted the man and filmed him, Kiely said he believed removing the posters was an act of “censorship”, and added, “I can’t condone that.” “There are ‘No’ posters and ‘Yes’ posters all the up along the street and people can vote for whoever they want. That’s why we live in a democracy,” he said.

Photograph: RTÉBig Tom McBride was the undisputed King of Irish country music. The Gentle Giant from Oram, just outside Castleblayney, Co Monaghan walked tall on the Irish landscape. When news came through of his passing, tears flowed freely. My friend of a lifetime had crossed the Great Divide. Growing up in rural Mayo in the late 1960s and early 70s, I fell in love with country music and especially Big Tom and The Mainliners. The great Larry Gogan presented their sponsored programme on Radio Éireann after 11pm for some time and the legend of Big Tom and the band soon spread around the country and across the Irish Sea. It was in the Royal Ballroom in Castlebar, Co Mayo that I first saw and met Big Tom and The Mainliners. I was introduced to Tom that night by a neighbour and friend, Martin Regan, who still lives near Kiltimagh. It was the start of a friendship that has endured faithfully and without blemish all through the years. Born in the heart of Patrick Kavanagh country, the famous poet from nearby Inniskeen, Tom always reflected the heart and soul of this drumlin countryside. Like Kavanagh, he too knew about his hills never seeing the sun rising, eternally some of them looking north towards Armagh. Like another great poet and singer, Hank Williams, Big Tom took his influences from “down home”. He was shaped and moulded by the people from this rolling land whose earthy qualities anchored him to this corner of Monaghan.Tom was always the quintessential country man who was most at home on the land or, for many years, pursuing one of his favourite hobbies of fishing. He supported his home clubs of Oram and Monaghan with a passion, the blue and white flag of Monaghan flying proudly in the garden. It his early 20s, he donned the county jersey on a number of occasions. The song Gentle Mother, first performed by Tom on The Showband Show on RTÉ, launched the career of the man that went on to attain iconic status in country music. The other six members of The Mainliners were Henry and Seamus McMahon, John Beattie, Ginger Moran, Ronnie Duffy (a brother-in-law of jazz maestro Paddy Cole) and the late Cyril McKevitt. They all came from within a few miles of each other. Soon Big Tom and The Mainliners were packing halls and marquees not just around Ireland but also over in England where Tom was mobbed by adoring fans. On one occasion, they had to bring in the mounted police such was the crowd that gathered outside the Galtymore Ballroom in Cricklewood.Irish people who worked in London during that era and throughout the 1970s will recall with affection that the most common sound emanating from flats and bedsits in Camden, Kilburn and Cricklewood were the songs of Big Tom and The Mainliners, many of which were penned by the late great Johnny McCauley, including Four Country Roads and Back to Castleblayney. Three number one hits in the Irish charts, Old Love Letters, I Love You Still, and Broken Marriage Vows, saw Big Tom and The Mainliners lead the posse by a country mile. In 1975, Tom and The Mainliners parted company for a decade or so and he fronted a new Monaghan band, The Travellers. By then I was working with the Bank of Ireland in Abbeyleix and was in the Dreamland Ballroom, Athy, in 1975 on the night Big Tom started his new career with The Travellers. One of the great highlights with The Travellers came in 1979 when they headlined the big London-Irish Festival in Roundwood Park in London before a crowd of 84,000 people. Around 1980, I left the bank and spent about eight months in Castleblayney working with the Tony Loughman-owned magazine, Entertainment News. Evenings spent out in Oram with Tom and Rose remain ingrained in my memory, including occasions I accompanied him on fishing trips to a small lake in south Armagh. Tom T Hall from Kentucky, once described by President Jimmy Carter as the “Poet Laureate” of American country music, had a special time for Ireland’s country icon. “When I was in Nashville a few years ago, the only Irish singer that Tom T Hall enquired about was Big Tom McBride. Tom often told me that he never recorded a song that he did not appeal to him. “If you don’t ‘feel’ a country song, don’t sing it.” He had a unique ability to sing songs that he often described as a “happy kind of sadness”. The feeling was in the voice, the outreach was to the heart, and Tom always managed to touch base. The fondness and affection for Big Tom was probably unparalleled in Irish showbiz history. Hearts melted in his presence. Summers came and summers went but the fascination, respect and absolute regard for this Monaghan man’s place in country music history never once diminished.He was the first recipient of the RTÉ Country Music Hall of Fame and The Farmers Journal Country Sound Hall of Fame. There could be no other for the accolade but Big Tom. He was the man with a huge sense of place and an abiding love for his neighbours and friends around Oram and Castleblayney. “Around the old Hope Castle where so often I did roamI dream of Castleblayney, my own people and my home”.Like Australian singer Kevin Johnson captured the essence of an earlier era in his classic song, Rock \u0026amp Roll I Gave You All The Best Years of My Life, Big Tom certainly gave countless thousands some of the best years of our lives too. The passing of his beloved wife Rose at the end of January impacted hugely on him. It was impossible not to remember the great bond between Johnny Cash and June Carter. When June died, Johnny lost the will to live and he died just six months later. Tom and Rose were a special couple and we always loved spending time in their company. His last public concert performance was at my annual weekend in the Salthill Hotel in Galway back in November and the last song he performed was a duet with Margo O’Donnell, A Love That’s Lasted Through The Years. It was followed by the inevitable standing ovation and rousing cheers as Tom tried to navigate his way through the surging and adoring fans. In every sense of the word, he was going out the same way he came in: A true legend. Big Tom was my hero, my legend. He was part of the fabric of life on this island for over five decades. He was the man who had the ability to touch the heart of rural Ireland like no other. The most humble man in the business, the most loved Irish singer in the hearts of all who ever enjoyed real country music here in Ireland, the man who never changed, who was always himself, plain and down to earth Tom McBride. I was so privileged to have the honour of introducing him and the band on stage so many times as well as hosting that unforgettable night when Irish TV recorded a three hour special tribute to Tom in the Glencarn Hotel in Castleblayney. Like thousands and thousands of people, I loved Big Tom as a person, for the incredible joy he brought to our lives. He was such a part of the soundtrack of our lives. He was, and always will be, our King. There will never be another like the great Big Tom McBride.

Photograph: Google MapsDublin City Council has taken legal proceedings against large city centre pub Opium amid complaints from local residents and businesses following a multimillion euro makeover.The Mercantile Group establishment, which describes itself as a “pan-Asian restaurant, cocktail bar and nightlife destination” closed in May last year and reopened in January after a revamp estimated to have cost between €2 million and €4 million.In a recent letter to councillors, the Camden Village Residents’ \u0026amp Business Association said it had received an “unprecedented” number of noise complaints since the pub installed a rooftop smoking area and opening glass roof on its premises.Dublin City Council last month refused retention permission on the roof works and said it has now started legal proceedings over alterations that it says were carried out without proper planning permission.In its letter, the Camden association said “people cannot get a night’s sleep as the crowd noise from these open areas inside this venue can be heard very often until 2.30am or later”.It accused the Mercantile Group of behaving badly by failing to adhere to an enforcement notice issued by Dublin City Council last October.In response to a question from Fianna Fáil councillor Frank Kennedy, council management said “there is a live file on Opium, 26 Wexford Street”. “A Section 154 Notice was served on 13th October, 2017, requiring the removal of the steel structure and glazed roof and the reinstatement of the curved bitumen covered roof by 15th December, 2017. “The notice was not complied with and the matter is now the subject of legal proceedings.”A planning authority may issue a notice under section 154 of the Planning and Development Act if development does not have the required permission, or where terms of permission have not been met.The council said it refused to grant retention permission because the development gives rise to unacceptable noise levels and creates unacceptable noise levels which negatively affect the “residential environmental quality of the area”.The council carried out sound monitoring in the bedroom of a property on Camden Row over three days in February. “On each of these occasions crowd noise and music with a high bass content were clearly audible and at a level that would be considered intrusive,” the Dublin’s environmental health officer said.Opium is one of a number of Dublin establishments in the Mercantile hospitality group. Last year it lined up a €20 million investment programme, after its warring shareholder blocs formally ended a bitter legal wrangle.The Mercantile Group did not respond to a request for comment.Thank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3464557.1523975813!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"he was a lifeline for a dispossessed people big tom remembered","story":"Irish country singer Big Tom McBride has died aged 81, in 2017 he released a duet with Margo O\u0027Donnell called A Love That\u0027s Lasted Through The Years.

Photographer: Dara Mac DónaillTHE IRISH TIMES Nobody could fill a hall at the height of the showband era like the late Big Tom McBride. Long queues would form outside the local ballroom when Big Tom and his band, the Mainliners, came to town. Generally, dancing was 9pm to 1am, with a relief band getting proceedings underway.In the 1960s, as Ireland was slowly changing, the ballrooms replaced as dance venues the parish halls, which had been frequently run by the local parish priest, whose task sometimes was to guard against the perils of close dancing.Not so the ballrooms, where close dancing ceased to be a moral threat.Many of the ballrooms were exotic, by comparison, and they introduced an element of glamour in a grey Ireland. Their opening saw the emergence of the showbands, vocally more sophisticated than the parish hall band, with the singers and musicians sporting bright suits and modern hairstyles. Big Tom and his band, the Mainliners, became the country stars of that new world. When he recorded the sentimental Gentle Mother in 1967, it became an instant hit, reaching the coveted number one spot in RTÉ Radio’s top 10 records.An overnight success, he went on to enjoy a huge following at home and among Irish emigrants.Yet the showband business was run on an informal basis, with mainly cash transactions.In the midlands, a young businessman, Albert Reynolds, later to become Taoiseach, opened a series of ballrooms. He was later spoken of as a good promoter the band was always paid and a hot meal provided before going on stage. In Tralee, Co Kerry, a ballroom attached to the Mount Brandon hotel, opened by then Taoiseach Sean Lemass in the 1960s, was a hugely successful venue for Big Tom. It had a chandelier and a large balcony. Like the other ballrooms, though, it sold nothing stronger than soft drinks.The women queued on one side of the hall and the men on the other. If there was a large crowd, there was a rush to ask a woman to dance. This was the entertainment world dominated by Big Tom, Dickie Rock, Brendan Bowyer, Brendan O’Brien and Philomena Begley in the sixties and seventies.With the exception perhaps of Bowyer, nobody rivalled Big Tom as a crowd-puller. His country audience followed him faithfully, sometimes driving miles to see him play, not least in the summer when the venue could be a marquee in a country village where the local carnival was being held. He understood his audience. He came from Castleblayney, Co Monaghan, and knew rural Ireland. He had spent some time as an emigrant in London. His songs were about love affairs, many of them ending in remorse and melancholy, old Irish ballads, and some modern songs. Despite being the lead singer and playing the guitar in the band, he was intensely uneasy with fame.I interviewed him many years ago when he was playing at the Festival of Kerry at the height of his fame.He was a courteous, diffident, shy man. He told me he found public recognition difficult.He had just turned down his own series on RTÉ television at the time because the station wanted to use professional session musicians rather than his own band members, all of whom hailed from his native Monaghan.“They would be the best in the business,’’ he said. “But they would have no interest in country music.’’Big Tom and his music were lampooned, of course. In an Ireland struggling for sophistication, having watched too much television, Big Tom and his likes were not cool.His country fans dismissed the lampooning, followed him in the dancehalls and bought his records in abundanceIn recent times, he would get due recognition on a country music special on The Late Late Show, presented by Ryan Tubridy, who helped the visibly ailing Big Tom to the microphone to sing his trademark Four Country Roads. Some 400,00 people emigrated from Ireland between 1951 and 1961 alone, most of them poorly educated and ill-prepared. Many headed for British building sites and factories. “They were a silent generation,’’ the novelist John McGahern later wrote,”and they left in silence.’’They followed Big Tom when he came to London to play in the then thriving Irish dancehalls, such as the Galtymore in Cricklewood, the National in Kilburn, and the Gresham in Holloway Road. They played his records at home and sang his songs at Irish emigrant gatherings, the poignancy of his voice in harmony with the bitter-sweet experience of forced emigration.It is very easy today to dismiss all this as crass sentimentality. It would be wrong, because it was no such thing.Big Tom’s songs and music were a lifeline for a dispossessed people, forced out of their own country, which could not even provide them with the basic human right of a job. Many of those songs were melancholic. But our history of forced emigration is laced with melancholy.A good friend, John Mulrooney, from Sligo, was a close friend of Big Tom. Some years ago, we said we would meet up at one of his concerts. We never did.I regret that now.The Ireland which made Big Tom a country star is gone. The ballrooms have long closed and the showbands are no more.

Photograph: Charles Platiau via APIf the worst thing that can happen to a new project is to be ignored, a party of the British centre ground has a chance, after all.The latest people to try, steered by the entrepreneur Simon Franks, are drenched from the Victoria Falls of cold water that has been poured on their idea. The yet-to-be-named party is doomed, say well-wishers, not just enemies, by its reliance on shop-soiled politicians from the recent past, its lack of ideas, its support from donors of the faceless, cat-stroking kind, its air of de haut en bas and its geographic spread of potential voters in an electoral system that rewards concentration.Some of these problems are more real than others. A wider donor base would make it harder for cynics, including Conservatives who should know better, to demonise this “rich man’s party”. But the Brexit campaign was not financed by the spare pennies of honest draymen either, and still won.As for ideas, lots of political movements are disparaged for their intellectual vacuity until they win. Tony Blair’s New Labour, David Cameron’s modernised Tories and Emmanuel Macron’s En Marche are just the most recent examples of vague but well-led platforms that carried the public. The inidual leader comes first. The ideas follow, and sometimes never do.The unavailability of such a leader is one of British centrism’s besetting curses, but there is an even more obvious problem. Nothing has happened yet. The hard but crucial thing to remember about the great age of populism, the historic rout of the centre, globalisation’s writhing ordeal, is that almost all of it is prospective. It amounts to a series of electoral shocks that have not had time to work much tangible effect on the governance of nations, and therefore on people’s lives.The implementation of Brexit is still years away, on the other side of a transitional phase. Fifteen months into his US presidency, Donald Trump’s foremost legislative achievement is a corporate tax cut that most of the hated “globalists” would drink up. Over the same period, the most notable policy change in Europe has been Macron’s attempted supply-side reform of France. Exactly what is a voter of the liberal centre meant to be mobilising against at this point, beyond the atmospheric change?The economist Robert Solow, unimpressed with the growth-boosting properties of information technology, once said that the computer age is everywhere but in the productivity statistics. The populist age is everywhere but on the statute book, at least for now. There have been some disturbing reversals for liberalism: in eastern and central Europe especially, and on the subject of immigration. But the overall balance of government policy in the democratic west, including Britain, has not changed drastically since the Year Zero of 2016.This can change, and probably will. But until it does, middle-ground voters are being invited to react against something that has not occurred – against the idea, not the felt reality, of illiberalism. It is too little to hang a new party on. No one calls the police because they fear a burglary in the medium-term future. It is the immediacy of a threat that concentrates the mind.Looking back, no one is surprised that an anti-globalisation movement failed to materialise in, say, 1980, when Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan had just been elected and the intellectual right was still talking a better game than it had legislated. Yet at an equivalent stage of this new populist era – if it turns out to be any such thing – the lack of a liberal resistance is seen as an ignominious failure. In fact, it is natural.The creation of a successful new party is not just difficult, it is mostly beyond anyone’s control. It requires a mating of historic circumstance and the human element, in the form of an outstanding inidual. All the same, Franks and his like are right to detect lots of unspoken-for voters in modern Britain. They are middle-income, largely apolitical workers who do not answer to the mystifying name “centrist”, but simply have a material interest in continuity. (Most people in work voted Remain.) They are frustrated by the world as it is, but do not believe it needs turning upside down.The trouble is, as of spring 2018, the world has not been upturned. Their material lives have not changed enough. As much as politics has pitched and yawed noisily in recent years, policy itself has not. If that changes, and these voters feel their hard-won living standards compromised by ideological hot-heads, watch the “insurmountable” barriers to a new centrism tumble. Voters cannot be persuaded of that which has yet to be felt. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2018Thank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/04/12/TELEMMGLPICT000002395664_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq6L3Bx11x18zbsv4k04trOP3QFo7fDZgyggOOCRYToPs.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"cant think rationallywithout emotions feature not bug","story":"Future AIs might be susceptible to something like depressionDoes intelligence have to be conscious?

Initially, emergency rations included only rice, vegetable oil and lentils. Ms Leidman warned that the coming rainy season, which normally starts between April and June, could make the situation worse.She said some of the feeding centres were in areas that could flood and, although steps were being taken to prevent the worst effects of the flooding, it was unclear what impact the monsoon would have on vital services.The rainy season also presents a greater risk of waterborne diseases such as diarrhoea, typhoid, hepatitis, malaria and dengue.Ms Leidman added: “The possibility of an outbreak of infectious disease can exacerbate malnutrition. In a malnourished population the disease severity and duration of an infectious disease can be much greater.”Researchers are now conducting a follow-up study to assess whether the nutritional situation has changed.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Mary Beard \u0026#39cut\u0026#39 from US version of Civilisations, fearing \u0026#39slightly creaky old lady isn\u0026#39t ideal for US TV\u0026#39Comment: For all its bluster about Syrian air strikes provoking armageddon, Russia has shown itself to be a paper tigerStudent who chose to have leg amputated for £5,000 targets ParalympicsEmoji \u0026#39ruining people\u0026#39s grasp of English\u0026#39 because young rely on them to communicateNew migraine treatment could help when other drugs fail Millions of IP addresses blocked as Russia tries to shut down TelegramWatch: Giant South Korean tug-of-war game gets underway at 500-year-old festivalFrom steak to aftershave to urine tests, how Donald Trump’s merchandising empire has collapsedDoctor cleared after faking sick note to get woman out of her gym contractStarbucks to close 8,000 branches for afternoon of racial bias training after discrimination rowUndercover officer who spied on Stephen Lawrence\u0026#39s family named as David HaganAnzac Day 2018: How the ill-fated Gallipoli campaign helped forge Australia\u0026#39s national identityComment: Jeremy Corbyn’s had a brilliant idea on when to take military action.

But that same year - in order to treat nothing more than a common cold - he was given an antibiotic incompatible with his immunosuppressive treatment.In 2016 he began to display signs of transplant rejection, and his new face deteriorated.Last summer Hamon was hospitalised and in November his face, suffering from necrosis, had to be removed.He remained in hospital without a face for two months, a very difficult time, while a compatible donor was sought.Everyone at the hospital \u0026quotwas blown away by Jerome\u0027s courage, his will, his strength of character in a tragic situation. While he was waiting he never complained, he was even in a good mood,\u0026quot recalled Bernard Cholley, an anaesthetist.Eventually, a face donor was found, a 22-year-old man who had died hundreds of kilometres from Paris. Lantieri heard the news on a Sunday in January and the massive logistical and medical operation was swiftly launched.The donor face was transported as quickly as possible by road on the Monday to the Georges-Pompidou hospital in Paris.By late morning the following day, Hamon was being wheeled back to his hospital bed following the ground-breaking surgery, with his medical team noticing encouraging signs of good colour in his new face.The operation answers a key question for Lantieri and the rest of the medical world \u0026quotCan we redo a facial transplant? Yes, we can re-transplant and this is what you get!\u0026quotThe French medical team and Jerome Hanon at the Hopital Europeen Georges-Pompidou in ParisTo avoid any rejection, the patient underwent three months of special blood treatment prior to the transplant, nephrologist Eric Thervet explained.Despite all the anxiety and suffering, Hamon is a happy man again.\u0026quotThe first transplant I accepted immediately.

Ulcers formed on her foot and, despite more than 50 operations and numerous skin grafts, they would not heal.After years of excruciating pain, Hannah says having her amputation was \u0026#39the best decision I’ve ever made\u0026#39At that point she made the harrowing decision to have her right leg amputated to stop the pain, even though she was told there was no guarantee it would work. The NHS refused to carry out the operation on the grounds that it was not the recommended treatment for CRPS and that she could still be in pain afterwards. But other surgeons said there was a chance the operation would take away her pain.Miss Moore said that since the operation she had never looked back, had lost 4 st and was fitter than before. “Having my leg amputated was the best decision I’ve ever made,” she said. “The things I have achieved I would never have without this operation. The hardest times were before having my amputation, as I was having operations almost every week in London and the pain was so wearing.\u0026quot“Since, I’ve never felt sorry for myself. It’s all been about making the most out of a situation, showing to myself as much as anyone that a ‘disability’ doesn’t have to define what you can and can’t do.”Last August, the Yeovil College student became the British PTS4 paratriathlon champion and this year she will begin a sports and exercise degree at Loughborough University.Miss Moore, who will remove the artificial limb and replace it with a blade for the running part of a triathlon, added: “I am a British champion and now my dream is to compete in Tokyo.”Please review our commenting policyMary Beard \u0026#39cut\u0026#39 from US version of Civilisations, fearing \u0026#39slightly creaky old lady isn\u0026#39t ideal for US TV\u0026#39Comment: For all its bluster about Syrian air strikes provoking armageddon, Russia has shown itself to be a paper tigerEmoji \u0026#39ruining people\u0026#39s grasp of English\u0026#39 because young rely on them to communicateNew migraine treatment could help when other drugs fail Millions of IP addresses blocked as Russia tries to shut down TelegramWatch: Giant South Korean tug-of-war game gets underway at 500-year-old festivalFrom steak to aftershave to urine tests, how Donald Trump’s merchandising empire has collapsedDoctor cleared after faking sick note to get woman out of her gym contractStarbucks to close 8,000 branches for afternoon of racial bias training after discrimination rowUndercover officer who spied on Stephen Lawrence\u0026#39s family named as David HaganAnzac Day 2018: How the ill-fated Gallipoli campaign helped forge Australia\u0026#39s national identityComment: Jeremy Corbyn’s had a brilliant idea on when to take military action.

He remained in the background obviously gathering information and intelligence.\u0026quotIt has always been my view that I was spied on but what I need to know is what parts of my life he was snooping on. We need to see the intelligence reports that he was feeding back to the Met. Only then can we begin to see the full picture.\u0026quotNeither Doreen or Neville Lawrence, who will mark the 25th anniversary of their son\u0027s death on Sunday, commented on the publication of Hagan\u0027s identity.It is understood Hagan controversially met with then acting detective inspector, Richard Walton, who was working on Scotland Yard\u0027s final submissions to the public inquiry, and passed on information including that Stephen\u0027s parents had separated.In 2014 a damning report on undercover policing by barrister Mark Ellison QC alleged that Mr Walton \u0026quotobtained information pertaining to the Lawrence family and their supporters, potentially undermining the inquiry and public confidence\u0026quot.Mary Beard \u0026#39cut\u0026#39 from US version of Civilisations, fearing \u0026#39slightly creaky old lady isn\u0026#39t ideal for US TV\u0026#39Comment: For all its bluster about Syrian air strikes provoking armageddon, Russia has shown itself to be a paper tigerStudent who chose to have leg amputated for £5,000 targets ParalympicsEmoji \u0026#39ruining people\u0026#39s grasp of English\u0026#39 because young rely on them to communicateNew migraine treatment could help when other drugs fail Millions of IP addresses blocked as Russia tries to shut down TelegramWatch: Giant South Korean tug-of-war game gets underway at 500-year-old festivalFrom steak to aftershave to urine tests, how Donald Trump’s merchandising empire has collapsedDoctor cleared after faking sick note to get woman out of her gym contractStarbucks to close 8,000 branches for afternoon of racial bias training after discrimination rowAnzac Day 2018: How the ill-fated Gallipoli campaign helped forge Australia\u0026#39s national identityComment: Jeremy Corbyn’s had a brilliant idea on when to take military action.

Because crypto-assets know no boundaries, international cooperation will be essential.”The Independent\u0027s bitcoin group on Facebook is the best place to follow the latest discussions and developments in cryptocurrency.

On average, people are still taking home less than they did before the crisis,” said Stephen Clarke of the Resolution Foundation think tank.The wages data was also weaker than the 3 per cent growth that many City of London analysts had anticipated, sending sterling down to $1.4325, as some traders pulled back their bets slightly on a May interest rate hike from the Bank of England.Meanwhile, the unemployment rate for the three months to February ticked down to 4.2 per cent, from 4.3 per cent previously. City analysts had expected it to be unchanged.The employment rate rose to a new record high of 75.4 per cent.According to the ONS the number of people in jobs rose by 55,000 over the period, while the numbers out of work fell by 16,000.The work and pensions secretary Esther McVey heralded the figures as evidence of the continuing strength of the UK jobs market.“Day by day we are helping people turn their lives around by getting them into employment.

Job prospects and and a disillusionment with politics are among the issues still pushing many millennials, like generations before them, to move away. Except now, things are supposed to be different. Brexit has the potential to undermine the Good Friday AgreementTwenty years ago, on 10 April 1998, peace came to Northern Ireland. After 30 years of brutal sectarian conflict, in which more than 3,600 people were killed, political groups agreed to reject violence and work together to solve problems democratically. It was called the Good Friday Agreement. A devolved assembly would be established for both sides to govern together and while unionists were assured of their British identity, a united Ireland was acknowledged as a legitimate political goal for republicans. Some 71 per cent of people in Northern Ireland voted to accept the agreement in a referendum, with the DUP being the only party to reject it. David Trimble and John Hume were pictured on stage with Bono after brokering the Good Friday Agreement (AFPGetty)The years that followed saw continued political instability and fringe paramilitary activity but largely, the deal held. By 2003, voting patterns in Northern Ireland shifted considerably. While Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader David Trimble and Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader John Hume had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts in 1998, their parties were gradually sidelined.Instead, the electorate moved towards more hardline options. The DUP, led by the formidable Rev Ian Paisley, with their staunch Presbyterian values, and unwavering loyalty to Britain overtook the UUP and Sinn Fein, the unapologetically republican party with former IRA prisoners among its ranks, effectively replaced the SDLP.And yet, they managed the unthinkable. In 2008, Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness led the two parties into power sharing for the first time, and were seen not just working together, but laughing together.But while violence faded from the streets, a cultural battleground began to open up politically – not just over the very narrative of the Troubles, but over parading, flags and language, with the DUP fighting for a retention of all things British, while Sinn Fein vouched for Irish culture to be given the equal weighting it was promised in the agreement. Naomi Long is the leader of Alliance, a small, centre ground party with members from both communities. She says even at the height of the conflict, politics was not as starkly ided as it is now.“I think there has been a reliance on the use of the politics of fear, and using that as a rather lazy means to garner votes in elections,” she explains. “The big political parties essentially ask people to vote for them to keep other people out, rather than as a positive expression of what their ambitions and aspirations for the future might be.”Power sharing has now been suspended at Stormont in Belfast since January 2017 (Getty)But whether the parties are setting the agenda from their offices at Stormont, or whether they are merely responding to the wishes of the people on the street, both the DUP and Sinn Fein are totally in step with their ever hardening bases.One of the best litmus tests is The Nolan Show, “the biggest show in the country” broadcast every morning on BBC Radio Ulster. The impassioned, angry, and often downright bigoted views expressed by callers have made the very name of the show synonymous with sounding off. A recent standoff heard a unionist man refuse to call Sinn Fein’s Mairtín O Muilleoir by his Irish name, because a previous republican caller refused to even call the country “Northern Ireland”. As they argued among themselves, Stephen Nolan spoke for many listeners when he muttered, “This is pathetic.”The DUP have found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights (PA)It would be pessimistic to suggest that the show’s more colourful callers are representative of Northern Ireland as a whole, but it would be a blatant dismissal of the region’s political stalemate to suggest it is not. Just as the callers cannot agree, increasingly, Sinn Fein and the DUP can’t either.On 9 January last year, Martin McGuinness resigned his position as deputy first minister over a political scandal that implicated DUP leader Arlene Foster – although she denies any wrongdoing. Declaring it “the right time to call a halt to the DUP’s arrogance”, Northern Ireland’s mandatory power sharing coalition meant his resignation also removed Foster from her position as first minister, collapsing the assembly.His statement, an astonishing swansong delivered two months before his death, also laid out a litany of claims against the DUP. After 10 years of working together, McGuinness concluded that, “the equality, mutual respect and all-Ireland approaches enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement have never been fully embraced by the DUP.”Martin McGuinness resigned in protest against the handling of a botched energy scheme (Getty)This brought everything crashing down, and in the election which followed, both the DUP and Sinn Fein increased their popular vote, but one side had clearly benefited. Unionism lost its overall majority for the first time ever, and Sinn Fein were suddenly just a hair’s breadth behind their rivals.To their detriment, the DUP have also found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights and abortion reform. The general election of June 2017 brought this to the attention of the British mainstream after their confidence and supply agreement with Theresa May’s Conservatives. Talks to restore power sharing remain unresolved, with Sinn Fein requests for parity with the rest of the UK on language rights and marriage equality being rejected by the DUP. Arlene Foster has been criticised for saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland (Getty)Michelle Gildernew was part of the first Sinn Fein delegation ever received at Downing Street by Tony Blair in 1997 and is now a Westminster MP. She doesn’t feel her party is asking for anything more than what people are entitled to.“We’re looking at rights that people have across these islands,” she says, “whether that’s legacy rights, rights for LGBT citizens, for Irish, Scots, Welsh language speakers. There are rights for people everywhere across these islands, except for the six counties. I think that is a completely unacceptable situation. I’m raising three children here and I want them to have the same rights as their friends and neighbours, wherever they are.”Talk to the average person on the street in Northern Ireland and they’ll criticise politicians, for putting cultural issues and minority rights ahead of health, housing and education – budgets for which have all been squeezed during the impasse. But every election returns the same reality. People vote in huge numbers for the DUP and Sinn Fein to hold their corners.Former Irish taoiseach Bertie Ahern signed the Good Friday Agreement alongside Tony Blair, and maintains that bigger hurdles were overcome then. The restoration of power sharing, as ingrained in the Good Friday Agreement signed by Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern, is vital (PA)“I think everybody has to compromise,” he tells me. “If you cast your mind back 20 years ago we were dealing with the big issues of prisoners’ release, decommissioning, a new criminal justice system – they were major issues. Now I don’t want to trivialise the issues now and say they’re minor, but they’re certainly not at the magnitude of what we had to crack in 1998.”The fundamental problem is that while the war is over, unionists and republicans remain locked in a psychological battle for the very soul of Northern Ireland. Is its future still within the United Kingdom, or are we moving towards a united Ireland? While the Good Friday Agreement acknowledged that Northern Ireland would remain a part of the UK, it was also agreed that when a majority of people in the north and the south of Ireland wanted to reunify, a referendum could be held, and the result would be honoured. Republicans saw this as a starting gun for their goal of reunification, and while this angered some unionists, most seemed confident it wasn’t of immediate concern – something leaders within the DUP and the UUP have felt the need to reiterate in recent weeks, with diminishing certainty.Murals in Belfast serve as a reminder of Northern Ireland’s violent past (Getty)For most of the past two decades, the public discourse has maintained that republicans cannot hope to win over a majority for a united Ireland because most centre ground voters are too well off in the UK – including many nationalists who are quietly accepting of the situation. But now that seems about to change.If Brexit stunned the country, it shook Northern Ireland to its core, where 56 per cent of people voted to remain. The European Union served not just as a guarantor for the Good Friday Agreement, but accommodated a kind of harmonisation across Ireland that contented many nationalists. An invisible border allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united.Gildernew’s Fermanagh and South Tyrone constituency shares a great length of that border with four counties of the Irish Republic.“I cross it probably every day,” she says. “People cross it for work, for business, for school, for caring responsibilities, to visit family, even just to walk the dog. We’ve spent decades trying to remove the border, not just the physical infrastructure, but in people’s hearts and minds, and any changes to that will be resisted by the communities on either side of it.”The invisible border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united (Getty)Indeed, the prospect of a border returning has also mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand, with taoiseach Leo Varadkar claiming that “no Irish government will ever again leave Northern nationalists and Northern Ireland behind”.It’s increasingly clear that by campaigning for a patriotic cause they probably never believed would have consequences, the DUP shot unionism in the foot. Suddenly, Sinn Fein were handed a card to play which made a united Ireland a plausible, realistic and economically sensible option. It would be lazy to assume that the 56 per cent who voted remain would automatically want to remain within the EU by means of a united Ireland, but it has certainly made the option much more appealing. In the past two weeks, Sinn Fein vice president Michelle O’Neill has called for a unity referendum to be held within five years, while Arlene Foster was criticised after saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland. The DUP were asked to provide comment for this feature, but neglected to put anyone forward.Alex Kane is a former communications director for the UUP and believes there are strong arguments to be made for staying within the UK.“Even if there was a referendum, I’m not convinced unionism would lose it at this point,” he says. “But I think there are more challenges for unionists now than there have been in my lifetime. I think it’s an existential challenge for unionism.”Michelle O’Neill (left) wants a unity referendum to be held within five years (Getty)Kevin Meagher is the author of A United Ireland: Why Unification Is Inevitable and How It Will Come About. He believes it could happen by 2022, as a result of a demographic shift in nationalism’s favour, and quite possibly, Jeremy Corbyn in 10 Downing Street. He warns that the vote could be won despite the apparent polarisation of Northern Irish politics.“An agreed Ireland is not a precondition for a united Ireland,” he stresses, “and what I’ve been saying to British politicians is if you think you can kick the can down the road until everybody gets on and everything is forgotten, you’re not going to have that option. The reality is, by 2022 you could have an electoral majority who want a united Ireland, and you’re going to have to facilitate that.”The ultimate irony is that by so flagrantly risking the interests of Northern Ireland to carry out the will of Little Englanders, the Conservatives have put Irish reunification further up the agenda than Sinn Fein ever could have done alone. Unionists may see this as their worst nightmare, but Meagher – a former special adviser in the Northern Ireland Office – believes it wouldn’t bother the British government much at all.“If presented with a way out that was reasonable and effective for British ministers of either party, frankly they would have had to take an option of Irish unity 20, 30, 40 years ago. It’s been looming in British politics that this is the direction of travel.”Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland (Getty)As government predictions show the GDP of Northern Ireland would be reduced by 12 per cent under a no deal Brexit, economic safety within the UK is no longer a certainty. The Irish economy, on the other hand, is growing three times faster than any other European country. The question now shifts from whether people want to risk their livelihood by joining a united Ireland, to whether people can actually afford to stay in the UK.As it currently stands, Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland, which is pleasing nationalists, republicans, the Irish government and the EU. She is also promising no border down the Irish Sea, to keep the DUP happy. And yet, she is carrying out the will of a British majority, whose primary concern in voting for Brexit was immigration Loughs, Brexit and fishermen in Northern IrelandLoughs, Brexit and fishermen in Northern IrelandEnda Craig, a member of the Loughs Agency Advisory Forum, holds a map of Lough Foyle in Moville, IrelandOyster farmer William Lynch puts on his wellington boots on his oyster farm on Lough Foyle in Culmore, Northern IrelandWomen walk along the shores of Carlingford Lough with Northern Ireland seen across the lough in CarlingfordA poster hanging on a wall of a house reads: No to the ferry, referring to a proposed new car ferry that would run from Northern Ireland to the Republic of Ireland through Carlingford Lough in GreencastleSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick (L) and boat owner Brian Cunningham navigate out of Warrenpoint harbour into Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandA woman with flowers walks past an old fuel station in Carlingford, IrelandA boat is seen at sunset on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandA mandries off after swimming in Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandA derelict house is seen on the shore of Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick dredges mussels from Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandBagged-up farmed oysters at a cleaning facility to get them ready for overseas shipping in Moville, IrelandA man walks his dog in matching hi-vis outfits on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandCarlingford Lough and in the distance Northern Ireland are seen at sunset from Omeath, IrelandA sign that reads: \u0027In 1771 nothing happened here\u0027 is seen on the shores of Carlingford Lough in Carlingford, Ireland. Will they really stand for the kind of soft or non-existent border the prime minister is promising Ireland? Someone, somewhere down the line, is going to be betrayed.Deputy leader of the SDLP Nichola Mallon says it’s now time for May to deliver solutions of substance, not just empty rhetoric.“This for us is not an orange and green issue, it’s not about the constitutional question on the island, this is about ensuring we have the best deal for people across the island, and we believe this is best served by Northern Ireland remaining in the customs union and the single market,” she says.The prospect of a hard border returning has mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand (AFPGetty)So Northern Ireland is waiting for a solution on the border, but also for a political landscape that works for everybody. Surely, after two decades, that isn’t too much to ask?“I thought within 20 years, something is bound to be different other than the fact we’re not shooting each other,” Alex Kane says, “and that’s good, but it’s not enough. Not killing each other is normal, but also normal is parties making decisions, going into government together, having choices. We don’t seem any closer to that.”I\u0027m ashamed of the state of the world, says PopeClinton says Good Friday Agreement anniversary is an chance for peaceThreat of \u0027serious trouble\u0027 in Northern IrelandBut the restoration of power sharing, as ingrained in the Good Friday Agreement, is a must. It may require unpalatable concessions from both sides, but a Stormont assembly is essential, whether you want to remain in a UK of devolved governments, or – as Bertie Ahern points out – if you are aiming for that referendum on Irish unity.“You have to have stable institutions and sustainable development going forward before you do that,” he believes. “The clause to have referendums is part of the Good Friday Agreement, so it doesn’t seem logical in my view to be talking about a referendum when you don’t even have the agreement fully in place.”The evidence suggests that the winds of change are blowing in favour of Northern Ireland’s nationalists, but the hard work of honouring the Good Friday Agreement is crucial to achieving a new Ireland of equals for all.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The UK is also a top destination for wealthy Russians to spend their money on art collections, expensive cars and private schools for their children. In return, the UK often grants them visas and, in some cases, citizenship“We are going after the money,” Boris Johnson promised after being questioned on the absence of specific measures to impose sanctions and financial penalties on the UK assets of Russian oligarchs closely aligned to President Putin. But when pressed by MPs on why decisive action was not being taken, the foreign secretary replied: “This is not a country where we in the government can say ‘Oi! We think this so-and-so deserves to have his or her collar felt’. This is not how it works.” While Theresa May may yet impose sanctions against Putin-supporting billionaires in response to the attempted murder of the Russian spy Sergei Skripal, her government’s track record has been marred by procrastination and prevarication.   Privately, the prime minister regards the exploitation of London as a haven for dirty Russian money as a serious problem. She once listened in stunned silence as a senior MI6 officer briefed her on the activities of Russian organised crime and certain oligarchs in the UK. And in 2016 she authorised the National Security Council to review why and how wealthy Russians buy property in London. But she has been nervous about taking action. For the past three years she has dithered on implementing a legally-enforceable register that will force all foreign companies that own UK property to disclose the identity of their owners.Russia claims Skripals poisoned using toxin possessed by UK and USRussia has been spying on the Skripals for at least five years- UKRussia stock market crashes after US imposes sanctions on oligarchsFreezing property assets is the key to inflicting pain on the Russian state and its compliant plutocrats. Since 2004, £190m of UK property has been subject to criminal investigation as suspected proceeds of corruption. The London property market has been skewed by laundered money, as The Independent revealed exclusively in 2014. Prices are being artificially driven up by wealthy, influential, foreign men who want to hide their assets in the UK.Multi-million pound payments are accepted without their origin being questioned. Oligarchs hide ownership behind anonymous shell companies registered in secretive jurisdictions while a London address offers a veneer of legitimacy and prestige that helps launder reputations as well as cash. Transparency International estimates that Russians account for £729m of the £4.4bn acquired in UK property via what it regards as “suspicious wealth”.There is no suggestion that all London property bought by Russian oligarchs is derived from illegal or criminal sources. For some Russian plutocrats buying luxury property in London is a symbol that they have been accepted by the British establishment. This is illustrated by the eleven bedroom Regency house on Belgrave Square that Oleg Deripaska, regarded as one of Putin’s favourite oligarchs, snapped up for £17m through an offshore company registered in the British Virgin Islands in 2003 and now worth £45m.Oleg Deripaska’s 11-bedroom Regency house on Belgrave Square is seen as a symbol of acceptance by the British establishment (Alamy)Built in the 1820s, it was formerly the home of Sir Henry “Chips” Channon, society host, Conservative MP and notoriously indiscreet diarist. It was designed for entertaining royalty and diplomats with its grand staircase, Madame Récamier sofas and flamboyant decor. When Harold Nicolson arrived at the house for dinner, he exclaimed: “Oh my God, how rich and powerful Lord Channon has become.” The equally grand and historic mansion Beechwood House, set in 11 acres of land in Highgate, north London, was bought by the powerful oligarch Alisher Usmanov in 2008 for £48m from the Emir of Qatar. Usmanov is a major shareholder in Arsenal football club and has amassed a £14bn fortune from metals and commodities and has long been regarded as a pro-Putin figure. And his fellow football-loving oligarch Roman Abramovich owns houses on Kensington Palace Gardens and Chester Square, Belgravia, and apartments on Eaton Square and Manresa Road, Chelsea.  One Hyde Park, one of the wealthiest residencies in the world, was famously bought up by Russian oligarchs (Alamy)It is not just prestigious houses that attract Russian billionaires. The UK is also a top destination for wealthy Russians to spend their money on art collections, expensive cars and private schools for their children. In return for their cash, the UK often grants them visas and, in some cases, citizenship.  Since 2008 iniduals have been able to obtain “golden visas” if they invest as little as £2m in a UK business. And for £5m, they gain the right to become a UK resident on a temporary basis and then, after five years, a British citizen. By 2014, almost 700 rich Russians had paid for entry using this method, with Roman Rotenberg, son of Putin’s former judo partner Boris Rotenberg, being the most prominent example. He owns a mews house on Cadogan Lane in Belgravia.The government is taking some action to stop London becoming what David Cameron described as a haven to hide “dodgy foreign cash”. The National Crime Agency (NCA) is investigating a list of wealthy iniduals, not just oligarchs, to assess if they have used the UK to launder their fortunes.An estimated 149 iniduals are restricted on their travel and ability to conduct business in the UK. And the Unexplained Wealth Orders is now law, whereby the NCA can demand that the oligarch explain the origin of his wealth. But the problem with this order, according to a Russian businessman, is that the inidual in question could too easily lie about his source of wealth and instead produce a document that shows his fortune was based on, for example, share idends. Roman Rotenberg gained entry to the UK using the ‘golden visas’ method (Getty)Boris Johnson protests that the government cannot act directly against the pro-Putin brigade because it cannot interfere in criminal investigations. But it could make specific changes to the law, notably an amendment to the Sanctions and Money Laundering Bill, which would give Magnitsky-type powers to freeze the UK assets of relevant iniduals, including intelligence agents or other officials who have abused human rights.  The government could also implement the register of inidual owners of foreign and offshore companies that own UK property. But that bill has been delayed until 2021 and campaigners smell a cover-up after the government announced that one reason for the delay is that the Business Department has commissioned research on the impact of the register on investment decisions. “This is a crucial moment for the UK’s future trading relationship with the rest of the world, and we must proceed with as good an understanding as possible of the potential impacts on legitimate inward investment,” said foreign office minister Lord Ahmad. Skripal attack aftermath – in picturesSkripal attack aftermath – in picturesInvestigators in protective clothing remove a van from an address in Winterslow near Salisbury in Wiltshire, as police and members of the armed forces continue to investigate the suspected nerve agent attack on Russian double agent Sergei SkripaA police officer on duty near the protective tent which covers the bench where a man and woman were apparently poisoned with what was later identified as a nerve agent, in SalisburyMilitary in protective clothing prior to removing vehicles from a car park in SalisburyPersonnel in protective coveralls and breathing equipment cover an ambulance with a tarpaulin at the Salisbury District HospitalHome Secretary Amber Rudd visits the scene of the nerve agent attack in SalibsuryMembers of the emergency services in hazard suits fix the tent over the bench where Sergei and Yulia Skripal were foundOfficials in protective suits check their equipment before repositioning a forensics tent A poice officer stands guard outside a branch of the Italian chain restaurant ZizziDetective Sergeant Nick Bailey, who assisted the Russian ex-spy targeted with a nerve agent, was also hospitalisedSergei Skripal days before he was exposed to a mystery substance that has left him fighting for lifeSergei Skripal speaks to his lawyer from behind bars seen on a screen of a monitor outside a courtroom in Moscow.Yulia Skripal, who is thought to have been poisoned along with her father, Sergei SkripalProgress to legislation has thus been painfully slow. An insight into why political rhetoric has not resulted in legislative action can be gleaned by the recent flotation on the London stock exchange of the Russian energy company En+, then owned by Deripaska and chaired by former Conservative energy minister Lord Barker. For it revealed a fundamental dispute between MI6 and the financial regulators on how to make oligarchs who park their assets in London more accountable and transparent.MI6 and the prime minister’s national security advisor, Sir Mark Sedwill, were furious with the Stock Exchange and Financial Conduct Authority for failing to consult them and conduct the required due diligence of En+. Their main concern was about whether Rusal, a subsidiary of En+, had been manufacturing aluminium powder used by Russian arms firms for military purposes. Rusal adamantly denied it – yet its own website previously indicated that the defence industry was among the users of the type of aluminium powder it manufactured.Sir Mark Sedwill was furious when the required due diligence of En+ was not carried out ahead of its flotation on the London stock exchange (Getty)The En+ group could be a candidate for new sanctions as the Russian state-owned VTB Bank is a major shareholder with a 4.35 per cent holding, while Deripaska is known for being close to the Russian President. Leaked US diplomatic cables described Deripaska as “among the two to three oligarchs Putin turns to on a regular basis” and is “a more-or-less permanent fixture on Putin’s trips abroad”.Indeed, when the US imposed sanctions on seven oligarchs and the 12 companies they own or control last week, shares tumbled. Deripaska was among those affected, as was Rotenberg.  Still, Britiain cannot follow suit. And the anger of National Security officials and MI6 En+\u0027s flotation last year stemmed precisely from their belief that it typified the complacent approach to Russian money in London, which the infamous oligarch Boris Berezovsky once told me was “70 per cent dirty”. The inability to impose sanctions is similarly emblematic.The London Stock Exchange has long been a vehicle for Russian companies and oligarchs to raise money in shares and bonds – an estimated $200bn (£140bn) since 2004. Last summer, Russia’s largest gold producer Polyus, controlled by Suleyman Kerimov, a Russian senator awarded the Order of Merit by Putin, raised $879m. There are now 57 predominantly-Russian companies listed on the London Stock Exchange, more than anywhere else outside Moscow.   The wealthiest Russian oligarchs who call London homeA little-noticed loophole to avoid sanctions is that Russian sovereign debt is permitted to be sold in London. “We are allowing Russian sovereign debt to be sold in the UK and that debt is being used to reimburse Russians to bring back their money onshore in Moscow terms,” said the Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. “As that gold is moving towards Moscow, we are quite extraordinarily enabling those bond and debt auctions...This is one of those areas where sanctions on businesses are being compensated by the Russian state.”Just hours after Theresa May’s retaliation against the poisoning of Sergei Skripal, Gazprom issued a $750m eurobond in London and the following day the Russian government joined in by issuing a $4bn bond in the capital. Within hours, the Russian Embassy issued a revealing tweet: “Business as usual?”Could the nerve-agent attack in Salisbury be the unwitting catalyst for finally cleaning up dirty Russian money in London? (Getty)But the irony is that it is the attempted assassination of a Russian spy and double agent living in Salisbury and the murder of Russian businessman Nikolai Glushkov in Surrey that could be the unwitting catalysts for finally cleaning up dirty Russian money in London.Mark Hollingsworth is the author of “Londongrad – From Russia with Cash’’ or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Colin Drury delves into the inside story of the battle to save 20,000 trees being felled in a single cityJenny Hockey still shivers when she remembers the moment, almost 18 months ago, she was woken by police hammering at her door. It was 5am. When she looked outside, she momentarily wondered if a terror incident was unfolding.“It was that kind of scene,” the 71-year-old says. “Multiple cars, officers swarming everywhere, flashing lights. We had no idea what was happening.”It was 17 November 2016 and, under the cover of darkness, officers from South Yorkshire Police had descended on Sheffield’s Rustlings Road, one of the city’s most sought-after addresses. Cordoning off the street and banging on doors, they ordered residents to get dressed and move their vehicles or have them towed away. Within the hour, Hockey, a retired sociology professor, would become one of three neighbours arrested and locked up for eight hours.227-year-old tree planted by George Washington pulled down by windBut this dramatic pre-dawn raid – described by Nick Clegg, then the local MP, as like something “you’d expect in Putin’s Russia” – was not carried out in search of terrorists or criminals.Rather, it was in support of council contractors hired to chop down eight street trees, which residents had spent more than a year petitioning to save.Amid the confusion, Hockey and two others – including another woman in her seventies – attempted to stand under one of these century-old limes, only to be detained. All charges were later dropped.“We wanted to protect something we loved,” she says. “And our right to do that – our democratic right – was taken away, really, by state force. It was so horrible and disempowering.”Indeed, by the time the trio were freed, the trees which had always overlooked their homes were no more.Contractors cut down the final tree in Rustlings Road (PA)Yet a bigger battle was just beginning: one which has since spread across the city, seen mass protests and riot police on suburban streets, and ultimately revealed an astonishing secret plan – hidden within a £2.2bn PFI contract – to cut down almost 20,000 street trees…Sheffield has long boasted of being Europe’s greenest city – in part because a third of it sits in the Peak District. But it is also due to the sheer number of trees that line the roads. Some 36,000 of them arch over highways and footpaths.But around 2015, talk of what the Woodland Trust called a “tree massacre” started to emerge.Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a highways improvement scheme  (PA)The eight limes in Rustlings Road were not the only ones marked for the chainsaw. Under then-redacted clauses in a £2.2bn contract, Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a vast highways improvement scheme being undertaken by the infrastructure giant Amey.Company and council both said – and still say – such felling was necessary. Targeted trees, they argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing irreparable damage to roads and footpaths. Every one taken down, they added, was being substituted with a younger sapling: “We assess every single tree and only replace them as a last resort,” says Darren Butt, account director with Amey, today.Targeted trees, the council argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing damage to roads and footpathsYet, as this felling increased, questions started to be asked. There was shock when two cherries commemorating Second World War heroes disappeared one day. At Christmas, a row decorated with charity festive lights were hacked back – with fellers cutting through wires and all.A feeling spread that perfectly healthy and safe trees were being chopped unnecessarily. A suspicion grew that the policy was actually about increasing Amey’s profit margins. Over the length of the company’s 25-year highway maintenance obligations, so ran the theory, a newly planted sapling is far cheaper to look after than older, larger arboreta.“People were going to work in the morning and coming home to entirely different-looking streets,” says Paul Selby, a city resident and leading member of Sheffield Tree Action Groups, known as Stag. “It was ecological destruction carried out, in secret, by a multinational company with the explicit support of the local authority and the police.“And people were angry. These trees were part of their lives and they didn’t want them taking. These weren’t anarchists or hardline activists from other towns. They’re Sheffielders furious they hadn’t been given a voice in what was happening in their streets. So they came out and fought to be heard.”Almost 6,000 trees have been chopped down. But in the face of overwhelming and increasingly nationalised pressure, a pause on felling was announced last week.Sheffield City Council has put this down to the “dangerous tactics” of protestors. Yet the support in favour of Stag – both within the city and from names including Jeremy Corbyn, Michael Gove, Ken Loach and Jarvis Cocker – probably had something to do with it too.Hopes are now high the whole policy can be reconsidered. “We don’t take anything for granted,” says Selby, a civil servant with the Department for Work and Pensions. “But, after so long fighting, surely dialogue is now the sensible way forward.”Tensions rose, with fellers and protestors accusing each other of intimidationCertainly, it has been a troubled road to here: the irony perhaps being that this all started with a real city victory.In 2012 the government handed Sheffield £1.2bn to improve its roads, an economic godsend for a place locals had taken to calling Pothole City. Amey – a subsidiary of the Spanish company Ferrovial – won the work contract, promising to upgrade and maintain every highway, pavement, bridge, subway and street light for 25 years.“This is work that is good for everyone living here,” says Paul Billington, director of culture and environment with the city council. “It is already bringing investment and opportunities back into the city because it is making our infrastructure world-class.”Replacing damaging or dying trees, he argues, is key to that success continuing. Doing it now, he adds, is important because, as a 2007 survey showed, a large majority of trees are so old that to delay action would store problems for future generations.At a picket last month, a specialist police protest removal unit turned up, the first time it had ever been deployed on South Yorkshire’s streets“No one disagrees that dying or damaging trees should be looked at – if they really do fall into those categories,” says Alison Teal, a Green Party councillor in the city. “But this went beyond that. We still didn’t know how many were due to come down but everywhere you looked, these magnificent trees were disappearing.”Demonstrations were civil enough to start with. People at home would spot Amey vans and go out to stand under targeted trees so they couldn’t be axed. Others started taking the bus to work, leaving their cars blocking access to endangered arboreta.Cups of tea were offered while people stood about. They debated the merits of the trees: their beauty, the environmental benefits, the wildlife. Occasionally, they talked about their favourite. An endangered elm in the Nether Edge area ended up being shortlisted for the 2016 England Tree Of The Year Award.Yet things hardened after the Rustlings Road raid (“In hindsight, it was poorly handled,” says Darren Butt). While many still supported the replacement scheme, opinion started to harden in favour of the so-called tree-huggers. Stag membership doubled within the month.“At that point people were really realising this isn’t just about trees, it’s about democracy and our right to a say on what happens in our streets,” says Teal, a psychologist by trade.Demonstrations became feistier. Stumps of trees already cut were painted blood red as a mark of anger. Stag supporters – now numbering in their thousands – took to organising daily spotter patrols and flying pickets.“When someone saw an Amey van near an endangered tree, they put a message in a WhatsApp group or online, and whoever was available would go and protect that tree,” says Teal.UK news in picturesUK news in picturesPrime Minister Theresa May hosts a meeting with leaders and representatives of Caribbean countries, at 10 Downing Street on the sidelines of the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting.Aneira Thomas, the first baby to be born on the NHS, addresses the Unison Health Conference at the Brighton CentreSir Patrick Stewart addresses the crowd during the People\u0027s Vote campaign launch on Brexit at the Electric Ballroom in Camden Town.

None were ever charged. At another picket last month, a specialist police protest removal unit turned up. It was the first time it had ever been deployed on South Yorkshire’s streets.Arrest numbers grew – yet there were vaguely comedic elements to many. A 57-year-old woman was detained after blowing a pink trumpet, while a retired couple – Dr John and Sue Unwin – found themselves being questioned by CID officers (and later cleared) about the suspected poisoning of a cup of tea they gave a feller.“It sounds like the plot from an Agatha Christie novel,” Dr Unwin told the Daily Mail.One 73-year-old was detained for intimidation. Alan Simpson, a retired firefighter and great-grandfather, says: “I’ve never been in trouble in my life and was there with my wife. I don’t think I could have cut a less intimidating figure if I tried.” His charge, too, has been dropped.“If it wasn’t so serious,” says James Whitworth, cartoonist on local newspaper The Star, “it would be farcical, and I mean that literally: there is enough material here to make an actual farce.“As a cartoonist, it’s a dream because the whole thing is so ridiculous. You think you can’t possibly say anymore on the issue – and then they arrest a woman for blowing a plastic trumpet. But as a city resident: I’m pretty neutral but, really, maybe leave our trees alone?”Local newspaper cartoonist James Whitworth’s take on the Sheffield tree massacre (James Whitworth)As news of the ongoing demonstrations spread, meanwhile, concern grew it was damaging the city’s reputation. When Sheffield was left off The Sunday Times Best Places to Live list this year, authorities blamed the campaigners: “it is regrettable the increasingly extreme actions of a small number of protestors is having this impact,” a council spokesperson declared.Demonstrators themselves were not above ridiculous assertions either: at a packed council meeting, one compared Amey’s workers to Nazi guards, just doing their jobs.Lavender and tea tree oils could be giving boys breasts, study warnsChina reassigns 60,000 troops to plant trees in bid to fight pollutionHow the Japanese fought suicide in the ‘Sea of Trees’For now, however, the potential turning point arguably came in March when a freedom of information request, asked by Paul Selby, forced the council to reveal it had indeed asked for 17,500 trees to be chopped down. The figure was so astonishing all three city MPs – all Labour – called for a rethink.In a disastrous interview on local radio, council cabinet member for environment Bryan Lodge – who declined to be interviewed for this piece – denied the figure was a target but could not explain what it actually was. Days later the suspension of felling was announced.What happens next is the question the city is asking itself.“We’ve already lost 6,000 trees,” says Selby. “Of course, there are some that should come down if they really are dying or doing irreversible damage to footpaths. But all other solutions should be sought first. Trees are a sign of a civilised city. We should be doing everything we can to save them.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Sterling’s surge, which pulled the FTSE 100 down three points at the open has been attributed to optimism ahead of wages and unemployment data, released on Tuesday morning, weakness in the dollar, and reduced concerns around the possibility of a hard Brexit as the UK and EU get ready for the next round of negotiations.  Sterling rises as Mark Carney signals hawkish stance on ratesTraders pushed the pound up in anticipation of Tuesday’s data, with expectations that the numbers would lend support to a spring rate rise by the Bank of England.The figures from the Office for National Statistics showed wages were up 2.8 per cent in the three months to February, compared to the same time last year, which was higher than the rate of inflation in the same period. However, traders were expecting earnings growth to hit 3 per cent, and sterling pared its gains following the release of the data, falling back to $1.434, and dropping 0.09 per cent against the euro to €1.1572.Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said that while the pound “saw its momentum stall... a disappointing wage growth reading wasn’t enough to properly knock the currency from its recent peak”.“Though clearly a tad disappointed by the fact the wage growth reading missed expectations, falling 0.2 per cent against the dollar and 0.1 per cent against the euro, this still leaves sterling at two and a half and 11 month highs against the greenback and the single currency respectively,” he addedor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Now I’m being told I’m not British, because there is no record of me’.“Because it was no longer possible to search in the archive of landing cards, people would be sent a standard letter that would state: ‘We have searched our records, we can find no trace of you in our files.’”The Home Office acknowledged that the cards were discarded, but insisted it was done to comply with data protection laws, which required that such records were “not kept for longer than is necessary”.A spokeswoman also said they “did not provide any reliable evidence relating to ongoing residence in the UK or their immigration status”.“It would be misleading and inaccurate to suggest that registration slips would therefore have a bearing on immigration cases whereby Commonwealth citizens are proving residency in the UK,” she added.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

On average, people are still taking home less than they did before the crisis,” said Stephen Clarke of the Resolution Foundation think tank.The wages data was also weaker than the 3 per cent growth that many City of London analysts had anticipated, sending sterling down to $1.4325, as some traders pulled back their bets slightly on a May interest rate hike from the Bank of England.Meanwhile, the unemployment rate for the three months to February ticked down to 4.2 per cent, from 4.3 per cent previously. City analysts had expected it to be unchanged.The employment rate rose to a new record high of 75.4 per cent.According to the ONS the number of people in jobs rose by 55,000 over the period, while the numbers out of work fell by 16,000.The work and pensions secretary Esther McVey heralded the figures as evidence of the continuing strength of the UK jobs market.“Day by day we are helping people turn their lives around by getting them into employment. Jobs are key to transforming lives and work is the best route out of poverty,” she said.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

They said if Florida were a separate country, it would be the world’s 26th largest carbon polluter.“The Sunshine State gets less than one per cent of its energy from solar power,” said Oscar Psychas, 20, from Gainesville, the oldest of the plaintiffs.Speaking at a press conference in the state’s capital, Tallahassee, he added: “Last spring I walked to 280 miles from my home in Gainesville to Tallahassee to demand our state’s leaders protect our wild places. During my walk I saw climate change firsthand during the hottest spring ever recorded in Florida and forests dying from sea level rise along the Gulf Coast. “I’m back in Tallahassee today because I’ve seen that when our leaders destroy a stable climate, everything we care about — our wild places, our communities, our basic rights to life, liberty, and property – is endangered.”Security of supply, jobs and climate change: Jacinda Ahern lays out why she is banning further oil exploration in New ZealandGuy Burns, who is serving as lead counsel for the young plaintiffs said that Florida had an amazing opportunity to make use of its renewable energy sources, that included solar, wave and wind. Instead, he claimed the state government had promoted the use of fossil fuels. “It is the responsibility of the state to uphold the constitution, and these young people have a fundamental right to a stable climate system,” he said.The civil lawsuit is not seeking financial damages. Rather, it wants the court to order a science-based climate recovery plan and for the state government to acknowledge climate change is real and that climate change impacts are harming the youth plaintiffs. World news in picturesWorld news in picturesEuropean lawmakers raise placards reading Stop the War in Syria in protest against airstrikes launched by the US, Britain and France in Syria last week criticizing the legitimacy of the operation, as French President Emmanuel Macron delivers his speech at the European Parliament in Strasbourg.
