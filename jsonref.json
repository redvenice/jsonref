I like that she\u0027s still given such a classic look a contemporary twist, by wearing the bun to the side, rather than in the middle\u0027\u0027Going back to the bun is a step away from the more casual low ponytail she sported yesterday, but as that was more of a private family occasion, perhaps she felt comfortable enough to try something new – today is a day for a tried-and-trusted look that she knows will photograph well.\u0027Meghan is known for wearing her hair in a looser and more relaxed style, but her hair today is much sleeker and more elegant, with a very tight ballerina-style knot in place of her usual messy bun.\u0027 Jason added: \u0027It\u0027s a sophisticated update on the look, ideal for such a formal occasion. I like that she\u0027s still given such a classic look a contemporary twist, by wearing the bun to the side, rather than in the middle of her head.\u0027This look also shows the neckline of her dress beautifully she clearly likes the combination of a bateau neckline, a fascinator and an up \u0027do. All three works together beautifully and it\u0027s a combination that looks fantastic, so I think it\u0027s safe to say this won\u0027t be the last time we see this look on Meghan.\u0027             The Duchess of Sussex was all smiles as she arrived at the event. To mark the RAF\u0027s centenary year, special events, activities and other initiatives at local, regional and national levels will run from April to the end of September 2018This year marks the centenary of the  Royal Air Force – the world\u0027s first independent air force – which was founded on 1 April 1918, independent of the British Army and Royal Navy.For one hundred years the RAF has defended the skies of Britain, preventing conflicts, delivering aid and combating cyber threats while working in partnership with other services.These include Operation Ruman – the UK\u0027s humanitarian assistance operation in the aftermath of hurricane Irma which hit the Caribbean in September 2017 – and the RAF\u0027s Quick Reaction Alert Typhoon Aircraft, providing a UK air defence capability 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.Today, the RAF is engaged on some 13 missions across 26 countries and is heavily committed on operations both at home and abroad.             The royals spent time speaking to RAF officials and members of the clergy before taking their seats in the church.

They also lack a dot in the centre of their spots, which is the mark of a jaguar.           The leopard is lazing in the branches of this tree, which is one of the animal\u0027s favoured hang-outs, as it keeps it out of the way of much larger predators that patrol the ground below          Even standing up in the tree, the leopard is hard to see (centre). The cats will often drag their prey into trees to stop it being stolen by lions and other large predators          Leopards are relatively common across Kenya but particular concentrations can be found inside the Maasai Mara and Samburu National ReservesIt is unlikely that the two species would be confused in the wild, however, as they do not share a habitat.Leopards live mostly across southern parts of Africa and in scattered communities across Asia, Pakistan and Malaysia, while jaguars live in the Americas.Leopards can be spotted across Kenya but there are particular concentrations in the Maasai Mara and Samburu National Reserves.As with many of Africa\u0027s largest predators, their numbers increase dramatically around wildebeest migration season as they follow the herd, hoping to pick off stragglers.Igor Gerlach has been a photographer since 1974 and began taking pictures of wildlife in 1976.

Shepard, none of which had been seen for almost 50 years.The famous illustration maps the magical world of Winnie-the-Pooh and captures the unique personalities of A.A. Milne\u0027s much-loved characters.Eeyore is depicted with his head hanging sluggishly in the grass, while the energetic Roo bounces towards the \u0027sandy pit\u0027 where he plays.

Meghan unveils a twist on her go-to style as she arrives in Ireland with a side bun and centre partingBy SIOFRA BRENNAN FOR MAILONLINE She\u0027s recently abandoned her beloved messy bun in favour of a more sleek and formal updo, and today the Duchess of Sussex debuted a new twist on the look.Stepping off the place in Dublin for her first official overseas visit with Harry, Meghan showed off a neat side bun with a side parting.It was a departure from the more severe style she\u0027s worn on several occasions, with hair swept to the back of her head with her hair parted down the middle.  The Duchess wore her hair in a neat updo with a side parting, lending a less severe look to the formal style. She wore her hair in swept back bun with a centre parting to a reception at Marlborough House in London last week Celebrity hairdresser James Johnson told Femail: \u0027The changing of a parting can alter your whole style, instantly.\u0027By keeping the side bun low and opposite, she\u0027s kept the symmetry in her look. This helps keep the over-style elegant, yet with a slight twist, making the hair a focal point.\u0027By keeping the hair balanced Meghans created a formal, more structured style, ideal for any royal appearance.\u0027Switching up the parting can create more dimension for any look, perfect for a plain outfit like Meghan has on here, giving the whole look more personality.   She ditched the messy bun she used to favour, seen here on a visit to Northern Ireland in March (left). But Meghan did mix things up today with a side parting and side bun The Duchess also showed off her prowess at literal dressing, wearing a top and pencil skirt by Givenchy in forest green, in a nod to the colour closely associated with the Emerald Isle.And she carried a £475 tan tote bag by Strathberry, the small Scottish brand whose designs Meghan has previously caused to sell out.This engagement is likely to be of particular interest to the Duchess, who has been outspoken on the topic of female empowerment.It\u0027s been a busy time for the newlyweds who kicked off the week by attending Prince Louis\u0027 christening at St James\u0027s Palace on Monday.Earlier today, they joined fellow members of the royal family for service to mark 100 years of the RAF at Westminster Abbey, followed by a flypast at Buckingham Palace.  Finding her royal feet! Meghan puts on a confident display on the Buckingham Palace balcony one month after her nervous debut at Trooping the ColourShe\u0027s less than two months into her role as the Duchess of Sussex, but today Meghan Markle proved she\u0027s finding her feet during celebrations for the RAF Centenary.The former Suits star looked poised and confident as she joined the royal family on the balcony at Buckingham Palace for the flypast, which saw the largest concentration of military aircraft in recent memory form in the skies above London to commemorate the milestone.The Queen, 92, looked up in wonder at the aeronautical display, which celebrated the history of the RAF and featured the return of Second World War aircraft including the Spitfires and Lancaster bombers, and followed a service of thanksgiving at Westminster Abbey earlier today.

Attorney General Geoffrey CoxYesterday, it was revealed that the Ministry of Justice has already been handed £17million to prepare for a no-deal Brexit.Justice Minister Lucy Frazer revealed that the Treasury had freed up the funds to ensure the MoJ ‘are ready for’ a no deal.The revelation came after a question in the Commons from Tory backbencher William Wragg.Justice Secretary David Gauke yesterday said that leaving the EU without a deal was ‘not an attractive proposition’.But, with time running out ahead of the UK’s departure next year, Mr Gauke said ministers had a duty to accelerate preparations. ‘It is absolutely right that we prepare for no deal,’ he said.Merkel praises May\u0027s \u0027progress\u0027 on Brexit and EU negotiator...May\u0027s fightback reshuffle: Millionaire lawyer who forgot to...Share this article‘We cannot rule out that that is where we will end up for one reason or another.’Mrs May warned MPs on Monday there was a ‘serious risk’ of Britain leaving without a deal if the EU rejects her latest compromise proposals.She added: ‘A responsible Government must prepare for a range of potential outcomes, including the possibility of no deal, and given the short period remaining before the conclusion of negotiations, the Cabinet agreed on Friday that these preparations should be stepped up.‘But at the same, we should recognise that such a disorderly no deal would have profound consequences for both the UK and the EU, and I believe that the UK deserves better.’Privately, Whitehall insiders believe Mrs May will be unable to go much further in offering concessions to the EU.          New Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, pictured, told his first meeting of the Cabinet that accelerating contingency plans would be one of his first priorities in the new jobOne said: ‘If the EU won’t agree then we have got a very serious problem with the negotiations at that point.’EU leaders have so far given a muted reaction to Mrs May’s Chequers deal, saying they want to hear more detail before passing judgment. But the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier yesterday suggested he was sceptical about Mrs May’s idea of the UK retaining full access to the single market without signing up to all the rules.Speaking at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, Mr Barnier repeated that the single market and the four freedoms – goods, capital, services and labour – were the ‘the fundamental principles on which the EU is based’ and would be defended.Mr Barnier said 80 per cent of the issues surrounding the UK’s exit had now been resolved.But asked if he was worried other countries might follow Britain’s lead, Mr Barnier said: ‘Once again, I regret profoundly this vote of the UK, we respect it and we implement it.‘But it’s day after day more clear... I can tell you that it will be clear, clear, crystal clear at the end of this negotiation, that the best situation with the best relation with the EU, will remain to be a member of the EU.’Mr Barnier later said Brexit would be ‘costly and unpleasant’ for the UK. He warned the cost of Brexit would be ‘substantially higher for the UK than the EU’.He said that the EU would not accept Mrs May’s proposal for an exception for the financial industry from EU rules. He added: ‘It would go against all our objectives... I don’t know any country in the world that would accept such a loss of sovereignty.’He then half joked: ‘I have no personal experience of orce, it’s always costly and unpleasant’.Angela Merkel yesterday offered Theresa May a slender Brexit lifeline, saying the Chequers proposals would be viewed ‘in the spirit of friendship’.The German Chancellor also did not outright dismiss Mrs May’s idea of the UK retaining full access to the single market without accepting free movement. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/10/22/4E19D84000000578-0-image-m-25_1531257019411.jpg","title":"Where Harry Kanes school cup winners Former classmates watch Englands Captain","story":"    His former teammates admit that as they grew older their priorities switched to job hunting and socialisingEven then, the 15-year-olds were often referred to as the ‘Harry Kane team’ and the players were under instructions to pass the ball to him if in trouble. His former teammates admit that as they grew older their priorities switched to job hunting and socialising. Kane, they said, shunned alcohol and was single-minded in his determination to become a professional footballer.One schoolfriend, Jack Coker, is at least a goalkeeper with semi-pro West Essex in the Essex Senior League but he earns his living as a PE teacher.Dean Ercan, a scaffolder from Chingford, played football with Kane from the age of eight.Share this article    Harry Kane of England national team plays with toy rooster during an England training session ahead of the 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia Semi-Final match against Croatia, on July 10English teacher Denis McElligott was coach of the school team and said Kane was always determined to make the most of his talent.‘He was a little bit stocky but then you would see him after a game out running, losing weight and working on his fitness,’ he said in a previous interview.‘Kids from other schools started to know who he was and know his name.

Mr Hancock’s support for the Babylon Health app may put him on an immediate collision course with the British Medical Association and the Royal College of GPs.Brexit is now a guerrilla war: Two more senior Tories quit...Share this articleLast November, Babylon Health took over a NHS GP practice in Fulham, West London, and offered patients free virtual consultations on their smartphones as well as face-to-face appointment. The firm has encouraged patients in the nearby area to de-register with their own surgery and join the new practice and 20,000 patients signed up in the first six months.But the BMA and the RCGP have accused Babylon of ‘cherry-picking’ the younger, easy-to-treat patients and leaving surgeries with the older, complex patients.          But GP leaders are very concerned about virtual consultations and fear they will miss serious, less obvious symptoms that doctors pick up through their gut instinctsSurgeries – including the one run by Babylon – are paid an average of £150 by the NHS for every patient on their books, so practices whose patients are moving to Babylon stand to lose substantial amounts of money. Last night it emerged that former culture secretary Mr Hancock, who was made Health Secretary in Monday’s mini-reshuffle, received a £5,000 in March 2015 from a donor who is the director of a number of companies working in the health sector. According to Companies House, Gurdev Dadral is director of several firms providing agency nurses and healthcare staff.Mr Hancock, 39, the MP for West Suffolk, who has three young children with his wife Martha, an osteopath, has inherited the hugely contentious social care remit from Jeremy Hunt and is supposed to be publishing a social care green paper this autumn.In a speech in 2012 he backed introducing an insurance system to fund social care. This would allow adults to take out insurance against the possibility of needing to spend many years being looked after in old age, if they develop dementia for example. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/06/12/4DF8E52E00000578-5925061-image-a-57_1530878002508.jpg","title":"Magical moment grandmother aunt learn Titan freed 18 days underground","story":"    As he was plucked from the cave mouth, his tearful grandmother Kong Kantawong, 60, spoke of her sheer relief, saying: ‘I am very happy and excited.

Thank you to everyone from around the world who has helped. Thank you, thank you, thank you!’The boy’s aunt described the agony of his family as they had to wait until the third day of the rescue mission for his turn to come out.‘On the first two days, nobody knew which boys had been chosen, so we just hoped and waited,’ she said.

They have a great opportunity to make a mark for themselves and their profession.\u0027When you win a World Cup it does put you in a different category to everybody else - because there are only 11 players in this country who have won it and it will change their football careers and their lives.\u0027            Sir Bobby\u0027s widow Lady Elsie, who says her husband would be so desperate for England to winThe former West Ham United equalised for England against West Germany in the 1966 final - before clinching the game with two goals in extra time.It was the only World Cup hosted in England - and a crowd of 93,000 spectators filled London\u0027s Wembley Stadium to watch.The Queen and Prince Phillip watched from the stands - with 400 million people tuning in from their living rooms.Sir Geoff added: \u0027When excitement reaches this level, it transcends the sport and it becomes a national event and people who may have not been very passionate before are now doing the opposite because they can\u0027t do or see anything without it being about the World Cup.\u0027People will remember exactly where they were at that moment in time. When any sport does well it starts to inspire people and none more so than the biggest sport in this country, football.\u0027He said of his hat-trick: \u0027I don\u0027t think I would be sitting here talking to you having scored three if we would have got beat in the final.\u0027That record still stands - it\u0027s hard to beat but it is nowhere near as important as the team winning the game.\u0027  It\u0027s #WaistcoatWednesday!

His tie was affixed in a neat Windsor knot.

Izzard looks \u0027perfect\u0027, he saysMost of all though, it was that waistcoat which, in this tensest of situations, remained resolutely fastened.That, my friends, is what I call style.Waistcoats have had a rough ride over the last few years. They are to men what the beret is to women. Hard to pull off, oh so easy to ridicule.But Gareth\u0027s waistcoat is leading a resurgence. M\u0026ampS, who provided the England team kit, say they\u0027ve nearly run out of the £65 garment such has been the demand – and their other styles have seen huge spikes in sales. Even the Moscow branch of M\u0026ampS has run out of most sizes of the waistcoat.And now there\u0027s \u0027Waistcoat Wednesday\u0027 – a huge social media movement urging both sexes to wear waistcoats in support of England during the semi-final against Croatia. Hugh Grant has tweeted he\u0027s taking part, as have presenters Andrew Marr and Jeremy Vine.Why the waistcoat resurgence? It helps Gareth wears one properly – well-fitting (never baggy) and with the bottom button unfastened (don\u0027t ask why, you just do).Cute moment Meghan pets dogs Brod and Sioda during Ireland visit\u0027Germany is totally controlled by Russia\u0027: Trump at NATO meetingQueen \u0027stumbles\u0027 on stairs as she leaves Westminster Abbey serviceAndy Murray makes his debut as BBC pundit at WimbledonEngland fans smash ambulance after jumping on itThai volunteers dance as they celebrate successful rescue missionRoyal Family arrives at Westminster service to mark RAF centenaryActor George Clooney injured in head-on crash in SardiniaForeign Secretary Jeremy Hunt thanks his predecessor Boris JohnsonFootage from inside Thai cave shows final rescue effort underwayPM sidesteps Donald Trump\u0027s claim that Britain is \u0027in turmoil\u0027Met Office says Storm Chris could bring end to Britain\u0027s heatwave      Female celebs including Victoria Beckham, Catherine Zeta-Jones and cyclist Victoria Pendleton (right).

A grieving Bobby Robson after his team\u0027s defeat on penalties to West Germany in 1990Lady Elsie Robson also claimed that the former manager would be willing Gareth Southgate and his team to win the tournament \u0027with every fibre of his being\u0027.Sir Geoff Hurst is \u0027convinced\u0027 England will emulate the success of his 1966 team by lifting this year\u0027s World Cup.The striker - who remains the only man to score a hat-trick in a World Cup final - said the players have the chance to become immortal.And he thinks a 2018 win would bring wilder celebrations - because the tournament is \u00271,000 times bigger\u0027 than it was 52 years ago.Sir Geoff said: \u0027Bearing in mind the last two tournaments were an absolute disaster, if I said before the tournament that we were going to win it I would have been looked upon as being deranged.\u0027But now you ask me today - and we can win it, it\u0027s as simple as that.\u0027I am absolutely convinced it will happen, the interest throughout the country with photographs and videos of people celebrating is like nothing before.\u0027The World Cup is 1,000 times bigger today when we played at the World Cup we weren\u0027t even playing much in Europe and had been beaten in a previous tournament by the USA 1-0.\u0027The advice I would give the England team going into the semi-finals is continue to do whatever it is you are doing. They have a great opportunity to make a mark for themselves and their profession.\u0027When you win a World Cup it does put you in a different category to everybody else - because there are only 11 players in this country who have won it and it will change their football careers and their lives.\u0027          Sir Bobby\u0027s widow Lady Elsie, who says her husband would be so desperate for England to winThe former West Ham United equalised for England against West Germany in the 1966 final - before clinching the game with two goals in extra time.It was the only World Cup hosted in England - and a crowd of 93,000 spectators filled London\u0027s Wembley Stadium to watch.The Queen and Prince Phillip watched from the stands - with 400 million people tuning in from their living rooms.Sir Geoff added: \u0027When excitement reaches this level, it transcends the sport and it becomes a national event and people who may have not been very passionate before are now doing the opposite because they can\u0027t do or see anything without it being about the World Cup.\u0027People will remember exactly where they were at that moment in time. When any sport does well it starts to inspire people and none more so than the biggest sport in this country, football.\u0027He said of his hat-trick: \u0027I don\u0027t think I would be sitting here talking to you having scored three if we would have got beat in the final.\u0027That record still stands - it\u0027s hard to beat but it is nowhere near as important as the team winning the game.\u0027 "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/11/11/4E1DB3BC00000578-5941773-image-a-5_1531303975304.jpg","title":"England fans post hilarious memes moaning work semi final","story":"    Anxious England fans are posting hilarious memes moaning about being stuck at work as they count down the minutes to the historic World Cup clash with Croatia          Workers across the country are struggling to concentrate at their desks as they nervously clock-watch their way through one last shift before tonight\u0027s big match          Even after waiting 28 years to reach a World Cup semi-final, the anticipation of just one more day is proving too much for most of England\u0027s workforceCraig Nicholson tweeted: \u0027Why isn\u0027t it 7pm yet?

Claudia Winkleman is still the top-paid woman, on up to £379,999. Mary Berry is one of eight women who have joined the listIt was disclosed that Today host Humphrys\u0027s salary would drop to below £300,000, Radio 5 Live star Campbell\u0027s to below £350,000 and newsreader Edwards\u0027s to below £500,000 - less than what has been published because the report only reflects the past financial year.Last year, BBC stars were able to see what their colleagues were paid when the corporation published salaries for 96 people for the first time.It catapulted the broadcaster into turmoil, with respected China editor Carrie Gracie resigning over unequal pay.On Wednesday, salaries were revealed in bands of £10,000 rather than last year\u0027s £50,000, after discussions with the Government over transparency.The BBC also published the detail of which programmes its stars have worked on, which it hopes \u0027will help ensure that more informed comparisons can be made\u0027, a BBC source said.The BBC recently published figures showing it had reduced its gender pay gap by nearly a fifth.A BBC source said: \u0027The BBC has come a long way in a short period of time. The job is not done yet, but we are making good progress.\u0027  BBC accused of using \u0027smoke and mirrors\u0027 to mask how much rich-list stars are paidThe BBC agreed with the Government to publish its top salaries annually. But it includes stars only paid directly by the licence fee.This means a string of major celebrities, who are paid directly by production companies or the BBC\u0027s commercial arm, can be left out. It is thought a third of the stars who appeared last year may be absent this time.BBC Studios was created to let the corporation sell shows to rival broadcasters and compete with giants such as Netflix. It creates the likes of DIY SOS, The One Show and Strictly Come Dancing.          The judges of Strictly Come Dancing are paid through BBC Studios so they pay is not revealedOne presenter on today\u0027s list said of BBC Studios: \u0027It sounds like a BBC organisation, it acts like a BBC organisation but, on paper and legally, it is not. It has caused confusion.\u0027The other deep resentment among presenters is there is not a level playing field. You have some of us having our salaries published with all of the ghastliness that comes with it. You either disclose people\u0027s salaries or you don\u0027t.\u0027Last year\u0027s pay revelations have created a \u0027bloody nightmare\u0027, according to one star whose earnings are disclosed.The pay of top-earning male stars has been cut following widespread outrage after it emerged that just one of the BBC\u0027s top ten earners was a woman.Tensions have ramped up between men and women in a process that one newsroom source branded \u0027haphazard\u0027.Damian Collins MP, chairman of the Commons digital, culture, media and sport committee, said last night: \u0027If people look at the report and say, \u0027Last year we were told how much BBC presenters in entertainment programmes were getting paid, this year we are not going to be told at all\u0027, people will think that\u0027s a backwards step.\u0027Tory MP Andrew Bridgen said: \u0027This is the BBC using smoke and mirrors to obscure the gender pay gap which I believe runs through the whole organisation.\u0027Moving people into private companies or other entities so their pay doesn\u0027t have to be disclosed is not solving the problem – it\u0027s running away from it.\u0027A BBC spokesman said: \u0027The BBC has done an enormous amount of work to ensure we pay fairly and equally.

The terrifying moment a giant...Feline intuition: Cats at daycare center run for cover...Share this articleLeopards are solitary animals, unlike lions, and largely hunt at night to avoid competition with the so-called King of the Jungle.Because of their small size they will often drag their quarry up a tree to prevent it being stolen by other predators, which offers a clue as to where this leopard is hiding.They are similar in appearance to jaguars, but are smaller and less muscular. They also lack a dot in the centre of their spots, which is the mark of a jaguar.           The leopard is lazing in the branches of this tree, which is one of the animal\u0027s favoured hang-outs, as it keeps it out of the way of much larger predators that patrol the ground below          Even standing up in the tree, the leopard is hard to see (centre). The cats will often drag their prey into trees to stop it being stolen by lions and other large predators          Leopards are relatively common across Kenya but particular concentrations can be found inside the Maasai Mara and Samburu National ReservesIt is unlikely that the two species would be confused in the wild, however, as they do not share a habitat.Leopards live mostly across southern parts of Africa and in scattered communities across Asia, Pakistan and Malaysia, while jaguars live in the Americas.Leopards can be spotted across Kenya but there are particular concentrations in the Maasai Mara and Samburu National Reserves.As with many of Africa\u0027s largest predators, their numbers increase dramatically around wildebeest migration season as they follow the herd, hoping to pick off stragglers.Igor Gerlach has been a photographer since 1974 and began taking pictures of wildlife in 1976.

Attorney General Geoffrey CoxYesterday, it was revealed that the Ministry of Justice has already been handed £17million to prepare for a no-deal Brexit.Justice Minister Lucy Frazer revealed that the Treasury had freed up the funds to ensure the MoJ ‘are ready for’ a no deal.The revelation came after a question in the Commons from Tory backbencher William Wragg.Justice Secretary David Gauke yesterday said that leaving the EU without a deal was ‘not an attractive proposition’.But, with time running out ahead of the UK’s departure next year, Mr Gauke said ministers had a duty to accelerate preparations. ‘It is absolutely right that we prepare for no deal,’ he said.Merkel praises May\u0027s \u0027progress\u0027 on Brexit and EU negotiator...May\u0027s fightback reshuffle: Millionaire lawyer who forgot to...Share this article‘We cannot rule out that that is where we will end up for one reason or another.’Mrs May warned MPs on Monday there was a ‘serious risk’ of Britain leaving without a deal if the EU rejects her latest compromise proposals.She added: ‘A responsible Government must prepare for a range of potential outcomes, including the possibility of no deal, and given the short period remaining before the conclusion of negotiations, the Cabinet agreed on Friday that these preparations should be stepped up.‘But at the same, we should recognise that such a disorderly no deal would have profound consequences for both the UK and the EU, and I believe that the UK deserves better.’Privately, Whitehall insiders believe Mrs May will be unable to go much further in offering concessions to the EU.          New Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, pictured, told his first meeting of the Cabinet that accelerating contingency plans would be one of his first priorities in the new jobOne said: ‘If the EU won’t agree then we have got a very serious problem with the negotiations at that point.’EU leaders have so far given a muted reaction to Mrs May’s Chequers deal, saying they want to hear more detail before passing judgment. But the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier yesterday suggested he was sceptical about Mrs May’s idea of the UK retaining full access to the single market without signing up to all the rules.Speaking at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, Mr Barnier repeated that the single market and the four freedoms – goods, capital, services and labour – were the ‘the fundamental principles on which the EU is based’ and would be defended.Mr Barnier said 80 per cent of the issues surrounding the UK’s exit had now been resolved.But asked if he was worried other countries might follow Britain’s lead, Mr Barnier said: ‘Once again, I regret profoundly this vote of the UK, we respect it and we implement it.‘But it’s day after day more clear... I can tell you that it will be clear, clear, crystal clear at the end of this negotiation, that the best situation with the best relation with the EU, will remain to be a member of the EU.’Mr Barnier later said Brexit would be ‘costly and unpleasant’ for the UK. He warned the cost of Brexit would be ‘substantially higher for the UK than the EU’.He said that the EU would not accept Mrs May’s proposal for an exception for the financial industry from EU rules. He added: ‘It would go against all our objectives... I don’t know any country in the world that would accept such a loss of sovereignty.’He then half joked: ‘I have no personal experience of orce, it’s always costly and unpleasant’.Angela Merkel yesterday offered Theresa May a slender Brexit lifeline, saying the Chequers proposals would be viewed ‘in the spirit of friendship’.The German Chancellor also did not outright dismiss Mrs May’s idea of the UK retaining full access to the single market without accepting free movement. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/10/22/4E19D84000000578-0-image-m-25_1531257019411.jpg","title":"Where Harry Kanes school cup winners Former classmates watch Englands Captain","story":"    His former teammates admit that as they grew older their priorities switched to job hunting and socialisingEven then, the 15-year-olds were often referred to as the ‘Harry Kane team’ and the players were under instructions to pass the ball to him if in trouble. His former teammates admit that as they grew older their priorities switched to job hunting and socialising. Kane, they said, shunned alcohol and was single-minded in his determination to become a professional footballer.One schoolfriend, Jack Coker, is at least a goalkeeper with semi-pro West Essex in the Essex Senior League but he earns his living as a PE teacher.Dean Ercan, a scaffolder from Chingford, played football with Kane from the age of eight.Share this article    Harry Kane of England national team plays with toy rooster during an England training session ahead of the 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia Semi-Final match against Croatia, on July 10English teacher Denis McElligott was coach of the school team and said Kane was always determined to make the most of his talent.‘He was a little bit stocky but then you would see him after a game out running, losing weight and working on his fitness,’ he said in a previous interview.‘Kids from other schools started to know who he was and know his name.

You have nothing to fear. To conquer fear, you have to face it. It is OK to cry when you win, then you have achieved something\u0027.  Former England manager Sir Bobby Robson would have been \u0027thrilled\u0027 by the progress of the current side at the 2018 World Cup, his widow has said.            A grieving Bobby Robson after his team\u0027s defeat on penalties to West Germany in 1990Lady Elsie Robson also claimed that the former manager would be willing Gareth Southgate and his team to win the tournament \u0027with every fibre of his being\u0027.Sir Geoff Hurst is \u0027convinced\u0027 England will emulate the success of his 1966 team by lifting this year\u0027s World Cup.The striker - who remains the only man to score a hat-trick in a World Cup final - said the players have the chance to become immortal.And he thinks a 2018 win would bring wilder celebrations - because the tournament is \u00271,000 times bigger\u0027 than it was 52 years ago.Sir Geoff said: \u0027Bearing in mind the last two tournaments were an absolute disaster, if I said before the tournament that we were going to win it I would have been looked upon as being deranged.\u0027But now you ask me today - and we can win it, it\u0027s as simple as that.\u0027I am absolutely convinced it will happen, the interest throughout the country with photographs and videos of people celebrating is like nothing before.\u0027The World Cup is 1,000 times bigger today when we played at the World Cup we weren\u0027t even playing much in Europe and had been beaten in a previous tournament by the USA 1-0.\u0027The advice I would give the England team going into the semi-finals is continue to do whatever it is you are doing. They have a great opportunity to make a mark for themselves and their profession.\u0027When you win a World Cup it does put you in a different category to everybody else - because there are only 11 players in this country who have won it and it will change their football careers and their lives.\u0027            Sir Bobby\u0027s widow Lady Elsie, who says her husband would be so desperate for England to winThe former West Ham United equalised for England against West Germany in the 1966 final - before clinching the game with two goals in extra time.It was the only World Cup hosted in England - and a crowd of 93,000 spectators filled London\u0027s Wembley Stadium to watch.The Queen and Prince Phillip watched from the stands - with 400 million people tuning in from their living rooms.Sir Geoff added: \u0027When excitement reaches this level, it transcends the sport and it becomes a national event and people who may have not been very passionate before are now doing the opposite because they can\u0027t do or see anything without it being about the World Cup.\u0027People will remember exactly where they were at that moment in time. When any sport does well it starts to inspire people and none more so than the biggest sport in this country, football.\u0027He said of his hat-trick: \u0027I don\u0027t think I would be sitting here talking to you having scored three if we would have got beat in the final.\u0027That record still stands - it\u0027s hard to beat but it is nowhere near as important as the team winning the game.\u0027  It\u0027s #WaistcoatWednesday!

Of the 90 exhibitions that fill the city’s museums and cultural spaces, five core shows have been selected and curated by the photographer Cristina de Middel, best known for her Afronaughts series, a playful reimagining of Zambia’s short-lived 1960s space mission. In Middel’s world, play isn’t a time-wasting, puerile distraction but an essential part of creativity. It is an invitation to stop and think differently. For this show of works by Magnum photographers, Middel and her co-curator Martin Parr searched for the word “players” in the Magnum archive. The resulting images show an unexpected side of the photography agency, bringing up questions about the definition of play and how it pervades everyday life, even in times of hardship.Marking 250 years of the modern circus, this exhibition explores the spectacle and thrill of the art form’s golden age, drawing from the vast collections within the Archive of Modern Conflict. While images of elephants standing on their hind legs and lions jumping through hoops are troubling from a contemporary perspective, they stand as a reminder of how differently joy has been experienced in the past. The show traces the trajectory of the spectacular, from human cannonballs to the nuclear tests in the 1950s. Here, Middel has chosen photographers who play with notions of time, place and scientific reason in unexpected ways. AnaHell’s absurdist series Secret Friends features people in multiple locations around the world, neatly bending their bodies forward to expose their backs. A hastily drawn face and a wig instantly transforms them into comic potato-like caricatures of the everyman.A comprehensive retrospective – and the 2018 PhotoEspaña award – celebrates Nigerian photographer Samuel Fosso’s exploration of identity, gender and colonialism in the African diaspora. The exhibition title references his own extraordinary journey from his childhood in Nigeria via Cameroon to the Central African Republic where he fled as a refugee after losing his parents in the civil war. Still a teenager, he became a photographer’s assistant before going on to run his own portrait studio. Fosso’s sardonic humour shines in his early experimental work and his later stylised recreations of black photo icons.

Beyond advances in the manufacture of clothing, the whims of fashion, and the occasional fad – who remembers Levi’s twisted seam? – cotton has remained cotton, and polyester is still polyester.But an award-winning Italian design duo is trying to realise the potential of smart technology in clothing to improve lives.Emanuela Corti and Ivan Parati, who met while studying at the Polytechnic University of Milan, have developed Sensewear, a collection of smart clothing and accessories for people who suffer from SPD. Also known as sensory integration difficulties, SPD can affect the way people, particularly those on the autism spectrum, process everyday stimuli, from light to touch.Their innovative work won Corti and Parati an AXA Health Tech \u0026amp You Award as part of the AXA Health Tech \u0026amp You programme, which aims to identify inidual champions, innovators and organisations that are creating exciting and pioneering health tech. In addition to winning awards, Corti and Parati’s work has also gained the attention of research academics and manufacturers in Italy.“If it is not treated effectively, it can result in clumsiness, behavioural problems, anxiety, depression or failure at school,” says Corti, a product designer specialising in textiles and furniture. She says hypersensitivity is often part of SPD, which can result in an enhanced sensitivity to sounds, smells and physical contact. “The textures, stitches and labels in regular clothes can cause unsustainably painful reactions,” she says. Left untreated, these symptoms can be disabling, leading to social isolation, anxiety and low self-esteem.The couple, who now have a young daughter, started with comparatively low-tech solutions, looking at the potential for 3D knitting processes, for example, to reduce potential rubbing points. They also looked at ways to redesign – or to build into clothing – some of the specialised toys and medical accessories already available. “Our focus was on incorporating those therapies into everyday objects that would not stigmatise the user as a disabled person,” Corti says. “We wanted to create invisible magic.”But the designers also wanted to think big. What if the elements of a wardrobe could talk to each other? For this, Corti and Parati looked at some of the smart clothing that is starting to become available, typically now targeted at the fitness market, such as Nadi X smart yoga leggings, which pulse on different muscles to encourage correct positions, and the sports vests that measures an athlete’s heart rate and position.“Our smart T-shirt will collect vital data – such as heart rate, breath frequency and movement – which is processed by an app to indicate the stress level of the wearer. It can then trigger the functionalities of other garments in the collection,” says Corti.One such garment is an inflatable pullover, capable of delivering a targeted “hug” to a wearer in need. “Deep pressure or deep touch pressure therapy (DTP) is a firm, tactile sensory input that can consist of firm hugs, stroking or cuddling,” says Corti. “It can have a calming effect on children and adults. Many people affected by autism refuse physical contact with others, but might be happy with a mechanical surrogate.” Other Sensewear innovations include Biteme, a biteable silicon necklace that measures pressure, and an aromatic scarf that can emit familiar, comforting scents.“This is a visionary concept that materialises ideas initially described by Mary Temple Grandin,” says Cesare Furlanello, head of the research group at the Bruno Kessler Foundation in Trento, and an expert in the way machine learning can be applied to biomedical and environmental data. Grandin, now 70, is a US professor of animal science and campaigner for autism awareness. She specialises in the emotional as well as physical welfare of livestock, and also invented a mechanical “hug box” for humans, after noticing how confined cattle calmed down before being inoculated.“As a child, I craved to feel the comfort of being held, but I would pull away when people hugged me,” Grandin wrote in 1992 in a description of the machine, a sort of pneumatic cocoon with pressurised padding that allowed her to control her own hugging. She suffered panic attacks throughout her teenage years before building the device in early adulthood. “Gradually, my tolerance of being held by the squeeze machine grew. Knowing that I could initiate the pressure, and stop it if the stimulation became too intense, helped me to reduce the oversensitivity of my nervous system.”Medical vests that replicate this mechanism have already been developed, but Corti’s priority is to make smart clothing that looks cool. “If you have a difficulty you don’t want people to stare at you, right? You don’t want to feel different,” she says. This summer, a team including Furlanello will introduce some of the Sensewear range to children with autism, to explore its potential to make their lives easier. “Patients are very often reluctant to ‘wear’ cumbersome and ugly scientific devices,” says Furlanello, “but we expect Sensewear smart clothes will be much more acceptable, which will help researchers to collect data and expand the context of the study.”Corti now hopes that the ideas behind Sensewear’s smart clothing might one day find broader applications. “We would like to expand our philosophy to furniture, interior design and objects,” she says. “We think that everyone faces a certain degree of discomfort, so we are also thinking about people who just live in a hectic urban environment and might want protection from overwhelming sensations or stresses.”Imagine having a slow, firm hug, administered automatically and invisibly, on a delayed, crowded commuter train. There might well be a market for that.We’re here to promote the people who dare to dream. Innovations in health technology are transforming the way we care for our minds and bodies.

This nuanced study considers it as a force for goodOf the world’s 1.6 billion Muslims a very large number – perhaps a majority – observed the Ramadan fast last month. This doesn’t simply mean abstaining from food and water during the hours of daylight (as well as sex and cigarettes), but in many cases involves a deliberate reappraisal of one’s relation to God and the world, with more prayers and philanthropy and less shopping.Of all the obligations that define Islam, Ramadan arouses perhaps the most irritation among some outsiders. A practice that places such a strain on the body is surely an affront to reason. Nor does it seem to make economic sense for workers to be tired and unproductive while declining to perform their allotted roles as consumers with credit ratings. And yet the west has absorbed Ramadan, if\u0026nbspuneasily, with supermarket promotions for dates (the Prophet’s favoured breakfast), school assemblies on the subject and “What is Ramadan?” features even in the Sun.Knowledge about Islam may have improved, but the speed with which relations are changing between Muslims and non-Muslims, and between Muslims, necessitates a constant reassessment of different worldviews and the way they interrelate. Isis’s defeat in Mesopotamia has not led to any meaningful dialogue between cultures. On the contrary, with Gaza aflame, the Iran nuclear accord uprooted and Sunni-Shia tensions at an all-time high, the prospects for detente have rarely been bleaker.It’s an illustration of the insincerity of many world leaders that more than 250 French public figures, including former president Nicolas Sarkozy and three former prime ministers, recently demanded that Qur’anic verses endorsing the killing of non-Muslims be “struck down” – just as the Second Vatican Council expurgated elements of Catholic doctrine in the early 1960s. This meretricious proposal affects to assume that Islam is a centralised religion like Catholicism (it isn’t), that the Qur’an can be snipped and remain the Qur’an (it can’t), and that because they recognise the same holy book the Islam of the jihadi is the same as that of the Sufi or the Europeanised Muslim with his Qur’an on\u0026nbspthe top shelf and his bottle of burgundy on the bottom. When will someone put these contradictions of text, practice and culture into terms accessible to the layperson? Who will speak across the ides?Enter Ed Husain. A Briton of Indian parentage, a\u0026nbspMuslim whose bestselling book, The Islamist, described his temporary embrace of the values of global jihad in the 90s, Husain retained his religious faith even after he became a government adviser on deradicalisation. Since then he has lived off the fat of the neoliberal establishment that ran the world before the age of Trump, working for Tony Blair’s Faith Foundation as well as several other well‑heeled thinktanks on both sides of the Atlantic. The anti-extremism organisation he co-founded in 2007, Quilliam, is considered by many to be hopelessly compromised by its support for government efforts to squeeze Muslims into the corset of “British” values.Husain’s politics and the company he keeps may be questioned, but they evidently haven’t stopped him from thinking productively about Islam as a force for good in the\u0026nbspworld. An account of the compassion, reason and wonderment that Islam has exhibited for much of its history, this book is a powerful corrective to the\u0026nbspwidespread perception, fostered by jihadis and\u0026nbspIslamophobes alike, that it’s a\u0026nbspbelief system for\u0026nbspmisanthropes.Husain offers the Sufis and their pursuit of love, and he illustrates his point with the verses of Rumi and Omar Khayyám. As for the argument that hadiths, or sayings attributed to the Prophet, prescribe death for adulterers, homosexuals and apostates: thousands of hadiths are in fact fabrications and Muslim subculture has always made room for sexual licence and irreverence. Elsewhere he tackles the dunderheaded literalism that infects modern-day Salafism, which led an Egyptian cleric to rule that the only way mixed workplaces could be acceptable would be for the women to breastfeed their male colleagues, making them “family”.Husain often cites the Prophet in support of his contention that authentic Islam is a fusion of the good and the workable. Those jihadis who claim Muhammad as their inspiration should reflect that he\u0026nbspspent just 10 days out of a 23-year ministry in combat. The Prophet tolerated much worse insults than the caricatures that were used as an excuse for the Charlie Hebdo massacre three years ago. The founder of a religion commonly associated with the forced marriage of young girls accepted a marriage proposal from a woman 15\u0026nbspyears older than himself, while his decrees on inheritance, orce and infanticide vastly improved the lot\u0026nbspof Arabian women.Ever since its inception Islam’s ethos had been contested, but a disastrous turn came with rejection of the printing press and the triumph of scholasticism over independent reasoning, exacerbated by a morale-sapping struggle against European expansionism in the 19th and 20th centuries. Husain rightly says that the root of much Muslim confusion is a sense that a glorious past has soured into defeat and humiliation, but fallen prestige is hardly the monopoly of Muslims. The West has also lost ground, particularly its white males dealing with changes in status is a part of being human. In general, Husain is too apt to view Muslims and their dignity as qualitatively different from those of other people. His modern politics can also be sketchy. With justification he criticises Saudi Arabia for its promotion of\u0026nbspbigotry – less understandable is his soft spot\u0026nbspfor the \u0026nbspTurkey of Recep Tayyip Erdogan – less a paragon of generous Islam than thuggish majoritarianism. His insistence that Muslim nations accommodate the tiny Jewish state in their midst is common sense but a suggestion of a Middle Eastern union including Israel reads somewhat grotesquely in the light of the\u0026nbsprecent carnage in Gaza. For all that, Husain has written a\u0026nbspvaluable book, full of suggestions for Islam’s implementation from a position of magnanimity and love.

Even for one whose situation is perfectly satisfactory, imagining a total disruption can beguile. It’s the ultimate rebellion against mortality, for potential is nearly synonymous with youth. We are born wandering an intact Pangaea of possibility the choices we make, and the years ticking by, break continents away under our feet until we are each left standing on a small personal island of identity. There we are deemed to be in our final form and can be spoken of as having ended up. The urge toward self-reinvention goes deeper than the risible “midlife crisis” of popular culture it’s a cri de coeur from that island, insisting: “I am more than I seem.” Even, “The world is bigger than this.”Upheaval can pose fundamental questions about identity. Our small islands have been shaped by us, but have shaped us as well. In my novel The Possible World, three characters each find themselves abruptly spilled into unfamiliar lives: six-year-old Ben, the only survivor of a brutal crime his doctor Lucy, facing the dissolution of her marriage centenarian Clare, harbouring her own story of cataclysm, carrying secrets that will affect the destiny of the other two. All of them struggle with memory, identity and meaning while seeking a way forward into their new lives.Maybe we read about disruption to avoid having to undergo it. Here are some books that offer vicarious experiences of mayhem and renewal:1. Life After Life by Kate Atkinson (2014) The riveting saga of Ursula Todd, who is born and dies in 1910 and is then reborn again and again into the same life, things going a little bit differently each time. She carries memories forward, and as the world marches through one war and then into another, the reader wonders if she will be able to budge the course of history. It is a masterpiece. I strongly recommend the audiobook the narrator Fenella Woolgar’s performance is a tour de force of its own. 2. Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine by Gail Honeyman (2017)At first we might pity Eleanor, the 30-year-old odd-bird outcast who lives in a rut of lonely vodka weekends and supermarket pizza. When a sudden passion for a pop star jolts Eleanor out of her track and she resolves to remake herself, her journey out of isolation is hilarious, surprising and poignant. The book doesn’t shy away from serious themes – “loneliness is the new cancer”, Eleanor says – but the sadness is perfectly balanced with hope. Damaged, quirky and above all resilient, Eleanor is a modern heroine. 3. The Poisonwood Bible by Barbara Kingsolver (1998)Evangelist preacher Nathan Price takes his wife and four daughters from 1950s America to the Congo. The Prices drop into Africa as naively as babes landing in the jaws of crocodiles. Told in multiple voices, this is a coming-of-age story in quadruplicate, as well as a parable about colonial arrogance. A family reinvents itself here, and also a country: the spectacular backdrop is a culture undergoing massive changes of its own. 4. Jasmine by Bharati Mukherjee (1989)A dark odyssey about a suddenly widowed Indian teenager who decides to fulfil her late husband’s cherished dream of moving from Punjab to Florida. She reinvents herself as needed, from Jyoti into Jasmine, Jazzy, and Jase, and finally into Jane, a 24-year-old Iowan housewife. Her voyage brings her to a crisis: she must decide which of her many selves is the authentic one, and which life can claim to be her destiny. 5. Shantaram by Gregory David Roberts (2003)This epic tome recounts the exploits of an Australian prison escapee who gets off a train into the chaos of Bombay. He disappears into the city, tucking himself into the slums and a vigorous exile. The tale is narrated with an irresistible, can-you-believe-it grin, its author an Australian prison escapee who lived a decade in Bombay. The line between fact and fiction is aggressively blurred. Best not to speculate – simply hang on for the long, wild ride. 6. Wave by Sonali Deraniyagala (2013)The memoir of a daughter, wife and mother, who has all of those identities ripped away simultaneously when her parents, husband and two young sons are taken by the Boxing Day 2004 tsunami. You would not think that anyone could survive such a loss without going mad – and she does go a little bit mad in this short book, which is something of a contained howl. It’s also a brave exploration of grief, and a luminous celebration of her lost loved ones. 7. Fifty Acres and a Poodle by Jeanne Marie Laskas (2000) A fortyish urbanite cherishing a lifelong yearning for open spaces drives past a picturesque farm one day – and buys it. She and her boyfriend upend their lives, and while the story of their adjustment is at many points highly comical, it is not a slapstick romp, it’s an engaging and tender testament to the beauty of the unexpected and the rewards of following your heart. There is indeed a poodle, who stars in perhaps the funniest anecdote in the book.  8. The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry by Rachel Joyce (2012) When a mysterious rose-pink envelope arrives for Harold, a 65-year-old man who “doesn’t know anyone anywhere”, it ruptures his stagnant life. His spontaneous decision to walk 600 miles to answer the letter makes a captivating, uproariously funny, often profound pilgrimage story. There are actually two pilgrims in this book, both grappling with buried sorrows and seeking redemption: Harold, walking through the beautifully described countryside, and his wife left behind at home. A deeply sentimental, highly enjoyable book. 9. His Illegal Self by Peter Carey (2008) Che Selkirk never knew his parents, outlaw hippie terrorists who abandoned him to a life of sanitised privilege with his wealthy grandmother. He’s eight years old in 1972 when he opens the front door of his Manhattan home to a woman he thinks might be his mother. When a chance to abscond with her arises, he willingly goes. The two skip across the globe, evading authorities, and end up in the Australian wilderness. In a matter of days, Che goes from upper-crust American to unwashed child savage. A fascinating, highly layered novel. 10. Lady Oracle by Margaret Atwood (1976)From its opening words, “I planned my death carefully,” the reader is consumed by the dilemma of Joan Foster, who has made a habit of secrets. A celebrated poet, a beauty and a wife, she is concealing a past of morbid obesity, a current infidelity and a flourishing career as a romantic novelist. Tripping over her own deceptions, she fakes her death and escapes to Italy. There, memory clouds Joan’s new life in a way she didn’t anticipate, and she realises that there may be a limit to one person’s capacity to self-reinvent. Wickedly intelligent, this is an early Atwood gem."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4dd322282f7e91bde848e5a12871132526e28537/0_19_2402_1441/master/2402.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=30ac9b74db76e244918130ceea1208d8","title":"jane austen andrew davies male gaze sanditon","story":"News that the veteran adapter of Pride and Prejudice and Bridget Jones is turning his hand to the unfinished Sanditon seems out of tune with the timesNobody made a fuss when Andrew Davies adapted Pride and Prejudice in 1995. With hindsight his sexing up of Jane Austen may look questionable, even pervy but you could hardly complain about a version that put women at its centre – compare its nuanced Elizabeth and its, er, unforgettable Mrs Bennet with its colourless Darcy and Mr B – and did wonders for the Austen brand: after it (and the superb Emma update Clueless, in the same year) came Bridget Jones, biopics, Hollywood stars doing Regency English and a general freeing up of how the novels were read and reworked. Reaction is bound to be more mixed to the news that Davies will be rejigging Jane again with a TV version of the unfinished Sanditon. Twenty-three years on, “appropriation” is taboo for many, and assigning female authors (the Brontës, Du Maurier, non-Poirot Christie) to female screenwriters is pretty much de rigueur where it was radical and fresh in 1995 to have a man departing from the ladylike style of previous telly Austen, it’s a woman’s take on a male-written, male-led novel series (Debbie Horsfield’s Poldark) that’s the trendsetting costume drama in 2018. Hardly helping his cause, Davies (who turns 82 in September) licked his lips in the press release at getting his hands on a novel – whose heroine, Charlotte, is the guest of the founder of a Sussex resort – featuring such attractions as “quite a bit of nude bathing” (the latter conceivably by the novel’s visiting group of schoolgirls).And an Austen fragment seems a peculiar departure anyway for the ace adapter, whose recent projects – War and Peace, Les Misérables, A Suitable Boy, John Updike’s Rabbit saga – have all been male whoppers. The case for the defence? If there is one, it’s that Davies was ahead of the game in putting fiction by women on screen – not just Austen, but George Eliot, Elizabeth Gaskell, Winifred Holtby and Sarah Waters – and the ITVPBS Sanditon represents an autumnal circling back to this 90s00s period after his “big books by blokes” phase. Either that, or he just likes novels where young women predominate, preferably in revealing Regency frocks."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/914c7c5584d8253f5f3d644b3e867e6aac46d2be/0_0_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ad665f13a4d20fbb46c18639f61afd4","title":"future dockless city really run floating transport apps scooters bikes","story":"Citymapper now supports dockless transport options such as Ofo bikes in London and San Francisco’s Bird electric scooters, offering an insight into the future of transport in citiesLast week, London-based transportation app Citymapper coined a new phrase: “floating transport”. “It has no set stops or infrastructure,” the company explained, “and it’s filling a mobility gap in our cities.”It’s a useful shorthand to lump together everything from dockless cycle hire, like Ofo and Mobike’s London offerings, Bird and Lime’s San Franciscan electric scooters, to Daimler’s short-term car hire service Car2Go – all of which are now supported by Citymapper’s app, alongside fixed urban transport options like buses and trains.These services rely on a combination of GPS and cellular connectivity to track whichever vehicle is being rented, charging users by the minute and immobilising the device wherever it is left at the end of its trip. They’ve exploded in popularity this year, riding the wave of trends like declining car ownership and increasing preference for renting rather than owning outright.These transport systems are quickly becoming ubiquitous – but what role can they play in the cities of tomorrow? The update to Citymapper offers an insight only if the kinks can be worked out – and it’s both more and less transformative than we might hope.Floating transport has obvious appeal to investors, especially those sore to have missed out on the Uber gravy train. Venture capitalists’ enthusiasm to jump on the next big thing in transport is the best explanation for the astounding US $300m (£226m) raised by scooter company Bird, at a valuation of $1.7bn, last month. That was matched this week by Uber and Google’s investment in Bird competitor Lime at a $1.1bn valuation, as the company rolls out (sorry) its bright green scooters to Paris, entering Europe for the first timeUnlike precursors such as docked cycle hire, or fixed-parking car hire (think Zipcar), the initial outlay is very small. There’s no need to build docks or pay cities for permanent parking spaces, and while demand remains high, the numbers are good – really, really good.A Bird scooter, for instance, will conservatively gross about $10 a day, according to Bloomberg’s Brad Stone. That’s five short rides, give or take. The scooter needs to be recharged – a job done by gig economy contractors who are paid $5 per recharged scooter – so the net profit per day is $5. With those figures, a $300 scooter with $50 worth of modifications including the GPS tracker and locking mechanisms, then pays for itself in two months.But simply being profitable doesn’t necessarily mean floating transport is good for a city, and the growth of the sector has been a bumpy ride. A big problem is that pavement is a shared space, and a limited resource. The overcrowding problems San Francisco has seen with Bird scooters are mirrored in London by Ofo bikes – a model where users abandon their vehicles wherever they want inevitably results in pavements littered with out-of-service rides.That can be annoying, unsightly or actively dangerous, depending on the circumstances. In London, parents have complained of having to push prams onto the road to get round piles of bikes, while wheelchair users in LA can find a previously accessible route blocked by a wayward scooters.While floating transport is free from many of the regulatory burdens faced by previous transport startups, it’s not immune. Electric scooters, for instance, can’t easily expand to the UK, because they aren’t legal to use on the road or the pavement. Dockless cycle hire faces similar trouble in Australia, where helmets are required by law.Citymapper is betting, though, that despite hurdles on a regional level, this is the future globally. The app currently has a slim level of integration with most floating transport providers – inidual bikes, cars and scooters will appear on the map, along with information like charge level. But they aren’t yet seamlessly combined with the company’s flagship multi-modal journey planner.When that does happen, as Citymapper has said, the services will be presented like any other mode of transport. If it’s quicker to hop on an Ofo bike and cycle to the tube than it is to wait for a bus, it will show as an option.But the company’s mock-up of how it might look in the app– showing a notional journey from transport-deprived Stoke Newington, in north-east London – conceals some of the potential flaws of floating transport. It’s easy enough to plan a journey that begins with a three-minute walk to a bike and ends with 30 minutes on the tube, but it’s somewhat harder to plan your return trip. Will the bike still be there? Or would you have been better off taking an entirely different route in the first place? (That’s not a hypothetical concern – it has happened to me a few times. It’s worse still when you arrive at a bike you’d intended to use to find it still there but not actually working, because it hasn’t yet been reported and removed from the map.)Floating transport also faces similar problems to those that docked cycle hire discovered in its early years: iniduals’ movement through cities is highly correlated. Rush hour is the obvious example, but other trends become clear if you spend long enough staring at data visualisations of where, say, London’s Santander bikes are at any given time. Try to find a docking space outside Hackney’s Victoria Park at 1pm on a sunny summer Saturday, and eight hours later, you’ll have just as hard a time trying to find a bike to get home with.Now imagine trying to solve that problem without docks where would-be renters can at least wait in the hope that a bike will be dropped off.Many floating transport providers have realised these potential pitfalls, and are taking steps to address them. Some bike providers, for instance, have followed the lead of London’s cycle hire network, and now collect bikes left in out-of-the-way places and drop them near transport hubs. Jump, an e-bike provider now owned by Uber, lets users “preorder” bikes, renting them in advance (and still paying by the minute) to ensure they’re there when they need them.And of course, smart transport planners play their own part. If we could give ourselves over fully to Citymapper and its ilk, religiously following instructions to the letter even on journeys which we think we know, then the app could merrily reroute as and when the circumstances on the ground change, erting users towards bikes that have suddenly appeared for rent, or telling them to hop on a bus if someone’s beaten you to a scooter.But ultimately, floating transport is going to have to learn another lesson that conventional transportation bodies have taken to heart: flexible may be fun, but cities run on reliable.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82bacba330eb9ef9923aa479a9f95464dd5e69e6/0_62_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10088b53e93793fb8aeef937ffd79547","title":"america left alexandria ocasio cortez new york primary","story":"The little-known history of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s victory in a New York primary hints at the coming transformation• The moment 28-year-old socialist beats top-ranking Democrat in congressional primary - videoEven at first sight it is exhilarating. The overthrow of one of the most mainstream and senior Democrats in Congress by a 28-year-old Democratic socialist with a radical programme and one tenth of his funding is, you might think, interesting enough.But since Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez beat Joe Crowley in the Democratic primary in New York’s 14th district (meaning she will almost certainly enter Congress in November), I’ve been interviewing some of the people who lit the fuse that caused this detonation. What has emerged is just how marginal and improbable their movement was when it began, and how quickly it is now gaining momentum. A revolution has begun in America, and it is time we understood what it means.While the effort to find and run insurgent candidates arose from the Bernie Sanders campaign in 2016, the handful of young people who launched this movement struck out entirely on their own. They had no resources and no political standing. Neither Sanders nor any others in the old guard were prepared to support them or endorse the candidates they found.In a way, this tiny group, Brand New Congress, which evolved into the Justice Democrats, marginalised itself. It wanted nothing to do with a traditional left it saw as being obsessed with positioning. It wanted to escape the shadow of people who seemed stuck in the 1980s, who didn’t take environmental issues seriously or understand the need to challenge structural racism and gender inequality, or to reach millennials trapped in terrible housing and miserable non-jobs. They were mocked, ignored and dismissed as well-intentioned but hopeless idealists. One of them told me how he was literally patted on the head by an older Democrat.At first, it was chaotic. Most of the volunteers they recruited had little or no experience. Some turned out to be wonderful, others less so. Their original aim was to find 400 candidates to challenge both Democratic and Republican incumbents. They sought bartenders, factory workers, small-business people, community organisers, teachers, nurses – ideally people who had never held public office before. While Democratic candidates are usually chosen on the grounds of how much money they can raise, the Justice Democrats looked for people who could not be seduced by big funders. They reasoned that if the people they met had served their communities instead of themselves, they were unlikely to sell out once they were elected.They found plenty of brilliant potential recruits, but without mainstream support they didn’t have the credibility required to convince hundreds of people to give up their lives for an improbable cause. They managed to persuade a few dozen, however, and among them was Ocasio-Cortez. They phoned her, invited her to dinner, and asked her to attend a meeting in Kentucky with other potential candidates, in the hope that they would inspire each other to run. She took her time and toured the 14th district before she agreed.She was, as we have seen, a fantastic candidate: determined, indefatigable, brilliant at explaining complex issues simply and directly. Alexandra Rojas, the campaigns director of Justice Democrats, tells me: “She has a way of making issues that others see as radical seem simple, straightforward and pragmatic.” Everyone I spoke to remarked on her grace and stability, and how she calmly absorbed the dramas that surrounded her bid. Extraordinary local campaigners combined traditional fieldwork with the big organising tactics developed during the Sanders campaign: using proliferating networks of volunteers to fill the jobs usually reserved for staffers.Remarkable as she is, there are others like her. Cori Bush in Missouri, Jess King in Pennsylvania and Kerri Evelyn Harris in Delaware are just a few of those now fighting for Democratic nominations or seats while renouncing big money, relying instead on the enthusiasm of the communities they hope to serve.The Justice Democrats are not expecting all these candidates to win, but hope for a few spectacular victories at the congressional elections in 2018 and 2020, not only replacing corporate, money-tainted Democrats, but flipping a couple of Republican districts as well (look out, for example, for the campaigns by Brent Welder and James Thompson in Kansas). As soon as such people take their seats in Congress, Saikat Chakrabarti, one of the core organisers, tells me the aim is to “legislate the hell out of everything, like the Republicans do … proposing the boldest, biggest ideas on day one”. By 2022, using the momentum gained from a few strategic victories, they hope to run a full slate of new or re-energised candidates. The aim is to create a genuinely populist Democratic party, which neutralises Trump’s brutal demagoguery and speaks to people across the political spectrum who have been alienated by the corruption and drift of mainstream politics.Thanks in part to the supreme court’s disastrous Citizens United ruling, which removed the caps on political spending by lobbyists, US politics is dominated by billionaires and corporations, buying the candidates and policies they want. They can’t be outspent, but they can be outmanoeuvred, by recruiting incorruptible people who can speak past the money. Eventually, the Justice Democrats hope, there will be enough strong and inspiring people in Congress to overthrow this ruling and purge the institutional corruption from US politics.So far, the Democratic party has reacted in two distinct ways. Some senior figures, such as Nancy Pelosi and Tammy Duckworth, dismiss the significance of what Ocasio-Cortez has achieved. Others, such as Kirsten Gillibrand, have suddenly switched positions in response to her victory, echoing her call, for example, for the abolition of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, which has been separating children from their parents on the Mexican border. Both are forms of self-preservation, but if more revolutionary candidates win their races, the second variety is likely to prevail.By understanding how the great reversal in New York happened, we can begin to understand what this movement of outsiders might achieve. It could yet change the world."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d41b0c64ecefe57140463c503483fc7e8bf9f573/0_182_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c217267281d535f11df00e29f8976e01","title":"england world cup diverse english football team","story":"“Oh, to be in England  Now that April’s there,” wrote Browning, but he might have looked at that again after last weekend and decided it could bear revision. “Oh, to be in England’s capital as Gareth Southgate’s team march nonchalantly into the World Cup semi-finals,” perhaps. When people meet the glances of others, smile and know exactly what they are thinking. When strangers, merry and giddy, connect on the trains that usually symbolise an urban dystopia. When young Britons of many complexions sport England shirts and look as though they had won a modest bet.Sure, there was over-exuberance: “Two world wars and two world cups,” was one mindless chant as my train circuited east London.

They will claim this, was the lament. But they can’t.Because there is nothing about that team, with its youth and vigour and ersity and modernity, that would give nationalists any succour. What can they credibly say about a team born of the contemporary Britain they so despise, with its thoughtful, dignified manager, its melding of young men whose lineages originate far and wide – not least the Windrush generation grandchildren?

How can it be claimed by reactionary Brexiters whose only navigation tool is the rear-view mirror?England may not prevail tonight but already they have given us a moment. And isn’t that something for the government to think about? It can’t mandate bonhomie, but it can think again about the power of sport to create moments when a erse society finds common cause. And then it can start funding grassroots sport properly through the public purse on the basis that it yields public gain. It can take a hard line to ensure that events that drive a national mood and conversation are accessible to all, not just to those with pockets deep enough to view them via satellite dish or premium cable.It can think seriously about how and where and why those communal moments occur and what might be done to have more of them. A erse nation is a boon in the modern world. It is a fact of life. But it throws up challenges. Homogeneity is a thing of the past. Someone in government has to be thinking about the ties that, day to day and then on special days, bind us together?The World Cup shows what can be achieved, as did the 2012 Olympics.

Which is a shame because our culture loves romantic love. It’s an idea that pervades pop music, novels, TV and film. Somewhere out there our perfect match is waiting to meet us, so the theory goes. But maybe love isn’t really about The One. Maybe the early films of Richard Curtis don’t have all the answers.So what is love, actually? There are many answers to this question, says the anthropologist Anna Machin, but let’s start with an evolutionary explanation. Basically, love helps a species to cooperate. “We need to cooperate to survive, to subsist, to learn, to reproduce and to raise our children,” she says. “Romantic and parental love is essentially the neurochemical reward for cooperating, which is cognitively quite difficult.” It’s a kind of biological bribery, in other words.Love is the basis of animal attachment, distinct from lust or sex drive. But forget about the myth of love at first sight, Machin says. “There is lust at first sight. When someone experiences lust, their amygdala – the ancient, central part of the brain responsible for emotion – is releasing the neurochemicals dopamine and oxytocin. Dopamine is a general reward chemical, which makes you feel euphoric, warm and motivated to form a relationship with someone. Oxytocin works to lower your inhibitions to forming a relationship.” This attraction, Machin explains, is triggered by physical signs of a good mate, such as an ideal 0.7 waist-hip ratio in women or a highly symmetrical face.The neurochemical processes of love are more complex, and last longer than lust. As well as the amygdala, love involves the neocortex – the part of the brain responsible for social cognition. “That’s where all the trust, empathy, planning ahead and trying to coordinate your life with the person you’re in love with sits,” says Machin.During love, the brain is flooded with an opiate called beta-endorphin. “Beta-endorphin is addictive,” Machin says, “so when you’re in love with someone, you are addicted to the release of beta-endorphin you receive when you interact with them. When you’re away from them, you go into a kind of withdrawal. As a consequence you go back and get another hit.”Our experiences of love are influenced by factors beyond spontaneous emotion. Jess Carbino, a sociologist who works for the dating app Bumble, says the way we seek love is complex, but it’s “a romantic myth” to call it random. “People are very deliberate about finding love,” she says. “When we are looking for romantic partners, for example, people are very realistic about who they look for in the dating market, based on their own physical attractiveness.”Carbino reckons this dating market has always existed in some form the advent of online dating apps just made it more visible. “In theory, prior to the emergence of online dating, people were speculating about what the market was because they could only see a fraction of it. Now you’re embedded in a variety of markets online – not just your work market or your religious market, but every market available within a geographic radius within the age and gender you’re looking for.”It is these differing expectations and experiences that can cause relationships to fail, says Kathrine Bejanyan, a relationship consultant . “Where I see the biggest problem is not necessarily people falling in love, it’s sustaining it,” she explains. These clashes can stem from our family upbringing, for instance. “Say you grew up in a family where love was shown through giving gifts when you got a good grade, that person experienced gift-giving as an expression as love. Another person with a different upbringing might understand love and how to receive it differently.”From a theological perspective, says Werner Jeanrond, a Catholic theologian at Oxford University, “love invites us to a much deeper way of seeing”. Jeanrond says all forms of love are united and defined “by the challenge of otherness” (the “other” being the opposite of the self). Jeanrond argues that love involves engaging with otherness in at least four ways. “There is the other human being, in an intersubjective relationship. Then there is our relationship to the cosmos or the universe or nature. Then there is the question of God or ultimate reality – how can you relate to the radical other? And most problematic is our relationship to ourselves – can I love me?”The opposite of love is therefore not hatred but indifference, Jeanrond says. “I think people see that wrongly. Hatred is a warped love, but it is still interested and obsessed with the other. Indifference is the opposite of love because they don’t even see the other.”As Jeanrond points out, love is relative, erse and not always conspicuous. It has countless definitions, depending on who you ask. But perhaps the real mystery is how these definitions fit together.• Alfie Packham is the editor of  Students"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c48bc04249e0122c0592d8fa1becd00ed95e517/4703_0_3216_1930/master/3216.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b2b1dbb20a88c7670e9a1cdf0a3f7529","title":"museum snaps up panorama of lost london landscape","story":"Pierre Prévost’s seven-metre watercolour depicts city before great fire of 1834A unique panoramic view of a lost London landscape including the medieval sprawl of the old Palace of Westminster, captured before the great fire of 1834 destroyed the parliament buildings, has been acquired by the Museum of London.In 1815 the French artist Pierre Prévost must have spent weeks up in the towers of St Margarets capturing an improbably immaculate and sunlit cityscape in an infamously smoky and dirty city. The watercolour is almost seven metres long and was a study for an even more epic version, now lost, which was 30 metres long and exhibited in Paris in 1817. His only other surviving work on this scale, a view of Constantinople, is now in the Louvre.Curators are considering how to put it on temporary display at the museum’s current cramped space at the Barbican, but it will undoubtedly be a star attraction – just as such panoramas were in Georgian London, as the Imax films of their day – when the museum moves to its new site in the old Smithfield market buildings.The museum raised £200,000 including a grant from the Art Fund charity to buy the painting at a recent Sotheby’s auction. Stephen Deuchar, director of the charity, said its acquisition was a coup for the museum.The museum’s director, Sharon Ament, said there was nothing like it in its collection. “Not only does it highlight London as an important centre of international artistic exchange, it also reveals a fascinating moment in time.”Prévost, who died in 1823, was one of the most accomplished artists working at the height of the craze for panoramas, creating vistas of many major cities. The first purpose-built panorama theatre opened in London in 1792, closely followed by one in Paris, where crowds queued to pay a hefty three shillings to admire the paintings, dramatically lit and stretched around the curved walls of a darkened room. Some were toured in popup panorama theatres, a history that explains why so many known to have existed were destroyed by fire or simply worn out. Prévost made an earlier London view, now also lost, when he visited London after travel between England and France became possible again with the Peace of Amiens in 1802, before Europe was torn apart by the Napoleonic wars. He is thought to have returned when peace was restored after the Battle of Waterloo in 1815.His painting shows the city as the Duke of Wellington would have known it, with great parade spaces around Whitehall and Trafalgar Square, and Westminster Abbey dominating the foreground.

The Swedish Central Ethics Review Board concluded recently that six papers should be retracted as they falsely claimed that the artificial windpipe transplants he gave them were much more effective than they actually were. In fact, at least three of his patients died.The House of Commons science and technology committee, which I chair, has published its report today on research integrity. Research is how we seek to cure diseases, find ways of tackling climate change, and make the world a better place to live in. But how common is “research misconduct” – fabrication of data, dodgy uses of statistics or even outright research fraud – in the UK?It’s painfully difficult to know for sure, because the data coming out of universities on the number of allegations they investigate each year is either inconsistent or simply non-existent. The majority of universities publish an annual report on research integrity with figures, but at least a quarter don’t. A few told me that they won’t publish information because of confidentiality. When plenty of other institutions manage to find a way of presenting the information, this just leads to suspicion that some universities are simply acting to protect their reputation.Some universities told me that they haven’t seen a need to publish data on the number of investigations they hold simply because there haven’t been any investigations. That might sound like something to be proud of, but experts warned us that if a university consistently receives no allegations from year to year then that should actually be more of a cause for concern than those that conduct lots of investigations.On that basis, I’d actually like to see the number of investigations increasing across the country, to show that concerns are being detected and responded to appropriately. We need to take a mature approach to reporting misconduct figures that recognises that no human endeavour is immune to error, questionable practices, and even fraud.Worse still, a lack of consistent transparency leads to suspicion that some might also not be doing a good job of investigating misconduct when allegations are made. Are problems being swept under the carpet, with non-disclosure agreements hushing up embarrassing cases? There are examples of serial fraudsters moving from institution to institution, and at the moment there’s no recourse to an external body if the university isn’t doing a good job with its investigation.What’s needed is a way of independently verifying that universities are following their own procedures and that those procedures are robust. In Canada and Australia, a national committee exists to provide exactly that check, and we need to create our own version of this for the UK. This would help manage the inherent conflict of interest of universities investigating themselves, while keeping the primary responsibility for investigating with the employer.We need to have absolute confidence in the way that misconduct is handled. Any weaknesses in the system could be thrown into the spotlight by a future scandal, which might prompt a knee-jerk reaction of over-regulation, risking the independence and academic freedom that universities are rightly proud of.But we also need to look at the underlying pressures that can lead researchers to compromise on standards in the first place. The science and technology committee was told that the pressure to secure publications – and to publish exciting, ground-breaking results in the top journals – can be enormous. Perhaps ignoring one data point might make the difference between being able to report a statistically significant finding and the prospect of a highly-cited article and, on the other hand, another inconclusive result. It was even suggested to us that the UK has lost sight of what science actually is. One of the witnesses to our inquiry told us that science “is not about the ultimate quest for ‘truth’, but instead involves incremental progress, careful checking and verification.The good news is that the Research Excellence Framework, which determines a significant proportion of university funding by assessing the quality of research produced – will in the future attempt to measure research integrity as part of this process. My hope is that this will make sure that any institution with the wrong culture will be pushed back in the right direction.Earlier this year the Prime Minister described scientific research as “a noble pursuit and a public good”. It can be both of those things, but without a reliable approach to research integrity it could too easily be neither. Public trust in researchers is currently very high, but if research integrity is not tackled head on then there’s a risk that public perception might plummet. We’ve been told that “we’ve had enough of experts” in the context of Brexit – let’s make sure the same conclusion is never drawn about science.Norman Lamb is chair of the Commons Science and Technology Committee and MP for North Norfolk.

What can the team’s approach teach us all about facing fear and failure?This week, the England midfielder Dele Alli was asked if he was nervous about the big tests up ahead: first, of course, the team’s semi-final against Croatia on Wednesday. “Excited, not nervous,” he replied. His apparent happiness and confidence reflected an England team that seems transformed from previous incarnations. Where once it was stuffed with entitled, surly stars, burdened with the weight of history and the pressure of expectations, it now comes across as a hungry, humble team, playing with lightness and joy.“We’ve spoken to the players about writing their own stories,” said the manager, Gareth Southgate, after the team beat Colombia in an unprecedentedly victorious (for England) penalty shootout. “Tonight they showed they don’t have to conform to what’s gone before. They have created their own history … We always have to believe in what is possible in life and not be hindered by history or expectations.”The team appears in a better place psychologically than it has for generations. Much of the credit has gone to Southgate, but also to Pippa Grange, the team psychologist, who has been working behind the scenes. “She’s an amazing person,” Alli said on Monday. “Everyone listens to her when she talks.”Grange was appointed by the FA as its head of people and team development in November last year, given the job of building resilience while confronting the pressures and psychodramas faced by previous England squads. The FA has said it searched globally for the right person for the job, but Grange, like most of the young players, isn’t an obvious superstar in her field there is no self-promoting social media presence or bestselling self-development books.She wrote in 2013 that being a woman in a male team environment “is a constant navigation, for everyone. I have no interest in being one of the lads and I don’t quite fit in the ‘nurturing mother figure’ category in terms of the leadership work I do. I would be professionally ineffective if I remained in the background, psychologically safe with minimal voice, and I am not here to be the centre of attention as some form of entertainment. I don’t want to be completely separate because that would make me inaccessible and probably be a lonely place to operate from.”The midfielder Eric Dier said: “I think a lot of the work that we’ve done with her has been prior to the tournament starting, over the last six or seven months.” This has reportedly included getting the players to sit down together in small groups to share their life experiences and anxieties, and to reveal intimate truths about their character and what drives them. The point, Southgate has said, is to build trust, “making them closer, with a better understanding of each other”.The England football team has focused on the mental side of the game before, most prominently with the psychiatrist Steve Peters, who was recruited before the 2014 World Cup. What is new is the extent to which psychology has been embraced (prior to Grange’s appointment, the performance consultancy Lane 4 was working with the FA on psychological tactics). Access to Peters, it was reported, was offered to the players only if they felt they needed it – and not many would have admitted to wanting help.“The whole group must buy into the idea that the sports psychologist has come with a specific set of skills and practices that are really worthwhile,” says Andy Lane, the professor of sport and learning at the University of Wolverhampton. “A recent turnaround in professional soccer is the preparedness to use sports science in an integrated way. It’s that acceptance by the whole group that gives one professional the chance to be effective.” Much of that culture shift will have been down to Southgate, who has shown his support for Grange, whom he clearly respects. “She is a strong and important addition to the team,” the manager said in May.Grange is a fan of inspirational quotes, from Oscar Wilde to Nelson Mandela to Michael Jordan some adorn the training gym walls (“Success isn’t given, it’s earned,” reads one). She is also said to encourage the players to get off their phones and play games with each other – including one in the hotel pool with inflatable unicorns after the win against Tunisia in the group stages and she is said to dislike social media, which she expects the players to use wisely. Southgate hasn’t banned social media – unlike previous managers, he hasn’t appeared to ban anything – but has apparently taken Grange’s thoughts on board. While he acknowledged it was good for the players to engage with fans, he added: “Personally, I’m not sure there’s value to reading comments that come in. It comes back to: what creates pressure, or what creates misery in your life?”Michael Caulfield, a sport psychologist and the co-director of the consultancy Sporting Edge, says Southgate, with whom he worked at Middlesbrough, has a leadership style “built on incredible levels of trust between him and his players and staff. He was determined to convince the team there was nothing to fear from playing in the World Cup for England, whereas in the past people were nervous or fearful. He was determined to change that mindset from one of fear to one of adventure. That’s the biggest thing he’s done.”When someone is under a moment of extreme pressure, using a tactic such as mental cues can be helpful, says Kate Hays, the head of psychology at the English Institute of Sport. “People will have cue words that will bring them back into focus on the task at hand – for some, they could be emotional cues for others, it could be technically focused. It’s just one or two words that can get people to focus on the right thing.”Southgate, who has experienced his own disappointments – that missed penalty at the semi-finals of Euro 96, and his managerial career at Middlesbrough ending in relegation – has said as much: “I have learned from things that have gone wrong and had to pick myself up … Because of those failures, I feel it gives you the freedom of being able to say, ‘How might we be the best possible team?’ and not be afraid of what goes wrong – because whatever goes wrong we can deal with, as I have lived through it.”Grange has no fear of failure either. She has written: “I’d like to turn this unhealthy preoccupation with success on its head and put it on the record that I think failure is really useful. For without failure we cannot progress longer, higher or faster. It’s a funny paradox – our successes are achieved through trying, and trying most often ends in failure. Every day in our general lives and our sporting lives we will win some and lose some it’s just part of the way life should be. It could be missing out on a promotion, being pipped at the line in a running race or bombing out in an exam – it doesn’t matter – the important lesson is to learn from our failures, reassess, rethink, move forward (sometimes in a different direction) and keep those dreams and goals alive.”Kevin George, the author of Soccology, who works with clubs and coaches on performance, also says that respecting the inidual qualities and personalities of your players (or your employees) is key. “To instil confidence in one player might be to give them freedom, so they know you trust them,” he says. “For somebody else, it might be a lot of praise. For a group of people, you have to tap into who they are inidually, but as a group, give them the belief that you trust them.” Singling people out for praise in a group setting can be tricky, he adds. “People can think: ‘That person’s a favourite, I’m not a favourite.’ It is tough.” Southgate doesn’t play favourites everyone feels as if they have a chance.The era of hard-talking, tyrannical managers is over – both on and off the pitch. “Football, which I love and work in, is really bad at talking,” says Caulfield. “It does instructing and telling off but it doesn’t do talking and listening and empathy that well. It sounds a bit fluffy but that’s the world in which we now live, and the world in which these players have grown up.” Southgate, he says, realised early in his coaching career that instilling fear wasn’t going to work. “We all need a telling-off now and then – and he’s good at that, by the way – but you’ll get far more from putting your faith in people than you will anything else. People had this lazy opinion that he’s too ‘nice’ and they see kindness as weakness, but it’s the most unbelievable strength if you use it in the right way.”As for nerves, it is a mistake to think it is essential or even desirable to eliminate them – from sport or from life. Caulfield says they can be “wonderful. They keep you alive and make you realise something important is about to happen. If you discuss what the nerves mean to you and how you deal with them, then they don’t become a threat to you. They become this wonderful cortisol that runs through your veins and you deal with the problem, and then you rest afterwards.” With or without an inflatable unicorn.• Don’t fear failure. “Part of what it takes to be courageous is overcoming the constant battle between the desire for what we want and the fear of failure. Most of us don’t expose ourselves because we are fearful,” writes Grange.• Reframe emotions: you’re not “nervous”, you’re “excited” a penalty shootoutjob interviewimportant speech is not something to dread, it’s an “opportunity”.• Positive thinking is unhelpful if you’re simply fantasising about achieving an Oscarthe World Cupa fuller social life.

Does he play Luka Modric and Ivan Rakitic deep with Andrej Kramaric in front of them (Fig 1), or does he do what he did against Argentina and Denmark and bring in a more orthodox holding midfielder?The former has the advantage of offering more direct support for Mario Mandzukic so there is somebody to pick up the second ball when he wins knockdowns or to capitalise when he pulls wide and crosses, as Kramaric did against Russia. Modric and Rakitic can then try to control possession and the tempo from deep in midfield. The danger for Croatia is that Modric ends up too deep, unable to exert the sort of influence he did against Argentina, too tied up with trying to stifle Dele Alli to hurt England.The other option is to bring in Marcelo Brozovic (Fig 2), or perhaps Milan Badelj. That liberates Modric and Rakitic – although Rakitic spent much of that Argentina game tracking Lionel Messi – and poses a problem for England by placing two men in Jordan Henderson’s zone.That would mean Alli having to drop off, assuming England maintain the same triangle in midfield rather than bringing in Eric Dier to play alongside Henderson, or, perhaps, England could rely on one of the back three to step up to offer support at the back of midfield. That would still leave them with two men against a lone centre-forward, which would have the advantage of Alli and Jesse Lingard overmanning in transition against a single holding midfielder.That said, England do have the advantage of Kyle Walker, who plays at full-back for his club, playing on the right of the three central defenders, so if Trippier is caught upfield, he should be comfortable covering. And there is the possibility of using a Croatian strength against them if Trippier drives past Perisic, Ivan Strinic can be left isolated. (Fig 3) The situation is reminiscent of what happened when the sides met in Zagreb in September 2008 – there Rakitic was the attacking left-sided Croatian who left his full-back Danijel Pranjic exposed, leading to Theo Walcott’s only international hat-trick and a 4-1 England win.England have scored five of their 11 goals from set plays and two penalties have resulted from fouls on Harry Kane conceded in the mêlée England’s corner routine produces. The focus on corners has been Gareth Southgate’s indisputable triumph, a recognition of a way a national manager can make a tangible difference in the relatively short time available to him.A line of four players at the edge of the box, one of whom stands still as the ball is delivered while the others scatter, rather like a queue in a Tesco  suddenly realising additional checkouts are about to be opened. Not only does the static player plus his marker serve as a barrier to help create channels for Kane and Harry Maguire but the flurry of movement seems to provoke opponents into making panicky grabs at English shirts.Queueing while pointing out foreigners committing infractions of etiquette, of course, has been an English strength for years Southgate’s genius has been to weaponise it.Croatia will study England’s movement and have enough beefy defenders that they should not be physically intimidated, but then the same could have been said of Sweden, against whom Southgate deployed a variant with two queues of three players. There will surely be further routines waiting to be unveiled and England will have observed how poorly Croatia conceded the late corner against Russia that brought Mário Fernandes’s equaliser.Denmark, meanwhile, scored against them from a long throw into the box and Iceland’s Sverrir Ingi Ingason headed against the bar from a corner in the group stage.England’s prowess from set plays can also have knock-on benefits if defenders become so anxious at the prospect of conceding a set play that it makes them, in open play, reluctant to concede corners. A moment’s hesitation, or an over-ambitious attempt to play out from the back could present England with opportunities.Both England and Croatia needed penalties to progress from their last-16 ties, with Croatia then becoming only the second team in World Cup history to win multiple shootouts in the same tournament (either side in Croatia’s last-16 match would have matched the achievement of Argentina in 1990, as Russia had knocked Spain out via the same method in their previous game). Winning games on penalties, though, tends not to be a sign of long-term health. Excluding finals, there have been 28 penalty shootouts in World Cup history: only eight of the victors have gone on to win their next game within 120 minutes, and one of those was playing a side that had also progressed by means of penalties.Modric has looked in danger of resurrecting a World Cup tradition of the most technically gifted players failing from the spot (Socrates, Michel Platini, Dragan Stojkovic, Diego Maradona, Chris Waddle …). He saw his kick saved in extra time against Denmark and his two penalties in shootouts have both been unconvincing. His effort against Denmark was nervous, straight down the middle and only just avoided the trailing foot of the goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel, while against Russia Igor Akinfeev reached a shot that was nowhere near the corner but was able only to push it on to the post from where it cannoned in. He is not a taker to be relied upon.Amid all the euphoria, it is perhaps worth remembering that the only teams England have actually beaten in this World Cup are Tunisia, Panama and Sweden. Although England’s defence coped well against Radamel Falcao, they were undone by Yerry Mina from that late Colombia corner.It is never wise to read too much into one moment in one game but, if that hinted at a vulnerability to an aerial threat at the back, it is one Croatia’s Mario Mandzukic is ideally suited to take advantage of. The 32-year-old Juventus forward has won 17 of the 30 aerial duels he has been involved in at this World Cup. Assuming he is fully fit – he limped through the final minutes of the quarter-final – he poses an aggressive and mobile threat."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62d23dae0a58dd49ff599445f9a4f48ed72b6905/0_199_3040_1824/master/3040.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7590dc9a67bbcd4b0e78918371365bf2","title":"england fan memories world cup semi final","story":"Inspired by the exploits of Bobby Robson’s team at Italia 90, a journey at times painful has led back to those heightsSport makes fools of us all – though sometimes in the best of ways. Russia 2018 was supposed to be the first major tournament in Europe I had missed since failing to go to Italia 90, but Gareth Southgate had other ideas.I was there at Euro 96 when he did not “just belt it, son” against Germany, as his mother put it, so I have seen England go out on penalties in a tournament’s last four. But an odyssey inspired by one World Cup semi-final will finally lead to another, provided my flights get me to Moscow on time on Wednesday afternoon. There have been some wonderful highs along the way – my biggest regrets are the matches I missed – yet it has undeniably been a torturous wait.Logically, given 1990 was the first tournament summer of my life not dominated by exams, I should have been at Italia 90. My first England game had been five years earlier, seeing Gary Lineker scoring his first international goal against the Republic of Ireland. Several of those exams I had sat had been in Italian, too. Then a work opportunity arose that made staying in London the “smart” option though it proved that way professionally, when Bobby Robson’s side went all the way to Turin, as an England fan “smart” left me smarting. I was not going to be caught out again.Two years later, therefore, I was in Stockholm when David Platt finally scored our first goal of Euro 92, and 1-0 up at half-time we were on the verge of another semi-final. OK, so enduring the 0-0s in Malmö against Denmark and France had been painful, but now Graham Taylor’s team were back on track. Sweden and Tomas Brolin staged a derailment, however, and away from home, at least, it proved to be the start of a trend, not a blip.Worse was to follow – I finally went to a World Cup at USA 94 but without a team to support – before my generation’s second summer of hope and wonder, at home in 1996. By then it was not purely about my compatriots. Five non-England games at Euro 92, capped by Denmark’s final upset of Germany, had given me the tournament bug, confirmed by USA 94.Seeing 12 matches in a home finals, at six of the eight venues, remains a treasured experience and one commemorated at least twice daily via a “Newcastle Euro 96” keyring. Yet the vivid memories of England’s post-hitting, penalty‑missing exit would be the only ones of a semi-final to sustain me for two more decades.The last memory of Wednesday 26 June 1996 – of the long, silent trudge to Wembley Park tube station and being aggressively threatened for trying to look for a silver lining – is sadly redolent of what followed far too often, given the behaviour of some of the team’s followers. In Marseille in 1998 there was the sting of teargas Euro 2000 was as pathetic off the pitch as it was on it, such as the moment I overheard one Brummie telling a Belgian barman matter-of-factly: “If wasn’t for the English you’d be a Kraut.” If you follow England because you love football and the team rather than because you hate other countries, you do find yourself doing an awful lot of apologising on behalf of others on occasion, the desire to show that not all England fans are obsessed with the second world war and Northern Ireland becomes a justification for putting up with it all.‘It all” includes successive quarter-final penalty shootout defeats to Portugal, at Euro 2004 and the 2006 World Cup watching Italy lose a quarter-final shootout to Spain at Euro 2008 (because I go even if England don’t) then seeing the Azzurri win one four years later, against Roy Hodgson’s side in Kiev. Then there’s having to skip the group stages in 2010 and the team coming close to elimination even before I arrived in South Africa, just in time for a 4-1 defeat by Germany, complete with Frank Lampard’s technology-inspiring disallowed goal.I wasn’t there all the time. In 2001‑02 my employers were imploding and I feared for my job so did not go to South Korea and Japan I found out that, yes, I was going to be made redundant one hour after we lost in the quarter-final to Brazil. Brazil 2014 was domestically impossible. Two years ago, though, I was in Nice for the easiest last-16 game anyone could have asked for. I still have my unused vouchers to collect my tickets for England’s Euro 2016 quarter-final, semi-final, final …Iceland’s win is not why I didn’t set out to go to Russia the reason were its hooligans and two doses of politics, namely the awarding in December 2010 of the finals to the country in the first place and the international situation. Donetsk, where I happily watched England at Euro 2012, is now a war zone. Just in case, though, and certain that I’d merely receive the traditional FifaUefa refund for unused England vouchers, I did cough up for the semi-final and the final.Now, finally, it may be time to retire that Newcastle Euro 96 keyring. Thank you, Gareth."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b38260371ce26376b4aa6007608aee8f1b8e79e/0_257_4742_2845/master/4742.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ec3591f71a43c6f73b367acfdf499aed","title":"liverpool confident of signing swiss world cup hero stoke xherdan shaqiri","story":"Liverpool are confident of making Xherdan Shaqiri their third summer signing after opening transfer talks with Stoke City over the Switzerland international.Jürgen Klopp is keen to add the 26-year-old to his attacking options for next season and the winger wants to remain in the Premier League following Stoke’s relegation to the Championship.

The huge weight of English footballing culture makes it difficult for their style to change overnight and acquire a levity that would allow it to take flight – as if somewhere in the footballing instinct of these players with a fresh talent and an indisputable commitment to a new idea there is still something rigid that refuses to die. In order for this new style, played along the floor, to grow and spread like ivy, covering everything and taking root, collective intelligence is necessary.An intelligence that, for example, ensures the best player in the team – in England’s case, Harry Kane – is involved as often as his quality demands. If the best player does not come into contact with the game sufficiently for the opposition to feel intimidated and his own team to grow, there is something wrong either with the player (I don’t think so) or with the team.It seems to me England are attempting to make that happen the right way, that they are heading in the right direction. To judge by the results, they are succeeding, although Gareth Southgate has said this is a process that is still not complete and I would agree. I understand there is always a risk implicit in contradicting results – which are God these days – but I feel like that attempt still feels a little forced it doesn’t feel entirely natural.What do I mean by natural? It’s hard to explain but easy to see: look at Luka Modric, the greatest threat to England, and you will understand. He’s prodigious playing this game – and, so they tell me, every other game too – as if he was born with some muscular intelligence applicable to any activity expressed through a ball. Modric honours that natural advantage by playing with passion, enjoying what he does. He kills himself out there and yet for a superior talent like him, that does not count as sacrifice or suffering. Maybe we can call it a challenge, a test, a very particular type of fun.We’re not talking about a gift like Diego Maradona’s, rather one that consists filling the game with common sense. He doesn’t do impossible things when he plays a pass, you see it and think: ‘That’s what I would have done.’ We love to draw conclusions like that when we watch games but we should not believe what we say. In fact, what Modric does only Modric does.When the ball passes by his feet, the play flows as if football was the easiest thing in the world. It’s not about adding intensity or danger to the move it’s about adding sense, clarity, intent. At a World Cup at which it seems like spaces are disappearing – which is strange, considering the pitch still measures 100 x 70 – and everyone who gets the ball seems to be in a hurry, as if the entire pitch was penalty area, Modric performs the miracle of allowing the move to breathe, giving the ball the necessary speed, wherever it is on the field. Suddenly, we discover space and time do exist and that all that was needed was someone with the talent to bring them back, to make them what they always were. Someone who knows how to play football. Or better still, PLAY FOOTBALL in capital letters.The other characteristic the Croat has that doesn’t just convince me but fills me with emotion is his commitment to the game when his team have the ball and also when they lose it – from the first minute to the last. Against Russia, he won possession 15 times. In Sochi he struggled to find the game’s pulse, its rhythm, but as it went on, he came to understand what the game needed to the point at which he took control, running it.At the end of extra time, frustrated in his last attempt to attack Russia’s castle, fortified and so well defended, he fell to his knees exhausted. I could have cast a mould of him right there, producing a statue in honour of an exemplary, model footballer to be erected at every pitch everywhere in the world with a simple quote: “This is how you play football, this is how you feel football.”And to complete the admiration, we should talk, too, of a kind of competitive maturity I wouldn’t say has been lost exactly but I do think has been forgotten amid the importance we seem to place on players who over-act. Modric is everywhere, he wants every ball, he runs as much as a responsible understanding of the game allows, but he never allows himself a single act of demagoguery. As if he believed the 80,000 spectators in the ground were intelligent enough to appreciate dignity. Or, better still, as if they didn’t exist. He does not feel the pull of populism, nor any temptation to play to the gallery. He is too focused on football, submitting his five senses to the game itself.As intelligence – both muscular intelligence and intelligence as we have always understood it – is not so visible to the average fan, and as discretion has little market value, Modric will not win the Ballon d’Or, just as Andrés Iniesta did not win it in the generation before him. But that’s not his responsibility that’s the responsibility of all of us who have turned football into a world where appearance is more powerful than substance."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4375389a4051480e69d6ca1cf16f68fe1466567/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=1200\u0026amp;h=630\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;crop=faces%2Centropy\u0026amp;bm=normal\u0026amp;ba=bottom%2Cleft\u0026amp;blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly9hc3NldHMuZ3VpbS5jby51ay9pbWFnZXMvb3ZlcmxheXMvZDM1ODZhNWVmNTc4MTc1NmQyMWEzYjYzNWU1MTcxNDEvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc=\u0026amp;s=3632004a2782dc1107dee058a4cb68a1","title":"transfer round up andriy yarmolenko west ham united arsenal matteo guendouzi","story":"West Ham United have made Ukraine international Andriy Yarmolenko their fifth recruit of the summer transfer window. The striker has joined the Hammers from Borussia Dortmund on a four-year contract for an undisclosed fee.“I am very happy to sign for West Ham United,” said the 28-year-old. “West Ham is a big club with good fans and I am happy to come to play in the Premier League. The Premier League is the best league in the world and I know that an interesting project is being built here at West Ham. The team wants to achieve high things and I am excited for this challenge.”Director of football Mario Husillos said: “When we had the opportunity to sign him, we did not hesitate, because he really is the kind of player that we were looking for. He is a left-footed player but can play on the right and is very quick, very good one-on-one against a defender. He gives the team a lot of attacking options and scores goals, is fast on the counter-attack and provides aerial threat with his height.”West Ham are continuing to pursue Felipe Anderson of Lazio despite landing Yarmolenko and are understood to be confident of agreeing a deal with Corinthians to sign the Paraguayan defender Fabián Balbuena, although there would be work permit issues to overcome.Meanwhile, French teenager Matteo Guendouzi has joined Arsenal from Lorient, the Premier League club have announced. The signing of midfielder Guendouzi, 19, follows the capture of Uruguay international Lucas Torreira on Tuesday and becomes new manager Unai Emery’s fifth addition of the summer.Guendouzi started at Paris St Germain before moving to Ligue 2 side Lorient’s academy in 2014. He made his debut two years later, making 30 appearances, and has represented France at the nation’s under-18, under-19 and under-20 levels.“We are delighted Matteo is joining us,” said Arsenal boss Emery. “He is a talented young player and a lot of clubs were interested in him. He has big potential and gained good first-team experience last season with Lorient. He wants to learn and improve and will be an important part of our first-team squad.”“Arsenal have always been the team closest to my heart and a side I’ve wanted to join since I was a child,” Guendouzi, who will wear the number 29 shirt, said. “It gives me great pride – it’s incredible. I hope I can do great things here. It doesn’t get any better than coming to a club like this, with so much history, like Arsenal. I’m hugely proud.He added: “I want to win titles, titles, titles. I want to establish myself here, which would be amazing. Winning silverware, as I said, is very important to me and winning things here at Arsenal would be incredible.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18f0b34451486dec71bacee0433c8b14897fd9f4/0_141_3840_2304/master/3840.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b7394f67f58b64286e9a6dfcb16cc291","title":"france into the final as destiny calls for england world cup football daily","story":"Max and co discuss France becoming the first finalist of the 2018 World Cup, a Thibaut Courtois post-match meltdown, England’s hopes, dreams and fears, Cristiano Ronaldo’s move and Welsh nightmares."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14729d5fb051983bcb2bb65b652c1d213da73609/0_0_3930_2359/master/3930.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=deef767f3e8396887b30d347bb1e3b30","title":"cristiano ronaldo 100m juventus real madrid transfer","story":"To pay such a sum for a player surely past his peak seems a risk but the Italian champions have not made many mistakes latelyCristiano Ronaldo described it in matter-of-fact terms as “the moment to begin a new cycle”. In Italy the headline writers went a little bigger as they hailed Juventus’s capture of the Portugal forward as “the deal of the century”.Even the club’s most optimistic supporters might not have dreamed such a thing possible at the start of this summer. A five-times Ballon d’Or winner coming to Turin? No Serie A player had even finished among the top three vote winners for that award since Kaká won it in 2007.So much has changed in the intervening years. The prestige of Spanish football waxed just as Italian football waned. When the Milan owner, Silvio Berlusconi, shared his “dream” of signing Ronaldo at the start of this decade, the player responded with a politician’s turn of phrase, saying that Serie A was “not the league I like the most”.Juventus were only just returning to the forefront of the domestic game. Dumped into Serie B in 2006 for their part in the Calciopoli scandal, they took six years to become champions of Italy once more. They have not looked back since, claiming seven consecutive league titles and four straight domestic doubles, as well as reaching the final of the Champions League in two of the past four years.Such sustained success is no accident. Juventus developed a business plan and followed through, from the construction of Serie A’s first modern, club-owned stadium in 2010 to their rebranding with a new, social media-friendly logo last year.Above all, though, they have made superlative moves in the transfer market. Year after year Juventus have found value where others missed it. Andrea Pirlo, Sami Khedira and Dani Alves joined on free transfers. Carlos Tevez cost an initial €9m. Paul Pogba was signed and then flipped back to Manchester United four years later for a roughly €70m profit (once Mino Raiola’s agent’s fees had been deducted).On the surface that might seem like an impossible indulgence for a club that is expected to report a small loss on its accounts for the past season. The reality might be the exact opposite.For all their impressive growth in recent years, the concern for Juventus has always been that they would be limited by the simple fact of competing in a league whose international brand continues to lag behind those of La Liga and the Premier League.Despite reaching the Champions League final in 2017 the club are still ranked only 10th in Deloitte’s Money League, with revenues less than two-thirds the size of Manchester United, Real Madrid or Barcelona.The signing of Ronaldo is designed to change that. You might even say that Juventus are taking a page out of Madrid’s own play book. There were plenty who scoffed at the Spanish club’s €37m outlay on David Beckham in the summer of 2003. Florentino Pérez knew he was getting a steal for a player who would bring far more than that into his club’s coffers.Ronaldo had already transformed Juventus’s finances before he even agreed terms. As rumours of his impending arrival increased in recent days, the club’s share price soared. The newspaper Secolo XIX noted on Thursday that the club’s market valuation had risen from €665m to €815m – enough (notionally) to cover the player’s transfer fee. After a dip, those numbers have continued to rise.And while Ronaldo is older now than Beckham was then, he is also a more impactful player. Ronaldo might be slowing down but he still scored 44 goals last season, including two goals and an assist against Juventus in their own stadium in the quarter-finals of the Champions League.Do we even need to ask how he will fit into this Juventus side? Massimiliano Allegri is an arch-pragmatist who has adapted his team countless times already during his four years in charge, maintaining his team’s domestic dominance through the departures of Tevez, Pogba, Leonardo Bonucci and many more besides."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4008eb5b04609d5e7092a493bde7c172f347e68/0_110_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b71b998c6528aca2813da4b58e7ec41","title":"world cup 2018 france into the final plus croatia v england buildup live","story":"An answer to Rosa O’Rourke’s question about the shape of the blob flags before games in Russia. The UK is now the most obese nation in Western Europe. Twenty-eight per cent of children between two and 15 are overweight – and Barney Ronay believes England’s run at the World Cup should be used for the greater good and inspire youngsters at grassroots level to be healthier in a way that the Olympics failed to do. “My family have been debating a very important question all tournament - during the anthems, what shape are the weird flag blobs meant to be? Our guesses have included hearts, tears, and a location pin like on google maps, but we can’t find the answer anywhere! Can the famous  investigative journalism help us settle this argument?” asks Rosa O’Rourke. I would love to be able to tell you Rosa, but our investigative journalist David Conn is busy. So I’ll plump for teardrops, because football makes us all cry a little, even if it’s just inside.Ralph Brown has been busy pulling apart the lyrics to Three Lions to give us a glimpse into the glass-half-empty English psyche. Superstitions eh? I suspect James Walsh won’t be the only England fan avoiding walking under ladders, blanking a black cat or swerving cracks in the pavement today: “I am struggling with my own Jagger’s jinx for tonight. A friend has invited me over to watch the match, but it is well known that the specific combination of me in that guy’s house ends in embarrassing English defeat regardless of format or feasibility – a record dating back to the 2007 cricket World Cup, despite the best efforts of future PM Ravinder Bopara. He has admittedly since moved down the road, but the one match of this World Cup I’ve seen at his new place was … Belgium 1-0 England. Should I just lock myself in the shed?” Maybe, but perhaps take a bucket.Croatia have another stellar midfielder you know – and David Hytner has written this lovely piece about the man who is happy to be put on the spot.The pressure is intense, never more than on that walk from the halfway line when teammates are begging you to please, please, please score and every step seems an eternity. Yet, on the outside at least, he walked calmly into the next round, taking Croatia with him, making history. It is more than penalties too, there is something in that idea that defines him well beyond the spot, the safety in knowing he is there, when needed and what is needed.An intriguing battle in tonight’s game will be that between Harry Kane and Dejan Lovren, who had a nightmare against Tottenham last October and was hauled off after 31 minutes of Liverpool’s 4-1 defeat. In Croatia’s press conference he was asked whether this game would be on his mind, and was a little bit miffed. I don’t know what to say in response to this question. It’s completely irrelevant, that 4-1 defeat. Why didn’t you ask me how I played well against him in other games? You’re just nit-picking in terms of my performances.To be fair to Lovren, he has recovered remarkably well since that low point, having got over a debilitating back injury and then benefited from having Virgil van Dijk as his partner in central defence at Liverpool. He played brilliantly in the Champions League games and appears so much more assured now. Croatia’s best chance of upsetting Lovren could be if Kane drops deep and pulls him out of position. Prhaps then Raheem Sterling or Dele Alli could find space in behind. The state of the world right here, summed up by corporate banter between the public transport authorities of Paris and Brussels. Here’s the story via Reuters: Brussels commuters, heading to work the morning after Belgium’s painful World Cup loss to France, had to endure the French soccer anthem piped through the city’s metro on Wednesday.The reason: not only did the national team lose 1-0 in Tuesday’s semi-final but also the Brussels public transport authority lost a bet with its Parisian counterpart. Before the match, the two groups challenged each other on social media. If Belgium won, Paris would change signs at its Saint-Lazare station to “Saint Hazard” in honour of Belgian whirlwind midfielder Eden Hazard. But after the “Golden Generation’s” defeat in St Petersburg, Brussels instead had to “treat” travellers to the anthem “Tous Ensemble” -All together - by late French rocker Johnny Hallyday at 8 and 10 am. At least Hallyday’s father was a Belgian. The country honoured the singer’s heritage when he died last year, playing his greatest hits on trains and over loudspeakers on the Grand Place in central Brussels.I asked you which other players have lost a European Cup final and World Cup final in the same year and you didn’t disappoint. The sorry list of big time double-losers is:Thierry Henry (Arsenal and France 2006)Karl-Heinz Rummenigge and Paul Breitner (West Germany and Bayern Munich 1982)Arjen Robben and Mark van Bommel (Bayern Munich and Netherlands 2010)Nils Liedholm (Milan and Sweden 1958)“Nils Liedholm managed to do the unwanted double of losing the European Cup final and the World Cup final in the same year at the earliest opportunity. In May 1958, he captained Milan to a 3-2 defeat against the great Real Madrid team of Di Stefano and Kopa, after being 1-0 and 2-1 up - just over a month later, he opened the scoring for Sweden against Brazil, only to lose 5-2 to Pele and Garrincha’s mob,” writes Phili Laing.If you want to know if what the longest assist in World Cup history is then today’s edition of The Knowledge is required reading. It also reveals who the lowest-ranked English-based World Cup 2018 player is while Rob Smyth busts the Italia 90 Dave Beasant myth.Now you might think Jordan Henderson’s ability to nullify Luka Modric, Kieran Trippier’s explosive runs from right wing-back or Dele Alli’s knack of arriving in the box with impeccable timing might determine whether England make it to the World Cup final by beating Cratia tonight. But we all know it will come down to the Jagger Jinx. If the Rolling Stones frontman turns up in Moscow tonight, England are doomed. He did for Belgium’s hopes last night and he did for Brazil’s in 2014 too. Poor Mick’s even be blamed for obliterating Australia’s hopes of winning the 2015 Rugby World Cup because his former partner, Jerry Hall, turned up at that one. Here’s a piece from 2014 explaining the Jagger Jinx.And having looked at the shimmering list of players who have won the World Cup and European Cup in the same year, what about those who have lost a European Cup final and World Cup final within the space of a couple of months.The only one I can recall is Michael Ballack, who lost the European Cup final with Bayer Leverkusen in 2002 and then went on to lose the World Cup final with Germany when Ronaldo tore them apart for Brazil. Players who could get to experience that acute misery on Sunday are England’s Trent Alexander-Arnold and Jordan Henderson, or Croatia’s Dejan Lovren, all of whom experienced defeat for Liverpool against Real Madrid in Kiev. Any more to join Ballack? Let me know. Stat time! If Raphael Varane goes on to win the World Cup he will join an exclusive group of players who have won the European Cup and World Cup in the same year. There are 10 at the moment. Here they are:Uli Hoeness, Gerd Müller, Franz Beckenbauer, Paul Breitner, Hans-Georg Schwarzenbeck, Sepp Maier and Jupp Kapellmann (Bayern Munich and Germany 1974)Christian Karembeu (Real Madrid and France 1998 ), Roberto Carlos (Real Madrid and Brazil 2002) and Sami Khedira (Real Madrid and Germany 2014)Sachin Nakrani has been busy crunching the numbers at  Towers to work out just where England rank in this World Cup. One of the best stats in this piece is not even England-related. It shows that Spain players still boss the passes completed section thanks to shuffling a million passes sideways and backwards in the last 16 against Russia.Amar Breckenridge believes a Belgian coach’s influence on Didier Deschamps might explain why the France team are playing such functional but successful football in Russia. “Didier Deschamps’s major achievements in France were winning the inaugural Champions League with Marseille in 1993 ( the first and only time a French club has won the title) and the World Cup in 1998 and Euros in 2000. All these were won on the back of iron discipline. In Marseille’s case that was masterminded by Belgian coach Raymond Goethals - nicknamed ‘La Science’ - and it’s hard not to see the late Goethal’s influence last night against, ironically, his homeland. And for all that we remember the exploits of Zinedine Zidane for France, the basis of France’s success was their defence – Blanc, Thuram, Lizarezu and Desailly, with Deschamps in front of them. France never lost when that back four played together. Given that background, Deschamps would never become the exponent of expansive play. Once derided by Eric Cantona as Zidane’s ‘water-carrier’, Deschamps is banking on his calculated approach to take France to a second title.”Jorge Valdano has penned some brilliant columns for the  during the World Cup and his latest, on Luka Modric, is another wonderful piece of writing, getting to the heart of what it is hat makes the Croatia captain so damn good at football. Here’s an extract: When the ball passes by his feet, the play flows as if football was the easiest thing in the world. It’s not about adding intensity or danger to the move it’s about adding sense, clarity, intent. At a World Cup at which it seems like spaces are disappearing – which is strange, considering the pitch still measures 100 x 70 – and everyone who gets the ball seems to be in a hurry, as if the entire pitch was penalty area, Modric performs the miracle of allowing the move to breathe, giving the ball the necessary speed, wherever it is on the field. Suddenly, we discover space and time do exist and that all that was needed was someone with the talent to bring them back, to make them what they always were. Someone who knows how to play football. Or better still, PLAY FOOTBALL in capital letters.More on the question of whether the FA has fixed English football. Here’s Luke Harrison: “I am with Chaps on this.... Somehow the FA has done something right with St George’s Park which does seem to be working. Evidenced by consensus on this article and by winning two (TWO!!!) youth World Cups last year. I agree that the appointment of Southgate was accidentally visionary but I think the future of English football is bright. So much so that I am almost hoping we don’t win this world cup so we can really win it in style in four or eight years time. Having said that, my confidence in the FA is such that I would not be surprised if they find a way to mess the whole thing up.”I’d agree that the youth World Cup wins are a huge indicator of progress being made in English football development. There is still the thorny issue of whether those players who have done so well at development level can break into their respective club sides’ first teams, though. That Trent Alexander-Arnold has done so well at Liverpool is a good sign but if a player such as Phil Foden, who appears to be an incredible talent, can somehow become a Manchester City first-team regular, then the prospects are good. His career could still stall, though. Look at Ruben Loftus-Cheek, who can’t break into the team at Chelsea despite a couple of seasons knocking on the door. The Premier League could still ruin all the FA’s good work. Good old Premier League.A bit of World Cup-related transfer news now. Liverpool are hopeful of wrapping up a £13m deal for Stoke and Switzerland’s Xherdan Shaqiri, aka the Powercube, before Jürgen Klopp heads off to the United States with his Liverpool squad on 22 July for a pre-season tour. Here’s our man on Merseyside, Andy Hunter, with the story. You know the nation has lost the run of itself when there is an entire podcast dedicated to deconstructing Three Lions to understand its perennial popularity. Here’s what musician Anthony T Jackson makes of the Lightning Seeds’ song:There’s a lovely moment towards the end of the bridge - the section just before the final chorus - where the songwriters leave us on that C7 chord - the chord that previously has taken us both to the F minor tonality of the verses and the major tonality of the triumphant choruses. It lingers tantalisingly, followed only by a reprise of the quiet, unassertive introductory music. It’s the closest they could have come, I think, to simply leaving the song at that. They had to finish with repeated choruses, given the song’s brief as a popular anthem, but that moment - lingering on the chord that for the rest of the song leads one of two ways, pain or glory - is almost as if they wanted to leave the question of defeat or victory open, to express that state of hope and doubt that strikes every fan on the eve of a major football match …You can listen to his full podcast here or we can all just agree that it’s catchy. Not everybody believes the FA has fixed English football. “I’d slightly disagree with Chaps assertion that ‘the performance of this squad and its coaches encourages me to believe that England will be there or thereabouts in coming years and tournaments,’” writes William Hargreaves. “I think that the appointment of Southgate was a blip, visionary through unconscious good fortune. As soon as Southgate has done his stuff it will be back to the usual numbskull fare from the FA, I fear, unless the whole FA get Southgated.”Hello. Gregg here. Excited much? Good. Do you know who else can’t stop thinking about England v Croatia? Yes, Steve McClaren. He’s been thinking about the fixture for 11 years. Here’s Ed Aarons to recall that damp night at Wembley in November 2007.And with that, I’ll hand over to Gregg Bakowski, who take you nearer kick-off time in Moscow. Until next time.West Germany and Hungary met twice in 1954 when the Germans gained sweet revenge for a thumping 8-3 group stage defeat with a 3-2 win over the heavily-fancied Hungary of Kocsis and Puskas in the final – the Miracle of Bern.And in 1962, Brazil and Czechoslovakia were in the same group, drawing 0-0, before goals from Amarildo, Zito and Vavá gave Brazil a 3-1 victory in the final. I think they are the only times it has happened to date, but stand to be corrected. Aha, here it is, what all goalkeepers have been presumably waiting for, courtesy of a bunch boffins in a lab. Given that said boffins are based in Germany, one assumes it’s safe to assume this as gospel? Quick someone tell Jordan Pickford.Here’s the full story on those earlier quotes from Hazard and Courtois. How wildly delirious are hopes that Gareth Southgate’s side can join France in the final? Below the line, opinion is, of course, split. “England will cruise past Croatia, relax,” says Flugler, while Noutopia reckons England “have a chance, but highly likely we’ll blow it.”Chaps is full of optimism, even if the Croatia result goes against England: “Even if football doesn’t ‘come home’ this year, the performance of this squad and its coaches - and the full pipeline of talent (evidenced by being serial silverware winners at junior levels) encourages me to believe that England will be there or thereabouts in coming years and tournaments, much as France have been since 1998. I’m sure now that it won’t be another 28 years before England makes another semi-final. It will become, more or less, a regular occurrence.”A few more headlines as France wakes up to a stonking hangover and the prospect of a World Cup final:This frame, in particular, really got me in David Squires latest cartoon.“They’re redefining the English game and I wanted to be a part of it.” Not Gareth Southgate and his backroom staff, but rather Manchester City under Pep Guardiola. That’s the view of Riyad Mahrez at least, who has put pen to paper on a deal at the Etihad.In other news, you may have heard a certain transfer has gone through. Ronaldo to Juve for silly money. Still, the Old Lady of Turin has not made many mistakes lately, writes Paolo Bandini as he assesses the “deal of the century”.Just going back to the ‘p’ word for a moment – Croatia’s exertions, both mental and physical, in their quarter-final shootout win over Russia could yet come back to bite them. At least that’s what England will be hoping after Zlatko Dalic admitted his team were tired.“We’ve played five difficult games, they’ve taken their toll. We’re tired but there can be no excuses. We’ve come to the semi-final. We’re here to play football, enjoy ourselves and give our all. We do not want to say we are fatigued. We have not been exhausted. There is still opportunity for us to exhaust ourselves.”After a quiet game by his standards against Sweden, what can England expect from their captain Harry Kane against Croatia? It’s not just about goals though – just ask Olivier Giroud, or even better read this from a woman who knows a thing or two about being a world-class striker, Marta.“People often ask me what the secret to being a good goalscorer is but there is not just one thing that makes someone a brilliant and consistent striker. You need a bit of everything. You need technique and positional awareness you need to be able to read the game and be quick. To be great, you need all of these things.”The Croatia manager, Zlatko Dalicwe, reckons his side “always expect to solve everything within 90 minutes”, which is great news for anyone of a nervous disposition, yet the prospect of another penalty shootout looms large over the game in Moscow, as it does in any game in the knockout phase between two evenly matched sides. Thankfully, England have Sir Jordan Pickford in their ranks, but Croatians will be equally comforted by Danijel Subasic. Here’s Aleksandar Holiga on the Croatia keeper:Football is just a game, 22 people kicking an inflated bag around, hopefully having a bit of fun along the way. Winning, losing, who cares? It’s about taking part, taking enjoyment out of the game. But then again, it can be so much more than that. And the World Cup tends to remind us of this on a quadrennial basis. For England, certainly, this tournament has become something more than a game. Here’s Hugh Muir on that:“Oh, to be in England  Now that April’s there,” wrote Browning, but he might have looked at that again after last weekend and decided it could bear revision. “Oh, to be in England’s capital as Gareth Southgate’s team march nonchalantly into the World Cup semi-finals,” perhaps. When people meet the glances of others, smile and know exactly what they are thinking. When strangers, merry and giddy, connect on the trains that usually symbolise an urban dystopia. When young Britons of many complexions sport England shirts and look as though they had won a modest bet.This is so hot off the virtual press, I haven’t had time to read it yet, but since it’s from Jonathan Wilson, one can assume it’s essential reading ahead of The Big Match:If the England players aren’t nervous, the same cannot be said for the majority of those who will watch on through inevitably laced fingers in Russia and back home. That people appear to be allowing themselves to dream only heightens those nerves. Here’s Barney Ronay on a a moment that nobody really expected.If the last few days have been marked by a feeling of gathering English hysteria, not to mention booze-sodden escapism as the rest of the country energetically falls to bits, then it is worth noting these moments don’t come around very often.Time to cast forward now, to today’s second semi-final. A lovely scene-setter from Daniel Taylor in Moscow:The focus of Courtois’ ire – rather amusingly his Chelsea teammate Giroud – is coming in for a bit of stick after a fairly anodyne performance – and another game without a goal. That’s over seven hours of play without scoring or, indeed, even a shot on target. The Stéphane Guivarc’h of a new generation.And another! “I prefer to lose with this Belgium than win with this France.”Eden Hazard has been at it too, telling Belgian newspaper Het Nieuwsblad: “But they do defend strongly and are very efficient. We have not found their weak point. That little moment of magic needed to score was not there. We have seen a fantastic Belgian team and have been eliminated by a team that was more solid than us.”A case of sour grapes in the Belgium camp? Speaking of their French conquerors, Thibaut Courtois told the Belgian website Sporza: “Their striker plays 30 metres from his own goal.” Oof. And there’s more: “It’s a pity and frustrating, I prefer to lose to a team like Brazil, who want to play football at least. France are no better than us, they do not play football, but they do have a lot of strength.”Some of those French celebrations turned a bit ugly earlier. This from Reuters:The partying was marred by clashes between riot police and mobs on the iconic Champs Elysees avenue. Live TV images showed bare-chested men hurling plastic crowd-control barriers and other missiles at the armed officers, who charged back. In the southern city of Nice, more than two dozen fans were hurt when the detonation of firecrackers triggered a brief stampede near the seafront. After a France game, it’s always good to have a look at how L’Équipe sees things. “Head in the stars” blazes its front page today. “Thanks to a headed goal from Samuel Umtiti, France can dream of a second World Cup title, 20 years after their first star in 1998.”The paper, which is notoriously sensible with its player ratings, awarded France an average of 7, to Belgium’s 5.1. Umtiti, Raphael Varane and Hugo Lloris got 8s, while Belgium goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois stood out with an 8 too. Eden Hazard (6), Romelu Lukaku (4) and Mousa Dembélé (3) didn’t fare as well.And just to rehash the Tintin theme – France “walked on De Bruyne”:One can only imagine how Belgium’s players are feeling at the moment (and how theirTrevor Steven knows all about playing a World Cup semi-final though. He was there in Turin in 1990, and reckons it was “like an out-of-body experience”. The former gives Jamie Jackson some further interesting insight into the agony being so close, yet so far.Snozmusket writes below the line: “Asterix, not Asterisk?” Good point. (*)* this is an asterisk. This is Asterix.Meanwhile, this is a great thread of France’s World Cup finalists as kids. Special shout out to Giroud’s hair, which is beautifully lustrous.What of Belgium? Their so-called golden generation has failed to deliver the goods once again. When can the promise of becoming world beaters be dismissed? You could make a pretty strong argument for, in Belgium’s case, that moment to be now after they came up blank against France and lost a match for the first time in 25 outings. As David Hytner at the St Petersburg Stadium writes:“This was Belgium’s big opportunity the moment to make history by reaching a first World Cup final. For many years the squad have been tracked by talk of a golden generation and several members of Martínez’s squad had made it plain that they were here to lift the trophy. Nothing else. But in the end, they were stifled and the manager did not have the answers.”Redemption is a word on the minds of Deschamps et al. Or rather la rédemption. The pain of Euro 2016, when they lost to Cristiano Ronaldo’s Portugal in the final, still lingers around the camp like the smell of a particularly fruity Brie de Meaux. Deschamps says he is keen to devour it, and never see it regurgitated again (or words to that effect). “I was there two years ago with my staff,” Deschamps said. “It was so painful we really want to taste the victory tonight. It’s not nothing to win the semi-final of the World Cup after losing the final of the Euro. It’s sport, we have this privilege to give happiness to the French people and the public.”Here’s some blurb from the pod crew: “Max and co discuss France becoming the first finalist of the 2018 World Cup, a Thibaut Courtois post-match meltdown, England’s hopes, dreams and fears, Cristiano Ronaldo’s move and Welsh nightmares.” Do yourselves a favour and have a listen.Allez les Blues! A decades-old debate has finally been settled by way of a fairly important football match in Saint Petersburg: Asterix is officially better than Tintin. And the upshot of that particular little revelation is that France are in the World Cup final, at the expense of their cousins to the north-east, Belgium.A tricolour-hued crowd collectively lost their merde on the Champs-Elysee after the 1-0 win in predictable shades of ‘98. Perhaps it was fitting then, that the match-winner was the Cameroon-born defender Samuel Umtiti. Didier Deschamps, who as a player was part of that Black-Blanc-Beur side, will now seek to emulate one of his predecessors, Aimé Jacquet, and complete his mission against the winner of another fairly important football match later today – that between Croatia and England.Ah, yes, that small matter. Bus shelters across England are bracing themselves with a nation set to spontaneously combust should Gareth Southgate’s side manage to reach a first World Cup final since 1966. The tension is mounting, the pressure building. What could go wrong?Anyway, stick with us as the buildup properly commences (aware we’ve been building up to this ever since the final whistle tooted in Samara, but this time we really mean it). And we’ll be able to cast an eye back over the game in Saint Petersburg, and bring you any breaking news as and when it happens before kick-off in Moscow.

The only difference from the avocados you know? These ones are about the size of your head.The Avozilla, as it has been dubbed, has arrived in Australia. Weighing an average of 1.2kg, the fruits are about four times the size of regular avocados and are expected to sell for $12 each. “There’s certainly a shock factor when you pick one up and they’re as big as your head,” farmer Ian Groves told  Australia. Originating from South Africa, the Avozilla reached Britain in 2013. But the Groves family, which has grown tropical and exotic fruits in central Queensland since 1957, are the first to bring the variety to Australia. Groves said the fruit tasted similar to their regular-sized equivalent but were slightly softer to spread. “I love them. We eat them at home all the time,” he said. Groves said the first harvest was being sent to grocers in Brisbane, Sydney, Adelaide and Perth. “There is a nursery we buy different trees off and when we were planting a bunch of avocados 10 years ago they gave us one as a trial,” he said. “And after about four or five years, we tried a few of the fruit and thought we’d give them a go. So we planted a small block of about just under 400 trees. They’re coming up to about four years and this is their first production.”Though they would be perfect for the increasing number of cafes and restaurants serving up hundreds of plates of smashed avo on toast each day, Groves predicted the variety was likely to remain a novelty because the trees were “light producers”. The family are likely to be the only growers of the novelty fruit for some time, having got in years before their competition. Farms cannot plant the variety without gaining permission and paying royalties to the South African company that owns the rights. “A friend of ours is planting 2000 trees in Bundaberg probably this year,” Groves said. “So we’re four years ahead of him. But I don’t know if growers will jump on board, they are such niche market.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/994fd006c7ad33712947a3af9a560e8321b33f98/0_1212_7444_4466/master/7444.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a594f9ec3137d624fc6b29f0d976e8a4","title":"perfect fish taco recipe mexican food felicity cloake","story":"If good fish tacos aren’t on your local takeaway menu, they’re fun to make at home – and here’s howAs a California girl, the new Duchess of Sussex claims “few bites of food” make her happier than fish tacos from Mexico’s Baja peninsula just south of the border: “Being from Los Angeles, I was conditioned to like Baja-style food from the womb … trust me, they are insanely good! I dream about those tacos.”As with all the best dishes, there’s some debate about its origins, with the city of Ensenada and the town of San Felipe both claiming paternity: the first credits Japanese migrants for the crispy, tempura-style fish, and the latter the local climate, which apparently is only tolerable on a regular diet of mustardy beer batter. One serves the fish in corn tortillas, the other in corn or wheat, one fries in oil, the other lard, one adds guacamole and ketchup – and that’s before you even get to the choice of fish or salad.Meghan herself favours a distinctly Californian-style grilled version with peppers and onions – and, 5,000 miles away, we’re even less bound by local loyalties. So, if you happen to find yourself stuck in a damp, grey city more into fish and chips than fish tacos, what’s the best way to make them at home?Unsurprisingly, the fish found in the ocean off Baja California bear scant resemblance to those in my local fishmongers. Mexican expert Rick Bayless says that “practically any” boneless skinless fish fillets will work (Markle enjoys salmon), but Bayless likes “larger-flake, lighter-flavor fish best”. His sea bass, J Kenji López-Alt’s hake and Rick Stein’s cod, from his book The Road to Mexico, are easy enough to source, but I use monkfish and stone bass in place of the more exotic mahi mahi and flounder. Hake and both varieties of bass prove a little soft for our liking, but monkfish and cod work brilliantly, being firm enough to hold their shape, and juicy enough to withstand the rigours of deep-frying: look for cod or similar white fish cheeks, which are not only a little cheaper than steaks, but are also already conveniently cut to size.Whatever fish you use, once it’s battered and deep-fried, it should begin to look a bit more familiar – unless you go down the American route. Sam Anguiano of LA’s Pink Taco rubs his fish with Old Bay seasoning and grills it over fresh mesquite for the “ultimate fresh flavour” – in the absence of mesquite, I go for a hot griddle pan. They’re delicious, as are Sam Sifton’s seasoned-flour versions, shallow fried in oil and butter, but texturally neither can compete with the crunch of hot batter: as López-Alt wisely observes, “if there’s any cooking method in the world that can make all foods taste great, it’s deep-frying”. (I don’t try frying them in lard, as I can’t get hold of any free-range stuff in time, but if you have a good extraction system, from my extensive experience with fish fried in beef dripping, I’d recommend it.) If you’d like a healthier version, then by all means grill them … but know you’ll be missing out.Although Stein is clearly a man who knows how to batter a fish (flour, salt, baking powder and ice-cold beer), his simple, rather British version can’t compete with the spicy tang of Bayless and López-Alt’s more highly seasoned recipes. Yellow mustard is apparently de rigeur in Baja California, but I can’t help thinking the more fiery English sort would be even better. López Alt adds paprika, and Sifton chilli powder, while Bayless goes for Mexican oregano and chicken stock, which gives his batter a wonderfully savoury flavour, although vegetable would do for pescatarians. Any extra chilli feels unnecessary given the accompaniments, and López-Alt’s egg and double flouring process gives his batter a crunchy, fried-chicken-like solidity which, while undoubtedly pleasing to eat, doesn’t prove quite as popular as Bayless and Stein’s lighter, crisper versions, possibly because they’re easier to overeat.You could just dollop on sour cream and chilli sauce and be done with it, but most of the recipes call for homemade “crema” made from a mixture of sour cream and mayonnaise, with Stein thinning it with lime juice and Bayless milk, while López-Alt sticks with mayonnaise mixed with sriracha, and Anguiano sour cream mixed with Louisiana hot sauce. I find the more liquid versions hard to keep in the taco, but López-Alt’s is a little too solid for me to drizzle. Souped-up sour cream with your own favourite brand of chilli-based condiment will do the job: although it’s a long way from home, López-Alt’s sriracha gives an addictively savoury flavour, and Stein and Sifton’s chipotle chillies in adobo sauce provide a more complex smokiness. Even good old Tabasco works in a pinch.Although salsa isn’t mandatory, it does give extra freshness to the dish, especially if, like Stein and Sifton, you make your own pico de gallo from tomatoes, onion, coriander and chilli, mixed with a generous amount of lime juice and salt. A salad of raw chopped cabbage is non-negotiable, however: we like the crunch of Stein’s white version, but red or green would do just as well. Anguiano also includes a cucumber slaw with red onion and serrano pepper dressed with orange, lemon and lime juice: nice on the side, but too wet for my liking in a taco.Faced with a dearth of decent fruit, López-Alt uses quick pickled red onions instead of the tomatoes he says are typically added to fish tacos in California for their “brightness and acidity”. Although we are now in peak tomato season, I’d urge you to make a batch of his onions anyway. They’re incredible. His avocados are another optional extra: you don’t need them, but I do like the creamy, squidgy texture they bring to the party – and if a taco isn’t too full to pick up, surely you’re not doing it right.You can use corn or flour – but I don’t know why you’d go for the latter when corn tortillas have so much more flavour. They’re still oddly hard to track down in this country, but if you don’t live near a stockist, then buy them online. They freeze very well, which means you’re only ever a few ingredients away from taco-based bliss: now with the seal of royal approval.4 ripe tomatoes½ small red onion1 jalapeño chilli1 small bunch corianderJuice of 1½ limes¼ tsp salt120ml sour cream2 tbsp chilli sauce, plus extra to serve½ white, green or red cabbage1 avocado, optional200g plain flour¼ tsp salt½ tsp baking powder1 tsp mustard powder1 tsp chicken or vegetable stock cube or powder300ml cold lagerNeutral oil, for frying8 corn tortillas400g cod cheeks, or other firm, white fish, cut into stripsDeseed and dice the tomatoes, and put in a bowl.

That brings him from the £2.2m to £2.25m bracket to £1.66m to £1.67m.The move means that the football presenter Gary Lineker has become the best-paid star at the BBC, earning between £1.75m and £1.76m, and is the only one of the corporation’s biggest male stars not to take a pay cut.Nevertheless, the top five best paid BBC stars are still male – although all, with the exception of Lineker, have taken significant pay cuts.The BBC has increased transparency this year by narrowing the pay bands it reports from £50,000 to £10,000.The pay of the BBC’s third best-paid star, Graham Norton,fell by about £250,000, from the £850,000 to £899,000 bracket to £600,000 to £609,000. The salary of Jeremy Vine, the Eggheads and Radio 2 presenter and the fourth highest-paid BBC star, also fell by about the same amount, from the £700,000-£750,000 bracket to £440,000-£450,000.He was paid between £600,000 and £650,000. This has now been cut to between £400,000 to £410,000, with the BBC saying that next year it will fall to “below” £300,000. Similarly, the pay of BBC News presenter Huw Edwards, whose pay was between £550,000 and £559,000, will fall to “well below” £500,000 by next year and will “continue to fall”.However, the bid to close the gender pay gap at the BBC will result in the total number of on-air talent paid more than £150,000 rising by almost a fifth from 58 this year to 69 by 1 April 2019."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d87a449d4b2537bcc243dd917f8606bbf0f3d4fc/42_16_3145_1888/master/3145.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=721c27be1c1a566d27b5bf89ceef1d31","title":"russia 2018 world cup england guardian support","story":"Our senior sports writer Barney Ronay explains how you can help keep the ’s football coverage in playHere we are then.

It is the latest sexual assault allegation against the music mogul.Alexia Norton Jones claims the attack happened in 1990, after she went to his apartment following a date. “It was such a fast attack,” she said in a first-person account published by Variety. “I must have said no seven to 10 times, and then I acquiesced. It was very fast. I would say it happened in less than 10 minutes.”Simmons has denied the accusation and says he is “deeply saddened” by Jones’s account. He says they “dated, were intimate and attended multiple events together after she alleges the incident occurred” – a claim Jones called preposterous, adding that she was “disgusted by him”. In a statement to the New York Times, Simmons said: “I have respectfully, factually and comprehensively denied the charges of sexual violence against me.”Numerous women have accused Simmons of sexual assault in recent months, beginning with Keri Claussen Khalighi in November 2017. Others include TV personality Kelly Cutrone, screenwriter Jenny Lumet, and nine other women who made allegations including sexual harassment and rape to the New York Times and Los Angeles Times.Simmons, who stepped down from his companies as the allegations began to increase, has repeatedly maintained his innocence, saying that any sexual relations were consensual he has also issued a statement supporting the #MeToo movement. He is unlikely to face criminal proceedings over the allegations due to the length of time has elapsed since the alleged attacks. A civil lawsuit brought against him by film-maker Jennifer Jarosik, who accused him of rape, was dismissed in April.

But he warned: “We need clarity for these negotiations to move forward for the time is very short.”Barnier said he had never been shown how Brexit provided added value when the world faced challenges from terrorism and climate change to migration, poverty and financial instability.“It will be clear, crystal clear at the end of this negotiation that the best situation, the best relationship with the EU, will be to remain a member,” he said.Barnier added: “No deal is the worst solution for everybody. It would be a huge economic problem for the UK and also for the EU. I’m not working for that deal, I’m working for a deal.”Barnier’s comments come after days of upheaval in the UK, since Theresa May’s attempt to bind her cabinet to an agreed approach to the Brexit negotiations triggered the resignations of the Brexit secretary, David Davis, and foreign secretary, Boris Johnson.Johnson used his resignation letter on Monday to claim that the UK was “headed for the status of a colony” under May’s soft Brexit plans, which would keep closer ties to the European Union than hardline Conservatives want.Asked if May’s weakened position put negotiations at risk, Barnier said: “To be sincere, I don’t want to make any comment on domestic and national policy in the UK. I have met many people with different views. I have listened to everyone and will continue to do so. But as EU negotiator I will negotiate only with the British government … so our next negotiations will be next Monday with the British delegation appointed by Mrs May.”He said the detailed UK proposals would be assessed in the light of the EU’s clear position on the inisible four freedoms of movement of people, goods, services and capital. The EU is ready to start negotiating on free trade and customs agreements with the UK, he said.“If it is well understood, these principles, which are the foundation of our union, we would start a constructive discussion, with the UK on two aspects of the negotiation, a free trade agreement and a customs arrangement. The solution will, however, have to be workable and realistic, it should not lead to red tape and cost for citizens and businesses.”A draft withdrawal agreement was signed in March, with several areas signed off including the Brexit bill most but not all issues relating to EU citizens and some issues relating to Ireland, including the common travel area. The UK leaves the EU on 29 March 2019. There is an October deadline to reach a withdrawal agreement and the latest round of negotiations is due to take place next week – with the new Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, replacing Davis at the table.May is facing the risk of a confidence vote from rebellious Conservative MPs and the mood of political chaos will be further complicated by the arrival of Donald Trump in the UK on Thursday for a visit which will be punctuated by protests.Leaving the White House on Tuesday for his flight to Europe, Trump described Johnson as “a good friend” and said the UK was “in somewhat turmoil”.Trump is almost entirely avoiding London during his trip, which will include a Windsor Castle meeting with the Queen and talks with May at the Chequers retreat where, last week, she failed to unite her cabinet around her Brexit plan.During a trip to Scotland in 2016, Trump hailed the Brexit vote as a “great thing” and said the people of the UK had “taken back their country”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e1f3abf0859082dc5d4ca6d498405887ac13e3c3/477_378_4477_2686/master/4477.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cff4c2cae3b52d1cc79e6a672e3c3e74","title":"romans had whale industry archeological excavation suggests","story":"Ancient whale bones have been found on three Roman fish processing sites close to the Strait of GibraltarAncient bones found around the Strait of Gibraltar suggest that the Romans might have had a thriving whaling industry, researchers have claimed.The bones, dating to the first few centuries AD or earlier, belong to grey whales and North Atlantic right whales – coastal migratory species that are no longer found in European waters.Researchers say this not only suggests these whales might have been common around the entrance to the Mediterranean in Roman times, but that Romans might have hunted them. They add that Romans would not have had the technology to hunt whale species found in the region today - sperm or fin whales which live further out at sea - meaning evidence of whaling might not have been something archaeologists and historians were looking out for.The right whale was once widespread in the North Atlantic, with breeding grounds off the northern coast of Spain and north west Africa, but was hunted by Medieval Basque whalers among others, and are now only found in the Western North Atlantic. Grey whales disappeared from the North Atlantic some time in the 18th century, and are now only found in the Pacific.Until the recent discoveries it was unclear whether the whales’ habitat had ever included the Mediterranean: the region is southerly enough for the animals to potentially calve there after feeding in more northerly areas. While there are a handful of historical reports of right whales cropping up in the Mediterranean, the only reliable grey whale sighting in the region was in 2010 and is thought to have been a misguided inidual that turned up from the Pacific.Writing in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B, Rodrigues and a team of archaeologists and ecologists, describe how they set out to unpick the issue by examining 10 bones – thought to be from whales – collected during recent archaeological digs or housed in museum collections. These bones came from five sites – four around the Strait of Gibraltar and one site on the coast of north-west Spain, three of which were linked to the Roman fish-salting and fish-sauce making industries.The team combined previous anatomical analysis with new analyses based both on DNA extracted from the bones and their collagen – a protein whose makeup differs between groups of species, and which degrades more slowly than DNA.While one of the bones was found to be from a dolphin and another from an elephant – possibly a war animal – three were identified as grey whales, and two as North Atlantic right whales with another also suspected of being from this latter species. All were found by carbon-dating as being from either Roman or pre-Roman times – findings backed up by dating based on information from the archaeological sites.The team say the discovery suggests grey and North Atlantic right whales were common in the waters around the Strait of Gibraltar during Roman times, since whale bones rarely end up in the archaeological record and they are not prized possessions. This theory is backed up by writings from the time: Pliny the Elder – a fervent naturalist who died down the coast from Pompeii during the volcanic disaster – appears to reference whales calving in the coastal waters off Cadiz in the winter in his Naturalis Historia. And if the whales were present, the team say, it is possible the Romans hunted them.The team say the location of the bones, and other evidence, suggests whales might even have entered further into the Mediterranean sea itself to calve.Dr Vicki Szabo, an expert in whaling history from Western Carolina University said the study offered a rare glimpse into the past habitats of the whales, and backed up ideas that industrial hunting might have happened far earlier than widely thought, although its scale is unclear. “Whales are considered archaeologically invisible because so few bones are transported from shore to site, so I think in that context this concentration of species that they have is meaningful,” she said.Mark Robinson, professor of environmental archaeology at the University of Oxford, said there have been suggestions for a decade that some Roman sites with fish vats in the region might have been linked to whaling. “The Greek author Oppian, writing in the 2nd century AD, describes whales being hunted in the Western Mediterranean by harpooning them on the surface, also using tridents and axes to kill them, lashing them to a boats and then dragging them to the shore.” However Dr Erica Rowan, a classical archaeologist at Royal Holloway, University of London, said while the study suggests the habitats of the whales probably extended to include the Gibraltar region, how common the whales were and whether the Romans industrially hunted them as they did fish such as tuna remains unclear – not least because the study included just a handful of bones from a period ning several hundred years. “I think that if these whales were present in such numbers and were being caught on an industrial scale that we would have more evidence, perhaps not in the zoo archaeological record but in the ceramic record and in the literary sources,” she said. “The Romans ate and talked about an enormous variety of fish and seafood, and if whale was widely exploited and exported, then it is strangely absent from many discussions.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e273fdc24062247f81a2a4fffc15628a2250140/0_185_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1ea3515062d1b5ffd7341ea2fd46208f","title":"talking horses impressive legal team lined up for tim brennan defence","story":"‘I’m going to prove that these allegations are false,’ Kilkenny vet says, and he will not be short of expert legal assistanceSome people have clearly not done enough preparation when they sit down in front of a disciplinary panel of the British Horseracing Authority, and it can count against them. No such problems will affect Tim Brennan, a vet from Kilkenny, when he defends himself next week against corruption charges.“I’ll be bringing a lawyer and a barrister, and I’ll be using an English barrister as well,” Brennan told me yesterday. I checked with the BHA and in fact they’ve been notified by Brennan’s legal team of three barristers and a solicitor who will be attending the hearing on Monday and Tuesday to represent his interests. One of these barristers is very well known in legal circles. He is Edward Fitzgerald QC, whose resume is extraordinarily impressive and includes appearances before the Court of Appeal, Supreme Court, the European Court of Human Rights and the Caribbean Court of Justice. Evidently, he has also presented arguments in Belize, Grenada, St Vincent, Gibraltar, Hong Kong, Trinidad and Tobago, St Lucia, Bahamas and the British Virgin Islands. So he is about ready for the crowning moment of his career, the chance to speak in the basement of 75 High Holborn. Media interest has, understandably, gravitated towards the notoriety of some of those Fitzgerald has represented, including Myra Hindley, Jon Venables and Abu Hamza. “Everybody is entitled to a fair trial,” he told the  and you’d like to think he was pushing on an open door with that particular line of argument. I’ve been attending BHA hearings for a few years and I can’t remember anyone arriving with this kind of legal weaponry in tow. I think we can say that Brennan’s defence will be well presented. Brennan, who works for Willie Mullins, is accused of passing on information to his brother about Faugheen, shortly before that horse was withdrawn from the 2016 Champion Hurdle, and thereby allowing his brother to make a profit by betting against the horse. Brennan denies it. “I’m defending myself from false allegations,” he told me this week. “I’m going to prove that these allegations are false. I guess they wanted to blame somebody and maybe the person who did it didn’t want to co-operate.” So much for next week’s drama. Today’s drama will be at Catterick, where a workaday card is spiced up by the Turmeric Handicap, named for the durable beast who won a load of staying handicaps at the Scotch Corner track in the late 80s.Italian Riviera (4.10), making his umpteenth appearance in this space, is 7-2 for a third course and distance success in a row. His mark has gone up again but by a manageable 6lb and he might even be able to win this without turning in a career best effort, depending on how the others fare. He’s had a useful break since his last start and I’ll stick with Ken Slack’s veteran. Size Matters (4.45) is attractive at 9-2 in the following seven-furlong handicap. From the Mark Walford yard, which has been among the winners, he ran well but needed his first run back and now has the chance to build on his Ayr success at this distance in August. The nap is at Yarmouth, where Kaanoon (3.50) is an even-money shot to score on his handicap debut after a couple of novice wins. Roger Varian’s three-year-olds made a stuttering start to the year but it seems to me they are, as a group, starting to come good.

You just couldn’t call it at this stage. Hugely in the balance, and the next 10 minutes could prove crucial. 52 mins: Holmes takes to the air in the corner and touches down! It’s a slick passing move from Queensland, involving DCE, Slater and Chambers before Holmes finishes in trademark style. Val can’t add the extras though and it’s all tied up at 12 apiece! 51 mins: Ooh, Hess nearly makes it to the line, after being fed by DCE, but no dice this time. 50 mins: A bit of argy-bargy now as Sims plays the ball before tackling the marker, Ben Hunt! Pretty funny stuff, but also a bit silly from the NSW big man. 49 mins: Maloney looks like he’s picked up a problem with his feet here. That could be a worry for NSW.48 mins: Hunt to Munster to Slater out on the left, but there’s nothing doing there, so they come back the other way. But it’s the same situation, and Chambers knocks on to gift NSW the ball. 47 mins: Cleary’s called for offside and the Maroons have a chance to ramp up the pressure they applied so continuously during that first half. 45 mins: NSW appear re-energised after the break. Those two late tries before half-time probably helped a bit too. 43 mins: Tariq Sims enjoys two early hits ups – big hits ups. He doesn’t look out of place in this arena. 42 mins: Maloney was back on almost immediately, having served the remaining 16 second of his sin binning. His firs touch is a grubber kick and the Blues regain possession.41 mins: Here we go again then, back underway at Suncorp. What can Queensland do here?40 mins: And that will be that for the first half. What a half of rugby league. NSW, by rights, should be dead and buried, but as it is they take a four-point lead into the sheds with them. That was fascinating stuff – the Blues’ defensive work was nothing short of immense and then they hit Queensland with two sucker punches. The sign of a great team?40 mins: What?! NSW lead! How did this happen? Cook plays the ball quickly and dishes to Tedesco who gleefully crosses amid a non-existent Queensland defence. Amazing stuff at Suncorp.38 mins: Well, few would have seen that one coming, at all. And if the Blues can make it to the sheds just two points off the Maroons, they’ll have done mightily well. It was Munster with the pass that Turbo Tommy intercepted, in case I didn’t mention it earlier. 37 mins: Unbelievable! In an almost carbon copy of the Maroons’ try, Trbojevic intercepts near his own goal line and streaks away all the way down to the other end of Suncorp to score against the run of play! Cleary adds the extras and NSW are right back in this one now. What a turnaround!36 mins: Ben Hunt is on, by the way. 34 mins: NSW’s hopes of holding on until half-time have just got a whole lot more difficult. The decision to bin Maloney is sure to cause a stir and we certainly haven’t heard the end of it.32 mins: Holmes’s kick is good and the Maroons open up an eight-point lead, but more importantly, they are a man to the good for the remainder of the first half.31 mins: Maloney’s in trouble here! He appears to impede Slater as the Queensland captain attempts to get on a kick through into the in-goal that strikes the post. No penalty try is called but Maloney’s sent to the bin for a professional foul. Cordner argues the toss, but there’s no way Gerard Sutton will change his mind. Holmes will kick for goal to get some points on the board.30 mins: Ten minutes left this half, and if the Blues hold out until the break it’ll be quite incredible.28 mins: Tariq Sims announces himself onto the Origin stage with a huge hit on Oates, before the Maroons win yet another line dropout and the pressure intensifies a touch. 27 mins: Slater now can smell the try line, he’s that close. But still the NSW defence holds firm. But another line dropout follows after Trbojevic cleans up in the Blues’ in-goal. What a sustained period of pressure, but credit NSW with some sterling work on the back foot.26 mins: A bit longer, at least for now. They get some breathing space as an attempted kick by Slater strikes Maloney in the face before he grabs the ball. It’s called accidental offside and the Maroons have a scrum. 24 mins: The Maroons win a line dropout and the pressure continues. How much longer can the visitors last without conceding?23 mins: Now it’s Slater’s turn to get on the receiving end of a big hit, this time from Mitchell. No bother though, and the Maroons come again, with Gagai held up just short of the line. 21 mins: Turbo Tommy comes to the Blues’ rescue after collecting a decent Maroons kick into the in-goal and NSW are able to relieve some of the pressure when Cook kicks downfield. But the Queensland pressure is immense at the moment. They seem to smell blood.18 mins: Oof! Klemmer barges into Arrow and bumps him off as if he were a schoolboy! The hit draws groans from the Queensland crowd, and Arrow could well be feeling that one in the morning.16 mins: Some lovely stuff from DCE here as he jinks this way and that before offloading. He’s having a decent game, the Manly Sea Eagles captain.14 mins: That’s a hammer blow for NSW, and one delivered with bad timing, given Cook’s break just moments earlier. 12 mins: That try was extremely similar to the one he scored in Game 1 in Melbourne, and when Holmes gets away like that, there really is no stopping him. 11 mins: Holmes intercepts Maloney’s pass inside his own 10m line and sprints uncontested the rest of the length of the pitch to open the scoring! Tyson Frizell does a valiant job of trying to run him down, but he just can’t get there, and Queensland lead! The kick if good. 10 mins: Cook suddenly breaks free and puts the afterburners on! He runs into traffic in the middle of the pitch though and the attack loses momentum.9 mins: Still Queensland attack. Until Vaughan piles into Arrow and the Gold Coast man loses control of the ball. NSW will feed the ensuing scrum. 7 mins: Cooper and Munster link up nicely moments before DCE dinks a grubber through. But Addo-Carr is alert to it and takes the ball in the in-goal. 6 mins: Cherry-Evans in particular has shown some nice touches on his return to Origin football. The word from the commentators is that there are very few spare seats, despite pre-match fears there would be quite a few empties.5 mins: A promising start from the Maroons, despite that disappointment though. 4 mins: Slater thinks he’s scored a try after leaping to grab a neat kick from Cherry-Evans! But it’s disallowed as replays prove the captain loses control of the ball while in midair. It’s a knock-on and the fairytale start will have to wait. 4 mins: Here come Queensland, down the left hand side with some quick ball play. Gagai’s involved before the attack runs into a blue brick wall.3 mins: The early chants of “Queens-land-er” have died down but noise levels are ramped back up as Slater gets his first touch. And Latrell Mitchell is pulled up for a shoulder charge of the departing great. 2 mins: Cherry-Evans gets an early touch before NSW get a chance for their opening set of six, from close to their own try line.1 min: Kick-off time! It is! The Blues gets things underway at Suncorp at 8:12pm exactly! Boom!Kick off time! No, not really. First we’ve got to have the national anthem, sung by Priscilla Queen of the Desert’s David Harris. Good job from him. And after the earlier Amy Shark debacle, at least the Channel Nine directors actually stick with it throughout. Finally, here come the teams. Blues first, to a chorus of boos from the maroon-tinged crowd. And then Queensland, to an altogether different reception, as Billy Slater leads his team out as captain for the night on his final Origin appearance. Kick-off time! But unsurprisingly the teams are still in the sheds.Amy Shark is up on the stage, belting out a number, although the television directors don’t seem too bothered to be honest. Instead we cut to replays of Cam Smith on stage, and then the injured Greg Inglis, who says he’s nervous. “I’d rather be playing thats for sure,” the Queensland captain says. “The boys have been training really well this week,” he adds. Meanwhile, no doubting who Sally Fitzgibbons is barracking for tonight. And here comes Smith onto the Suncorp pitch. He stands on the stage, flanked by his wife, Barb, and kids and thanks... everyone. From the bottom of his heart. Then he’s asked about tonight’s game.“We’ve got a lot young guys in the squad now and its their turn to shine in the jersey. It’s important for Queensland to send Billy Slater off a winner. He deserves that. He’s been one of Queensland’s finest rugby league players for while now.”Following on from the tribute for Billy Slater (including plenty of horse riding), Channel Nine are now turning their focus to retired great Cameron Smith. There won’t, one would assume, be a mention of Brad Fittler’s incendiary comments the other day about the reasons for Smith’s rep retirement – that he was running scared of NSW’s Baby Blues. Kick-off is scheduled for 8pm local time, but as is Origin tradition, the game absolutely won’t start then. Making predictions is a mug’s game, but hey ho, in the spirit of Origin bingo, I’ll go for 8:12pm. And here’s how the Blues lineup, with a late change seeing Jake Trbojevic starting at lock in place of Jack de Belin:A quick reminder of how we got to this point: a thrilling Game 2 performance from the “Baby Blues”. Here’s Matt Cleary with his Game 3 preview:For a variety of reasons the concept of friendlies to the majority of Australian sports folk is a foreign one. Be it the dearth of international football played, or some chippy competitive spirit borne out of convict anthropology, Australia doesn’t really play friendly matches. And in rugby league they don’t exist at all.Because you can’t play rugby league thus. Tackles are called hits or shots. The game demands commitment, confrontation and cartoon hate. In 2001 they held an old boys’ game of legends from NSW and Queensland, and Mark McGaw went all red mist on Mal Meninga, and the pair traded blows. Their combined age was 78. And that was a friendly, but the mien of old league dogs dies hard.With no Greg Inglis Inglis tonight, Queensland have been forced into making a few changes, but coach Kevin Walters insists his team is ready to make an impression. “We’ve been trying to cut loose for two game,” he has just told Channel Nine. “Our preparation has been good again. We just need to get a win under our belt. There’s a real expectation that we’re going to play well tonight.”Dead rubber – a sporting term used in description of a match in a league or series where the series’ result has already been decided by previous matches’ results. The dead rubber match therefore has no effect on the winner and loser of the series, other than the number of matches won and lost and can be considered entirely superfluous.Hmm. Well, yes, in some circles it could be deemed “entirely superfluous”. But not in State of Origin. In State of Origin the result absolutely will have an effect on the players involved – and the people of either state. There is no such thing as a dead rubber in Origin football and tonight’s match will be contested just as intensely as another other game.For NSW, they are looking for a first clean sweep in 18 years for Queensland, their imperative is to avoid the ignominy of a whitewash, god forbid. Yet aside from the tantalising possibility of a sweep, other narratives abound: Billy Slater bids farewell, Daly Cherry-Evans returns, Tariq Sims debuts, Brad Fittler’s pop at Cameron Smith... It’s going to be a special night, whatever happens.Do get in touch if you have anything you need to get off your chest – mike.hytner@the, or tweet @mike_hytner.

Last year they imported a strange off-Broadway tuner called Death Takes a Holiday. Now comes an even weirder show based on the true-life story, set in 1930s Florida, about a German immigrant’s obsession with a Cuban-American girl that led him to preserve her corpse for seven years. The show’s creators see it as a romantic love story to me, it looks more like Psycho. To be fair, the first half has a perkily comic tone. Jill Santoriello (book, music and lyrics) and her collaborators, Jason Huza and Jeremiah James, give an amusing picture of a sun-kissed island full of beach bums, cheerful con artists and Carmen-like workers from a local cigar factory (you see why Tennessee Williams and Ernest Hemingway were drawn to the place). It also attracts a radiology technician who goes under the name of Count Carl von Cosel and becomes fixated with the beautiful Elena, who has tuberculosis. Even though Carl lavishes time, money and his questionable medical gifts on Elena, she dies and it is at this point the musical itself starts to decompose. The second half is taken up with Carl’s devotion to Elena’s abducted body and his eventual trial. The musical sees the story as a testament to Carl’s undying love. Indeed, in a shouty Lloyd Webber-style ballad, he repeatedly tells us: “I’d feel sorry for you if you never felt this way.” But the musical skates over the lurid details of Carl’s doctoring of Elena’s corpse and vainly asks us to empathise with a practising necrophiliac. It is also typical of the show’s sentimentality that Alyssa Martyn, however charming as Elena, remains to the end the immaculately bridal figure of Carl’s imagination. Wade McCollum, brought over from New York, is impressive as Carl, portraying him as a besotted Mittyesque fantasist, and there is lively support from Sophia Lewis as Elena’s predatory sister. But, although Marc Robin’s production looks fine, and Santoriello can write a jaunty tune, I can’t see a musical about mummification ever catching on."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8fd63fa9093910bc778d6ec16ad03046514cad2c/0_108_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fed9aa293637e5e18a4a8faa3db47644","title":"from online to on the high street how one fashion brand made the move","story":"Festival-going retailer Carrie Hyndman on expanding her venture Junkbox Apparel with a store and creative space in ChesterWhen Carrie Hyndman finally set up her first bricks-and-mortar store for her adventure clothing brand, Junkbox Apparel, she did not want to lose sight of where she gained much of her inspiration – festivals. So she’s brought that creative buzz into a multi-faceted retail space.Joining up with another clothing designer, The Grunge Monkey, Hyndman launched The 2nd Floor in Chester in April. The idea was to make it a place where people could come in to get a feel for her brand, but also where creative minds could relax and be inspired. Within it, she has set up a coffee shop, a space for artists to showcase their work and an area for local musicians to play and sell records. “We feel really passionately about what we do, but also about the creative community around us. We wanted to offer that support to other people in our position,” she says.Hyndman knows many sides of the creative industry, putting her in a good place to make the space work. Not only does she sell her own clothes, but she splits her time with her band, Campfire Social, and is a keen wakeboarder and surfer. Each summer, she travels from festival to festival, sets up shop, meets new people and sells her clothes to like-minded folk.“Part of the whole idea of the brand is going out travelling and being outdoors. I don’t want to lose that,” she says. “It’s great to have a place that reflects that.”Hyndman started Junkbox Apparel as an online clothing shop in 2013, drawing on a background in retail and her jewellery design hobby. “It came from my own interests and what I wanted in my wardrobe – leisurewear for people who enjoy the outdoors.” The name she picked out with her mum, inspired by where people tend to store their accessories, in particular their costume jewellery. “You used to call that junk jewellery, hence where Junkbox came from,” she says. “It applies to what the brand is now: you chuck your stuff in a bag and you’re off.”The idea of travelling light evolved from her days of going on holiday with a different outfit packed for each day. “I hate doing that now, but I still like to look good and I like to be comfortable.” Which is why she came up with the capsule set: a few items of clothes that centre around a similar colour palette and activity that mix and match, so they are all that is needed for a weekend away. “You chuck them in a bag and you’re done,” she says.It’s a simple concept, but growing the business has been anything but smooth sailing. Hyndman believes there is “no original idea any more” – instead, building a business means carving out a niche, getting the brand name noticed, and collaborating rather than competing. “I think that encourages you to look at what you’re doing,” she says. “Looking at the competition and making it not competition, making them your peers.”“The nice thing is, I take a little bit less along to festivals now,” she says. “I used to take a clipboard, notebook, stock sheets, and loads of things like that. The stock management side of it became a little bit of hard work. Now I just take a little box with my carrier bags, my Square Reader and then my van with as much stock as I can fit into it.”Having launched The 2nd Floor in April, Hyndman has bigger plans for Junkbox Apparel. “I want to say take over the world, but we won’t be doing that any time soon – I’ve got to be realistic,” she laughs.Learn more about Square"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88cf252560b16761976842c7fd883e6753ab7b41/0_224_6651_3991/master/6651.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f7b33dd58742627cb02241e4ea8c57c","title":"wild swimming lake district brecon beacons cairngorms","story":"From tranquility in the Lake District and Brecon Beacons to lovely lochs in the Cairngorms, six enthusiasts reveal their top spots for a wild swimSuzanna CruickshankWhen I first moved to the Lake District I was a big walker but then I started swimming and realised all those feelings you get from climbing a mountain – the sense of peace, the satisfaction – you can get from swimming for five minutes in a lake. Swimming is a different way to appreciate the beauty of the area it’s a view that you’re not sharing with anyone else because you’re on your own out there.My perfect spot is Crummock Water, in the north-west lakes. It takes a bit of effort to get to but is surrounded by mountains. The water is very accessible, so it’s suitable for beginners, but it’s also very quiet. You do get busy spots, normally around car parks, but within five or 10 minutes’ walk you can find your own little secluded bay. I was there at 6.45 this morning and it was mirror flat with the sun coming up over the hills. It was fantastic. The Barn Tea Rooms at New House Farm, near Crummock, is a quaint place to go for a coffee or hot chocolate afterwards.I set up my swim-guiding business in December 2016 and demand is growing. When you swim in a lake or river you can’t take anything into the water with you. There are very few experiences like that where you can have such detachment from your everyday life.• Suzanna leads wild swims across the Lakes for all abilities, suzannaswims Daniel StartThe Brecon Beacons provide a Narnia of pools, lakes and rivers an enchanted land I have paddled, swum and explored since I was a child. Coed-y-Rhaiadr, the “waterfall woods”, are carved out by the Mellte and Nedd rivers where they meet a band of soft limestone coral. There are canyons to snorkel through, waterfalls to climb behind and emerald pools, such as Lady Falls, hidden in a great moss-and-fern amphitheatre. Bushwhack up to Einion Gam, a narrow, roaring cascade – it’s one of the tallest falls in Wales but is rarely visited. The New Inn in Ystradfellte is a cosy place to warm up afterwards, with roasts and a bunkhouse.To the east, around Blaenavon, Keeper’s Pond (Pen-ffordd-goch) is a natural infinity pool with mountain views. From here follow Hill’s Tramroad to the Blorenge Punchbowl, a forested cwm with a secret lake and an island to swim to. They’re both close to the highest inn in Wales, the Lamb \u0026amp Fox at Pwll Du, with roaring fires, live music and a wild-west feel. For something gentler, the River Usk cuts a meandering course past charming villages and twisted yews with idyllic beaches all the way. My favourite is at Llangynidr, where the river runs rocky with rapids. Explore downstream to find beautiful swimming at Crickhowell.• Daniel Start is the author of Wild Guide: Wales (Wild Things Publishing, £16.99)Alexandra HeminsleyI came to river swimming as someone who had learned my stroke in the sea. The first river I swam was not far from my home town of Brighton – the Arun, from Ford down to Littlehampton. I spent the first few minutes lost in a sensory wonderland. There was none of the noise of crashing waves that I had become accustomed to in the sea, nor was I rocked from side to side by tidal swells. Instead, I felt the river’s gentle motion take me through the countryside and with it down to the beach.The water is greener than I have ever seen in the sea, the colour and opacity of a piece of glass. Nor does it taste of briny tang – only the hint of “mint and mud”, as Virginia Woolf called it. It is silty, but fresh, like spirulina.As the river approaches the sea, its banks are high, its curves wide and slow. The swimmer, often surrounded by swans at this point, sees the world as a cygnet might: drifting softly by, protected but enjoying the view. The Arun is the second fastest tidal river in the UK, unmistakably so once you near Littlehampton beach. It felt like the very best of flying dreams, when you need only put your arms out and feel yourself carried aloft by the elements. When I can’t sleep, I relive that swim.• Alexandra Heminsley is author of Leap In: A Woman, Some Waves and the Will to Swim (Hutchinson, £12.99)I’m based in Glenmore in the Cairngorms national park and I try to swim every day of the year, even if it means breaking the ice. There are two lochs within a mile of where I live, so I’ll usually go for a swim in one of those.Loch Morlich is the bigger of the two and it’s accessible by road. It’s quite big and they do loads of water sports there. It has a really nice long beach and the water takes a long time to become deep, so you can wade in easily and get acclimatised. There’s also the Red Squirrel café where you can get your hot chocolate and bacon roll after your swim. The other one is Lochan Uaine. It means “Green Lake” in Gaelic and it’s this amazing jade colour. The folklore is that it’s because the fairies wash their clothes in it, but I think it’s something to do with the minerals in the water.Lochan Uaine is a mile’s walk on a good track from Glenmore. It’s a popular place for walkers, but not everyone goes for a swim. I don’t know why… They’re missing out. The lake is surrounded by a proper Caledonian pine forest, so you might see squirrels – and on one side there’s a huge scree slope.• Calum MacLean is an outdoor instructor and broadcaster who makes vlogs and videos on swimming for the Scottish Gaelic channel BBC AlbaThere’s something really grounding, but also a bit OTT, about wild swimming. It resets you. I travel a lot for work so now I just look up the nearest lake, river, puddle, where I can go wild swimming whenever I’m away.For the last couple of years I’ve done the Hay Festival. In my work I’m often communicating, public facing, trying to make people feel comfortable, so going off on my own and keeping my mouth shut for a bit is a real pleasure. I’d heard about the River Wye so I got up early and walked through the woods to this place called the Warren. It was beautiful, really serene, and the water was green and still. These are the things you start to notice with cold-water swimming: it’s quite animalistic, you notice nature’s colours. I really enjoyed it, but then I had a bit of fear wash over me because I was on my own and I was like: I don’t really know if there are electric eels in here! I did it again this year, but this time I took my colleagues with me. Wild swimming has changed my life.

My favourite places at the moment are family-orientated: my two boys (five and six) love Farleigh and District Swimming Club, one of the country’s last river swimming clubs, on the River Frome near Trowbridge, where they can jump in, wade with small fish in the shallows around the weir and attempt to get their open-water long-distance badge. It’s a very English kind of river: mellow green water, kingfishers, mayflies, mating damselflies, giant shags on floating branches… and cream teas at the farm next door. With a sunbathing field to spread out picnics and BBQs, it’s a delight.Also near my current home in Somerset is Warleigh Weir in the River Avon. It is massively popular, to the extent the Canal and River Trust has put up signs giving swimmers risk information, rather than trying to scare them off. The River Dart in Devon has myriad dipping and swimming spots. Spitchwick Common on Dartmoor suits children well with space for a picnic and ball games. There are river pools and natural water slides nearby, and deeper water on the far side.• Kate Rew is founder of the Outdoor Swimming Society.

We laugh and sing. We play music. Music is for peace so we no longer live in fear,” Kabanle says, sipping a cappuccino.There are few cities with contrasts as stark as those of Mogadishu. Swollen by hundreds of thousands of people displaced by famine, drought and conflict in rural areas, its outlying districts resemble a vast refugee camp. Authorities are incompetent, corrupt or simply absent.It is seven years since the Islamic militants of al-Shabaab withdrew but many streets bear the scars of more than two decades of incessant warfare.Mogadishu’s inhabitants have long been known for their resilience, but a new wave of activists, entrepreneurs and artists are now trying to improve their city.Two years ago, Kabanle survived an al-Shabaab gun attack and suicide car bombing close to where he now performs every evening. The attack left at least 10 dead, including three of Aweys’s friends. The oud player was forced to jump over the wall of the hotel where he was playing to escape.“For several months following, there was no show,” he says. “People were unwilling to come back but I was committed to come here again. I started the first night by myself alone playing music and resumed hosting the show. Thanks be to God, people got confidence and now they are coming back for my show.”Despite the ongoing violence in the Somali capital, the economy is growing, hundreds of expatriates are returning from the west or African nations, scores of colleges are opening to cater for the young population and there is growing investment from the diaspora. Estate agents thrive: a two-storey house can cost nearly £100,000. Mogadishu has hosted a TEDx conference.News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theAhmed Hassan Sheikh decided to return to Mogadishu from Kenya a year and a half ago. He started his own arts company inside the fortified Mogadishu airport complex, where thousands of diplomats, United Nations staff and regional troops from the African Union stabilisation force are based.There is no shortage of demand for Sheikh’s paintings.“I do not need to fight with a gun. I have a powerful pen with which I draw my feelings. I believe through it I can bring change. I can make Mogadishu peaceful,” the 48-year-old artist says.His paintings call for young people to take up pens and books instead of arms, to warn against illegal migration and its devastating effects on Somali families.Other drawings recall life in old Mogadishu before the civil war, a time when the city was known as the most beautiful city in Africa. “When people see my artworks of former Mogadishu and how it used to be like, they appreciate how peaceful and prosperous Mogadishu was,” Ahmed says.Then there is Ubaxa Caasimadda (Flowers of the City), a group of students who, 18 months ago, set out to smarten scruffy city streets and mark roads to increase public safety. They started with the safest roads such as those near the presidential palace, because some had already received death threats from al-Shabaab.“When we started, we did not even know what will come out. It was just, go and do and then see. We knew the dangers we were facing but we took that risk,” says Amira Mahad Abdulle, a 24-year-old university student.Abdulle wears a burqa to conceal her identity and does not respond to phone calls from unknown people for her safety. “There are a lot of threats coming in but I try to stay safe. I do not fear. I want to serve Mogadishu,” she says.The group decided to act “because nobody else was willing to do it” and the government in Mogadishu is focused on fighting al-Shabaab. “We could not sit behind and wait for someone else to do this for the people of Mogadishu. We are the youth of this country and we decided to stand up for it,” Abdulle says.So far the group has painted dozens of zebra crossings and have planted flowers on pavements. “We are committed. We were born in Mogadishu and we want to help our city become developed, beautiful and safe like other cities in the world,” Isse Hassan Ibrahim, a 23-year-old typographic graduate, says.Though his best friend, a government employee, was assassinated by al-Shabaab last year, Ibrahim never stopped working as a volunteer in Mogadishu. “When my friend was killed, I got scared but I decided not to quit. I want to help my people and my capital city,” Ibrahim says. “We now have new youth groups joining us from other cities.”In the last 18 months, US and Somali forces have intensified the battle against al-Shabab, though without achieving decisive success. Last week US officials said a new airstrike killed 14 militants. Though the increased military activity has weakened the extremists, it also led to more civilian casualties.Kabanle believes his country will soon be at peace. “Somalia is no longer a war zone. It is a love zone,” he says, pointing to a group of young men and women sitting on the warm white sand of Mogadishu’s beach.This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

Belmullet weather station in Co Mayo was the exception.An “absolute drought” is defined as 15 or more consecutive days of less than 0.2mm of rainfall.The dry weather has prompted Irish Water to extend its hosepipe ban nationwide from 8am on Friday. Irish Water warned the ban would likely remain in place until at least July 31st.Those found flouting the ban can be fined €125 and prosecuted if they fail to pay the fine. Irish Water said the measure had helped to reduce demand from 615 million litres a day to 578 million litres.Kate Gannon, Irish Water’s corporate affairs manager, said it would “take weeks and months” for water sources to recover from the dry spell.“We have seen a reduction in demand and we would like to see that continue over the coming weeks,” she said.Despite the warnings, supermarket chain Lidl said its 7,500 litre swimming pools had sold out within hours of going on sale on Thursday.“Unfortunately due to unprecedented demand the above item has sold out much quicker than we could have anticipated,” it said. “Stock for this promotion was bought and the sales date planned nearly a year in advance.“Whilst we apologise to customers who have been disappointed, we would ask customers to be respectful towards our employees who have no control over availability.”In response to queries from The , a spokeswoman for Irish Water said less than 20 domestic users have been reported for water misuse.“Irish Water continues to review the situation and asks that everyone, including commercial entities, are mindful of their water usage,” she said.“The water conservation order relates to domestic customers only but again we will continue to review this in conjunction with reviewing the weather situation in the coming days and weeks.”Irish Water also said it was making two tanker trips per day to Inis Oirr off the west coast as the volume of visitors meant the population was increasing on summer weekends from the usual 150 to some 2,000.The conditions have led to the outbreak of wildfires in many parts of the State. Coillte said fires were tackled on Thursday in the Slieve Bloom Mountains in LaoisOffaly, where a large area was burned after a blaze spread into a forest from open moorland.Offaly Fire and Rescue Service shared an image on its Facebook page of a baby fawn that was rescued from the Slieve Bloom blaze on Wednesday.There was also a “significant fire” in Kildalkey, Co Meath, as well as others in the Dublin Mountains.Following a request from civil authorities, the Air Corps said it responded to requests for assistance in Dublin, Wicklow, Limerick, Cork, Tipperary and Offaly. It dropped approximately 300,000 litres of water using specialised equipment.Agusta Westland AW139 helicopters were utilised as they can be equipped with a “Bambi” bucket aerial firefighting system capable of dropping 1,200 litres of water per pass.“This amount of water, concentrated in small areas, makes an immediate impact on wildfires,” it said. “These operations are ongoing and the Defence Forces are prepared to continue firefighting operations in support of our communities.”Irish Water Safety, Coast Guard and RNLI issued a joint appeal reminding the public to stay alert to the risk of drowning. On average, five people drown in Ireland every fortnight and the risks increase during July and August.Meanwhile, Inland Fisheries Ireland appealed to anglers and fishery managers to voluntarily cease salmon angling on catch and release rivers with immediate effect due to high water temperatures and the current drought conditions.Five-day nationwide forecasts, weather warnings and rainfall maps "},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Seanad to vote on legislation prohibiting importation of goods from illegal settlements\u0026lsquoSome alleviation\u0026rsquo to drought conditions but dry and warm weather to continueDisturbances in Derry continue ahead of TwelfthConsultants\u0026rsquo body says State\u0026rsquos acute hospital and mental health services are at breaking pointRoyal itinerary: Duke and Duchess of Sussex to make number of stops around DublinInvestigation begins after loaded weapon returned by member of the publicPatrick Freyne: Prince should feel at home here, given he looks like a John Hinde postcardOireachtas members begin co-ordinated efforts to field a rival presidential candidateCatherine Noone tweeted and then removed the claim after meeting the royal coupleHundreds of soccer fans, including ambassadors, gather in Dtwo for semi-final clashVaradkar asked about poll on deletion of role in the home article from ConstitutionShane Ross wants reform of selection process as he believes bench is marred by \u0026lsquocronyism\u0026rsquoOireachtas committee told Climate Emergency Measures Bill \u0026lsquolaudable but flawed\u0026rsquoMet \u0026Eacuteireann issues warning as Air Corps helicopters help douse Armagh gorse fireMinister for Health confirms abortion services \u0026lsquowill be provided on a universal basis\u0026rsquoCourt told member of Garda unit watched on as fake explosives delivery arrived at man\u0026rsquos homeDepartment official says demographic bulge will cause pressure \u0026lsquoacross all subject areas\u0026rsquo"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3560141.1531244814!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ireland s drought could be over showers forecast for wednesday","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tHot summer: children on parched grass in Phoenix Park, Dublin, after 20 days without significant rain.

Over Munster and south Leinster top temperatures will reach 21-23 degrees. Winds will be light northeasterly and moderate near coasts.Thursday will have sunny spells and be mostly dry, with just a few showers likely. Temperatures will reach 18-23 degrees in light northerly or variable breezes.Friday will be another mostly dry day, with some sunny spells, but a few showers are still likely. Temperatures will reach the low to mid-20s in light variable breezes.Temperatures are forecast to reach 24 degrees on Saturday, which is likely to start mostly dry, with sunny spells or hazy sunshine cloud will increase from the west, with scattered showers spreading eastwards later and overnight. Winds will become light to moderate southwest to westerly.Sunday will be somewhat cloudier, with outbreaks of showery rain in light to moderate southwesterly winds.But Irish Water has warned that it may still need to restrict supplies for the rest of the year executives at the utility company met on Monday to discuss the possibility of imposing further limits in addition to the introduction of a national hosepipe ban.The vast majority of the country officially entered a state of absolute drought last week, with no rainfall recorded at 24 out of 25 weather stations over a two-week period.Amid the drought, Ulster Bank announced it would set up a €15 million fund, from which farmers affected by the weather can apply for credit. Applications for the fund open on Monday, July 16th.Farmers facing cash flow problems due to higher feed costs and fodder shortages, as a result of the extreme weather, can apply to the fund.Dublin Fire Brigade have warned motorists to avoid parking their cars directly over grass, as there is a risk the exhaust pipe could ignite the dry vegetation.A spokesman for the fire service cautioned motorists: “Your car’s exhaust pipe gets extremely hot and can cause dry grass to catch fire.” There has been one report of a car exhaust pipe starting a fire on a grass verge it was parked on in Wexford, which destroyed the car, the spokesman said.Meanwhile, Air Corps helicopters have been deployed across the Border to assist fire fighters in Northern Ireland who are tackling a gorse fire two miles from the Border, in the Slieve Gullion area of Co Armagh.The involvement of the Defence Forces was welcomed by Doug Beattie, Ulster Unionist Party MLA for Upper Bann, who tweeted his thanks to the Air Corps, describing their role as “neighbours being neighbourly”.Two helicopters were involved following a request from the Northern Ireland Fire Service.

Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, hailed the “unique” relationship between Ireland and the UK when he spoke to guests at a garden party at the British ambassador’s residence in Dublin.In his only public remarks on a two-day visit - the first with his wife Meghan Markle, the Duchess of Sussex, since their May wedding - the prince struck both a serious and humorous tone in his four-minute speech to guests at Glencairn in Sandyford.He opened his remarks with a few words in Irish, addressing Tánaiste Simon Coveney, British ambassador Robin Barnett and “a dhaoine uaisle,” following up quickly with: “Did I get that right?”He did and guests cheered in response.“There are more rugby people than we originally thought,” he joked in response to the raucous cheer.He thanked everyone for the “warm welcome we’ve received since being in this beautiful country” and he thanked the Tánaiste for showing his father, Prince Charles, around Cork when he visited last month.“And it was also very nice to know that he didn’t bore you senseless,” he said of his father.The prince, sharing the podium with the Duchess, the Tánaiste and the ambassador, said his father and grandmother, Queen Elizabeth, had spoken warmly with him of the visits they enjoyed here in Ireland.He and his wife were “so pleased” to make Ireland their “first international visit together as a married couple” and hoped that it would be “the first of many”.“As each other’s closest neighbours, the UK and Ireland’s relationship is unique our shared history is long and complex. There have of course been challenging and at times tragic period of that relationship,” he said.He closed with President Michael D Higgins’s remarks on his visit to the UK in 2014: “We live in each other’s shadows we shield each other, and rely on each other for shelter.”The prince said that sentiment was “as apt now as it was then, as we draw strength from one another as neighbours, partners and above all friends”.The prince, wearing a navy suit, and the Duchess, in a black knee-length cocktail dress designed by Emilia Wickstead, chatted with guests that included former president Mary Robinson, former taoiseach Enda Kenny and members of the Cabinet including Simon Harris and Josepha Madigan.Among the guests were people from the worlds of sports and the arts, who assembled in “pods” on the lawn of the ambassador’s residence.The possibility of England winning the World Cup was an icebreaker in conversations with the Royal visitors.Former Leinster and Ireland rugby player Brian O’Driscoll said he asked the prince: “Is it coming home?” referring to whether England would win.“He didn’t jump at me immediately saying ‘yes it was’, so I am thinking there is either humility or he is not sure whether he is coming home or not,” said O’Driscoll.Actor and author Amy Huberman told the prince that she attended the royal wedding between Prince William and Kate Middleton on her own as O’Driscoll could not fulfill the invite as he was playing for Leinster. She referred to her husband’s circle on the greeting line as the “Bod pod.”Vicky Phelan, the Limerick woman whose case exposed the controversy around the CervicalCheck screening programme, said she was gobsmacked when the Duchess told her she had heard about her story.“She said: ‘I have been following your story you have been doing some great stuff’,” said a dumbfounded Phelan.Actor Barry Keoghan said he previously met the prince at the UK premiere of Dunkirk, the movie he starred in.“He’s cool, yeah. It was nice,” he said. “At the Dunkirk premiere it was a bit more serious with veterans there. With this, he stood and had his chat with us.”Introducing the Duke, Mr Coveney welcomed that “the new generation of the British Royal Family” were continuing to “nourish” Anglo-Irish ties as “the countries seek to navigate a shared and difficult history.”Remarking on England’s success in the World Cup, Mr Coveney said that it was the “first time I can remember that there are probably as many people cheering for England as against England”.There was, however, a hesitant and muted round of applause when he said he would like to see England win the World Cup."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3561071.1531296850!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"where can i see prince harry and meghan markle today","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex arrived in Dublin Airport on Tuesday afternoon.

Video: Parliamentlive.tv\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTheresa May departs following a cabinet meeting at number 10 Downing Street in London on Tuesday. Photograph: Luke MacGregorBloombergBritish prime minister Theresa May moved to reassert her authority on Tuesday after two top cabinet members quit and launched broadsides against her Brexit plans, winning support from many of her ministers including a leading eurosceptic.Ms May said she had chaired a “productive” meeting of her government, unswayed by the resignations of foreign secretary Boris Johnson and Brexit negotiator David Davis that rocked the government on Monday.Among those rallying around the prime minister was environment minister Michael Gove - a prominent campaigner to exit the European Union alongside Johnson for the 2016 referendum - who said he would not follow suit by resigning.However, the vice-chairs of the Conservative Party, MPs Ben Bradley and Maria Caulfield, resigned their posts on Tuesday because of their opposition to Ms May’s current policy on Brexit.“I fully understand and appreciate the great many challenges you face in delivering on Brexit, not least the balancing act in the House of Commons that constrains your freedom,” Mr Bradley wrote in his resignation later. “However I have come to the conclusion that I cannot in good faith be a spokesman for the party or for Government on this issue, and I cannot with any sincerity defend this course to my electorate, 71 per cent of whom voted to leave the European Union.”With less than nine months until Britain is due to leave the bloc, Ms May is sticking to her plan for a “business friendly” Brexit.She looks set on facing down a rebellion in her Conservative Party, where hardline Brexit supporters are livid over her plans to negotiate “a free trade area for goods” with the EU. One described accepting EU rules as “the ultimate betrayal”.Above a picture of her cabinet, including her new foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt and Brexit minister Dominic Raab after a mini-reshuffle late on Monday, Ms May wrote on her twitter feed: “Productive Cabinet meeting this morning - looking ahead to a busy week.”Her spokesman said she had welcomed the new members of her cabinet and they had discussed the publication of a white paper policy document on Britain’s future ties with the EU and stepping up preparations for any no-deal outcome to the negotiations with Brussels. Other ministers described the meeting as “very good”.“I think it is right that the cabinet backs the prime minister and speaks with one voice and if people don’t do that then they have to go,” justice secretary David Gauke told BBC radio.Ms May must now move quickly to try to win the EU’s support for her Brexit proposal to unblock talks. These have all but stalled because of her reticence of show her cards until now for fear of angering one of the two main factions of her party.German chancellor Angela Merkel arrives in London later on Tuesday for a meeting with May and other leaders to discuss the Western Balkans.The British leader may have stilled the waters over a possible leadership contest, but some Conservative Brexit supporters are still incensed over what they see as her decision to break her promise for a clean break with the EU.“It is the ultimate betrayal of our democracy and people’s belief in it. It’s not even an accidental betrayal, it was planned and plotted well in advance,” said Conservative politician Andrew Bridgen.“Never have so many campaigned for so long and so hard for so little,” he said.But while many Brexit campaigners were still hoping for a vote of confidence to oust Ms May, it is unlikely that they have the numbers. They also are in a minority in parliament to try to change any deal that is agreed with the EU.At a meeting with Conservative politicians on Monday, she was cheered and applauded by many, having warned them that internal squabbling could pave the way for socialist opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn to take power instead.Ms May’s proposals for a future EU relationship after Britain departs from the bloc next March had taken two years of internal government wrangling to agree. But within 48 hours Davis had quit and Johnson followed. The Daily  newspaper ran a photograph on Tuesday of him, pen poised, resigning as foreign minister. Three junior ministers also quit their posts.“Brexit should be about opportunity and hope,” Mr Johnson said in a scathing resignation letter that was echoed in headlines in a number of Britain’s national newspapers. “That dream is dying, suffocated by needless self-doubt.”Meanwhile, US president Donald Trump has said the UK is in turmoil and suggested that his meeting with Russian president Vladimir Putin would be the easiest of his trip to Europe to see Nato leaders and Ms May.Speaking as he boarded Marine One, Mr Trump said: “It’s going to be an interesting time in the UK and an interesting time at Nato. We will work it out and all countries will be happy.“So I have Nato, I have the UK — that’s a situation with turmoil. And I have Putin. Frankly, Putin may be the easiest of all.”On his trip to Europe, he added: “It’s going to be an interesting time in the UK and an interesting time at Nato. We will work it out and all countries will be happy.“We do have a lot of allies. But we cannot be taken advantage of. We’re being taken advantage of by the European Union. We spend 75 per cent on Nato and frankly, it helps them more than it helps us.”–ReutersPress AssociationDeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

This will help ensure that more informed comparisons can be made.”However, the BBC’s insistence that it is being transparent over salaries is marred by the fact that the list is already out-of-date. It covers the financial year to April 2018, but many presenters have had pay increases or cuts in recent months. Their current salaries will not be disclosed for another year.The BBC will hide current earnings in a separate table grouping presenters anonymously in £50,000 bands, rather than publishing inidual salaries.Around one-third of the stars who appeared on last year’s list will be absent because they salaries are paid via BBC Studios, which was spun off last year as a commercial entity. Strictly Come Dancing, Countryfile, Antiques Roadshow, Casualty and EastEnders all fall within the Studios remit.In 2017, two-thirds of presenters earning £150,000 or more were men:BBC\u0026#039s star salaries: Where the money is spentInsiders said there will  be more women on the list this year and fewer men. Sarah Montague and Emily Maitlis are expected to appear for the first time, after their exclusion last year highlighted the corporation’s gender pay gap.Some men are also thought to have received a pay boost, including Justin Webb, who until recently was the lowest paid member of the Today team. Although his salary last year was £150,000-199,999, a portion of that was for other BBC output. Sarah Montague’s Today salary was £133,000, and Webb earned less than her.Webb later asked why another Today colleague, Nick Robinson, was “paid £100,000 or so a year more than me essentially to do the same job”.2017 BBC salaries list: the biggest surprisesThe BBC’s famous names are braced for the fallout when their salaries are made public as part of the corporation’s annual report.One household name told the  last week that the list amounts to “a National Trolling Festival where we all get pummelled over our salaries”, and said the £10,000 bands were “the latest humiliation”.Lord Hall, the director-general, will today reaffirm his pledge to eliminate the gender pay gap by 2020. The gap has fallen from 9.3 per cent to 7.6 per cent in the past year.Revealed: The BBC stars to have taken the biggest wage cutsNew footage shows two boys from the Thai football team airlifted to hospital after cave rescueBritish ers who found trapped Thai cave boys should get George Cross, says Lord Ashcroft\u0026#39BBC Women\u0026#39 enter ranks of top earners after leading fight over gender gap - but men still dominate listCanadian park ranger fights off grizzly attack after bear rips off part of his scalpJohn Cleese announces he is leaving Britain in protest of ‘awful’ Brexit vote for paradise Caribbean islandFootball is \u0026#39most definitely\u0026#39 coming home, says Duke of Sussex ahead of England\u0026#39s World Cup semi-finalNovichok victim is interviewed by police as they continue to hunt for the source of the contaminationBig Ben to be adorned with St George\u0026#39s flags for the first time in nearly 100 yearsDonald Trump UK visit: Everything you need to know, from when he will arrive to who he is expected to meetWhy Russia\u0026#39s forgotten war will speak almost as loudly as Trump at Nato summitWorld Cup: England embraces Waistcoat Wednesday as football fever sweeps nation \u0026#39War zone\u0026#39 hospitals, \u0026#39no-go\u0026#39 areas and \u0026#39lousy\u0026#39 locations: What Donald Trump has said about BritainDonald Trump at Nato summit: \u0026#39Germany is a captive of Russia\u0026#39Multivitamins provide no protection against heart attacks, study findsBeate Zschäpe: Surviving member of German neo-Nazi murder cell NSU gets life in prisonHandmaid\u0026#39s Tale wine launched, then immediately pulled after social media backlashSenior aide to David Davis accuses Downing Street officials of pursuing a \u0026#39Hotel California Brexit\u0026#39What is the \u0026#39First Past The Post\u0026#39 voting system?Fans clash with riot police as French World Cup celebrations turn uglyEngland World Cup excitement hits fever pitch as nation gears up for Croatia semi-finalWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/07/11/TELEMMGLPICT000168744650_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"british divers found trapped thai cave boys should get george","story":"digitalservices@telegraphTwo British volunteer ers found the boys in the cave after a nine-day search, and worked on the rescue with the Royal Thai Navy as well as other volunteers from the UK, US, Australia and Chinadigitalservices@telegraphThere are calls for the British ers who helped rescue 12 schoolboys and their football coach from a flooded Thai cave to be honoured.Rick Stanton and John Volanthen were the first ers to reach the group nine days after they went missing in the underground network in northern Thailand.The pair, along with a number of other British elite ers had flown to the region to assist at the request of Thai authorities.On Tuesday the last of the Wild Boars football team were brought safely to the surface and taken to hospital.The British rescuers were said to be all alright and resting after the gruelling operation.Writing on Twitter, former Conservative Party treasurer Lord Ashcroft suggested Mr Stanton and Mr Volanthen could be awarded the George Cross or George Medal for their bravery.The George Cross is the highest civilian honour in the United Kingdom and Commonwealth.Others called for the pair to be given knighthoods for their heroic efforts.Businesswoman Tracey Follows tweeted: Knighthoods for the British ers involved please. True bravery and superhero status.Other figures paid tribute to the rescue team, including Oscar-winning US actress Marlee Matlin.She tweeted: Oceans of gratitude to the British Thai cave ers and Navy SEALs who got all 12 boys and their coach out of the cave.Former England captain Michael Vaughan wrote on Twitter: Proud of the England Football team ..

The initial walk-out will take place at Amazon\u0027s biggest warehouse, on the outskirts of Madrid.But the organisers have called on workers across Europe to join in the strike too.Some Twitter users have called on Amazon customers to support the strike by not buying its products or using its services.Remember to stand in solidarity with Amazon workers from the\u0026nbsp10th-16th! wrote one Twitter user, Mackenzie Harris, in a post that has now been shared thousands of times.

But, the US did not threaten Russia in the same manner.\u0026nbspAn unnamed Russian delegate said the country stepped up to back and help pass the resolution because they felt\u0026nbsp “it is wrong when a big country tries to push around some very small countries, especially on an issue that is really important for the rest of the world.The delegation was also opposed to another section of the resolution which called on countries to curtail promotion of products that medical experts agreed could cause harm to children according to more than a dozen delegates to the health meeting, the majority of whom requested anonymity because they feared retaliation from the US, according to the newspaper.Though US\u0026nbspefforts were unsuccessful since the bulk of the original wording survived two whole days of procedural talks, language calling for “inappropriate promotion of foods for infants and young children to end was removed due to US efforts.\u0026nbspThe US mission to the UN nor the State Department responded to a request for comment.\u0026nbspIt appeared,\u0026nbsphowever, the US was asking to have the language removed as a sign of support for the $70bn\u0026nbspinfant formula industry which relies on mothers not exclusively breastfeeding. Baby food lobbyists were in attendance as observers to the meeting.The US also reportedly threatened to cut its contributions to the World Health Organisation - the US contributes almost 15 per cent of the agency\u0027s budget or $845m last year - if the resolution was introduced and passed.\u0026nbspIn light of the threat on Ecuador, other poorer countries in Latin America and Africa refused to introduce the resolution out of fear of American retaliation which left Russia to push it through.\u0026nbspBreastfeeding in public controversiesA woman has sparked a heated debate among parents after she revealed that she breastfeeds both her and her friend\u0027s son.

However, Comcast waded in with a higher offer of £12.50 per share earlier this year, and Sky withdrew its support for the Fox bid. On Wednesday, Fox and Sky announced that they had reached agreement on the terms of a new offer of £14 per share, a 12 per cent increase on Comcast’s bid, which values Sky at £24.5bn.

With an estimated worth of $1bn, a trade body and a recognised marketing award, they have finally been tamedClick to followThe Independent OnlinePep talk: Kendall Jenner’s Pepsi advert was pulled shortly after it aired for appearing to trivialise demonstrations tackling social causesLast month, the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity –\u0026nbspthe biggest grouping of advertising and marketing people you could ever hope to avoid –\u0026nbspintroduced a new award: the Social and Influencer\u0026nbspcategory.Yes, those\u0026nbspgurning thumb-flexers forever punching #YOLO, #instacool and #nofilter into their smartphones as they plug products have come of age.\u0026nbspInfluencer-dom is now a fully-fledged industry. Yet only a year or two ago we were told by many (rather gleefully in some cases) that the influencer was dead or at least in crisis.Earlier this year, this seemed to be confirmed as the owner of the White Moose Cafe in Dublin turned the tables on\u0026nbsp22-year-old YouTube vlogger and influencer Elle Darby, by exposing her demand for five free hotel nights in return for exposure.His public burn spoke for many: “If I let you stay here in return for a feature in a video, who is going to pay the staff who look after you?” The twitter-mob turned on influencers. Who were they? How do they get away with it? Do they actually earn money?When the influencer marketing industry began (around 2008-10, attest the form’s historians) the notion took hold that like celebrity endorsement before it, aspirational people could become marketing tools, accessing the consumer mind as if a recommendation from a friend.YouTuber with 139,095 subscribers, was refused a free hotel stay (YouTubeElle Darby)As one observer put it:\u0026nbsp“They emerged almost overnight and in 10 years have gone from a small network to a worldwide community.” Some sources suggest that there is now a baseline of 1.1 million influencers worldwide.\u0026nbspMediakix estimated\u0026nbspthe industry was worth more than $1bn\u0026nbsp(£750m)\u0026nbspin 2017. Malcolm Gladwell’s coinage, “the tipping point”, was used a lot in meetings.\u0026nbspBy about 2014, a baffled world had started to understand influencer marketing, but the industry’s breakthrough year was probably 2016 when, as Hamda Issa-Salwe of Bravado, part of Universal Music Group, found when she did a research thesis called Investigating the Use of Influencer Marketing on Social Media.“It began to soar,” she says. “Google classified ‘influencer’ as a breakout keyword with a 5,000 per cent month by month increase in the number of times the search term ‘influencer marketing’ was typed.”Also in 2016, it was established that Kendall Jenner was paid an estimated $300,000 per social media post. Advertising agencies took more careful notice of influencers and Instagram –\u0026nbspfounded in 2010 – became the key station of the social media cross, along with other key platforms\u0026nbspsuch as YouTube, Snapchat and Pinterest.Even the fustiest legacy-media type can now see the point. The barrier to entry is low. All you need is a smartphone and a certain brio. And the research seems to add up. According to Nielsen, 84 per cent\u0026nbspof consumers trust opinions from people they know, while 70 per cent\u0026nbsptake action based on other consumer’s opinions online.vlogger Zoella reportedly has a net worth of £2.5m (InstagramZoella)The Association of National Advertisers found that 75 per cent\u0026nbspof members already work with influencers, and the growing industry will take 20 per cent\u0026nbspof the total global marketing budget by 2023.No wonder that 82 per cent\u0026nbspof millennials hope to become influencers at least, according to a survey by London-based dating app CLiKD.\u0026nbspSo the money’s talking, and influencers can do well.It seems a great life but you don’t want to be that person with a fridgeful of isotonic drinks and unable to pay the rentAs Anthony Svirskis, CEO\u0026nbspof TRIBE and a juror on the\u0026nbspSocial and Influencer award says:\u0026nbsp“On a post by post basis, brands should expect to pay £50 for someone with 3,000 followers and upwards of £300 if someone has more than 100,000 followers.” Small wonder the market is seething with aspirant influencers.\u0026nbspYet influencers are still derided as being without any particular skills: even that they’re the apotheosis of the entitled “Me” generation, spreading paid-for blandishments in vocal-fry vlogs on YouTube.While it’s hard to blame someone who travels the world in return for Instagram snaps, is there an influencer bubble waiting to burst? Paul Dyer, of marketing company Lippe Taylor, believes it will, as trust has disappeared from the sector in the sceptical Facebook-Cambridge Analytica era.“There is tremendous value in influencer marketing,” he said recently. “However, many current practices are only speeding us to the precipice where the bottom falls out.”Indeed, there have been several influencer #epicfails, perhaps the most notable being\u0026nbspFyre\u0026nbspFestival, the ill-fated 2017 Bahamas musical festival that paid Kendall Jenner and Bella\u0026nbspHadid\u0026nbspto drum up support.\u0026nbspFyre\u0026nbspbombed and the repercussions are ongoing.There’s also an undergrowth of freebie-hunting influencers harassing hotels and providers. Some hotels – the\u0026nbspDusit\u0026nbspThani\u0026nbspresort in the Males among them – now use weeding out processes. “When they work hotels love them,” says one travel PR.\u0026nbspThe influencer economy … is a market irrationality. Companies are self-correcting in the face of so much wasted money“Influencers are uncritical and often share films and photographs that would otherwise be paid for. But there’s a trust problem.”There are other cracks in the influencer edifice as brands begin to ask questions about the business efficacy of influencers. As publicist Mark Borkowski says:\u0026nbsp“More brands are beginning to realise that influencer activity doesn’t necessarily drive ROI.”And the pain is on both sides, he adds. “It seems a great life but you don’t want to be that person with a fridgeful of isotonic drinks and unable to pay the rent.” Anti-influencers are coming of the woodwork –\u0026nbspand they’re not all crusty oldies with a grudge.“The influencer economy … is a market irrationality,” wrote Sam Biddle of Gawker in 2016. “Companies are self-correcting in the face of so much wasted money.” As for bots and fake followers, that’s a real problem.Fyre Festival attendees locked in airport ‘for their own safety’At Cannes, Unilever’s chief marketing officer Keith Weed called for industry action to clean out the influencer stable, and vowed never to use influencers found to be buying followers.So the sands are shifting. Hamda Issa-Salwe says that while influencer activity remains hard to define and audit, it’s still growing. Although trust and authenticity (the great influencer bon mot) are major factors, brands still spend a lot on influencers: after all,\u0026nbspInstagram has more 800 million monthly active users.And the influencers themselves are fighting back. It’s a new industry: of course legacy dinosaurs wouldn’t get it. It’s just another marketing tool. And what are –\u0026nbspsorry, were –\u0026nbspnewspapers half the time, but a vehicle of paid-for information?“Indeed, there’s a growing distrust of traditional media advertising,” says Harry Hugo, cofounder at The Goat Agency, Europe’s leading influencer agency, which claims to be growing at a rate of 600 per cent\u0026nbspa year.“Just look at the rise in ad blockers, investigations into media transparency and big networks like WPP struggling. Influencers can be one of the most trusted, and therefore highest converting, information sources for people.”\u0026nbspAlso, we jeremiahs just don’t get the craft and graft that goes into an influencer’s brand persona, adds Florencia Lujani, influencer marketing manager at agency We Are Social London.“People struggle to see why brands would pay money to partner with influencers for something which appears relatively simple,” she says. “But it takes time and effort, talent, passion and commitment.”\u0026nbspAnd even the thorny issue of disclosure –\u0026nbspthat is, whether you should know what someone is being paid to promote –\u0026nbspis a smaller issue than is often supposed, says Svirskis. “Influencers are very compliant of requirements to disclose and are often represented by an influencer agency.”There is tremendous value in influencer marketing. However, many current practices are only speeding us to the precipice where the bottom falls outMost importantly of all, influencers make money for clients. Currently, the average ROI of influencer marketing is £7 back for every £1 spent, says Amelia Neate of Influencer Champions.\u0026nbspSo,\u0026nbspdo you have to be pretty? “It’s definitely not reserved for those with looks,” says Svirskis. “The cheesy smiles are long gone.” It’s about style and tone, he says, and as the industry matures it’s moving beyond lifestyle products like travel, beauty and fashion to finance, automotive –\u0026nbspeven dog food.“There are new influencers emerging every day, in every single vertical,” says Lujani. They’re marshalling themselves into communities: mummy bloggers, healthy eaters, sports fans – why, possibly even news organisations.\u0026nbspWith the maturation of the influencer world comes a shakeout: Influencer 2.0, if you will. Sheer numbers don’t matter so much anymore.\u0026nbspThe smart talk is now about engagement and micro-influencers,\u0026nbspthose with fewer than 100,000 followers and possibly as low as 5,000, but with proper peer recognition.\u0026nbspYouTuber Alfie Deyes came under fire for his recent video, ‘How I lived off £1 for a day’ (YouTubePointlessBlogVlogs)“Data shows that influence by measure of engagement actually increases as the audience size reduces,” says Svirskis. In a hedge-betting strategy, brands now prefer to work with 50 micro-influencers rather than one mega-influencer, and brands are taking influencer management in-house as influencer marketing moves into the mainstream.If children are obese then blame food manufacturers, not ZoellaInvestigation promised into Trump campaign data firmThree arrested after Facebook group raid cannabis field – only to Sexist men who abuse women on Facebook and Twitter are compensating“Most new industries go through periods of turbulence as they form foundations,” says Svirskis, who thinks that many of today’s influencers will become tomorrow’s creative directors and entrepreneurs.He has a point. Beauty influencer Emily Weiss now has a cosmetic company, Glossier, and within the last couple of weeks M\u0026ampC Saatchi bought a stake in two influencer agencies.

Conditions are such that detainees suffer mental health problems which sometimes lead to\u0026nbspsuicide attempts, according to the charity.Thousands of innocent asylum seekers –\u0026nbspoften fleeing war and torture – are detained each year and\u0026nbsplocked up indefinitely\u0026nbspwith no support, the charity warned.In the first intervention of its kind by a major charity, the Red Cross calls for significant reforms including a 28-day limit on detention. It found cases of asylum-seekers being detained for as long as two years and seven months.Home Office separating scores of children from parentsHome Office makes almost £100m profit from children\u0027s citizenship feesHome Office separating scores of children from parentsFive of the 26 detainees interviewed\u0026nbspfor the report had attempted suicide while they were detained, and\u0026nbspjust 25\u0026nbspof them\u0026nbspsaid they had been given no access to mental health\u0026nbspsupport services.Pregnant women continue to be “needlessly detained” in breach of the Home Office’s own guidance –\u0026nbspwith 47 pregnant women detained in the year to June 2017.The charity said the\u0026nbsp“overly onerous and traumatic” experience of attending immigration reporting centres\u0026nbsp– which many are required to do every every two weeks – should be overhauled by banning the practice of detaining people when they turn up.Mike Adamson, chief executive of the British Red Cross, said: “Most of the people in the UK asylum process have fled conflict or persecution to find a place of safety. They have already experienced more trauma and anguish than the rest of us could possibly imagine.“The threat of detention without notice hangs over many people going through the asylum process in the UK.\u0026nbspOur research shows that not knowing whether this week will be the week they are detained again, can make the process of having to report regularly extremely distressing.“This can exacerbate existing mental health issues and mean people never truly feel free.”Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said the Red Cross report was a “damning indictment” of how the government treats migrants and refugees.“We know from the Windrush scandal that people are wrongly detained,” she said.\u0026nbsp“Some suffer indefinite detention without legal representation. The government needs to introduce some humanity into the immigration system,” she said.Figures obtained by the Red Cross through freedom of information requests show that of 14,733 asylum seekers who left detention in 2016, nearly half (42 per cent) had been detained for between 29 days and six months, with 10 per cent held for more than four months.The charity recommends that the Home Office allows people to live in their communities while their immigration cases are resolved by replacing the systems of detention and reporting with end-to-end, community-based alternatives.The Home Office told The Independent it had noted the recommendations from the report and was also carefully considering the contents of the Stephen Shaw review into the needs of vulnerable detainees, which is set to be published this month.The warnings come amid mounting criticism of the UK’s immigration detention system, which currently holds around 26,500 people each year and around 2,500 at any given time. Britain is the only EU country without a statutory time limit for the detention of migrants.Recent figures obtained by The Independent revealed at least one person a day needs medical treatment for self-harming in removal centres, while the prisons watchdog described conditions in the centres as “prison-like”.In May the Home Office came under fire\u0026nbspwhen it emerged that proven torture victims were also being detained.Inspectors from HMI Prisons joined growing calls for a time limit, warning of a “deep level of emotional distress” and rising number of suicides, and noting that 50 per cent of detainees were eventually “released back into the community”.UK news in picturesSerena Williams celebrates after winning against Camila Giorgi during their women\u0027s singles quarter-final match on the eighth day of Wimbledon.

It would be a huge economic problem for the UK and also for the EU. I’m not working for that deal, I’m working for a deal.”Brexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

The tie had explosive potential. England would face the host nation of a tournament boycotted by its own government. Russia would face the declared enemy the focus of four\u0026nbspmonths of relentless propaganda on state TV. It would have been an existential showdown.\u0026nbspTwo missed penalties later, Wednesday’s semi-final tie was turned on its head. Russians had a new dilemma: Croatia\u0026nbspor England?\u0026nbspThe choice is not as straightforward as it might seem. Yes, Britain is not\u0026nbspflavour of the month. But Russia’s relations with their fellow Slavs are far from simple.\u0026nbspTheir complexity was underlined with a leaked video showing Croatian defender Domagoj Vida performing a populist, pro-Ukrainian greeting. That video earned him a FIFA censure.\u0026nbsp“The Vida incident has changed things for many Russians,” says Anton Prokudin, 21, a customer at the hipster Pivbar bar on the Garden Ring Road in central Moscow. “He should have kept quiet.”\u0026nbspThe student says some of his friends have switched from supporting Croatia. He has decided to stick to Modric and Co – a “footballing” decision. The Croats are “better, more determined” than the English they performed wonders against Argentina.\u0026nbspProkudin, on the right, with friends (Oliver CarrollThe Independent)Others in the bar said they would support England. Tensions were for politicians and the media, said Sergei Petrov, 32. He was a fan of all things English – the music, the football, the humour. “Sport should be outside of politics,” agrees his wife, Maria Petrova, 28.\u0026nbspEngland\u0027s route to the World Cup semi-finals16 England\u0027s route to the World Cup semi-finalsHere we take a look at the route that has taken Gareth Southgate\u0027s side to the last four.A Harry Kane double got England off to a winning start, although they needed an injury-time winner from the Tottenham front man. A strong start from England was rewarded by Kane\u0027s close-range finish from a corner after only 11 minutes, but Kyle Walker\u0027s handball gifted Ferjani Sassi the chance to equalise from the spot before half-time. England probed without success for the second 45 minutes until, a minute into added-time, Kane\u0027s far post header following another corner sealed victory.Southgate\u0027s side turned on the style against the ill-disciplined minnows, who were 5-0 down by half-time. Panama could not live with England\u0027s strength at set-pieces, which led to John Stones heading the opener and Kane adding number two with a penalty. Jesse Lingard curled in the best of the bunch for number three before another Stones header and another Kane penalty put England in dreamland. Kane completed his hat-trick with a deflection he knew nothing about before Felipe Baloy\u0027s late consolation.Both sides fielded second-string sides, having already qualified for the knockout stages and in the knowledge that finishing second in the group was likely to offer a more favourable route to the final.

They then recovered from conceding a last-gasp equaliser to Yerry Mina, and from Jordan Henderson missing first in the shootout, to win their first knockout game at a major tournament in 12 years.Southgate\u0027s side turned in their best performance of the tournament to see off a team who had kept three clean sheets in four games and contributed to Germany\u0027s early elimination. Harry Maguire\u0027s thumping first-half header got England up and running, with Dele Alli nodding home the second, but Pickford was again the star of the show with a couple of quite brilliant saves.16 England\u0027s route to the World Cup semi-finalsHere we take a look at the route that has taken Gareth Southgate\u0027s side to the last four.A Harry Kane double got England off to a winning start, although they needed an injury-time winner from the Tottenham front man.

A man in a tight black and brown laminated shirt answers only one question – “Croatia” – before returning to drink vodka with his friend.\u0026nbspOthers refused to give their full names.\u0026nbsp“The English are all clowns,” says “Alexander”, 63, a former submariner, who is drinking vodka and beer chasers with fellow military man Vladimir Afanasiev, 66.\u0026nbsp“And don’t get me going on Boris Johnson,” he says. “You won’t like it.”\u0026nbspHis friend Mr Afanasiev said England had never done Russia any favours: “You couldn’t call England a prostitute, that would be impolite. But they do go with whoever they want.” \u0026nbspBoth men would be supporting Croatia at Luzhniki stadium on Wednesday, they said. There was no contest.\u0026nbspThe Croats “may have been Nazis in the Second World War”, says Alexander, but they will always be “closer to the Russian spirit” than the English.From the moment Russia lost on penalties, nationalistic commentators have zoomed in on the Croatian Second World War stance. Some have even drawn a direct line from that to Vida’s pro-Ukrainian video.\u0026nbspBut it is another military campaign – the Yugoslavian wars of the 1990s – that will likely have a larger effect on Russian allegiances on Wednesday.\u0026nbspRussia’s ultras fostered close links with their Serbian counterparts during those years – and a corresponding animosity towards the Croats. T-shirts proclaiming “Kosovo je Srbija” are popular among the Russian ultras crowd. The Serbian question is one of few that unites the movement.\u0026nbsp“Eighty eight\u0026nbspper cent of Russians will be for England,” declares “Mikhail”, a barman at a central Moscow bar associated with footballs’ ultras. “No one is bothered about Skripal, Johnson or politics.

Frontex runs an operation off the coast of Italy that works closely with the local coast guard.The EU missions have helped rescue thousands of refugees\u0026nbspat sea, all of whom were disembarked in Italy. Spokespeople at Frontex and Sophia did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Italy has so far refused to take back any migrants stopped at the German border.“Before receiving even one asylum seeker from another European country, we want to see a precise commitment – giving the timetable, costs, means, men and resources –\u0026nbspon how the EU plans to help us defend our external borders,” Mr Salvini said last week.Aid groups and United Nations’ agencies on Friday asked Italy open its ports to rescue ships because the policy could have a high human cost. More migrants could die at sea, or they could be trapped indefinitely in inhumane detention centres, they said.On Sunday, Mr Salvini said the previous government had agreed to welcome migrants rescued by ships participating in the EU sea missions.Mr Salvini said: “With our government, the music has changed and will change”.This comes after a rescue boat carrying 60 refugees arrived in Barcelona last week after being turned away by Italy and Malta.The mayor of Barcelona, Ada Colau, came to the ship’s rescue when she, with permission from the Spanish government, told the crew of the vessel that it could dock.\u0026nbspThe boat, which was said to have had five women, a nine-year-old and four teenagers on board, was turned away by Mr Salvini.He said the rescue boat “can forget about arriving in an Italian port” and then suggested the boat should dock in Malta which he claimed was the nearest port.Additional reporting by ReutersEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

May in crisis: Ben Bradley and Maria Caulfield QUIT over Brexit                 Rees-Mogg shares \u0027ENCOURAGING NEWS\u0027 that will see Brexit throughHe added: \u0026ldquoThis should have been done many months ago, but it will give a lot of reassurance to British businesses.\u0026ldquoGiven the challenges that the Chequers proposal faces \u0026ndash particularly in respect of freedom of movement of labour \u0026ndash a \u0027no deal\u0027 outcome is very possible and it is important that we should be prepared.Mrs May\u0027s reshuffled Cabinet put on a show of unity today following the resignations of Boris Johnson and David Davis earlier this week.The two leading Eurosceptics quit, accusing the Prime Minister of making too many concessions to Brussels in her plan approved by a special Cabinet meeting at Chequers last week.The Prime Minister gathered her cabinet together ahead of a crunch Brexit showdown at her country retreat at Chequers in Buckinghamshire                    PA1 of 14Members of the cabinet and government officials gather at ChequersMr Rees-Mogg, who is the leader of the influential pro-Brexit European Research Group of Tory MPs, said: If the Government plans to get the Chequers deal through on the back of Labour Party votes, that would be the most isive thing you could do.And it would be a split coming from the top, not from the members of the Conservative Party across the country.Earlier, Justice Secretary David Gauke risked angering Tory Eurosceptics by signalling that further concessions to Brussels could be on the way in the talks.In a BBC interview, he said: What I would say to those of my colleagues, if there are some, who think this is pain-free and this is just something that we can ride over very easily, is no deal will have a negative impact on our constituents, on the British public.Theresa May has warned that Britain must be prepared to leave the EU WITHOUT a formal dealAnd shockwaves following the Cabinet resignations continued to be felt around Westminster today.Mrs May was hit by two more resignations from her team when MPs Maria Caulfield and Ben Bradley both quit their roles as vice-chairmen of the Conservative Party.Ms Caulfield, who was appointed to her post in January to reach out to women voters, wrote to Mrs May: I cannot support the direction of travel in the Brexit negotiations which, in my view, do not fully embrace the opportunities that Brexit can provide.The policy may assuage vested interests, but the voters will find out and their representatives will be found out. This policy will be bad for our country and bad for the party.The direct consequences of that will be Prime Minister Corbyn.Dominic Raab has replaced David Davis as Brexit secretaryMr Bradley, who was vice chairman with responsibility for reaching out to younger Tories after last year becoming the first Tory MP for Mansfield since the seat was created in 1858, wrote to the PM that he understood the challenges she faced in delivering Brexit.However I have come to the conclusion that I cannot in good faith be a spokesman for the party or for Government on this issue, and I cannot with any sincerity defend this course to my electorate, 71 per cent of whom voted to leave the European Union.Tory MP Andrew Bridgen has openly called for Mrs May to stand down, saying her Brexit plan was a betrayal of the 2016 EU referendum vote.In a letter to the 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers calling for a party leadership contest, he wrote: \u0026ldquoThe negotiations with the European Union appear to have deteriorated into a state of complete capitulation.Angela Merkel has said Germany wants to have \u0027as close a relationship with Britain as possible\u0027 \u0026ldquoWe have to deliver Brexit or we will be punished at the polls at the next General Election.\u0026ldquoAll we have asked from the Prime Minister is that she sticks to what she has promised on repeated occasions when she declared that \u0026lsquoBrexit means Brexit\u0026rsquo and pledged to take back control of our money borders and laws.\u0026ldquoBut it now appears those promises are all a pretence and a charade intended to dupe the electorate which is an insult to their intelligence.\u0026ldquoTherefore, in the interests of our country and the future of the Conservative Party, I feel the time has come for a new leader as so I am writing this letter to inform you I have no confidence in the Prime Minister.Mrs May has insisted her new Brexit plan absolutely keeps faith with the vote of the British people.Speaking alongside German Chancellor Angela Merkel at a joint news conference during a London summit, the Prime Minister said: We will bring an end to free movement, an end to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in the UK and an end to sending vast sums of money every year to the European Union.We will come out of competitions policy, we will come out of the Common Agricultural Policy.But we will do this in a way which will be a smooth and orderly Brexit that protects jobs, protects livelihoods and also meets our commitment to no hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.Mrs Merkel said: The British Prime Minister as in Berlin last week so obviously we discussed Brexit.I can only say on behalf of all the people of Germany that even after Britain has left the EU we want to have as close a relationship with Britain as possible, which I think is true for the other EU member states.What we want to do now is bring the negotiating process forward, Britain will table a white paper and we have actually made progress.The German Chancellor said the 27 nations remaining in the EU will soon table a common response to the UK proposal.We as a 27 will table a common response. That is a good thing, where we have proposals on the table, she said.We are looking forward to discussions, and they will be discussions inspired by the spirit of friendship and inspired by the wish to continue the relationship in the future."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/139/590x/Theresa-May-986999.jpg","title":"Brexit news Theresa May EU reject Brexit proposal customs arrangement Chequers summit","story":"The Prime Minister broke the deadlock within her Cabinet and resolved the Government\u0026rsquos policy in regards to trade and the UK\u0026rsquos post-Brexit customs arrangement with the EU.Mrs May has proposed a UK-EU free trade area which would establish a common rulebook for industrial goods and agricultural products.However, she has signalled that different arrangements would be made for services, which make up around 80 percent of the UK economy, where the Government is seeking a greater degree of flexibility.Speaking exclusively to\u0026nbspExpress, independent MEP Nathan Gill commented on the proposals, saying: \u0026ldquoIf we present a sector by sector draft trading arrangement it then befalls the EU to reject it as \u0026lsquocherry picking\u0026rsquo.\u0026ldquoThis would visibly expose them as an obstinate business-blocking entity.\u0026bullPATheresa May has proposed a UK-EU free trade area which would establish a common rulebook for goods                John Cleese is \u0027SO DISAPPOINTED\u0027 with Brexit and UK he is MOVING to...

Mass deportations of illegal immigrants? Jawohl!And don’t mention the #RefugeesWelcome hashtag.What a change of heart. Merkel’s solution to the refugee crisis of 2015 was to dismantle Germany’s borders.No elected politician in modern history has ever acted with such monumental, breath-taking arrogance.Merkel’s grandiose virtue signalling unleashed mass, mostly economic migration that continues to this day.More than a million refugees poured into Germany in 2015 alone. They were almost exclusively young men because the old, the sick and children — the most vulnerable refugees and those most deserving of a helping hand — can’t walk the length of the Balkans.Anyone who had doubts about promoting limitless uncontrolled migration was silenced by Merkel’s smug catchphrase, “Wir schaffen das!” — We can do this!But Germany, and Europe, will pay the price for Angela Merkel’s apocalyptic arrogance long after she is pushing up edelweiss.Merkel’s career is on its knees because she permanently changed Germany without ever consulting the German people to see if her policy of the unmanaged migration of one million-plus young males from a totally different culture was actually WHAT THEY WANTED.Merkel never even thought about the wishes of the German people. We hear a lot about the rise of “populism” everywhere from Trump’s America to the new, vehemently anti-EU coalition government in Italy.But there is no great mystery about the rise of anti- establishment sentiment. For decades haughty politicians have viewed their own people with unbridled, undisguised, unapologetic contempt.Now, all over the Western world, they are paying the price.Theresa May should carefully study the fall of Angela Merkel. Whatever the polls might say, few would weep to see May departing Downing Street.It seems increasingly likely, from what we’re hearing out of Chequers, that this prime minister would far prefer to cuddle up to the crumbling EU empire rather than break free and strike trade deals with the US, Australia, Canada, India and China.But if we can’t trade with the world then it is not a soft Brexit. It is no bloody Brexit at all.Her job is not to soften our departure from the EU to such a degree that it becomes meaningless.Whatever her personal preferences, Theresa May’s job, and the historic role that falls to her now, is to honour the referendum of 2016, the vote we were solemnly promised was final by our former prime minister, David Cameron.It is not complicated. Don’t do a Merkel.Theresa May has to respect democracy and the will of the British people.And if she doesn’t or she can’t, if May betrays the British people, if she castrates or buggers up Brexit, if she tells 17.4million that they are ignorant racist bigots who should never have had a vote in the first place, then we are going to need a new prime minister.In Merkel’s spectacular fall from power there is a lesson for every leader in the Western world, especially Theresa May.You are not our master. You are our servant. You do not know best. And you ignore the will of your people at your peril.THIS World Cup has been a revelation. Who knew we would still be working up a sweat long after Germany, Argentina, Brazil and Spain had flown home?Who knew that England could win a penalty shoot-out in a World Cup? Then cruise through a quarter-final?And who knew England could only ever really succeed again – and true success means having a team that we love and take pride in – if we returned to having English managers? All jaw-dropping stuff.Now Alicia Aylies – former Miss France and the girlfriend of France’s fleet-footed Kylian Mbappe – proudly poses in a zippy bralet.Seriously, who had ever heard of the zippy bralet until Russia 2018?

The men’s singles final will overlap with the World Cup Final.But quite frankly, who cares?This year we are lukewarm on Wimbledon.So you had to feel for British wildcard Katie Boulter, knocked out in the second round.There is still plenty of time for Henman Hill or Murray Mound to become Boulter’s Bulge or Katie’s Cusp.LONDON Mayor Sadiq Khan is allowing a Donald Trump blimp to float above London during the President’s visit to the UK.No news yet on if Khan has plans to do anything about the gun, knife and acid epidemic on the streets of London.With well over 1,000 stabbings this year, more than fifty of them fatal, crime in London is out of control.But at least we have that Trump balloon, Sadiq.DIEGO MARADONA was pictured grinning happily in an XXL Colombia shirt before their match with England but was apoplectic in defeat.“You have to denounce this,” fumed Maradona.“As the captain of legends, I have to tell Infantino (Fifa President) this cannot be left like this.“This is a fatal mistake for the whole country.”I’m sure it all sounds much better in translation.But you get the gist – “Our headbutting boys were robbed”.Fifa hands Maradona a reported £7,000 to turn up at every match and the fat man issued a grovelling apology for criticising the ref when he reflected that seven grand might possibly slip through his cheating hands.But you can hardly blame Diego Maradona for sticking up for those grappling, nasty, spiteful, penalty-spot-scuffing Colombians.After all, Diego has done his best to single-handedly prop up one of Colombia’s major exports. And that’s nothing to sniff at.YOUNG mum Claire Morrison, 28, was mortified when her six-year-old daughter Eve took her vibrator to school for show-and-tell because Eve thought it was a particularly interesting looking pen.Some parents might prefer to keep quiet about this mishap, but Claire has gone on Facebook to tell the “hilarious” story.“She just said it was her funny pink pen,” chuckles Claire, a hairdresser from Dundee. “Then she said, ‘It must talk because it needs batteries’. So her stepdad and I laughed that off and we have safely stored it away.”It has now been shared 6,000 times.The story. Not the vibrator. Obviously. That wouldn’t be very hygienic.WE can all understand why David and Victoria Beckham would want to put on a public display of loving solidarity on their wedding anniversary.But I can’t help wondering, does Victoria really need to tell David “I love you so much” via her Instagram account and its 21.3million followers? It seems so extravagantly public.Couldn’t she just give him a card?AFTER careful consideration, MEPs in the European Parliament have voted to keep their £3,900-a-month taxpayer-funded (and tax-free) expenses a secret.Blow me down. Nobody saw that one coming.The generous expenses, known as the general expenditure allowance, or GEA, are paid as a lump sum into the MEPs salary, with no records kept, no receipts required and no questions asked. MEPs can spend it all on prostitutes and Ferrero Rocher chocolates if they want.Nobody cares.The GEA costs around £35million a year.And our corrupt continental cousins wonder why we’re leaving.DAVID Cameron received £800,000 to write his memoirs, which have been unexpectedly delayed until next year.Cameron should tell us why he made it legally binding for this country to spend £13billion a year on foreign aid, why he bombed Libya into the failed state it is today and how he blew £9million of public money on his pro-EU leaflet.

And we will decide where our armed forces and foreign aid could be used alongside the EU.Brexit has never been about turning our backs on Europe, pulling down the shutters and keeping ourselves to ourselves.Since well before the EU existed we have traded with and fought alongside allies around the world, and that won’t end when we leave next March.There’s still a lot of negotiating to be done.

threat to their existence is a highway which cuts straight through their ancestral home, according to charity Survival International.The road brings tourists to the territory who are accused of treating the Jarawa like animals in a safari park.Meanwhile poachers are believed to enter the rich forests of the reclusive islands and hunt the game the tribe needs to survive.This is one of the many reasons the Jarawa are hostile towards outsiders, having lived in harmony with the land for so many generations.The nomadic tribespeople are master hunters who trap pigs, lizards and turtles with a specially made Jarawa bow.Being an island-dwelling tribe, food sources in the ocean are vital to their survival and men often catch fish in the shallows.They are also understood to love fruit and honey, extracting it from hives by using special plant extracts to calm the bees.They are said to have detailed knowledge of more than 150 plant and 350 animal species on the island.The Jarawa also have reputations as as warriors and uncompromising defenders of their territory.They lived through both British colonisation in the 19th century and then Japanese occupation later on.In 1998, a few Jarawa started to emerge from their forest for the first time without their bows and arrows to visit other settlements.But in 1990 local authorities revealed a long-term master plan to settle them in two villages with an economy based on fishery.The plan went as far as to suggest what style of clothes the Jarawa should now wear.Forced settlement had been fatal for other tribes in the Andaman Islands, according to Survival International.Following a passionate campaign by Survival and other Indian organisations, the resettlement plan was abandoned in the early

But in practice, how does that work given that most sexual encounters are one-on-one with no witnesses?She can still say yes at the time then later pretend she didn’t and falsely accuse him of rape.And equally, he could pretend she had consented when, in fact, she had screamed no.Perhaps we are moving to an era when all young people will feel compelled to temporarily stall a moment of passion so they can film the consenting “yes” on their mobile phones? Or failing that, perhaps have a solicitor present.ACTRESS Paula Williamson wed “Britain’s most violent prisoner” Charles Bronson last November and said she looked forward to him getting out so they could enjoy a normal marriage.Yet just two months later he allegedly attacked the deputy governor of HMP Wakefield and now, just before appearing via video link at Leeds magistrates court, he tried to take his guards hostage in his cell.Hmmmm. Something tells me that – after spending 42 years inside – 65-year-old Charlie boy has become institutionalised and doesn’t actually want to come out, hence the litany of violent episodes that keep him in trouble and constantly embarrass his trusting wife.It gives a whole new meaning to the term blushing bride.NEW research shows that the ability to ward off fear and unhappiness is a skill that improves markedly with age.An American neuroscientist says the reaction of the old and the young to, say, the imminent results of an election were significantly different.That’s because, when you’ve seen a few governments come and go, we of a certain age eventually realise they’re all as useless as each other and whatever we say or do to try to change that has no effect at all.But if it turns out to be a France v England final, I may be heading home sooner than expected.FORMER Radio 1 DJ “Diddy” David Hamilton has weighed in to the #MeToo debate with his recollection of his Seventies heyday, saying: “We didn’t go around forcing ourselves on women.“It sounds conceited to say it but we didn’t have to because a lot of women were forcing themselves on us.”Meanwhile, Kinks frontman Sir Ray Davies reveals: “A world-famous groupie once threw me out because I was too kind.”A reminder, if needed, that not all men are b******s and not all women are innocent victims.And if further proof is required, look no further than some of the predatory females stalking their male prey on Love Island each night.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It wasn’t obvious that it was going to happen for me. And I wasn’t willing or excited about the idea of getting married or having a family in the absence of that.

which was presented to her by the Air Cadets when she took on patronage in 2015.She also wore a coat by Alexander McQueen, and a hat by Sean Barrett, with Meghan choosing to wear a dress by Dior and a hat by royal milliner Stephen Jones.And in keeping with the traditional blue of the RAF, the Queen wore a royal blue silk coat with a turquoise collar and dress in the same colour, both by Angela Kelly, with a matching hat and a diamond star brooch.The head of the RAF Air Chief Marshal Sir Stephen Hillier said: It is a tremendous coming together of a whole range of RAF capabilities, and a celebration of the quality of our people, and it is that connection between the Royal Air Force and her Majesty the Queen.Later the royals gathered on the balcony of Buckingham Palace to watch a vast array of more than 100 RAF aircraft roar and thunder across the skies of London.In their biggest ever formation, 22 Typhoon jets spelt out the number 100 in the sky - an added surprise for the royals, personnel and the throngs of public spectators who had packed out the streets to watch.The Queen spoke proudly not only as the RAFs Air Commodore-in-Chief, but also as a citizen who remembered the Battle of Britain, and as a daughter whose father King George VI served with the RAF.She said: Presenting the Royal Air Force with a new Queens Colour provides an opportunity to congratulate the service for your remarkable contribution to defence over the last 100 years.KATE Middleton has today worn a spectacular brooch - but it isnt just a fashion accessory.Instead, the large brooch signifies a huge honour, usually bestowed only on Air Cadets themselves.The brooch is said to be the highest honour that a female cadet can achieve.The Duchess of Cambridge had been gifted the beautiful diamond and ruby piece as a gift from the RAF when she became an Honorary Air Commandant in 2015.Tenacity, skill and gallantry have been your hallmarks as you helped safeguard freedom and security in many parts of the world.I remember the Battle of Britain being fought over the skies above us and we shall never forget the courage and sacrifice of that time.She also took the Royal Salute at the ceremony as her relatives watched nearby.It was 100 years ago on April 1 1918 that the Royal Flying Corps and the Royal Naval Air Service merged to create the RAF -

It’s about celebrities improving their image.”Oh, but what record-breaking names they’d assembled.Robbie, Adele, Elton, Ed Sheeran, Coldplay and Stormzy, were just a few of those who didn’t attend.Blue, Coleen Nolan, Amber Davies, from last year’s Love Island, UB40, Kimberley Walsh and Tony Hadley, on the other hand, were all involved, as was JLS’s Aston Merrygold, right, who said, on behalf of the NHS, he was: “Happy to clear my diary.”So we thank him and whoever covered the shift at Domino’s.Job demarcation, though, among the celebs, was a bit vague. A few just seemed to have backing track duties, like Kimberley Walsh who was given the line “What would you do if I sang out of tune?” (IF?)Some were enrolled for the full, record-breaking, Abbey Road finale, while others went on recruitment drives at UK hospitals, where Tony unearthed “the singing ambulanceman”, and Sara set her sights on Debbie “who’s pouring custard on a spotted Dick” — in the staff canteen, rather than the Infectious Diseases Unit.Eulogies to the great NHS god, though, were compulsory and delivered with a glassy-eyed, lip-quivering intensity that has become a very familiar sight these past few months.Good intentions, as we know, though, pave the road to hell. And so it proved with Wednesday’s Big Singalong Live, which kicked off with a parp of a klaxon, from Ashley, and Sara screaming: “Can we now please break that record.”Perhaps we can put what followed down to the swirling p***storm, in North London, or the lack of practice time — they only had six weeks — but, dear Lord in heaven — Russell Crowe didn’t unleash this much hell in Gladiator.Missed cues, frozen screens, flat voices, Tony Hadley giving it the big ’un, on the Abbey Road zebra crossing, with his “woh-oh ohhhs”.Seven thousand drunk Millwall fans chanting: “You’re going home in a London ambulance” could not have been much less unco-ordinated, but would undoubtedly have delivered an equally powerful message about the NHS.Salvation, though, was on hand in the form of Sara Cox.“The results are in and . . . (drum roll).“We almost made it, but it looks like the weather may have rained on our parade. We didn’t break the record.” A MASTERCLASS in scheduling, editing and continuity, from Channel 5, on Thursday night, that began with the very chirpy announcement: “We’ll find out What Happened to Josef Fritzl after brand new Nando’s, A PERi PERi Big Success . . . ”Which isn’t the first thing I associate Josef with, to be perfectly honest with you. Though, who knows.The old sod may have loved their Spicy Mixed Olives with a Wing Roulette.Unappetising start or not, I wasn’t going to switch off A PERi PERi Big Success until it had truly unlocked the secret of this much-loved high street dining phenom- enon.Two minutes and 30 seconds into the documentary, bingo.

He’d go every single day and I’d trot in straight after him.”“Nando’s empire now stretches from Inverness to Plymouth.” All those clueless ITV presenters desperately trying to clamber aboard the football bandwagon, like Amanda Holden, who kicked off last Friday’s This Morning announcing: “We’re all excited about tomorrow’s World Cup final between England and Sweden.”On the strength of which, I’ve booked a once-in-a-lifetime, cheap-as-you-like caving holiday in Thailand.Column returns some time before Qatar 2022FINALLY, some awards for those fine men and women who really have gone above and beyond the call of pundit and commentating duty during this unforgettable World Cup.STICKING HIS NECK OUT AWARD – Lee Dixon: “France are always French.”HISTORIAN OF THE TOURNAMENT – Ally McCoist: “And of course, the October revolution in Russia took place here in 1977.”KING OF LOGIC – Gary Neville: “By avoiding bigger teams, you avoid them.”GLASS HALF EMPTY TROPHY – Sam Matter- face: “Didier Deschamps has lost this game even though he’s won it.”MATHEMATICIAN OF THE TOURNAMENT – Jurgen Klinsmann: “If nine out of ten are called correct, you won’t worry about the other one or two.”RUNNER-UP – Fabian Delph: “A birth only happens once in a lifetime.

Ya got me, Sacha. Feel better now?I join a long list of American public personalities who have fallen victim to the evil, exploitive, sick humor of the British comedian Sacha Baron Cohen, enabled and sponsored by CBS/Showtime.Showtime is an American entertainment company owned by CBS and behind Who Is America?Palin, 54, claims she received a request to take part in a legit historical documentary.She said she was asked to travel across the US with one of her daughters, who she did not name, to speak to a disabled US veteran.Palin wrote: Out of respect for what I was led to believe would be a thoughtful discussion with someone who had served in uniform, I sat through a long interview full of Hollywoodisms disrespect and sarcasm.But she said she finally had enough and literally, physically removed my mic and walked out, much to Cohens chagrin.The politician added: The disrespect of our US military and middle-class Americans via Cohens foreign commentaries under the guise of interview questions was perverse.Palin then asked Cohen, CBS and Showtime to donate all proceeds from the programme to a charity that that actually respects and supports American Vets.She added: Mock politicians and innocent public personalities all you want, if that lets you sleep at night, but HOW DARE YOU mock those who have fought and served our country.Truly sick.Palin hit the headlines in 2008 when Republican presidential nominee John McCain chose her as his running mate.A teaser for Who Is America? features former US vice president Dick Cheney signing a waterboard kit.Cohen is no stranger to controversy, sparking outrage in 2009 when he appeared in his guise as gay Austrian fashion designer Bruno on a chat show claiming to have adopted an African baby which wore a T-shirt that said “Gayby”.He pretended to spill the ashes of Kim Jong-Il on the 2012 Oscar’s red carpet.And in 2003, as Ali G he interviewed Donald Trump and pitched a drip-free ice cream glove to him.The first episode of Who Is America? will air on Channel 4 at 10pm on Monday July 16."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/06/2048x1152/skynews-theresa-may-prime-minister_4335252.jpg?20180618123003 ","title":"a reckoning postponed not extinguished where theresa may goes from here","story":"In some ways, she got lucky.As one senior Conservative (no friend of Mrs May\u0027s) told me last night: \"Boris got it wrong - again.

If she can keep her head down \u0027til then, she\u0027s safe til October.\"Her survival and unexpectedly plucky performance in the House has even led to some excited bien-pensant chatter that the resignations have left her stronger than before.The argument goes that Mr Johnson and Mr Davis were destined to resign, that their departure from the cabinet means she is now surrounded by allies, not enemies. She is liberated.She may feel relief at not having to duck and weave to please the mansplaining Mr Davis and Mr Johnson every other Thursday from now on.But medium term, it seems to me undeniable that the resignations of Mr Johnson and Mr Davis have weakened Mrs May for one very important reason.

All they\u0027ll think now, whatever we put forward, is that it\u0027s a sellout.\"His despair is well founded: Mr Johnson in particular, one of the only political figures the public recognise, with his warnings of \"semi-Brexit\" and colonial status, seems to have gone out of his way to stoke the furnaces of Brexit apostasy.Those furnaces now burn brightly within the Conservative Party too.As Jacob Rees-Mogg told me shortly after Mr Davis resigned: \"It raises the most serious questions about the prime minister\u0027s ideas. If the Brexit secretary cannot support them, then they cannot be very good proposals.\"Fellow Brexiteer Philip Davies told the PM that her scheme represented \"a Remainer coup\".Mr Johnson and Mr Davis were appointed to their jobs because they gave Theresa May - the Remainer prime minister - Brexiteer credentials. Now they\u0027ve taken those spurs away, in spectacular fashion. It was just about conceivable that had Mrs May been able to keep Mr Johnson and certainly Mr Davis in her cabinet, she might have attracted the lion\u0027s share of Brexiteer support for her proposals if and when they come to the House of Commons in the form of a deal.But now, with her ideas damned as heresy, if the Chequers ideas aren\u0027t substantially altered (and it seems from the PM\u0027s statement in the House that they won\u0027t be) it is hard to see how or why the hardline Brexiteers can or will vote for them - and Mr Davis and Mr Johnson will lead the charge in opposition.Brexit nirvana, they will say, can be achieved if we vote them down - and thereby secure the hard Brexit we crave.If the PM had succeeded last June in winning a decent majority, this would be less of a problem.That - despite her protestations to the contrary - was the election\u0027s aim, to give her the space she needed to make the compromises she knew would necessary.These internal party contortions inexorably flow from her failure to secure it. With no majority at all every Brexiteer vote, even the votes of the three ministers who resigned, will be pivotal.It is not obvious, without her Brexiteer MPs supporting Chequers, how she can guide a deal through parliament.And if she can\u0027t, what exactly is the point of Mrs May? It is why she tried so hard to keep them on side. Without them there is only one option left for the prime minister, one remaining route through.When the final vote comes, she must attract Labour votes.If negotiations drag on to the last possible weeks, perhaps even into 2019, the PM could make a credible pitch to pro-Remain Labour MPs: vote for this, or we crash out with no deal at all. There is no time for an election. It\u0027s this, or bust. Country before party.She will therefore, in effect, be asking Labour to solve the Brexit riddle on her behalf.A tacit acceptance that the Conservative Party, with its deep, gorge-like fissures, cannot resolve the issue.That will put Remainer Labour MPs in an invidious position. The tantalising chance to defeat the government, to remove a sitting prime minister, will be theirs for the taking - but at the cost of plunging the country into profound crisis. In those circumstances, even if Jeremy Corbyn tried to whip his MPs to vote against the deal, he might find it difficult to stop some of his most pro-European colleagues traipsing into the government lobby - especially if, the cost of their votes is a continued softening of Brexit.Some of them, after all, represent some of the most Remain constituencies in the country - how will they explain to their constituents that they enabled the hardest Brexit possible?Mr Corbyn might even get in on the act, seizing the opportunity to in effect control the Brexit process and sell himself to the country as a statesman.And putting country before party might not be an entirely magnanimous act for Labour.Getting the softest of Brexits through on Labour votes would be a devastating blow for Mrs May and the Tory Party more generally. She would become the Ramsay MacDonald of the Conservative Party.The Brexiteers would probably split and form a separate grouping in parliament.The Tory Party - which has throughout its history been better at absorbing splinter groups than making them - would be more fractured and divided than at any time since the Corn Laws. This is a danger to which Brexiteers are alive. They are alarmed at reports that the government has been briefing Labour MPs about their Brexit proposals.Mr Rees-Mogg warned the PM of the dangers of that strategy: \"It is a matter of grave concern. It would prompt a split, but a split from the top.\"In this scenario Mrs May would probably be finished as PM.But I wonder if she has concluded, that her premiership, once Brexit is complete, is over anyway.I am struck by the language she used yesterday at the 1922 Committee, talking of doing \"the right thing for the country\".She may be preparing, psychologically and politically, for the ultimate compromise ahead. She might have concluded that in the end, the plaudits she is seeking are not from her party, but from history."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/07/2048x1152/skynews-the-week-magazine_4359016.jpg?20180711112929 ","title":"cash rich daily mail owner tables bid for the week magazine","story":"DMGT is facing competition for Dennis\u0027s assets from a number of private equity firms, including Equistone, HIG and Inflexion.Some of the bidders have lodged offers for the entire business, while others have identified specific titles that they want to buy."},{"url":null,"title":"its coming home big ben","story":"NewsIt\u0027s coming home - to Big Ben!

Now even Big Ben has got into the spirit - with its world-famous clock tower to display the George Cross for the first time in almost a century. Parliamentary officials revealed the new design today as part of a \u0026pound61million refurbishment of the 1859 landmark. They insist the timing is just a coincidence, but it comes hours before the Three Lions\u0027 tie against Croatia. The six shields above each dial of the clock face have since the 1930s had a cross in black and gold, rather than the red and white of the England emblem. But as part of the refurbishment they will be restored to a red cross on a white background.  Commons officials insisted the other nations of the UK are represented because there are thistles, shamrocks and leeks also in the design. Adam Watrobski, Parliament’s Principal Architect said he was restoring the original colour scheme after studying paint samples, contemporary illustrations and photos. The dials and clock hands are Prussian blue and gold and the adjacent areas make use of the red, white and blue colours of the Union flag, he said. He added the intention was to restore the wishes of Charles Barry, the architect of the 19th Century Palace of Westminster.

Naz Shah was one of four MPs promoted in a mini-reshuffle by Jeremy Corbyn last night as she became Shadow Equalities Minister.  The Bradford West MP was was stripped of the whip and barred from party activity for three months in 2016 during an investigation into a 2014 Facebook post.   She later rejoined the party after issuing a grovelling apology for sharing the post, which suggested Israel could move to America with the words: “problem solved”.  Another post on her page featured a plea for friends to support an online poll because the Jews are rallying.  At the time Ms Shah quit as an aide to John McDonnell, stepped aside from a Home Affairs Select Committee probe into anti-Semitism and later made public apologies at a synagogue and in the House of Commons.  But she was not initially suspended and the decision was only taken after then-Prime Minister David Cameron blasted the extraordinary bid to keep her in at Prime Minister\u0027s Questions.  Ms Shah later admitted she was ignorant about discrimination against Jews and won the support of a key body, the Board of Deputies of British Jews. President Jonathan Arkush said in January 2017: Naz Shah is one of the only people involved in Labour’s antisemitism crisis who has sought to make amends for her actions.

MPs fell into hysterics as Jeremy Corbyn\u0027s stand-in branded the Tory civil war Reservoir Dogs remade by the Chuckle Brothers at a fiesty PMQs .  I may know very little about football, said the Shadow Foreign Secretary - who was once embroiled in a row for sneering at an England flag. But even I can see that England\u0027s progress so far in the World Cup shows what can be achieved when all the individual players work effectively as a team, when there\u0027s a clear game plan and when they\u0027re all working together and of course when everyone respects and listens to the manager. What lessons could the England team teach this shambles of a government?  Theresa May\u0027s deputy David Lidington prompted laughter at Prime Minister\u0027s Questions too - by insisting there was a “clear plan” with “full support of the squad”.  He called on Labour to show its own plan for Brexit , which he claimed was the “best kept secret” in British politics.  But quoting the US President, Ms Thornberry said: Even Donald Trump can see they’re in turmoil - and he hasn’t even got to Britain yet.  PMQs was a rare battle of the deputies after Theresa May travelled to the NATO summit in Brussels.  She was replaced by her deputy David Lidington , leading Shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry to take Jeremy Corbyn\u0027s place for Labour.  The pair clashed after Tory Brexiteers vowed guerrilla warfare and co-ordinated resignations to derail Theresa May\u0027s new, softer plan for Brexit.  Theresa May agreed the plan at Chequers on Friday, prompting the resignation of Cabinet big beasts Boris Johnson and David Davis. Brexiteers say the plan to share EU rules on imported goods will run up the white flag and keep Britain chained to Brussels. But Labour Remainers currently oppose the plan too because they say that by not including services as well as goods, it doesn\u0027t go far enough.

The Tories are trapped in a Brexit turmoil, with Mrs May forced to make big changes to her cabinet team. Former health secretary Jeremy Hunt replaced Boris Johnson as he\u0027s promoted to foreign secretary. The move has led to senior Tory Eurosceptics to accuse Mrs May of being a Remainer Government, as four main offices of state - PM, chancellor, home secretary and foreign secretary - are now all held by MPs who campaigned to remain in the EU referendum. However, Hunt has said he\u0027s converted to Brexit. Mat Hancock replaces Hunt as health secretary, while Dominic Raab takes on the role as Brexit Secretary from David Davis. Another Remainer takes on the role as culture secretary. So who now holds a position in the Prime Minister’s top team?  Here’s your guide to who’s in and who\u0027s out in Theresa May’s cabinet after the reshuffle.  Theresa May - Prime Minister  Hammond remained chancellor of the exchequer after the June General Election despite rumours that he’d be sacked.  He was formerly foreign secretary in David Cameron ’s cabinet from 2014 to 2016, and before that served as defence secretary and transport secretary.   He was a Remain supporter in the EU referendum . He’s seen as a voice for a softer Brexit than that of his Leave colleagues.  Jeremy Hunt - Foreign Secretary  The controversial former Health Secretary survived last year’s reshuffle - despite presiding over the longest and most drawn-out industrial dispute in the history of the health service. It was thought he could be axed in 2016 when Mrs May first became PM, but he survived and continued to run the Department of Health. After Boris Johnson resigned as foreign secretary, Hunt was promoted to the position. It brings an end to his long stint in health - a job he took under Cameron in the 2012 reshuffle. He was previously culture secretary. It’s thought he resisted an attempt by May to move him to another role in January 2018 when she added the responsibility of social care to his portfolio. Sajid Javid - Home Secretary  The first home secretary from an ethnic minority background Javid has held a few roles.  He landed the job as Communities and Local Government Secretary after Amber Rudd ’s resignation. He has also been Business Secretary.  He was also Culture Secretary and Financial Secretary to the Treasury under David Cameron. He is the son of a bus driver from Rochdale, Lancashire, and became an investment banker before going into politics - he became an MP in 2010. He stood on a joint ticket with Stephen Crabb in the 2016 leadership contest. Javid had hoped to be chancellor if Mr Crabb had become PM. Dominic Raab - Brexit Secretary  Lawyer Mr Raab has long been waiting in the wings for a cabinet role. The Leave supporter is a former chief of staff to David Davis - who he now replaces as Brexit Secretary - and Dominic Grieve. He’s worked on the Brexit legal details behind the scenes and apparently is ok with the idea of a “no deal” situation. He has previously held the post of housing minister, one of the junior ministerial posts he’s had since becoming MP in 2010. Mr Raab has previously said immigration drives up house prices and in June he called for the UK to have more “economic self-confidence in talks with Brussels.  One of Mrs May’s allies, Mr Williamson was the former chief whip. He was promoted to defence secretary in November 2017, which annoyed some Tories who felt he wasn’t experienced enough for the role. He took over from Michael Fallon, who resigned after his past conduct was called into question. Mr Williamson is MP for South Staffordshire and was elected in 2010. He also used to be an aide to David Cameron. Matthew Hancock - Health and Social care secretary  Mr Hancock was promoted to health secretary after David Davis and Boris Johnson resigned over Brexit policy. He had only been in the role of culture secretary for a few months before the move to replace Jeremy Hunt who has become foreign secretary. Mr Hancock is a former Bank of England economist and was close to former chancellor George Osborne under David Cameron. He became MP for West Suffolk in 2010. David Gauke - Justice Secretary  Mr Gauke is the sixth justice secretary in six years as well as the first solicitor to take on the post. He was promoted in the January 2018 reshuffle. The four people in the post before Mr Gauke were all non-legally qualified MPs, despite the justice secretary being the government’s chief law officer. Mr Gauke has been the work and pensions secretary and chief secretary to the Treasury. He became MP for Hertfordshire South West in 2005. Damian Hinds - Education Secretary  Mr Hinds was brought in to replace Justine Greening, who refused to move to the Department for Work and Pensions in the January 2018 reshuffle. The MP is a former management consultant and served as the employment minister in the Department for Work and Pensions and as a junior Treasury minister. He’s also been a government whip and is a Remain supporter. He was elected as MP for East Hampshire in 2010. Liam Fox - International Trade Secretary  Brexit supporter Liam Fox became the International Trade Secretary - a new department - when Theresa May became PM. He has the job of trying to set up post-Brexit trade deals. Mr Fox was Cameron’s defence secretary, before he resigned in 2011. It was alleged he had given a friend - and lobbyist - Adam Werrity access to his department and allowed him on his trips abroad. Mr Fox, a former GP, did stand in the 2016 leadership race against May but was kicked out after the first ballot with just 16 MPs backing him. He’s MP for North Somerset. Greg Clark - Business Secretary  Mr Clark has been business secretary since July 2016. He formerly looked after communities and local government for a year. In January it was thought he’d be moved in the reshuffle to make way for Jeremy Hunt, but Hunt fought to stay in Health. The former business consultant was a Remainer. Mr Clark started as president of the Liberal Democrat student branch at Cambridge. He’s MP for Tunbridge Wells. Michael Gove - Environment Secretary  Mr Gove was brought back in June 2017 as environment secretary. He had been sacked as justice secretary in 2016 in the reshuffle. Mr Gove had previously served as education secretary in Cameron’s cabinet and chief whip in the coalition. Cameron and Gove were long-term friends until Mr Gove joined the Leave campaign in 2016. Things got more complicated when - after initially backing Boris and Brexit - he withdrew his support for Boris as leader midway through the contest, and stood himself. He was eliminated in the final round and came third. Chris Grayling - Transport Secretary  Mr Grayling has been in the cabinet since 2012 - he was first Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice, then Commons leader. He was made transport secretary in 2016. He stood with the Leave campaign. In the January reshuffle he avoided being moved or sacked despite facing criticism over train fares, disrupted services and franchise problems. The former BBC and Channel 4 TV producer became MP for Epsom and Ewell in Surrey in 2001. James Brokenshire - Housing \u0026amp Communities  Mr Brokenshire returned to the cabinet in the reshuffle after Amber Rudd’s resignation. Formerly Northern Ireland secretary he stepped down due to ill health - he was diagnosed with the early stages of lung cancer. He was back a month later and is “recovering strongly” after surgery. The former lawyer served under Theresa May for five years in the Home Office and is a close ally. Mr Brokenshire is MP for Old Bexley \u0026amp Sidcup and has been since 2010. He was elected as MP in Hornchurch in 2005, but the boundary changes meant his constituency was no more. Baroness Evans - Leader of Lords  The Baroness was given the role in 2016, it was her first ministerial role since being ennobled in 2014. Baroness Evans was formerly deputy director of the Conservative research department and deputy director of the Policy Exchange think-tank. She was also chief operating officer of the New Schools Network, the organisation headed by journalist Toby Young, which runs the free schools programme. David Mundell - Scottish Secretary  Mr Mundell is was one of the 13 Scottish Conservatives elected in June 2017. He was first appointed by David Cameron as Scottish Secretary in 2015, when he held his seat for Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale. In January 2015 he became the first openly-gay Conservative Cabinet minister. Alun Cairns - Welsh Secretary  Mr Cairns retained his cabinet post in the January reshuffle. The former banker was born in Swansea. He became an MP in 2010. He worked in the private sector before joining the first cohort of AMs in the 1990s, switching to Westminster at the start of this decade. He became a junior minister in the Wales Office in July 2014, under the Tory/Lib Dem coalition - and kept his job after the Conservatives won again. Karen Bradley - Northern Ireland Secretary  Formerly working under Mrs May in the Home Office, Karen Bradley took on the role of culture secretary in the Prime Minister’s first cabinet. Her decision to refer Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox takeover bid for Sky to the media and competition regulators dominated her time as culture secretary. She took over from Mr Brokenshire as Northern Ireland Secretary when he resigned due to ill health in January. She was first elected in 2010 as MP for Staffordshire Moorlands. Penny Mordaunt - International Development Secretary  Replacing Priti Patel, Penny Mordaunt took on the role as International Development Secretary in November 2016. Ms Patel resigned when it emerged she had held unofficial meetings with senior Israeli figures. Ms Mordaunt was formerly minister of state for disabled people at the Department of Work and Pensions. She was also minister for armed forces under Cameron and was once tipped to replace Fallon as defence secretary. She was elected as MP for Portsmouth North in 2010 and is a Brexit supporter. Jeremy Wright - Digital, Culture, Media and Sports Secretary  Mr Wright was promoted from the role as attorney general after Matt Hancock was made health secretary this July after Boris Johnson and David Davis quit over Brexit Policy. A former barrister specialising in criminal law he has served in the whips office for the Conservatives from 2007 to 2012. He then became a justice minister in 2012 and attorney general in 2014. He became an MP in 2005 for Kenilworth and Southam in Warwickshire.  Esther McVey - Work \u0026amp Pensions Secretary   A former GMTV presenter Esther McVey was the one to watch under Cameron. She won her Wirral West seat in 2010. She then lost the seat to Labour in 2015, returning in 2017 in former Chancellor George Osborne’s Tatton seat. She became deputy chief whip in the reshuffle after Sir Michael Fallon resigned. Two months later she given a role in cabinet - in the same department she had worked for as a junior minister.  David Lidington - Minister for Cabinet Office   Formerly Commons Leader, Mr Lidington replaced Damian Green, who resigned in 2017 after misconduct allegations. Mr Lidington did not take on the First Secretary of State title, but will take on same of the role, standing in for Mrs May at Prime Minister’s Questions and chairing the cabinet Brexit committees. Mr Lidington, who is a Remain supporter, is also a former justice secretary and Europe minister. Formerly working for BP and mining firm Rio Tinto, he became an MP for Aylesbury in 1992.

Rachel Beaufoy, was preparing to dance the night away after marrying love of her life, Paul. The couple had said their vows at the Sandy Cove Hotel in Devon before disaster struck and her gown burst into flames. After lighting sparklers with family and friends outside the venue, Rachel, 33, was heading back inside to carry on the celebrations. But as she stopped to chat to a friend, the mother of two smelled burning coming from close by. And as she turned around to locate the smell, the blushing bride discovered the bottom of her dress was on fire and her legs felt as if they were burning. Rachel, a resourcer for a utility company, said: I immediately started screaming and panicking. My dress was fully on fire, and I had my little girl in my arms, and I didn\u0027t know what to do.   Bride and groom\u0027s big moment takes strange turn as England score World Cup goal at the worst possible time  We tried to put it out by wafting it but it just made it worse. I thought I was going to lose my legs. Close friend, Carl, offered to pour his pint of lager over Rachel but the traumatised bride managed to extinguish the blaze herself before it spread any further. Rachel, who is mother to Megan, five and Jack, three, married her fianc\u0026eacute Paul, 36, at The Sandy Cove Hotel in Devon in September last year. The couple, who have been together 15 years, began planning their big day in 2015, after the birth of their second child, Jack. After getting hitched on a cliff top overlooking the ocean, Rachel, and new husband Paul, a builder, celebrated with their guests. Everything went swimmingly but at 9:30pm they realised they\u0027d forgotten to light the sparklers, something they\u0027d been planning into their wedding for months.   World Cup-loving bride watches England football match while making her marriage vows  Rachel said: We\u0027d had our first dance and were having loads of fun with our friends and family but we realised we\u0027d forgotten about the sparklers. We headed outside to light them all and made some fun shapes in the dark and once they were all out we went back inside to carry on dancing. As I was making my way back in, I stopped to have a chat with my friend. I noticed she had a little burn mark on her dress and she said one of the sparklers had managed to catch it. It was really strange because as soon as I mentioned this I began to smell burning. I had no idea where it was coming from at first and then I began to feel my legs getting hot. It felt like they were burning and when I turned around the bottom of my dress was on fire! Rachel, who was carrying her little girl, Megan, began to scream and panic. She recalls: My mum came out and was screaming Paul was panicking, he had Jack in his arms and Jack was crying it was just awful.   Bride and groom fear no one will show up to wedding - because of England clash  I was wearing a corset dress so I was never going to be able to take it off before the flames spread. My friend was about to pour a pint over me, and mum was saying we should roll me down the hill to put the flames out. Luckily, due to some quick thinking, Rachel and her friends were able to extinguish the fire by frantically patting it down, but her dress was ruined. Rachel said: I was shaking and could barely walk by the time we managed to put it out. My legs felt like they were on fire, and my mum was left so traumatised that she had to go to bed. I really thought I was going to lose my legs, but luckily and by some kind of miracle, they didn\u0027t have a mark on them. Paul was completely distraught and didn\u0027t understand how it could\u0027ve happened.

We missed Harry Maguire’s opening goal, but we made it back in time to see Dele Alli head us into tomorrow night’s semi-final in Moscow.  The boys were so happy I thought they would burst. They were screaming, jumping on the sofas and hugging each other so much anyone would have thought they were in the winning team. What made the moment so poignant for me was the fact that Joshua’s friends are all from such diverse backgrounds – Ghana, India, Ireland, Spain, Portugal, England –and they were all united behind the national team. I was surprised to get WhatsApp messages from family in America telling me they are backing England all the way. And later that evening driving past an England fan waving a huge St George’s Flag in South London, my aunty insisted on rolling down the car window and shouting, “Come on, England” in her loudest Accra accent and beeping my car horn. “Yeah!” he screamed back.   This talented England team under manager Gareth Southgate have brought the country together in a way I’ve never seen before.  It made me think back to when I was my son’s age. Would I, aged 12, in the late 1980s ever have sat down with my friends to cheer on the England football team? No I wouldn’t.  Growing up in South London, I feared English football fans and the English flag they brandished so menacingly. The St George’s Cross was hijacked by extreme nationalist groups such as the BNP and National Front which used it as their emblem.  For me, my family and friends it signified that, to many people in this country, we weren’t welcome. My memory of English fans then was as drunken, rampaging yobs who felt it was acceptable to hurl vile racist abuse at their own players.  John Barnes has spoken about the abuse he faced on the pitch. The former England player, who had a banana thrown at him during a 1988 FA Cup tie at Everton, said: “Any black player of my generation had it. In 1984 with England in Brazil, I had it with the National Front. There wasn’t a game in the Eighties when you didn’t get racial abuse as a black player.”  "},{"url":null,"title":"ex rugby league star facing","story":"NewsEx-rugby league star facing jail after knocking child, 15, unconscious for \u0027bullying his son\u0027Vila Matautia, 48, reportedly threatened the boy by saying: \"If I find you\u0027ve done anything again I will cut you.\"\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByNeil Docking06:19, 11 JUL 2018NewsFormer Rugby player Vila Matautia outside Liverpool Crown Court.

Vila Matautia, 48, is believed to have launched the vicious attack after accusing the teen of bullying his young son, the Liverpool Echo reports.  The ex-Samoa international is a former St. Helen\u0027s prop who enjoyed a glittering career at the top of the sport - winning numerous titles during the 1990s and 2000s. Yesterday, Matautia admitted a sustained attack on a 15-year-old victim at Liverpool Crown Court. Matautia claimed he battered the child, who cannot be named for legal reasons, because he had been bullying his son.  Before he pleaded guilty to assault causing actual bodily harm, his barrister, Tom Watson, requested a Goodyear indication from Judge Steven Everett. This is an indication of the likely maximum sentence an offender will receive if they plead guilty - a legal deal that can prevent a trial from taking place. In response, Judge Everett asked prosecutors to outline the incident, which happened at around 4.35pm, on December 4 last year. Simon Duncan, prosecuting, said the victim was stood with friends behind the Golden Lion pub in Church Road in Rainford. He received a Snapchat message, purportedly from Matautia\u0027s son\u0027s account, asking where he was, but did not respond. Matautia walked down the side of the pub towards him and the boy, who did not know who Matautia was, asked are you alright? Mr Duncan said: The defendant didn\u0027t reply and just walked up to him and punched him in the face with his right hand. The punch knocked him, he said, unconscious at that point, however, he regained consciousness to some degree and was aware that the defendant had continued to punch him around five times. The boy said Matautia stood over him and said you\u0027re a bully and when he asked what he had done, replied: If I find you\u0027ve done anything again I will cut you.

And according to a study, 42% of us have also slept with bedroom windows wide open during the last two weeks. The study was carried out by a British mattress brand, in a bid to discover more about the UK’s sleeping habits during this unusual stretch of warm tempreatures. The poll found that most people have switched their duvet for something lighter for a more comfortable night’s rest and one in five have slept apart from their partner at least once to try and stay cool.  www.Ergoflex asked a total of 2,133 about their sleep patterns since the June 25 when the heatwave really began. The overwhelming majority, 88%, of the people taking part in the survey said that they had lost sleep due to the heatwave. And when asked to estimate how much they had lost since the start of June, the average answer was revealed to be 45 minutes per night, per person 10 hours and 30 minutes in total. More than two fifths of the respondents taking part in the poll confessed that they had slept with their bedroom windows wide open for the majority of nights over the past two weeks, posing a risk to home security. Steve Willis from www.Ergoflex said: “As much as we all love the fact that we’re actually getting a proper summer for a change, there’s no hiding the fact that this country just isn’t cut out for lasting hot weather and it’s clear that our sleep suffers badly as a result.

Stunned inspectors discovered the animals living in horrendous conditions at the property in Lincolnshire.  In one disgusting case, a pig that had eaten a bucket of rat poison was found dead, reports Lincolnshire Live .  And the terrible treatment of animals there only came to light after some pigs escaped. Now the case has been prosecuted in court and images of what inspectors discovered there have been revealed.  At Peterborough Magistrates’ Court, it was heard that an officer at the RSPCA was increasingly concerned after visiting Maxine Cammock’s home in Bourne in October 2017. After returning some pigs that had escaped, RSPCA inspector Kate Burris was left horrified by the condition some of the animals were living in – many of whom were dead. She said: “I went to Cammock’s home in October last year after a call from a police officer who had been involved in rounding up a number of escaped pigs and returning them to her. “The officer was extremely concerned by what he had seen, and rang us.  “It is a large property with several buildings on site. There were the remains of dead animals everywhere, most in such a state of decomposition it was impossible to establish how they had died. “Several collie type dogs were in a shocking state in filthy pens in one of the buildings. Two of the dogs were dead, one in a pen with two other dogs, Julie and Martin. “A pig who had eaten a bucket of rat poison was dead in another of the buildings. Cammock realised what the pig had done and, rather than seek vet treatment, locked him inside.”  Only twenty-five animals were found alive and were immediately removed. However, a month later even more animals were found in distress including chickens who had been packed into plastic containers with the lids weighted down. A total of 55 eggs had been hatched and the chicks were seen living in cardboard boxes and containers. Cammock, 54, was taken to court where she pleaded guilty to five offences contrary to the Animal Welfare Act 2006 relating to a total of nine dogs, a pig, ten chickens and 55 chicks. Two offences contrary to the Animal By Products (Enforcement) England Regulations 2013 were dropped.

He was moaning about Britain\u0027s racially diverse society before stating the England football team \u0027doesn\u0027t represent him\u0027. He told the Daily Mirror\u0027s Associate Editor Kevin Maguire, who was hosting the talk show, In fact, it represents everything I\u0027m against.  Shockingly the man said: When you are talking about the subject of race, it goes a lot deeper than skin colour.

And after Ian replied yes, Kevin added: What, because you\u0027re so obsessed by race and your bigotry, and your prejudice is so poisonous you want England to lose? I just hate seeing my country destroyed by multiracialism and anything that represents multiracialism, Ian replied.  Kevin gave Ian some advice before ending the conversation. I\u0027d just go and make yourself a nice cup of tea, take it into a darkened room, get a bag of frozen peas from the freezer and put them on your head, and just reflect on what you\u0027re saying.

And also very nice to know he didn’t bore you senseless. “My father was telling us just last week how much he had enjoyed his recent visit and said that each of his visits over the years holds a special place in his memory. “My grandmother the Queen also spoke of her own visit in 2011 and the fantastic welcome that she too received.  “Standing here with you on this beautiful evening, it is easy to see why Ireland has such a special place in the hearts of my family and indeed all those who come here. “We are so pleased to be here for our first official international visit together as a married couple and we hope it will be the first of many. “As each other’s closest neighbours, the UK and Ireland’s relationship is unique. Our shared history is long and complex. “There have of course been challenging, and at times, tragic periods of that relationship. “Tomorrow we hope to have the opportunity to reflect on some of those difficult passages in our history when we visit Croke Park and the famine memorial. “On this visit we will also celebrate just how much unites us. This is a very special relationship between two proud sovereign countries.  “We share common values, culture, business links, family ties and possibly a similar sense of humour. “Our relationship is of course informed by our history but it is also one which is now dynamic and forward-looking. “This evening, we are extremely fortunate to be joined by many of those who are shaping future of Ireland. You embody the energy which characterises this amazing country. “I have the greatest confidence the friendship, collaboration and mutual understanding that our two countries have built up over the years will endure and it will grow. “I will finish by drawing on the words of President Higgins during his extraordinarily successful visit to the UK in 2014 for which we still remember with admiration. He quoted the traditional Irish saying ‘We live in each other’s shadows. We shield each other and rely on each other for shelter.’ "},{"url":null,"title":"mum reveals how maternal instinct","story":"NewsMum reveals how maternal instinct led to her saving her newborn baby from deadly sepsisAlthough Mirror writer Amanda Killelea admits she had never heard of the life-threatening infection, something inside her told her that baby daughter Lola needed urgent help\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByAmanda Killelea22:39, 10 JUL 2018Updated02:15, 11 JUL 2018NewsMum Amanda Killelea with lucky Lola at five months and Gracie (Image: Amanda Killelea)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet soaps updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailCoronation Street viewers were left in shock when little Jack Webster had to have his foot amputated after contracting sepsis from a grazed knee. Like distraught dad Kevin Webster, I too had never heard of the deadly disease until my daughter Lola developed the condition at just two days old, and our world was turned upside down. I’d had the perfect pregnancy and everything seemed to be going to plan, including going into labour on my due date. The hospital I was supposed to have her at was full, so in a no-room-at-the-inn-style drama, my midwife had to ring round to find a hospital that could take us. We made it to the delivery suite at Fairfield General Hospital in Bury, Greater Manchester with only 30 minutes to spare before Lola arrived into the world – a perfectly healthy 7lb 1oz bundle of joy. But two days later, I knew there was something terribly wrong with my baby.  She was burning up and yelped in pain like a little cat when I picked her up. Worried, I asked one of the doctors to look at her, but he tried to reassure me saying I had probably just over-wrapped her and she had colic. But, as a second-time mum, I knew instinctively he was wrong. My one-year-old, Gracie (now 13) had suffered from colic, and this was different. Lola wasn’t too hot because I had her wrapped up – she definitely had a temperature.  So, when a junior doctor popped into our room, I told her my fears and demanded a second opinion. Thank God I did. She got a more senior doctor to take a look and he immediately ordered a lumbar puncture. I remember asking him if he thought my baby had meningitis , and the horror when he said yes. It was like someone had stabbed me in the heart. They scooped my baby from my arms and took her away for the painful procedure to see what was making her ill. At that age, babies are too young for pain relief. Instead, a nurse drip-fed her sugar water to distract her as a doctor drew fluid from her spinal column to test for infection.  I was alone on the maternity ward, desperately trying to phone my husband while listening to other mums coo over their healthy babies. It was the longest hour of my life. Lola was admitted to the special care baby unit, where doctors pumped her tiny veins with antibiotics and antiviral drugs to fight the infection, while they desperately tried to pinpoint what it was. Some of the drugs were so strong I had to sign consent forms and was warned that they may leave her with permanent hearing problems. But I didn’t care – I wanted them to do whatever it took to save my baby’s life. Test after test came back negative – the doctors couldn’t find out what was making Lola so sick. So they just continued with the drugs, as I spent every waking hour at her bedside. As the veins in her tiny hands gave up, they started using the veins in her feet. When they had used all those, they then wanted to use the veins in her head. I refused, and sat for hours holding the tiny cannula into her foot to deliver the last scraps of antibiotic. When they wanted to put another needle into her stomach to take a urine sample, I held her over a tiny potty for hours until she passed water. I didn’t want my baby to have any more needles put into her unless it was really necessary. Our priest came to the hospital to bless Lola. He offered to christen her there and then in case she didn’t make it but we declined, refusing to believe that our baby would die.

The Duke of Sussex didn\u0027t seem to mind that he was offending the heir to the throne as he spoke in front of dozens gathered at Glencairn. Prince Charles recently visited Cork and this week Harry and wife Meghan have embarked on their first official overseas royal engagement as a married couple. They will spend two days following a packed itinerary exploring Ireland\u0027s capital. And the pair could not stop smiling as they stepped out hand-in-hand for the evening occasion.   Meghan wore a stunning black sleeveless dress by New Zealand designer Emilia Wickstead, her third outfit of the day. She also swapped her chic bun up-do for loose curls.  She opted for black stiletto pump heels by Aquazzura Deneuve which retail for $750. And to finish the look she held a Givenchy black satin clutch. Before Harry began his speech, the couple sipped on champagne. He started by saying how grateful they were for the warm welcome they had received in Ireland and gushed about his family\u0027s love of the country. As well as throwing in a few jokes, the one that got onlookers laughing the most was about Harry\u0027s father, Charles.

Ace O’Driscoll said: “I asked him ‘so, is football coming home?’ “But he refused to say it. “I think he just said he isn’t as confident as everyone else about England winning tomorrow. “He said he won’t say it because he doesn’t want to jinx it.”   Cheeky Harry also made a dig at the Prince of Wales as he stood on stage with Meghan by his side, while thanking the audience for attending.   Paying tribute to the British Ambassador in Ireland, Robin Barnett, Harry said: “As some as you may know he showed my father around his home city of Cork a couple of weeks ago. “So we are very grateful for you joining us here his evening as well. “And also very nice to know that he didn’t bore you senseless.

He thanked the newlyweds for making the trip to Ireland as their first official overseas trip, adding: “We thank you. Perhaps there is romance in our summer air.”  The trip is the latest in a series of foreign visits the royal family have made to EU member states in the wake of Brexit , as part of a “charm offensive” to renew relationships with countries as Britain prepares for Brexit.   Glencairn House is the official residence of the British Ambassador to Ireland and has been the home to successive ambassadors since the 1950s.

Passenger Emma Fitzpatrick says Mark Boon, Operations Director of parent company Govia, told passengers to stay out of the empty cart on a late and very packed service. He is then said to have spread out in comfort - placing his bag on the empty seat beside him - while customers had to squeeze into the rammed doorway and adjoining carriage. The image has sparked outrage on social media among Southern Rail passengers who have endured months of delays amid strikes by staff. Hair stylist Emma, from Croydon, South London, claims Mr Boon was even handing his business card out to passengers as he turned them away.

Ellie Campbell, a first year psychology student, was with a group of friends from her halls of residence on Friday January 26, an inquest heard.  The Canterbury Christ Church University students visited a number of bars, including a Wetherspoon pub and The Jolly Sailor before moving onto Club Chemistry. An inquest into the teenager’s death held at Archbishop’s Palace yesterday heard how Ellie went outside the nightclub at around 1.30am on January 27 and told her friend she wanted to leave, reports KentLive . The 18-year-old, originally from Basildon in Essex, then returned to her accommodation at St George’s Centre at around 2am.  Det Sgt Nicky Holland-Day said: “She said she was not feeling very well and was going back to the halls. “She had drank a mojito pitcher and four double vodkas through the night. She was described as sobering up but a bit down. “Ellie had her friend’s phone in her bag. They tried to call her but couldn’t hear if the call connected because of the noise in the club. “The girls would normally go home together so this was unusual.” DS Holland-Day explained how Ellie had greeted one of the security guards at the halls with a hug instead of her “usual fist bump” but they noticed “nothing to alert them”. Ellie’s friend arrived back at the halls at around 2.30am and knocked on her fourth floor room door to retrieve her phone but there was no answer and it was locked. The friend fetched security and they gained access to the room where Ellie was found hanging in the shower room. Eight paramedics rushed to the scene to help Ellie before she was taken to the William Harvey Hospital in Ashford in a critical condition. Sadly, a CT scan later revealed that her brain activity was “incompatible with life” and the heartbreaking decision to remove her support was made.

The inquest heard how Ellie had 296mg of alcohol in 100ml of blood – the legal drink-drive limit is 80 – but had no history of self-harm and no known mental health conditions. DS Holland-Day added: “There was no note and no indication she was considering suicide. Her mood had changed from a bubbly one to a sombre one. “But I am unable to determine why this popular young girl would end her life. It’s devastating. “The case is unusual. She had made friends really easily, very good relationships. She normally felt able to discuss anything going on. “There was no indication to them that there were any issues to be concerned about.” Assistant coroner Katrina Hepburn recorded a conclusion of suicide and passed on her condolences to Ellie’s family and friends.

Talitha Beales, 19, started screaming hysterically one year ago today when she saw the infant - umbilical cord still attached - on the concrete floor of a bus shelter in Towyn, in north Wales. The mother of the baby never came forward despite repeated appeals by North Wales Police and Conwy county council, reports the Daily Post . The little girl was put into foster care and Talitha, who does not even know her name, thinks about her every day.  Talitha has revealed how much she’d love to know she is doing after admitting she and her family were told nothing about the child’s progress after she was rushed to hospital in a critical condition. The 19-year-old said: “After the baby was taken away in the ambulance, we never saw her again. “We were desperate for information about how she was doing. We just wanted to know she was OK. “My dad really wanted to go in and see her, even just to give her a teddy, but we weren’t allowed. “I’d love to know her first name and that she’s in a happy home. “I do think about her a lot. “I’m just glad we found her when we did because she came very close to dying.”  Talitha was being driven home to Stoke-on-Trent after spending time in North Wales with her dad, Daniel Braxton when she made the grim discovery. She said: “I remember every detail about the day like it was yesterday. “It’s something I will never forget. “As dad drove past the bus stop, I saw the baby covered in blood, it still had the umbilical cord attached and I thought it was dead. “I told my dad to stop the car, he thought it was a prank and carried on, but I started screaming my head off hysterically until he stopped and turned back. “I stayed in the car because I didn’t want to look. My dad was reluctant at first, he thought it was a doll or a sick joke until he realised it was a real baby. “She was cold and lifeless and my dad ran to get a dressing gown from the car to wrap around her after calling for help.  “The ambulance and police came and taped the area off. “We have always wondered about her ever since.” Speaking to the Daily Post at the time, Daniel said: “She (the baby) was a fair size, I’d say probably around the seven pound mark. “She was not tiny, but definitely newborn as she still had the umbilical cord on. “I gave her a few hard rubs on her chest to see if there was any life in her, and at that point she gave a big gasp and opened her eyes.” He added: “As I waited for the ambulance I was just cuddling her, telling her everything was going to be all right.

The Duchess of Sussex and husband Prince Harry are in Dublin for their first foreign trip as a married couple.  But just hours into their two-day visit they ran into a spot of bother.  Irish politician Catherine Noone posted on Facebook suggesting Meghan had agreed with the country\u0027s recent referendum result in favour of legalising abortion.  The senator said: A pleasure to meet Prince Harry and the Duchess of Sussex at the British Ambassador\u0027s Residence this evening. The Duchess and I had a chat about the recent referendum result - she watched with interest and was pleased to see the result.  The comments suggest that Meghan may have broken royal protocol by expressing political opinon. Since the 17th century, members of the British monarchy have been banned from doing just that, which includes voting. From an early age, former Suits star Meghan was politically active. Aged just 11 she successfully campaigned to have a washing detergent advert\u0027s sexist language changed. She also said in 2016 she would move to Canada if misogynistic Donald Trump was elected US president.    Senator Noone\u0027s comments were quickly removed and a later tweet simply read: A pleasure to meet Prince Harry \u0026amp the Duchess of Sussex at the British Ambassador\u0027s Residence this evening. Posting a screenshot of her first post, Luke Silke tweeted: The Queen will be cross! He added that Prince Harry is in for an almighty dressing down when they go home.  Daily Mirror royal correspondent Russell Myers tweeted: Astonishing candidness from @  senatornoone  The senator, who chaired the parliamentary committee on abortion, replied: I clarified - it was a very benign chat, she expressed no political opinion. She was interested and charming.

You play for the glory and to win things.“If you are asked, you would say you would love to leave a legacy and Gillie has certainly done that.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b434788ba270-719x564.jpg ","title":"a true legend dundee fc league winner pays tribute to exceptional dark blues and tottenham striker alan gilzean","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAn exceptional striker and a lovely man who was never changed by stardom.That’s how Dundee legend Alan Gilzean is described by fellow Dens Park great and championship winning team-mate Bob Seith.Gilzean died on Sunday at the age of 79, less than a month after it was revealed he was battling a brain tumour.It was a sad day for Seith, one of four surviving members of the Dark Blues greatest-ever side, but he was able to recall the many happy memories of his friend and colleague.“It’s sad news and my thoughts are with Alan’s family,” he said.“I was just thinking about him the other day and wondering how he was, so it’s sad to hear of his passing.”Recalling their time together, what Seith highlighted first was Gilzean’s superstar status on the park was matched by being a class act off it.“Alan was an exceptional striker for Dundee and Tottenham, but that never changed him. He was always the same nice lad.“I think that was one of the strengths of the Dundee team that won the championship – we were all good friends. There were no cliques in the dressing-room and none of us let our success go to our heads.“I remember when Alan was at Spurs and I was manager at Hearts, we played them in a friendly. He was a big star, but he was exactly the same as he was when we were at Dens.”“Gillie” scored a club record 169 goals in 190 appearances in dark blue and, after leaving for London in 1964, went on to earn similar legendary status at White Hart Lane, where he formed lethal striking partnerships with Jimmy Greaves and Martin Chivers. None of that came as a surprise to Seith, who rates him as one of the best ever.He said: “Alan was exceptional and a great header of the ball. His timing in the air was the thing and when he jumped he seemed to hang in the air. We knew that if we could get the ball to his head he would score goals.“At Dundee he had a fine partnership with Alan Cousin and he would have been the first to say Alan Cousin’s donkey work was responsible for him scoring as many goals as he did.“With Alan, though, it was not just about his heading, he had two very good feet as well. In fact, I was never sure whether he was left or right-footed.“He had the knack of being in the right place at the right time. He always seems to know where to be, that’s why he scored so many goals.”Former Dundee director and long-time friend, Dave Forbes, also paid tribute. Organiser of a number of events down the years to honour the 1961/62 team, he knew Gillie well.He said: “I knew he wasn’t well and I’m just glad it all seems to have been quite quick and he didn’t suffer for too long.”Particularly after spending 10 years in the limelight at Spurs, where he was dubbed the King of White Hart Lane, Gilzean was famous for valuing his privacy.For a long time after he retired, the native of Coupar Angus did not make many public appearances but, over the past decade or so, was a familiar figure at White Hart Lane on match days and made regular visits back to Dundee.“Gillie was a private man, but he was a gentleman.“I remember when we were organising Dundee’s centenary celebrations he was a big help,” added Forbes.“I am proud, honoured and privileged to have known him as a good friend.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b44846f6daa4-752x564.jpg ","title":"bbc radio 4 listening project broadcasts from dundee this week","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA radio project which is collecting stories from the public is being hosted by the city’s Verdant Works all this weekThe award-winning former jute mill at West Henderson’s Wynd, now a popular visitor attraction, is temporarily home to BBC Radio 4’s The Listening Project from 10am-5pm until Friday and local residents are being invited to stop off and make their own contributions.A mobile unit is parked at Verdant Works, where the public can share their stories on life, moments, memories and people – whatever they choose.By taking part they will also be creating history.

And he is eager to get going when the competitive games finally get under way this weekend away at Stirling Albion in the Betfred Cup.“It’s been good, I’m really enjoying it,” he added.“It’s a fantastic club, fantastic fanbase as well. Everyone has made me feel welcome, the boys are brilliant with me and the manager and staff are really good.“I’m enjoying it and just desperate to get back out on the park and get playing again.“The facility is brilliant, the hotel is nice, food and everything is good – it’s everything you want and it’s good to get the boys all together.“Being a new boy as well, it’s good to be able to get to know everybody that wee bit better and getting a better understanding with everybody, I’m really enjoying it.”Hamilton started Sunday’s game against Portimonense in Albufeira before being replaced halfway through by Elliott Parish with the score at 1-0.The final scoreline of 4-0 flattered the Portuguese side a little and Hamilton insists there was plenty of good work done to help their preparations for the coming campaign.“It wasn’t the result we wanted, it was disappointing in that way but it was good to get back on the park again.“It was difficult conditions, absolutely roasting, playing against a good side but I felt there were times we played well and are starting to look like a good team.“They were a good side, the effort from the boys was there, we lost a few bad goals but, other than that, the boys worked hard.“We’re all gearing up for Saturday.“It was good to get back playing two 45 minute halves, a full 90 minutes as well. It’s a game we’re looking forward to.”Former Hearts goalie Hamilton has a rival for the gloves at Dens Park, with last season’s No 1 Parish having done well in the Dundee goal following the departure of Scott Bain.The 28-year-old has already issued a challenge to his new pal Hamilton ahead of the campaign that he’ll have a battle on his hands.It’s not one the new man is likely to shirk away from, however.He added: “I don’t think there’s anywhere there isn’t a battle for the gloves but it’s a fight I’m really up for and I want to be playing.“I got a good run at Hearts, 60-odd games but I’m here now to further that and I’m desperate to get more games and make myself better.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee people baxter park picnic","story":"\t\t\t\t\tPlenty of people turned out for the Park Lives ‘Picnic in the Park’ event at Baxter Park in the sunshine on Thursday.The sun was shining was various activities which included a giant snakes and ladders board and face-painting.One woman getting in on the fun was Maryfield Community Officer – Constable Lydia Thatcher, pictured, who was spotted getting her face painted by some youngsters.The next Picnic in the Park event, Messy Play, event will take place on July 12 from midday to 2pm and is suitable for all ages.

Obviously, you miss the guys who were here before and have left but that’s just football, it’s a good change.“And I’ve really enjoyed my time here, bar the end of last season, so I’m delighted to still be here and part of things. Hopefully, I can have a good season.”While it’s still early days, Stanton believes there are signs United can make it third time lucky and win promotion this term.He’s been impressed by the quality of his new team-mates and with the way the side appears to be gelling.“At Brechin the other night we came together well and we moved the ball about pretty nicely considering it was the first game.“We are pretty fit and we’re feeling good. Everyone seems to be fitting in well and that was pleasing.“The manager’s brought in a lot of good players, so it’s exciting and we’re looking forward to the season starting.“It was a good start at Brechin and, hopefully, it will get better.”Today the Tangerines were in action in a closed-door friendly at their St Andrews training base and a week today sees the Betfred Cup kick off with a group tie against Arbroath at Tannadice.While the league is the priority, Stanton’s looking forward to that.“It’s only a few weeks until the league starts up and I’m really looking forward to it.“We’ve got the Betfred Cup starting next week and that’s good.

work for his coaching licence","story":"\t\t\t\t\tWinger Niall McGinn is only 30 and contracted ​to Aberdeen for another three years \u0026#8230 but he has spent the summer planning for his future after playing.While his Aberdeen team-mates enjoyed down-time in the post-season, McGinn was working hard on the training pitch and lecture room.The Northern Ireland international cut short his holidays to work towards a UEFA B licence in Belfast alongside a number of legendary football stars.At the Irish Football Association course, McGinn studied alongside Portuguese greats Ricardo Carvalho and Tiago Mendes.A Champions League winner with Porto, Carvalho went on to win three Premier League titles with Chelsea and the La Liga crown with Real Madrid.Capped 89 times the 40-year-old also won the 2016 Euro championships with Portugal.Now assistant manager at Spanish outfit Atletico Madrid, Mendes won league titles with Chelsea, Atletico and Lyon.The 37-year-old, capped 66 times, won the Europa League with Atletico and was a beaten finalist in two Champions League finals to Real Madrid in 2014 and 2016.McGinn reckons working alongside players of that calibre will not only help him after he eventually retires but make him a stronger force for Aberdeen.He said: “I have just started on my B licence.“To do it while still playing can help improve me as a player and then I can see what I want to do after that.“It is important that you start these things while you are still playing.“Once you finish then you are playing catch-up a bit so it is easier to do it now.”The B Licence course includes a residential week and three practical assessments.During the week-long stay there are two assessments with one on functional practice focusing either on defensive or attacking play.There is also a Principles of play assessment with the final one carried out within a 12-month period.Candidates are also required to submit 25 hours of session plans along with their coursework tasks.McGinn said: “It was great as there were some big-name players on the course like Carvalho and Tiago who is assistant at Atletico Madrid.“Joleon Lescott (two-time Premier League winner) was also there as well as a number of Northern Ireland internationals.“Every other day you had to go in and make a presentation in front of those lads.“When you are coaching alongside them it is a strange situation but also very enjoyable.“Coaching is so different to playing as you are out of your comfort zone.“It was a big learning curve because as a player you are not that used to giving out advice and explaining different situations.”Former Ajax, Borussia Dortmund and Everton attacker Steven Pienaar was also present.Pienaar has been capped 61 times and retired from professional football in March this year.On the course, McGinn was also joined by five Northern Ireland international team-mates who had been pivotal to reaching the knock-out stage of the Euro 2016 finals.Gareth McAuley, who along with McGinn shares the distinction of having netted in the famous 2-0 win over Ukraine at Euro 2016, was in attendance.They were joined by international team-mates Kyle Lafferty, Roy Carroll, Aaron Hughes and former Aberdeen striker Josh Magennis.“Being part of a successful Northern Ireland team and working under manager Michael O’Neill, and seeing the way he puts his ideas across, motivates you to go on and become a coach in later life,” said McGinn.“And maybe become a manager as well.“It had always been in the back of my mind to do it.“For me it was just about getting the opportunity and time to do it.“When you are a player and an international you have a relatively busy schedule.“In recent summers we had the Euro 2016 finals and the tour to South America.“It was great that six Northern Ireland internationals were on it together as we are a tight-knit group and could give each other support.”Not only was McGinn working for his UEFA B badge in Belfast, he also returned to Pittodrie a week early from the summer break to get ready for the season.He has been impressive in the pre-season friendliesMcGinn has also found inspiration closer to home with Aberdeen gaffer Derek McInnes, who he has worked under for five years.He said: “I have been learning under Derek McInnes as well as Michael O’Neill.“That can only benefit me in the long run.“As I continue to progress as a footballer and then go into coaching or management people like them will only benefit me.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"winger backs boss for rebuilding job","story":"\t\t\t\t\tWinger Niall McGinn is confident boss Derek McInnes will deliver quality signings to make the Dons stronger in the upcoming season.Aberdeen kick off the campaign with a Europa League clash against Burnley on July 26.McInnes has already secured three signings this summer and aims to deliver more new additions before the Battle of Britain with the Clarets.Northern Ireland cap McGinn said: “Every season the gaffer has always recruited well and taken in strong players, he has shown that every year. There is absolutely no reason why we cannot be even stronger again in the upcoming season.“The gaffer has already added to the squad this summer by taking in three new signings.“Those three are good additions to the squad and I am sure there will be another two or three before the season starts.”McInnes has already signed three midfielders with £200,000 outlaid to secure Chris Forrester, 25, from Peterborough United on a three-year contract until 2021.Republic of Ireland international Stephen Gleeson, 29, was secured on a free having left Ipswich Town at the end of last season.Capped four times, Gleeson signed a two-year deal at Pittodrie until summer 2020.The Dons were today set to discover the extent of a knee injury sustained by Gleeson in the recent 2-2 friendly draw at St Johnstone.Gleeson was set to undergo a scan on Monday but that was put back 24 hours to allow the swelling on the knee to subside.The Dons boss faces a sweat on the extent of Gleeson’s injury and whether he will be fit to face Burnley in the Euro opener.Teenage midfielder Lewis Ferguson arrived from Hamilton.The two clubs failed to agree a figure for training compensation for the 18-year-old.Aberdeen offered in excess of £100,000 but Hamilton are understood to value compensation for developing Ferguson through their youth academy scheme at around the £900,000 mark.The matter is set to go to SPFL arbitration with a date yet to be decided for the tribunal.Aberdeen are confident the figure will be closer to their valuation.McInnes aims to bring in a striker and a defender, ideally a full-back, before the UEFA signing deadline of Friday July 20 for the second qualifying round.However, there remains the provision to sign two “wildcards” beyond that deadline up until 24 hours before the first leg – which would be 7.45pm on Wednesday July 25.Aberdeen had a bid rejected for Doncaster Rovers striker John Marquis who has netted 41 goals in the previous two seasons.It is understood that bid was for £250,000 and McInnes has confirmed the offer that was rejected was the highest they were likely to go to and the Dons will now look at other options.McGinn said: “Under the manager we look to continually get stronger and keep improving.”The emergence of January signing Mikey Devlin during pre-season is essentially a summer signing. Centre-back Devlin signed in January but was still undergoing rehabilitation from a cruciate ligament injury.He is fully fit and has impressed in pre-season having made his debut six months after signing in the 1-0 defeat of Cobh Ramblers.“It is great to see Mikey back after 13 months out,” said McGinn.The pre-season and signing activity are geared towards that Euro opener against the Clarets.McGinn added: “We got a good draw in Europe and have plenty to look forward to in the upcoming weeks.“We aim to really kick on.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/07/20180421_101005-317x564.jpg ","title":"aberdeen woman to climb mount kilimanjaro to raise cash for animal charity","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAn Aberdeen woman is set to climb Mount Kilimanjaro to raise money for the Scottish SPCA.Kim Leil, whose family have rehomed a number of pets from rescue charities, will make the trip to Tanzania in December.She will then attempt to climb 5,895m (19,340 feet) to the top of the dormant volcano, which typically takes between five and nine days.And it\u0026#8217s not the first time the self-confessed animal lover has taken on a tough physical challenge to raise money for the charity.In the past Kim\u0026#8217s completed the Kilt Walk, the Forth Road Bridge 5K and abseiled down the Falkirk Wheel.Kim said: “Animals love unconditionally and I think growing up with that has really shaped who I am as a person.“My family has rehomed a number of dogs from rescue charities and the fact that they can still love and be loyal despite being mistreated just amazes me so I really wanted to do something to give back and help animals in Scotland.“Although it\u0026#8217s a daunting climb I\u0026#8217m just looking forward to the overall experience at the moment.\u0026#8220I haven’t done anything like this before and have actually never been to Africa before so all of it will be totally new to me!

strikes over wages","story":"\t\t\t\t\tPlanned strikes at Aberdeen’s airport could cripple services during its busiest season, a union boss warned today.More than half the 252-strong workforce at Aberdeen International Airport are expected to strike after 88% of workers rejected the latest pay offer.Aberdeen airport workers vote for strike action over payThe move could see around 170 workers taking part in industrial action, including security and airfield operations, airside services, firefighters and passenger service agents.A series of 24-hour stoppages are planned to take place on July 20, August 2 and August 16 but a spokeswoman for the airport maintained they would be ready to deal with any planned strikes.Mediator Acas has been contacted to lead discussions between the two parties, with the airport seeking a suitable date for these to continue.Unite regional officer Wullie Wallace said the strikes would affect the running of the airport at the height of the summer holiday season.He said: “It would have a big effect because the people taking the action are key to the running of the airport.“I could see the airport not being able to run on those days because a lot of key people would be striking.“It could be a busy time for the airport as it’s July and August it’s pencilled in for, so unfortunately it would have an impact on the public.”The airport employs its own firefighters but it is understood replacements could be drafted in from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service to plug the gap.However, the airport could not confirm how many firefighters it employs or what contingency arrangements would be in place.Unite said operations at the heliport would not be affected under any industrial action.Unite members have now rejected two wage offers over the two previous years.Mr Wallace added that the latest pay offer has been “emphatically rejected” by Unite members.He said: “The workforce for several years now has received below inflation increases and the company’s idea of rewarding their hard-working employees is by offering more real-term pay cuts.“Aberdeen Airport has been investing heavily into improving the airport facilities and amenities.“It’s high time for the company to invest in their employees.“Unite remain open to further discussions with a view to resolving the dispute.”An Aberdeen Airport spokesman said: “We have been informed by Unite of their intention to take industrial action on Friday July 20.“This follows the rejection of our proposed pay offer.“We believe we have made an offer that is entirely fair and reasonable and we are committed to continuing discussions to reach a resolution acceptable to all parties.“We have made contact with Acas, which has agreed to mediate between both parties.“We are seeking a suitable date to continue our discussions in an attempt to reach a mutually agreeable position.“We will, as a matter of course, ensure contingency plans are in place in the event of any planned industrial action.”A TUI spokesman, which operates flights to and from the airport, said staff are “working closely” with the airport to “understand the situation”.He added: “We would like to reassure customers that we will do everything possible to minimise disruption should the industrial action take place.”In 2016, a potential strike by Aberdeen Airport workers over pensions was averted after talks between union bosses and airport chiefs resulted in an “agreement in principle”.There were fears industrial action could lead to major disruption at the north-east gateway at the height of the summer season.The airport recently unveiled a much bigger and improved security hall, as well as new shops and a larger duty free section as part of a £20 million investment at the terminal.Work on a third phase is already under way and will deliver new and bigger catering facilities, with bosses hoping it will be finished in time for Offshore Europe 2019.The Duchess of Rothesay officially opened phase one last October, which saw the creation of a new international arrivals hall and baggage reclaim area.Airport bosses spent nearly four years designing the development to minimise the impact the work on the terminal’s transformation would have on passengers.Easyjet said it could not comment until it received notice of strike action.Flybe, British Airways and Thomas Cook could not be reached for comment.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/07/5b407e2c0acc3-846x564.jpg ","title":"car parking and gritters given space as operations

the Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route (AWPR) when it opens in the autumn.Included in the depot would be a central building to be used as an office and meeting room, storage area and parking and fuelling facility for vehicles including five gritters.According to council papers, 16 car parking spaces will be provided along with a road to the depot.In a decision notice it said: “The area is

proposal is related to the future operation and maintenance of the AWPR.“The proposal would support improved connectivity via modern transportation infrastructure provision in the Aberdeen region, resulting in economic benefits.”The first main section of the bypass opened to drivers at the end of last month.The northern leg between the Parkhill and Blackdog junctions, which spans four miles, is the first stretch of the main bypass which has opened to traffic.The new road provides links between Dyce, Bridge of Don and the A947 Aberdeen to Banff road, as well as the B977 and B999.Transport

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"exciting shinty at the macaulay sixes","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 22/06/18, 8:15 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowNo fewer than 29 youth shinty teams travelled to Oban\u0026#8217s Mossfield Park for the annual Macaulay six-a-side competition.The winners of the main competition for P7 and under were Inverlochy, who defeated Taynuilt 1-0 in the final with Taynuilt taking the Oban Celtic Shield.The Alastair Campbell Shield for P5 and under was won by Braxi Boys from Inverlochy who defeated Bute in a very exciting final after extra time by one penalty to nil.The Macaulay Development trophy was won by Rockfield Rapids.

This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

However, the away team were really up against it from the start. The Ardnamurchan ladies were clearly also up for the game and had a full squad to choose from. With some key players out and one new player making her debut, the nine player squad from Dunadd started strongly. They had several early chances but just couldn\u0026#8217t find the back of the net.There were some crunching tackles and tasty challenges in the first half the Ardnamurchan ladies were keen to neutralise the strength of Dunadd defender Iona McCulloch, often doubling up on her. Referee Beth MacDonald had her work cut out trying to contain tempers as tensions ran high both on and off the pitch.The first half ended 0-0 and Dunadd left the field feeling like they hadn\u0026#8217t performed to their usual high standards. After a rousing half time team talk, Dunadd were keen to get an early goal in the second half to help settle them and to perhaps go on and build from there.And that is exactly what they did. Straight from the throw up, Grace Drummond caught the ball cleanly, sending it sailing over the defence\u0026#8217s heads. Leone Airlie ran on to it and struck it smoothly, low beyond the keeper.However, the home team responded positively and had Dunadd pinned back in their own half for the next five minutes. On 40 minutes, a fortunate strike from wide left bounced past a few players and found it\u0026#8217s way into the corner of the Dunadd net, 1-1.Dunadd were not despondent and regrouped to press again. However, minutes later Ardnamurchan broke and finished well making it 2-1.Again the referee had to step in to break up some fierce challenges as Ardnamurchan continued to goad McCulloch. However, the young Dunadd defender answered the contentious tackles in the best possible way. In the 51st minute she collected a loose ball and broke away from her marker. After dodging past three players she shot high and scored a certain goal of the season contender, pinging it sweetly into the top corner.The remainder of the game saw both teams coming close to winners. Ellie Hetherington making some crucial blocks and tackles, clearing the ball to safety time and time again. Dunadd held on to grind out the result and retain their unbeaten record and hold on to top spot in south division two.After a summer break, Dunadd will travel to third placed GMA on Sunday August 5 in another crucial game as they search to get back to winning ways.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"scrum for burgers","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 30/06/18, 7:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe Mid Argyll Rugby Club had its annual end-of-season barbeque and awards ceremony at the Ropework park on Sunday June 24.The kids from P4/5 and P6/7 that played a big part in winning the league and runners up in P4/5 also received medals.Of the primary six and sevens, player of the year went to Murray MacDonald, most improved player of the year went to Aileen Barr, the coaches award went to Campbell Shaw and best newcomer went to Rhys Coffield.Of the younger kids of primary four and five, the player of the year award went to Arran Martin most improved player of the year went to Fergus Bennet the coaches award went to Jorja and Jemma MacDonald and best newcomer went to Logan Cinnamond.On top of their awards, all the kids were also given a new training top sponsored by Jewsons.The players also clubbed together to get all the coaches a gift each.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"inverarays sale of the summer gets underway","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/07/18, 6:37 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe famous Inveraray summer sale has started.On Monday June 25, Inveraray’s parish church hall opened its doors, brimming with exquisite odds and ends.Ornaments, sports equipment and anything else you can think of can be found at the church for a fair price.Volunteer Wilma Wood said: \u0026#8216Anyone looking for something in particular can give us a shout.

The collective sigh of relief could be heard in body shops and garages all across the land, with annual leave in  most of them on hold until Douglas\u0026#8217s result came in.Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker were out in the mighty Peugeot 106 once more and were having a decent day, with a few hairy moments when the intercom wasn\u0026#8217t working (or so Duncan tells it) and unfortunately breaking a gearbox mount which, though fixed between stages, saw them over their time limit and out of the rally.Mull ace Ally Currie and his Oban co-driver Grant MacNiven continued to chase the bigger more powerful machinery in his 150bhp Fiesta and was sitting third in the 2WD section when a problem that they had been experiencing for most of the day became worse \u0026#8211 and the passenger side front wheel decided to part company on the approach to the start line of stage seven.The family duo of Cara and Donald MacNeill made a welcome return to the stages, in new machinery this time, debuting their Subaru Impreza and bringing it home in one piece in 31st overall and second in class nine.Mull\u0026#8217s James Campbell and Claire Tilley also got their Mitsubishi Evo to the finish and will be happy with the result.The event was won by Kilmarnock\u0026#8217s Andrew Gallagher with Jane Nicol on the notes in the CobbleShop Ford Focus WRC.The next rally action for Argyll is the Mach 1 Stages on the weekend of July 14/15 at Machrihanish.\u0026nbspPICS:Photographs by West Coast PhotosAlly Currie and Grant MacNiven blasted it while their Fiesta was still on four wheels. no_a27ArgyllRally01no_a27ArgyllRally02Overall Winners Andrew Gallagher and Jane Nicol in their Ford Focus. no_a27ArgyllRally03Donald MacNeill from Furnace and Cara MacNeill, Glasgow, make light work of the hairpin in their Subaru.  no_a27ArgyllRally04James Campbell and Claire Tilley from Mull in their Mitsubishi. no_a27ArgyllRally05Kicking up dust in their Peogeot 106 are Lochgilphead team Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker. no_a27ArgyllRally06\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tv company seeks argyll adventurers","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 11:20 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowCould you travel to The Far East without stepping on a plane?If so, a television production company is looking for you.Studio Lambert, the company behind Gogglebox, is seeking folk from Argyll to take part in a trans-global race for a cash prize.Flightless is described as an \u0026#8216ambitious real-world adventure series\u0026#8217.

I am still receiving many justifiable complaints about the terrible condition of Mansefield Road in Port Ellen and the hospital road in Bowmore. With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains. Scottish Water were coming under fire from locals because of its slow progress on the matter.I made my anger about the poor conditions in Tarbert very clear when I contacted Scottish Water. A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"riverside fun day sparkles in the sun","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 9:44 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe sun shone on the Riverside in Lochgilphead for a day of fun.Mid Argyll Community Pool and Riverside Rascals nursery hosted the family day on Sunday July 1, featuring a variety of colourful craft and charity stalls.The unmistakeable aroma of barbecue wafted across the car park from Riverside Rascals nursery, which opened its doors to the public for the occasion, complete with children\u0026#8217s activities.MACPool lifeguards were on hand to keep an eye on the youngsters in the pedal boats while the sunshine glistened across the splashing fun.PICS:Four-year-old Kaiden Abel from Lochgilphead has fun splashing in the inflatable outdoor pool. 06_a27RiversideFun01Kyra Robertson, aged 11, from Cairnbaan, tries to hook a duck on the MS centre stand \u0026#8211 and it\u0026#8217s not as easy as it looks. 06_a27RiversideFun04On the MS Centre Mid Argyll stall were Maggie Dodd and centre manager Karen McCurry. 06_a27RiversideFun07Mary Stewart of the Loch Awe Pottery helps sisters Abby and Chloe McCallum, from Glasgow, to decorate their pottery. 06_a27RiversideFun08Cathleen MacDonald was there with her Woolly Bobbins textile-base crafts. 06_a27RiversideFun09Alongside Cathleen was her mum Margaret Davidson, who creates soft toys under the name Twisted Yarn.

The Honest Men were relegated at the first time of asking in the second tier in the 2016/17 season when they finished bottom with 33 points. But former Ayr hitman and manager, Roberts, reckons being part-time was what held them back. Marko, who played second tier football with Ayr under Brian Reid, said: “I think Ayr will be fine, I really do. “Being full-time in that league is a massive thing. “The last few times Ayr have been in that league it has been very difficult to compete with the full-time teams. “But the fact they have got that now will make a big difference and I don’t think they will have any issues staying in the league. “When I was there under Brian Reid, being part-time was what held us back. “You didn’t have enough time to go and work on things on a daily basis but Ayr will have that now.  “You can beat any team in a one-off game but over the course of a season of 36 games it’s difficult to compete. “But the fans should be excited this time as there should be no problem – Ayr can even start looking up rather than looking down.” Roberts, who hit the net 43 times for Ayr, was more than impressed with Ayr’s impressive goal-scoring form last season as they topped League One, pipping Raith on the final game of the season. He said: “I thought they were really good to watch. “You always thought they were going to score every game they played. “And I don’t mean just scoring one, you always thought they’d grab three or four. “Sometimes they were left open all over the park – but they had too much quality up front and that’s the reason they went up. “Fair play to them as they had three really good strikers in Shankland, Moore and Moffat.” Roberts added: “The way the league was won was certainly a bit of a way to win it.  “I’ve been in teams that have won titles and been promoted with five or six games to go, which gives you a great feeling of accomplishment, but there’s nothing more exciting than winning the title in the last 10 minutes of the season. “Both teams had the chance to run away with it but kept faltering.” Roberts managed Ayr for three years before getting sacked, He then had a player/coach role at Clyde for a season. He has now gone back to playing at Junior Cup finalists Hurlford United. But he insists that his managing days aren’t over.  He said: “I won’t give up on it, I just wanted to play again for now. The best days of your life are when you’re kicking a ball and I am still fit enough.  “Any manager who tells you they prefer coaching is talking rubbish.

Councillors have approved the results of a public consultation in the town that will see a 1400-pupil campus erected at Carrick Academy. Plans will see Cairn and Gardenrose Primaries merge to become a new school located at the purpose-built campus. Nurseries for both schools would also merge to be ready for August 2021. St Cuthbert’s Primary – where parents responding to the consultation issued a rejection of the move – would also relocate but operate as a stand-alone school. A bid for funding will now be made to the Scottish Government. A total of 87 written responses were received during the council’s consultation that officials noted was “low considering the size of Maybole with a population of 4,700 people”.  Council schools spokesman William Grant said: “There is a general agreement of all schools to come together. “Where we had a more mixed response regarded the possible move of the swimming pool. “It is important as we progress the design that too much is not crammed in to this new campus. “It must be open and spacious.” Maybole Tory councillor Ian Campbell hailed the project as a “wonderful step forward”. And colleague, Hugh Hunter, added: “There are exciting times coming up for Maybole and the town has some real opportunities to flourish.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12884680.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/asr_ayp_210618Nicola3jpeg.jpg","title":"meet weeks wedding week","story":"NewsMeet this week\u0027s Wedding of the WeekNicola, 28-year-old classical singer married 30-year-old shipbuilding engineer John Hunter.\u0026nbspShareByAbi Smillie16:46, 9 JUL 2018NewsJohn and Nicola share a moment (Image: Kevin Moulds Photography)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThis week’s Wedding of the Week bride is Ayrshire’s own Award Winning Classical Artist Nicola Cassells. Nicola, 28-year-old classical singer married 30-year-old shipbuilding engineer John Hunter. The pair now live in Shawlands, Glasgow, but were both originally from Ayr. One Friday night back in 2009 John walked in to Harley’s Pub in Ayr to wish his cousin a happy birthday, and his sister told him to say hello to Nicola – her workmate at the time. “Nobody knows if it was the brown eyes, the sweet perfume or the six pints, three vodkas and the shot of Midori that caused him to steal my cardigan but steal it he did,” joked Nicola. She added: “A few days later, cardigan in hand, John returned it to H Samuel where I worked at the time. And that moment was the beginning of something special.” Since then both have enjoyed years of happiness and in October 2016 – seven years after meeting – John asked Nicola to marry him at Loch Lomond.  John and Nicola tied the knot on Thursday, June 7, at The Cruin at Loch Lomond. The couple said: “It was relaxing, elegant and absolutely perfect. “We can’t thank the staff enough. The weather, setting and scenery were breath-taking.” The bride wore a Vera Wang dress from David’s Bridal, Braehead, the bridesmaids also wearing gowns from David’s Bridal. The kilts were the Spirit of Lochearn tartan from Kilts 4 U. The wedding party consisted of Best man Mark Cosgrove, Groomsmen Niall Carney, Paddy McCurdie and Ryan Glass (nephew, aged 8), Maid of honour sister Jennifer Cassells, Bridesmaids Laura Dickson, Heather Armstrong and Aimee Trainer, Groom’s parents John Hunter and Hazel Hunter and the Bride’s parents Brian Cassells and Julie Cassells. The pair are currently celebrating being newlyweds in Bangkok, Thailand, and will be heading to Koh Samui, Thailand, then on to the Atlantis in Dubai.  3D Cakes created the couples wedding cake. The couple said: “We were inspired by the Scottish theme and used the same tartan ribbon that was on the kilts.” Kev Moulds Photography captured Nicola and John’s big day, leaving them with fond memories to look back on. The bouquets were arranged by Narcissus Flowers by Susan Hair and make-up was styled and created by Anna Wade (hair) and Lynn Brown (make-up). The couple added: “We would like to thank everyone who made the day possible, especially our parents Brian Cassells, Julie Cassells, John Hunter and Hazel Hunter. “And to our guests who contributed to an amazing day.” For more photos of the couple\u0027s big day, pick up your copy of this week\u0027s Ayrshire Post.

Bids of \u0026pound1.5million are being sought for Enterkine House, perched above Annbank. The luxury four-star retreat, which boasts 74 acres of land, employs around 50 staff. Kirk House and Steading, a six-bedroom farmhouse currently used as overspill accommodation for the hotel, is also included. Agents Christie \u0026amp Co and Galbraith said the plot offered “potential for development under a new owner”. It follows a long-running noise battle at the hotel which saw bosses spend \u0026pound80,000 soundproofing their wedding marquee. Council chiefs were told that slapping an 11pm curfew on party bands could put the hotel out of business.  But they finally got the all-clear earlier this year and revealed plans to build a permanent structure. However, the hotel is now being offered to the market. Bob Cherry, a partner with Galbraith, said: “The purchaser of Enterkine would find it relatively straightforward to continue the current business, which is well-established, and there are further opportunities for diversification or expansion of the tourism and events facilities on the estate, subject to the necessary consents. “This is a beautiful estate with a thriving hotel business and potential for further development.” Brian Sheldon, of Christie \u0026amp Co, added: “The market for country house hotels such as Enterkine House has vastly improved in recent years. “Its location in South Ayrshire and within such an enviable estate and countryside will attract local, regional and potentially international operators. “Whilst the business is trading well, there is certainly scope for further growth.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"royal troon golf club make","story":"NewsRoyal Troon golf club make generous donation to hospital unitIt follows a charity 18-hole golf event with Troon Portland and Troon Ladies, writes Charlene Bennie.\u0026nbspShareByAyrshire Post15:39, 10 JUL 2018News\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailRoyal Troon Golf Club has made the generous donation of \u0026pound1k to Crosshouse Hospital’s Acute Stroke Unit.

That’s the shock ultimatum delivered by warring SNP councillors to their embattled leader. Douglas Campbell has been ordered to regain control of his split ranks during the council’s summer break. It comes as rival camps “fight like rats” to wrestle the council’s power base back on track. A racism storm and failed coup on Councillor Campbell has plunged the SNP into crisis. And the Post understands another plot to oust the leader is now brewing. It follows all SNP group members signing a declaration of support for their under-fire boss just two weeks ago. But a party insider has revealed growing disquiet is threatening to tear the group apart.  Within hours of the public show of support, Cllr Campbell was being placed under increasing pressure to step down of his own accord, rather than face another bruising challenge from within, the Post has learned. A senior source said: “People agreed to fall in line and sign the declaration for the sake of the bigger picture. “But it’s widely accepted that a change is required and this can’t go on. “The group is in a position where people will fight like rats to get what they want. “However, the even bigger concern is trying to keep the administration intact.” Worries over a potential walkout from Labour colleagues has, until now, ensured enough SNP support behind Cllr Campbell. A potential change in the their leadership is thought that have strained relations with administration partners, who have indicated they are happier working with Cllr Campbell.  But the Post understands that Cllr Campbell’s Labour past is forming a big part of the problem for the SNP leader as he battles factions within his new party. And a new warning – issued as councillors left for their summer break – stressed that he must crack the whip among his troubled ranks. The source added: “It was made very clear that if he doesn’t, the matter will be taken out of his hands. “The party is being crucified every week and it cannot be allowed to continue. “Some see Douglas as being far too close to Labour and that is undoubtedly a big issue for him. “Either way, he’s been given the message in clear terms that he needs to get everyone behind him and on the same page.” When asked about the warning, the group’s depute leader, William Grant, insisted: “This is news to me.” Cllr Campbell added: “Cllr Grant responded to your enquiry that ‘This is news to me’ and I have nothing to add.” "},{"url":null,"title":"up-to-50-jobs-created-with-new-home-bargains-store-in-galashiels","story":"UP to 50 jobs are being created with the opening of a new \u0026pound4million Home Bargains store in Galashiels this weekend.\nThe Stirling Street outlet, which is due to be opened on Saturday at 8am, replaces the smaller Channel Street store which closes the day before.\nJoe Morris, operations director at Home Bargains, told the Border : \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore thrilled to be launching this flagship store in Galashiels and look forward to welcoming customers through the doors.\nThe 25,000 sq ft store, which has previously been a Co-Op and B\u0026ampM, will offer shoppers a range of products, including homewares, health and beauty essentials, sweets, snacks and drinks, as well as fresh and frozen food.\nJoe added: \u0026ldquoStirling Street will be a great location for us and we\u0026rsquore proud to be able to offer local people top-branded goods at exceptionally low prices.\nWith more than four million customers each week, Home Bargains is one of the country\u0026rsquos best-loved discount retailers, stocking top-quality branded goods at low prices.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"feature-peebles-pupils-meditate-their-way-to-mindfulness","story":"IT\u0027S a typical weekday, high school students are lying on the floor of their classroom, eyes closed, listening to the soothing sounds of tranquil music, gently guided by their teacher as they breathe deeply, exhaling all worries away and their minds drift off\u0026hellip\nNow, I know you must be wondering, what on earth are they teaching at Peebles High School? What about prelims, exams, studying, grades?\nBut what do all these pressures bring to the fragile mind of a young person, and how do they process the stress to ensure their mental wellbeing?\nIn steps Suzi Gibson, who has been running mindful meditation sessions with Peebles High pupils as part of Health Week for the past five years.\nAnd so a group of pupils dropped their pencils, calculators and chemistry tools and walked through the doors of a more unique classroom setting, kicking off their school shoes and leaving their cares behind them as the lay in the comfort of Space 108 in Peebles.\nCan mindfulness meditation really help pupils concentrate amid the distractions of 21st century living?\nI decided to experience for myself the sessions offered freely to the pupils by Suzi, who guided sessions at the high school before opening her studio at Greenside, Peebles, in January 2016.\nAdmittedly I had always been a bit sceptical about meditation. I mean seriously, how can sitting on a floor in the lotus position, inhaling the pleasant oil aroma while the ambient sounds of dolphins singing and ocean waves crash, bring me peace of mind?\nI\u0026rsquom a wife, mother, writer, and like most people, my life is busy and my head is bursting with thoughts from which there\u0026rsquos no escape.\nBut I entered the beautiful airy studio with an open-mind and intrigued about the experiences of the pupils.\nOn this particular afternoon, I feel like I\u0026rsquove got the weight of the world on my shoulders. Thoughts are racing through my head like a train out of control. But immediately I feel a sense of calmness speaking to Suzi, as she explains the techniques she is using and gently guides me through the smooth ride to a quiet mind\u0026hellipand I am, going, going, gone\u0026hellip\nI am in a state of deep peace and the mind is calm, so much so, when I hear Suzi\u0026rsquos soft instruction to open my eyes \u0026ndash I don\u0026rsquot want to. I love it here.\nSo now I can see why meditation could potentially tackle a myriad of problems suffered by young students, including mental health. This is a growing problem in the Scottish Borders, with evidence suggesting almost 2,000 children and young people in the region will experience mental ill health at some point in their lives.\nThe sessions are offered to groups of pupils from S1 to S3, who arrive at the studio giggling with excitement and anticipation for their new experience.\nSuzi explained: \"There are some nerves and awareness of peers, especially if there is a mix of ages. The great thing is, once they close their eyes, it becomes completely about their own experience. Fidgeting and chatting stops, there is a sense of calm, and some sleep which is great because they perhaps need it.\"\nEach group is given an insight into the benefits of meditation, as well as exploring how stress becomes unhealthy, warning signs, and how to build resilience through practical techniques that can help reduce anxiety.\nThe meditation guru shared skills with the pupils which, if put into practice daily, can be life-changing.\nSuzi said: \"They are all very relaxed and quite amazed at the experience. I hope they leave with the knowledge that they have the ability to create calmness within themselves using some of the techniques they have learned, leading to greater concentration, focus, creativity and well rested teens.\"\nThe visible difference in the pupils during the session at Space 108 has astounded school staff. \"Some of the teachers and staff who have attended over the years can\u0026rsquot quite believe the quiet and calm that begins to settle in the room. I\u0026rsquove had a few parents afterwards tell me how much their kids enjoyed it,\" said Suzi.\n\"There is a lot of anxiety and tension in our kids today, sometimes a feeling of being relaxed is a little alien to them, then they experience it. That\u0026rsquos the important bit, they have an experience of relaxation and calm, not an intellectual understanding that it is good for them, but an actual experience.\"\nResearch has proven that mindfulness and meditation is very beneficial to a person\u0026rsquos mental health, and many schools are incorporating it into their classrooms, teaching philosophies, and disciplinary programs.\nIn fact, some schools are choosing to replace detention with meditation with it even being used as behavioural therapy in classrooms.\nWhether this trend will catch on remains to be seen, as there are many parents who still prefer traditional discipline, with youngsters being given their marching orders to the principal\u0026rsquos office for unruly behaviour.\nBut one thing is certain, the pupils of Peebles High School reaped the benefits of their mindful meditation sessions with Suzi during Health Week last month.\nPrincipal teacher of pastoral care Kirsteen Robertson, said: \"The studio is beautiful, the students immediately notice how soothing the space is, the lovely smell and lighting. The sessions give our students strategies to relax, think calmly, reducing stress and anxiety and improve sleep. It\u0026rsquos just amazing to see how some of them react.\"\nHaving embraced meditation and its healing benefits, I leave the studio feeling renewed, carefree and a little lighter on my feet. The everyday worries and thoughts I described like a train racing out of control?

particularly like to welcome our special guest, Ailsa Stewart.\u0026#8216Mrs Stewart was asked to take over the running of the club 70 years ago in her present role as trustee.\u0026#8216Some have commented that this project has been all down to myself but that’s not true and I have a lot of people to thank.\u0026#8216Firstly, our committee, and this morning six of us set up for today.\u0026#8216Three members, Gill Wright, Jane Gallagher and Donald MacKay have been outstanding.\u0026#8216Gill designed the clubhouse and ramp and dealt with the planning regulations.\u0026#8216Jane, who unlike me, is very meticulous, reads the small print on our legal contracts with sportscotland and Tennis Scotland and advises us accordingly.\u0026#8216Gill and Jane have also raised funds this year with a quiz and raffle at various events culminating yesterday at the RNLI open day.\u0026#8216Donald, our captain, who is in California, on a number of occasions appeared with his tractor and trailer to remove the old clubhouse keeping costs down.\u0026#8216Thanks also go to Campbeltown Community Council chairman Alan Baker, who oversaw the project and took the stress away from the rest of us who don’t have his expertise and knowledge.\u0026#8216Thanks to all of our sponsors listed on the new noticeboard inside the gate.\u0026#8216Thanks to all the contractors for their amazing work in transforming our club into one fit for the 21st century.\u0026#8216I would like to single out our main contractor, Gerry Nugent. Nothing was ever a problem. He was very reassuring even when we discovered the old clubhouse had no solid foundations.\u0026#8216I first became involved in the club as a 12-year-old looking to escape the house and meet up with friends.\u0026#8216My friends and I spent many hours at the courts, sometimes playing tennis, often not.\u0026#8216Mrs Dickson or Gertie, as we used to call her, was in charge in those days. She gave up so much of her time making sure the club was thriving and that we were behaving.\u0026#8216She had no hesitation in throwing us out if this wasn’t the case and I’m delighted to see Gertie’s sons, Toby and Ronnie here today.\u0026#8216Since 2014 we have raised a total of £95,000 to resurface our two courts and build the new clubhouse and ramp.\u0026#8216In two years I’ll retire from the committee and as a coach. The next generation will need to ensure that the young people have access to this great game in Campbeltown.\u0026#8217Guests celebrated the event with sparkling wine and traditional strawberry tarts.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"carradale canters first canine champion","story":"A four legged 5k runner made Carradale history as she led her puffed out owner across the line in the 4th Canter.In last Sunday\u0026#8217s race, \u0026#8216Lola,\u0026#8217 (00:53:16) a Manchester terrier from Maghull, Liverpool became the first official dog, complete with race number, to finish the Carradale Canter.Lola\u0026#8217s finish was overshadowed by a marshaling error which caused the U16 5K winner and second overall, Kyle Paterson, to miss a turn and have to retrace his steps to the finishing line.Campbeltown Running Club\u0026#8217s (CRC) Stewart Ireland (00:24:26) was the first man home in that race and but for the signing error Paterson would have been hot on his heels.He eventually finished in 00:29:40 with the consolation of beating Ruairidh Campbell who finished on 00:30:19.First lady 5K finisher and 4th overall was CRC\u0026#8217s U16 Kirstie Renton 00:30:25.In the headline 10K race perennial favourite, CRC runner Stuart McGeachy took the honours admitting it had been a hard race.

supplies during the current period of hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer usage has increased significantly.With the current weather conditions forecast to continue people should take simple but important steps to conserve public water supplies.In some areas there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water during the summer and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely and  to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Some water treatment works and distribution networks are working at near capacity to meet demand.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of usage and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce usage wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their usage and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible, use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.Scotland’s public water supply is the lifeblood of the country, for household and business customers and more than 1.3 billion litres is used per day.There is a strong and resilient water distribution network but everyone will need to play their part as Scotland enjoys its hottest and driest summer in many years.To help customers use water wisely, advice is at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or by calling 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer,Chief Operating Officer,Scottish

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.

Margaret and Keith Morris moved from a Dunedin Canmore property in Bathgate last September into the phase two of Mill House \u0026ndash an amenity housing development for residents aged 55 and over.  Mrs Morris said: \u0026ldquoThere is no privacy whatsoever.  \u0026ldquoPeople who park in the car park have been waving in.  \u0026ldquoThere were two young guys in a van and I was hanging out my washing and one was nudging the other.

Mrs Morris said that although there were some trees along the boundary, they shed their leaves in the autumn, leaving the area bare.  She claimed that she and her husband had called on the housing association for permission to fill in the gaps in the fence to allow more privacy but claimed they had been told they couldn\u0026rsquot as another resident liked it that way.  \u0026ldquoWe wanted to get these slats which are only 94p. We would pay for them and fill in the spaces, she added.  She said they also called for a fence to be installed to stop people using an area past their flats as a shortcut to Tesco, claiming they were dumping rubbish including cans and bottles en route.  Neighbour Fiona Wilson said that motorists ate and slept in their vehicles and let their dogs out of cars.  \u0026ldquoWe are entitled to some sort of privacy, she added.  \u0026ldquoWe can\u0026rsquot go out \u0026ndash everybody\u0026rsquos looking at us.  \u0026ldquoMy bedroom is also to the front.

Sculptor Michael Johnson\u0026rsquos work, called \u0026lsquoMemory and Reflection\u0026rsquo, is 12ft high and 6ft feet wide.  The stainless steel sculpture depicts aspects of Musselburgh\u0026rsquos history with images of agriculture, people, connections to the sea, the river and the Romans. The face of the sculpture is mirror polished and reflects whatever stands before it.  Mr Johnson, from Nottinghamshire, sees these two aspects of the shell, the memory and reflection, as metaphors for a work which interprets the history of the town and offers a reflection of how the town is viewed now.  A working group made up of community representatives selected the mussel shell for the commission. Mr Johnson undertook activities with local groups and schoolchildren to create designs for bronze inserts incorporated onto the main sculpture.  The fisherfolk stone sculpture at Murdoch Green will be moved to a seating area in front of the Shell petrol station, also off Edinburgh Road.  The mussel shell is one of two works of art funded by Tesco at a cost of \u0026pound76,000 as part of the council\u0026rsquos Percent for Art policy, which was a condition of planning consent for the company\u0026rsquos present store.

Fears were raised back in 2016 that the day centre might be forced to relocate or even cease to exist in its present form because a new day centre facility could not be accommodated within the current building.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership needed to provide at least 18 places of registered day care for people with complex care needs in Musselburgh given that it was the largest town in East Lothian. This was in line with need identified as part of a wider review of older people\u0026rsquos day centres.  This led to the partnership and the Hollies exploring the options available, which ranged from potentially adapting the current building to accommodate 18 people through to looking at possible other buildings if the Hollies couldn\u0026rsquot be adapted.  After nearly two years of talks, and Care Inspectorate and architects\u0026rsquo input, it was found that, in order to adapt the Hollies premises, the lunch club and public cafe would be lost at the expense of more than 100 users.  A joint decision remains to be made about the eight day care places already in existence at the Hollies current premises but, at present, there is agreement that these places will continue.  The health and social care partnership is now looking for somewhere else in Musselburgh to accommodate the other 10 places.  Following a meeting this month, the Hollies trustees have confirmed that agreement has been reached with the health and social care partnership that the status quo will remain at the day centre.  In a joint statement, the trustees said: \u0026ldquoThe Hollies distributed a consultation paper to service users and had 271 responses completed in two weeks. The overwhelming consensus of the people consulted is for the Hollies to continue providing the service it does now for the people of Musselburgh and surrounding areas. We have also received positive feedback on our proposed expansion of activities in the hall in the afternoons.  \u0026ldquoWe have agreed with the health and social care partnership that the Hollies should remain as it is. We are looking forward to continuing to work as before and to embark on exciting new projects to meet the wishes of all those who attend the Hollies.  Liz Shannon, centre manager, said: \u0026ldquoFunding is a constant battle for us all at the Hollies and we have been in limbo whilst these talks were taking place and have been unable to approach funders as we were unclear what funding we were asking for.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership has assured us they will continue to give funding at the current level for this financial year which is \u0026pound82,000 to continue to fund the eight registered places which we are grateful for in this transition period. However, that is less than a third of what it costs to run all our services and maintain the building.  \u0026ldquoThings are going to be very tight for the near future while we submit funding applications to funders like the lottery however, we are very excited at the prospect of moving forward and very grateful for the support from the people of Musselburgh and beyond.  Councillor Fiona O\u0026rsquoDonnell, health and social care spokesperson, said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that the Hollies will continue to provide a wide range of services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis was a really positive meeting and the plans to provide more activities in the Hollies are good news for local people.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership will continue its work to increase the amount of day support in Musselburgh for older people with complex care needs."},{"url":null,"title":"flag-ceremony-held-to-mark-armed-forces-day","story":"  The ceremony marked the start of a week of celebrations across Scotland to mark the contribution members of the armed forces make.

Among the issues highlighted at the public meeting were long waits to get through to the surgery by telephone failure of repeat prescriptions poor communication with patients very long waiting times to see a named GP lack of continuity of care and treatment difficulties with NHS 24 and test results not being given out by doctors.  Concerns were also raised about GP training and recruitment, the area\u0026rsquos growing population causing additional pressures on local health services, the cost of calling the surgery and the idea of an online booking system.  Last Wednesday, Ms Dugdale asked the Scottish Government what discussions it has had with NHS Lothian regarding general practitioner services in Musselburgh.  Shona Robison, who was Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport at the time, said: \u0026ldquoNHS 24 is delivering a pilot at the Riverside GP practice in Musselburgh whereby it is triaging patients who have requested same-day GP appointments. Where appropriate, NHS 24 will signpost patients to areas of the primary care system that are better placed to meet their needs, often more swiftly. \u0026ldquoIndications are that the pilot is working well, with a number of patients signposted to more appropriate support, freeing up GPs to deal with patients with more complex needs. A full evaluation is underway with a report due in the coming weeks, which will be shared with health boards and integration authorities.  Ms Dugdale commented: \u0026ldquoEarlier this month, 200 angry Musselburgh residents turned out at a public meeting because they have had real and persistent difficulties in accessing GPs locally. They do not think that the pilot is working that well. Many of the problems are caused by a GP shortage - a point that the practice and the British Medical Association have acknowledged. Can the cabinet secretary explain to my constituents why they have to phone NHS 24 to see their GP and when she expects Scotland\u0026rsquos GP shortage to be resolved?  Ms Robison said: \u0026ldquoThe pilot that NHS 24 is running is a system that has worked well elsewhere and that has had strong evaluation, so I urge Kezia Dugdale to wait for the formal evaluation of the pilot. I am happy for her to be furnished with the evaluation if she would be interested in that.  \u0026ldquoWith regard to the way forward for general practice, she will be aware of the new contract that has been put in place with substantial resources to back it up. In this financial year, we will invest \u0026pound100 million to support the new contract, and we also have the ambition to increase the number of GPs by at least 800 over the next 10 years. In addition, the multidisciplinary team will make sure that we can reduce the workload of GPs.  Mr Whitfield told the Courier: \u0026ldquoAt the recent GP public meeting, Kezia and I agreed to take the concerns raised back to the practice, but also to NHS Lothian and the Scottish Government. Kezia has acted swiftly to challenge the Health Secretary on the issue and demand she does more to alleviate the problems experienced in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoWe have also passed on the issues and questions highlighted at the meeting to the practice. Once we receive a response we will share it with those who attended. We will also keep up the pressure locally and nationally for further action to help patients here receive the service they need.  Mr Dugdale later said the appropriate steps needed to be taken to support \u0026ldquostruggling GP practices and prevent further closures.  Miles Briggs, Lothian Conservative MSP, who also took part in the Holyrood debate, later said: \u0026ldquoThe Health Secretary\u0026rsquos assurance that the pilot is working well in Musselburgh is totally at odds with the experience of many local patients who have expressed very real concerns about delays in getting through and arranging a routine GP appointment.  \u0026ldquoMinisters and NHS Lothian need to respond to what are genuine issues being experienced by local residents and to take urgent action to address these."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-potter-stars-are-heading-to-musselburgh-this-summer","story":"  Stars of the movies will be taking part in the summer event which is being held at Loretto School and raising funds for Children\u0026rsquos Hospices Across Scotland (CHAS).

Searching for frog spawn and wee tadpoles is often a key childhood memory. But there are things we know about without really knowing about them.  This thought came to me as I searched for tadpoles and wee frogs in a pond last weekend with a group of parents and their children.  I love nature and believe it is a powerful part of all of us, which is why going to the woods or the beach, or just the general \u0026lsquocountryside\u0026rsquo, is an antidote for the stress of life.  But the truth is we don\u0026rsquot really have to go far to reach nature it\u0026rsquos all around us.  The spider\u0026rsquos web on the hedge, the birds on the roof that wake us in the mornings, the self-seeded flowers which grow in places all around our towns, the trees which blossom then turn our streets green, the wee beasties in our garden soil, the list goes on and on.  Yet it is so easy to rush past all the magic which is just on our doorstep.  And as I watched the wee frogs swimming in the pond last week, I discovered just how much I don\u0026rsquot know and have missed.  That\u0026rsquos the joy of having young children, I think: they are a passport for you as a \u0026lsquogrown-up\u0026rsquo to explore the world with a sense of fascination that we all once had, and can be rekindled.  You see, I\u0026rsquod never actually thought about how a tadpole changes into a frog.  In the day-to-day living of life I suppose it\u0026rsquos understandable it is not an issue we will spend too much time thinking about.  But as I watched the wee frogs come up from the mud to the surface to breathe, then swim down again, I realised we were looking down on a simple but fascinating miracle of nature.  Then a wee frog literally jumped from a stone onto my son\u0026rsquos hand.  He could have squashed it or even been frightened by it, but instead he said \u0026ldquowow.  The wee creature jumped from his hand onto mine, obviously looking for a way back to the safety of the water.  Carefully, and a bit reluctantly, he helped the wee \u0026lsquobaby frog\u0026rsquo back into the water where it swam back down to the mud.  That\u0026rsquos when I realised I knew about the process without knowing about it.  There were some frogs which looked like late developers compared to their cousins, for they seemed to be more tadpole than frog, still swimming about with a tail between their developing frog legs.  The whole spectacle was, honestly, fascinating. I found myself being in awe at the process that we all know about but don\u0026rsquot really know about.  And so as summer has reached us, I am determined to make it a Safari of Discovery on our doorstep.  I will share this journey with you the places, stories and folklore attached to them. And while I cannot claim to be an expert on nature, I know its spiritual importance and I think that is a good beginning.  My first port of call will be the wood of what my kids call the \u0026ldquoserpent trees.  Where is that? You\u0026rsquoll find out next week!  In the meantime, I will have to keep this week\u0026rsquos page short as it is my daughter Manja\u0026rsquos ninth birthday and I have mermaid tails to connect. . ."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7697530.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"council-calls-for-rejection-of-substation-plans","story":"  East Lothian Council will submit its formal objection to the proposals to a Scottish Government reporter after officials were given the unanimous support of elected councillors at a meeting of the local authority on Tuesday.  A planning application for the substation by Inch Cape Offshore Limited (ICOL) was called in by Scottish Ministers in a controversial move in April and will now be decided by the reporter instead of the council.  ICOL wants to bring offshore energy from a planned windfarm off the Angus coast onto land at Cockenzie by building the substation on the footprint of the former power station.  A previous planning application siting the substation further inland had been given planning permission but that permission lapsed instead of renewing it, ICOL decided to pursue a new site.  In its argument to Scottish Ministers, the council will state that the substation is \u0026ldquonot the best use of the land and point out that planning permission had been given at another site.  Councillor Norman Hampshire said: \u0026ldquoBecause of the location, we have to recommend it should be refused. We have done a lot of work to move this proposal forward and this action jeopardises that.  \u0026ldquoI think if everybody had worked together we could have got a development on a site the council, developers and communities could have supported.  Earlier this month, representatives of ICOL were challenged by Prestonpans Community Council to name any independent party that support the planned location of the substation.  Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are against it, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council are against it, East Lothian Council and Scottish Natural Heritage are against it.  \u0026ldquoShow us anyone, apart from Inch Cape, who think it is a good site.  Ian Johnson, ICOL project manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe are naturally disappointed that East Lothian Council officers have recommended refusal to the application on the grounds that it could prejudice future development of the area. ICOL have been and will continue to work with the council to look at options to reduce the footprint of the site and ensure that other potential future developments can co-exist next to the substation.  However, he made it clear there were no plans to consider an alternative site, telling the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe have no intention of moving the proposed site of the onshore transmission works again.

Boasting one of the oldest golf courses in the world \u0026ndash Musselburgh Links, The Old Course \u0026ndash the town was once home to the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, who now play at Muirfield, near Gullane.  The Honourable Company brought other Edinburgh clubs to the town such as Royal Burgess, Bruntsfield and the Warrender.  The exhibition celebrates the days from 1836 to the early 20th century when Musselburgh was at the forefront of the game\u0026rsquos development.  It not only celebrates the golf clubs which played in the town over the years but also the many golf club and ball makers, and professional players, who made their living in the town between 1836 and 1900 \u0026ndash a period of dramatic growth in the game.  The display has been organised by Musselburgh Museum and Heritage Group in partnership with Mungo Park, whose great-grandfather Willie Park Senior, from Wallyford, won the first Open Championship at Prestwick in 1860 and went on to be a four-time Open champion.  Willie\u0026rsquos brother Mungo and son Willie Junior were also Open champions at Musselburgh Links.  Two other local men \u0026ndash Bob Ferguson, who won a hat-trick of Open Championships, and David Brown \u0026ndash complete the town\u0026rsquos five Open champions, with 11 wins between them.  Support for the exhibition has also been received from East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos economic development and strategic investment department and Musselburgh Common Good Fund.  The exhibition, which runs from July 6 to September 1, is to be officially opened by Lord Wemyss, whose family has been involved with golf since the early 18th century.  On display are a large number of golf items and memorabilia donated by golf clubs that were formerly located at Musselburgh Links. Artefacts from the British Golf Museum and private collections can also be viewed.  The exhibition includes significant artefacts that have not been seen publicly in Scotland for decades, among them Charles Lees\u0026rsquo famous painting A Summer Evening on the Musselburgh Links: Golfers, which recently sold at Bonhams.

The land had previously been owned by Sainsbury\u0026rsquos who had permission for a new supermarket there but their long-stalled plans were finally ditched when they sold the land earlier this year.  A public exhibition took place at the town\u0026rsquos John Gray Centre last Tuesday where those behind the plans were on hand to answer local residents\u0026rsquo questions.  Alex Mitchell, director of Zander Planning, admitted there had been a \u0026ldquomixed reaction from the people who turned up.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have had a great turnout \u0026ndash some people have been supportive and think that it will be of benefit to the town but others are worried about what it will do to the town centre.  Alastair Dickie, development director at Ediston Real Estate, which are behind the plans, added: \u0026ldquoI think there have been a lot of valid comments.  The names of the businesses looking to move into the site have not yet been revealed but it is hoped that their identities will become public by the time a planning application is submitted to East Lothian Council.  Mr Mitchell hopes a detailed planning application will be lodged before the end of the summer. He said: \u0026ldquoIf we can get an application in by about September then we\u0026rsquore probably looking at six months for planning [approval]. If we get [that] we could be on-site in spring 2019.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom sure retailers would want to be open before Christmas but that is probably a bit tight so we\u0026rsquod be looking at early 2020.  Mr Mitchell also attempted to allay fears over the volume of traffic on the road by adding: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore looking to create a filter lane so people coming in [to the new retail park] would not cause queues for people getting into the town.  Paul Darling, one of the planning liaison officers at the town\u0026rsquos community council, attended the exhibition.  He said the buildings proposed were \u0026ldquougly but added: \u0026ldquoI am not against the plans, I just think the buildings have to be more in-keeping with the rest of the town.  \u0026ldquoI think that it could actually bring people to the town but it is a bit of a worry what could happen to the shops in the town centre.

Among those representing the Dundee university is Emily Peterson, from Dunbar.

The team, who make up Blacklight Games, created Firepoint \u0026ndash a first-person mixed reality simulator which aims to bring a new level of realism to firefighter training.  Using HoloLens and Windows Mixed Reality technology, the game allows trainees to see through the eyes of a firefighter as they make their way through a multi-storey training ground tackling a variety of different issues.  It is hoped the simulator can eventually be used at open days or recruitment fairs.  The former Dunbar Grammar School pupil told the Courier the idea had evolved over time before resulting in the final product.  Originally, proposals looked at creating a game involving a maze.  However, a discussion with a firefighter saw the focus of the project, which is the work of eight third year students, change.  Emily said: \u0026ldquoMatthew McAuley, from our team, had a friend who worked for the fire service.  \u0026ldquoI think he got the initial from there and said why don\u0026rsquot we come up with that.  \u0026ldquoWe had been making the initial concept like a maze and it is something you can still see in the final build of the game.

Mrs Paul said that, while she was not against giving young people a place of their own, she felt the shelter \u0026ndash which sits to the rear of the home the couple have lived in for 18 years \u0026ndash was not the right location.

Derek Costello, club convenor, said: \u0026ldquoPancreatic Cancer Scotland is the Labour club\u0026rsquos nominated charity and we will continue to support Walter\u0026rsquos family and friends in their fundraising efforts in memory of Walter, who was a well-loved and respected member of our club.  Fiona Brown from the charity was delighted to receive the cheque and said the proceeds would go to help raise awareness of pancreatic cancer, which is the fifth most common cause of cancer death in the UK as the majority of patients are diagnosed too late for potentially curative surgery.  Walter, who lived in Prestonpans with Janet, was just 60 when he died. He had been diagnosed with the disease only 29 days earlier.  Wife Janet has vowed to continue campaigning to raise funds and awareness in her husband\u0026rsquos memory.  She said: \u0026ldquoI cannot thank everyone enough for the support they have given me and my family over the past 18 months.  \u0026ldquoRaising awareness of pancreatic cancer is just as important as the fundraising and I would urge everyone to learn and understand the symptoms of this \u0026lsquosilent cancer\u0026rsquo.

The volunteers arrived on the scene shortly after 5.35pm to find the man with \u0026ldquosevere blisters on his feet and in considerable pain.  A spokesman for the Dunbar RNLI said: \u0026ldquoHe and his partner had been enjoying a barbecue on the beach.  \u0026ldquoWhen the barbecue cooled they moved it elsewhere but the man stood on sand where the disposable tray had been sitting.  \u0026ldquoThe heat of the sand was such his feet blistered.  \u0026ldquoCrew members used burn bags to protect the man\u0026rsquos feet as they, with help from two surfers, transferred him to the lifeboat.  \u0026ldquoThey then headed to the nearby chalets at Shore Road, where an ambulance crew was waiting to treat the man for his injuries.

They also found five secondary tumours at the top of his spine.  By the age of 13, the brave teenager had completed a high dose of radiotherapy to his brain and spinal cord following a biopsy.  Despite his health challenges, Paul, who is now 30, received a Bachelor of Engineering with Honours in Computer Systems and Networks degree at a graduation ceremony at the Usher Hall last week.  His family, including mum Angela, 52, and sisters Laura, 34, and Aleigh, 21, were filled with pride to see him receive his degree.  He was also awarded the Rob Kemmer Prize, receiving \u0026pound100 in recognition of his \u0026ldquooutstanding achievements on his individual programme of study.  Paul, of Burns Wynd, is now planning to return to Napier after the summer to complete his Master\u0026rsquos Degree.  Angela, who has been Paul\u0026rsquos full-time carer, said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom incredibly proud of Paul.  \u0026ldquoDespite his challenges he just gets on with things and has achieved his degree.  \u0026ldquoHe has had a tough life but he does not give up and is an incredibly caring young man.  \u0026ldquoNothing is going to stop Paul.  Angela revealed that Paul was a pupil at Musselburgh Grammar School when his condition was first diagnosed.  She said: \u0026ldquoPaul was having trouble with his eyesight and the school contacted me to say they thought it was getting worse.  \u0026ldquoIt was when he was referred to the Eye Pavilion in Edinburgh they discovered the tumours were the cause of it.  \u0026ldquoHe had multifocal germinoma tumours and secondary cancer caused the spinal lesions.  Although the radiotherapy cured his tumour, it had other detrimental effects.  Paul is registered blind as a result of the radiotherapy to his visual nerves and also has a curvature of the spine.  The pituitary gland in his brain has failed completely, so he needs to take hormone replacements and he also finds it difficult to open his jaw, which is thought to be due to scar tissue following radiotherapy.  It was when he was working as a volunteer at Musselburgh Citizens Advice Bureau that Paul first became interested in developing his computer skills, attending both Edinburgh College and Napier for four years.  Angela said: \u0026ldquoPaul doesn\u0026rsquot have an assistant at Napier and he travels there independently.  \u0026ldquoHe has some vision out of the side of one eye and the centre of the other.  \u0026ldquoThe university helped with extra large screens for him and giving him more time his teachers are all delighted for him.  Paul hopes that his achievement will inspire others with illness and disabilities to follow their dreams and aspirations.  He said: \u0026ldquoTo graduate with a degree is massive. It took a while to get here from secondary school.  \u0026ldquoI am looking forward to returning to Napier for a year to do my Master\u0026rsquos Degree. They have given huge support.  Paul is hoping to get a job based in computer security once he finishes his studies."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8024055.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"couple-get-permission-to-turn-old-bar-back-into-pub","story":"  Michael and Wendy Peters took over the Gardeners Arms in Haddington in 2011 when its licence had come under review because of problems experienced by previous management.  A meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board last Thursday heard that since the Peters took charge of the pub there had not been a single complaint about it.  Now the couple have applied for permission to turn the building next door \u0026ndash which currently operates as Jo\u0026rsquos Kitchen \u0026ndash into a pub which they plan to name the New Pheasant.  The name is a reference to the building\u0026rsquos previous history as The Pheasant pub before it shut in 2009.  Mr and Mrs Peters\u0026rsquo agent highlighted articles in the Courier to the licensing board that showed the problems at the Gardeners Arms before the couple took it over.  He said: \u0026ldquoBefore they took over there were some interesting Courier articles which described the pub as a disgrace.  \u0026ldquoSince they took over, the Courier articles were about a disgraced pub being turned around.  Applying for a major variation to the current licence held by Jo\u0026rsquos Kitchen, the agent said that the Peters\u0026rsquo current role managing the Gardeners Arms was coming to an end next month and they were keen to move on to their own establishment.  The board heard two objections had been received, along with two letters of support, all from neighbouring residents.  Both objections raised concerns about noise, as well as pointing out that there were already three pubs in the town with \u0026lsquoto let\u0026rsquo signs up. But the board was told the fact other pubs were available to let was not relevant.  Rudy Fruzynski, East Lothian licensing standards officer, told the board he was happy to support the application, confirming that there had been no complaints about the operation of the Gardeners Arms since the Peters took over.  He added: \u0026ldquoIn recent times, the anti-social behaviour team has received a substantial complaint made by a resident in the area complaining about late-evening noise with persons congregating on Market Street and using nearby Cross Lane as a thoroughfare from High Street.  \u0026ldquoThis problem cannot be directly attributed to licensed premises on Market Street. It is more likely to be related to the make-up of the area as a whole, being a focal point for persons seeking the services of many different types of business that are open in the evenings, particularly at weekends.  The board unanimously approved the application, with a request from Police Scotland agreed for children under the age of 15 to vacate the new premises by 8pm and 16 and 17-year-olds to leave by 10pm.  A request from Police Scotland for outdoor drinking hours to be reduced from 9pm to 8pm was not supported by the licensing board as it conflicted with the current hours for the Gardeners Arms."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/6802523.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"earwigs-eat-into-coastal-car-park-profits","story":"  Calls have been made for a detailed review of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos parking charges policy at the county\u0026rsquos coastal car parks amid claims by opponents that once the costs had been taken away the entire scheme only made a profit of about \u0026pound6,000 in its second year.  And council official admitted that while the income from the charges was increasing year on year, it was not expected to come close to the \u0026pound300,000 included in the administration\u0026rsquos budget for this financial year, with an estimated gross income of \u0026pound238,000 predicted.  It was also revealed at a meeting of the council\u0026rsquos policy and performance review committee that the council pays the Earl of Wemyss one third of the income from Longniddry Bents car parks No 1, No 2 and No 3, on top of a \u0026pound10,000 lease, as the car parks are part of the Wemyss and March Estate.  Since the introduction of the charges in 2015, those three car parks have brought in just under \u0026pound75,000 in income.  In total, the money collected from the 10 coastal car park sites which charge since it was introduced has been \u0026pound343,212.45.  However, the cost of the scheme was questioned at the meeting.  East Lothian Council introduced a \u0026pound2-a-day charge for using the three Longniddry Bents car parks and those at Barn Ness, Gullane Bents, John Muir Country Park, Shore Road at Belhaven, Tyninghame Links, Whitesands and Yellowcraig in 2015.  The initial cost of introducing the scheme, which included ticketing machines, signs and introducing double yellow lines at various locations, was about \u0026pound900,000.  A further \u0026pound425,000 is earmarked to be invested this year in improving toilet facilities at the Longniddry car parks.  Season passes are available for \u0026pound40 a year and just under 3,000 are currently being used.  A report on the income from the car parks revealed that in its first year the scheme brought in \u0026pound98,795 with costs of \u0026pound4,977.  However, it said in its second year the gross income was just over \u0026pound169,000 while costs rose substantially to nearly \u0026pound94,000.  In the last financial year, gross income grew to \u0026pound188,000 while the costs were at about \u0026pound83,000.  Among the reasons given for the rise in costs were \u0026pound55,000 which is paid towards East Lothian\u0026rsquos private parking attendants and the cost of replacing machines which had been vandalised by people trying to break into them, as well as rental fees for the Longniddry car parks and payment to a private company which collects the money from the machines and provides IT access so they can be monitored.  Peter Forsyth, service manager with the council, said the cost of replacing four machines last year had been \u0026pound25,000 and he revealed there was an unusual bug problem.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have been affected by equipment failure due to bugs, earwigs and such, who like to nest in the equipment. They are not covered by our warranty.  Councillor Paul McLennan, who is part of the SNP Group which has opposed the car park fees from the start, said he estimated that, between costs of the scheme and interest generated from the initial loans, in its second year it would have made just \u0026pound6,000 profit.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe business case is not stacking up.  However, Jim Lamond, the council\u0026rsquos head of finance, said the scheme was never intended to make profits.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is not in the budget as an income-generating activity. It is in there for improving the coastal car parks and ultimately that has been done.  Councillor Jeremy Findlay (Con) said people in his ward in Gullane did not feel they were seeing improvement in facilities at their car park. He said: \u0026ldquoIt was sold to people as a way to invest in facilities and they are not seeing it.  However, Councillor John McMillan (Lab), cabinet spokesperson for economic development, said a review would have to take in the bigger picture.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt needs to look at the impact on economic development and benefits it is bringing into East Lothian as well.  The committee agreed to ask for a detailed review of the scheme."},{"url":null,"title":"delve-into-haddingtons-history-this-summer","story":"  An exhibition of the history of Haddington opened its doors at the John Gray Centre last week in the town as it celebrates 700 years since King Robert The Bruce awarded it a Royal Charter.  The collection looks at seven centuries of life in the town and was officially opened by Provost John McMillan who brought along a portrait of his grandfather, who shared his name and joined the army in 1918 as one of many underage young men keen to defend their country.  Mr McMillan said he hoped the exhibition would encourage people to explore their own family history and look into their ancestry.  The Bruce Charter, which is the oldest document held in the John Gray archives, is not on display during the exhibition because it has to be kept in conservation conditions, but people can view it during the archive\u0027s opening hours.  Some of the less ancient items were on display at the Haddington Show at the weekend when archivists from the centre set up a stall in the crafts tent.  There they displayed some old images from shows gone by and a book of the show\u0027s records from 1820.  Interestingly some of the family names in the nearly 200-year-old records were still well know in the communities.  Exploring themes such as royalty, religion, health, education, wartime and crime and punishment, the exhibition aims to bring stories from the archives to life.  Haddington was one of the most important towns in medieval Scotland, and even had a royal palace, the birthplace of King Alexander II.  One of the items on display is a sick note from Mary Queen of Scots \u0026ndash the Queen asks the burgh to excuse Philip Gibson from military service because he was too corpulent to ride his horse!  Other characters featured include Agnes Blaik and Elizabeth Golight, two ladies of ill repute who were accused of entertaining dragoons. Both were convicted \u0026ndash Elizabeth Golight in particular was named a \u0026lsquovicious strumpet\u0026rsquo by the court. They were sentenced to stand at the market cross with a paper announcing their crime attached to their clothes, and thereafter they were to be drummed out of the town.  In medieval Haddington crime certainly did not pay and punishments were harsh. Criminals could be sentenced to death and the burgh account books include costs for building the gallows and the purchase of ropes for executions.  Gallows Green (where Bellevue House stands) gets its name from being the place the gallows were situated, and there is evidence that hangings also took place from the Nungate bridge.  Punishments for lesser crimes were harsh and cruel \u0026ndash those caught stealing could be sentenced to a whipping by the hangman, banished from the burgh, branded with the town key, or have an ear nailed to the pillory post!  While much of the exhibition concentrates on the medieval period more modern topics including the Glasgow Overspill are featured.  In 1958 Haddington signed the first Overspill Agreement in Scotland with Glasgow which was bursting at the seams with a post war housing crisis while other parts of the country were sparse. Haddington Town Council agreed to provide 250 houses for Glasgow families, increasing the town\u0027s population by 20 per cent.  which would result in a 20% increase in population. The original Overspill Agreement is on display in the exhibition.  This exhibition offers a glimpse into the lives of the townspeople of the past, and tries to demonstrate the central role Haddington played in events of national significance. Seven Centuries of Haddington is on display until the end of September and is well worth a visit."},{"url":null,"title":"new-life-coming-for-pub","story":"  Officers were called to the Masons Arms on Belhaven High Street at 6.50am on March 31 following an undisclosed incident.

In April, Police Scotland asked East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board to review the pub\u0026rsquos licence and that of its manager Christopher Darling.  However, at a meeting last week, the board was told that Mr Darling had parted company with the pub owners and the premises was currently closed.  James Hughes, who currently runs Dunbar Golf Club, asked the board to consider transferring the licence to him as he revealed ambitious plans to invest \u0026pound50,000 in the business with a view to eventually taking ownership of the property.  Mr Hughes told the board that he was preparing to sign a five-year-lease of the pub with its current owner in a deal which would allow him to buy it at the end of the lease.  He said that there were plans to renovate the building to open it up more and make it a family-friendly site.  Mr Hughes told the meeting: \u0026ldquoWe plan to make it a good country food and beer premises.  \u0026ldquoIt is in an area steeped in history with [Belhaven] Brewery and a popular tourism area, and we want to turn it into a good welcoming family pub.  Mr Hughes, who has been at Dunbar Golf Club for several years, told the board he had more than 23 years of experience in the licensed trade and had worked in Edinburgh before moving to East Lothian.

Assembly host Bryden McKinnie, told the Courier, he received news from the Food Assembly UK operators on Friday afternoon that they were no longer operating in the UK.  The assemblies, which started in France, have been operating across the UK for five years.  They provide local hosts with the support to set up a website where local producers can offer their goods for sale and customers can browse online filling a \"shopping basket\" with products from a number of different companies.  They then collect all their shopping at one place on a set evening of the week.  The Haddington Assembly has held weekly collections at the Maitlandfield House Hotel since it began, with a wide range of local suppliers.  More than 1250 people have become members of the assembly in East Lothian but host Bryden said one of the issues to faced was building regular customers to make it sustainable.  He said of the 100 plus members only around 50 shop with any regularity and if the assembly was to continue in another form it was important to understand what stopped the other members from using it.  He said: \"It is difficult to sustain when you do not have a lot of regular shoppers, and this is a common thread among all the UK food assemblies.  \"We are talking to each other and looking at whether we can come up with a new way of operating, the announcement from the Food Assembly came as a shock and has really rocked everyone, but we are looking to the future.\"  The Haddington Food Assembly will stop at the end of this month.

The company, which provides a link to many of the Scottish islands from the mainland, dates back to 1851 and has become famous for the red and black funnel, complete with the Lion Rampant, on its ships.  Kit said: \u0026ldquoWe self-published it the first time and having, finally, persuaded him to write down all the stories I found a way of getting it published.  \u0026ldquoWe printed about 400 copies and the punchline is, despite him giving a few away, we got enough money back to cover the publication cost.  \u0026ldquoAs far as I know it is sold out \u0026ndash I have got a copy and so do both my sons but I think that is about it.  \u0026ldquoThe reason we published it in the first place was, certainly to us, the highly entertaining stories about MacBrayne.  \u0026ldquoThere was a lot in it about his army service and, after coming back to it after all those years, the reason for publishing it again was just to make sure those reflections on a way of life long gone did not die with him.

The other is a giant stainless steel mussel shell, depicting Musselburgh\u0026rsquos history, which was recently put in place at Murdoch Green.  Svetlana Kondakova and Maja Quille, graduates of Edinburgh College of Art, worked on \u0026lsquoMusselburgh Archer\u0026rsquo, a life-size bronze cast of an archer and 12 steel arrows which will create a trail around the town.  In a joint statement, they said: \u0026ldquoWe hope that the artwork will link the heritage of Musselburgh to the modern day, as well as providing an interactive element of activity for both locals and visitors with the trail.  The lifesize figure represents layers of local history including the Roman invasion in AD 80, the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh in 1547 and the Musselburgh Silver Arrow, which dates back to 1603 and is claimed to be the oldest sporting trophy in the world still competed for annually.  The artwork will be completed with a series of stainless steel arrows installed at different locations around Musselburgh. They are expected to be installed later this summer and will form a trail around the town to areas of cultural, historical, natural and community significance, supported by a Global Treasure App organised by Musselburgh Area Partnership.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoThis is a striking piece of art that represents so many aspects of local history. Residents of Musselburgh and visitors will no doubt appreciate this latest addition to the public art within the community.  Michael Johnson of Nottinghamshire created \u0026lsquoThe Mussel\u0026rsquo with input from local schoolchildren, and its installation was recently highlighted in the Courier. He has been making artworks for public places since 1991 and has now completed more than 180 commissions for both rural and urban sites throughout the UK and Ireland.  Mr Goodfellow added: \u0026ldquoThis is a work of outstanding beauty that truly complements the town and its cultural heritage.  East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos Arts Service formed a working group to select and commission artists to create the new public artwork. The group included representatives from Musselburgh Area Partnership, Musselburgh and Inveresk Community Council, Musselburgh Conservation society, East Lothian Council officers, councillors and other community representatives.  The artists were commissioned to undertake the work, which is being funded by Tesco with \u0026pound38,000 for each of the two sculptures, as part of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos Percent for Art Policy."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8046040.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"queen-named-ahead-of-dunbar-rnli-lifeboat-day","story":"  This year\u0026rsquos Lifeboat Queen is 14-year-old Beth Mackay, with attendants Mia Thomson, 11, and 12-year-old Anushka Demer.

Dunbar and East Linton ward member Councillor Norman Hampshire encouraged members of the public to go along and have their say.  He said: \u0026ldquoThere is a high demand for the parks that we have in Dunbar.  \u0026ldquoAs the town grows in size, we have got to make sure we make best use of every bit of green space that we have.  A proposed theme for the park would be to celebrate the varied geology of the county.  Information cairns and distance markers could be created around a circular path.  The creation of paths, additional trim trail equipment and the retention of the putting green are among the ideas highlighted, as well as a new football area with permanent goals.  However, potentially the most ambitious aspect of the scheme is the creation of a new pavilion with access to public toilets.  The potential of a pavilion comes after Winterfield Pagoda, which dated back to the 1920s, was torn down in March last year.  Capital investment could also be made in a tree shelter belt, rural parkour \u0026ndash or free-running \u0026ndash elements in timber and additional benches and seating.  Another major project could be the creation of \u0026ldquoa low-key but iconic \u0026lsquogateway\u0026rsquo feature which would welcome walkers off the John Muir Way and into the park. That would require special funding applications.  Stuart Gibb, area manager of Dunbar and East Linton Area Partnership (DELAP), said that consultation had already taken place with groups such as DELAP and the town\u0026rsquos community council, as well as various departments of East Lothian Council.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe area partnership is supporting the acknowledgement that the town is getting bigger.  \u0026ldquoFacilities and amenities need to be on the ball in terms of that growth to ensure that we have suitable and sustainable facilities moving forward."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7959603.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"lineker-tops-bbc-salary-list-dominated-by-men","story":"  The Match Of The Day host is the biggest earner, taking home between \u0026pound1.75 million and \u0026pound1,759,999.

Last year\u0026rsquos accounts showed the Radio 2 Breakfast DJ\u0026nbsptook home up to \u0026pound2,249,999 in the 12 months to April 2017 and his salary has been reduced since stepping down from Top Gear.  The top 10 published this year is made up of men, with Lineker and Evans followed by Radio 2 DJ Graham Norton, on up to \u0026pound609,999 \u0026ndash not including payments for his TV chat show.  The other big earners are also men \u0026ndash broadcasters Steve Wright,\u0026nbspHuw Edwards, Jeremy Vine, Alan Shearer, Nicky Campbell, Nick Grimshaw and Stephen Nolan.  The BBC argues that the list does not reflect the true balance of payments to men and women as salaries through BBC Studios,\u0026nbspwhich is not funded by the licence fee and became a commercial entity, are not revealed.  If included, they would feature payments to Claudia Winkleman for Strictly Come Dancing,\u0026nbsp Alex Jones for The One Show and Fiona Bruce for Antiques Roadshow.  It also says that changes to pay packets in recent months are also not reflected as the list is compiled from salaries up to April this year.  There are women on the list who did not appear last year.

Other female stars to appear this year include Newsbeat\u0026rsquos Tina Daheley, who was paid between \u0026pound150,000 and \u0026pound159,000, which also includes cover for BBC Breakfast and Victoria Derbyshire.

Backbencher Andrew Bridgen became the first Tory MP to declare that he has sent a letter of no confidence in Mrs May to the\u0026nbspchairman of the backbench\u0026nbsp1922\u0026nbspCommittee, Sir Graham Brady. Some 48 letters are required to trigger a vote.  Writing in The Sun, arch-Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg denounced the Chequers deal as \u0026ldquoa dud which \u0026ldquowill not deliver Brexit.  Mr Rees-Mogg, who chairs the European Research Group of Tory Eurosceptics, said Mrs May would have to U-turn on her plans or rely on Labour votes to force them through Parliament.  And he warned: \u0026ldquoA government that depends upon the opposition to get its business through is like the gingerbread man on the back of the fox crossing the river.\u0026nbspAt the end of the journey it gets eaten.  But former Conservative leader William Hague warned party rebels that voting against the Prime Minister\u0026rsquos final deal could result in Brexit being indefinitely delayed or halted altogether.  And Mrs May herself insisted that her plan \u0026ndash agreed by the Cabinet on Friday, only for David Davis and Boris Johnson to resign days later \u0026ndash would make good on her promise to deliver Brexit.  Set to be published in a white paper on Thursday, the plan envisages Britain continuing to trade freely with the remaining EU in goods under a \u0026ldquocommon rulebook, while accepting restrictions on trade in services.  Arriving at the Nato summit in Brussels, the Prime Minister said:\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos there because it delivers on the vote that people gave on Brexit, it delivers the fact that we will have an end to free movement, we will have an end to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in the UK, we won\u0026rsquot be sending vast contributions to the EU every year, we\u0026rsquoll be out of the Common Agricultural Policy, out of the Common Fisheries Policy.  \u0026ldquoWe deliver that Brexit and we do it in a way that protects jobs and livelihoods and meets our commitment to Northern Ireland.  Unnamed Brexiteers were quoted in the press as saying the PM should brace herself for \u0026ldquoguerrilla war to kill off her deal, with Eurosceptic Tories withholding their support in the Commons.  But leading Eurosceptic Bernard Jenkin played down the prospects of more walkouts from Mrs May\u0026rsquos administration.  \u0026ldquoFor the record \u0026hellip ERG is not expecting any further resignations, nor were we expecting any in the first place, said Mr Jenkin.  \u0026ldquoNor do we expect a leadership challenge. We are supporting Theresa for PM.  Lord Hague told BBC Radio 4\u0026rsquos Today programme that he did not think that a free trade agreement alone would solve the twin issues of keeping the Irish border open and keeping Northern Ireland in the United Kingdom.  He said: \u0026ldquoWhen it comes to a vote sometime around the end of this year, let us say that Theresa May has done a deal that bears some resemblance to what was put forward at Chequers with the EU.  \u0026ldquoIf anyone in the Conservative Party is then thinking about voting that down, that is the point at which they are going to endanger everything they have been trying to achieve.  \u0026ldquoThere is a whole range of scenarios in which they get no\u0026nbspBrexit, or an indefinitely delayed\u0026nbspBrexit, or a change of government or a second referendum.  Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns, a vocal critic of Mrs May, said it was time to \u0026ldquoput country first.  She told BBC Two\u0026rsquos Newsnight: \u0026ldquoI think if the Prime Minister makes further concessions with the EU then there will no doubt be more resignations from Brexiteers in the Cabinet, from junior ministers to PPSs, because there is only so much that you can give in a negotiation.  Tory former minister Mark Francois said a confidence vote in the PM was not the \u0026ldquoright thing to do.  But he warned he felt \u0026ldquovery strongly about the future of my country and said Tories had \u0026ldquoreal concerns about the direction of Brexit.

Samuel Pypes  Pepys, a regular at the royal court, recorded that King Charles II intended to set a new fashion with a \"vest\", which he would wear the next day.  While not quite a vest in the modern sense, the item as a departure from the frock cots popular at the time and is regarded as the first waistcoat.  Ms Behlen, added: \"Waistcoats were born in London in 1666, promoted by King Charles II. The new fashion soon spread and for at least 300 years a three piece suit soon formed a key part of every man\u0026rsquos wardrobe.\u0026nbsp  \"Now Watford-born Gareth Southgate is reviving that London tradition and bringing waistcoats home to the forefront of fashion.\"  Fashions change over time, and during the 1750s the garment was shortened to the length familiar to suit-wearers and sports fans today.  Since then it has been cemented into British culture the waistcoat, although has undergone slight alterations.\u0026nbsp  In the late 1800s it became popular to leave the bottom button undone, a fashion supposedly started by the courtiers who surrounded Edward VII, who was too rotund to do up his.\u0026nbsp  The garment also retains royal connections of a darker sort in Scotland, with Jacobites said to toast the \u0026nbsp\"wee gentleman in the velvet waistcoat\" \u0026nbsp- in reference to moles - because of William of Orange\u0027s death after falling from a horse which had tripped on a molehill.\u0026nbsp    William of Orange  A long-sleeved version of the waistcoat said to have belonged to Bonnie Prince Charlie, was featured by the National Museum of Scotland during last year\u0026rsquos Jacobites exhibition  But before fans of the England team get too carried away with making an icon out of Mr Southgate\u0027s wardrobe it should be remembered that the necktie - which no three piece suit should be without - was invented in Croatia.\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8051855.jpg?type=article-full","title":"catholic-church-calls-for-review-of-orange-order-routes-in-glasgow","story":"  Scotland\u0026rsquos Grand Lodge has already condemned what it called \u0026ldquobigoted actions when Canon Tom White was spat on, abused and threatened during a parade through the city\u0026rsquos east end on Saturday.

Fox\u0026rsquos sweetened bid is also around 30.2% higher than its original \u0026pound10.75-a-share bid made in December 2016, which valued the 61% stake at \u0026pound11.7 billion.  Its move signals that Fox hopes to see off competition from Comcast after a long battle to buy out Sky, which has come under heavy scrutiny from the UK Government and competition watchdogs.  Earlier this month, then UK culture secretary Matt Hancock said Fox would have to sell off Sky News in order to address media plurality concerns and secure Government approval for the deal.  Fox has already agreed to sell most of its assets \u0026ndash including its current 39% stake in Sky \u0026ndash to Walt Disney.  If Fox buys the remaining stake in Sky before completing the Disney deal, Disney would take full ownership of Sky when it closes its own takeover of the Fox assets.

Fox is waiting for a final decision from the UK Government on whether to accept its proposals over the sale of Sky News to address concerns over media plurality, given that the Murdoch family also owns News Corp \u0026ndash the publisher of a raft of UK newspapers.  Under its plans to offload Sky News to Disney, Fox has pledged to provide a Disney-owned Sky News channel with funding of at least \u0026pound100 million a year for 15 years.  But if terms of a sale of Sky News cannot be agreed, Mr Hancock has already told Parliament the \u0026ldquoonly effective remedy now would be to block the merger altogether.

Around 12.9 per cent of all claims in Aberdeen relating to parking bumps.  Commenting on the findings, Sabine Williams, head of motor at Admiral, said: \u0026ldquoParking prangs are common car insurance claims accounting for one in ten claims we deal with.  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore still a long way from self-parking vehicles and while things like parking sensors can assist with manouvering tight spaces and can reduce the risk of bumping into something as you park, they certainly aren\u0026rsquot fail safe and they aren\u0026rsquot in every vehicle.  \u0026ldquoOur advice to all drivers to avoid both PCNs and parking accidents is to try and plan where you will park in advance and to take your time when maneuvering into and out of parking spaces, especially in older car parks where the bays can be a tight fit for modern vehicles.  \u0026ldquoParking is a set maneuver on the driving test so all drivers should know how to park correctly, and safely but our advice to drivers to avoid getting into trouble when parking is to simply take their time."},{"url":null,"title":"bbc-earnings-to-be-published-for-a-second-year","story":"  BBC stars were able to see what their colleagues were paid when the corporation published salaries for 96 people last year.

On Wednesday, salaries will be revealed in bands of \u0026pound10,000 rather than last year\u0026rsquos \u0026pound50,000, after discussions with the Government over transparency.  The BBC is also publishing the detail of which programmes its stars have worked on, which it hopes \u0026ldquowill help ensure that more informed comparisons can be made,\u0026nbsp a BBC source said.  But many top earners will not be on the new list, or only a fraction of their salaries will be published, because stars paid through BBC Studios, which is not funded by the licence fee and became a commercial entity, are not revealed.  Its shows include big-hitters\u0026nbspTop Gear, Planet Earth II, Strictly Come Dancing, Doctor Who, Mrs Brown\u0026rsquos Boys, EastEnders, Casualty and The One Show.  The BBC recently apologised for underpaying Gracie, a situation which it said it had since \u0026ldquoput right.  Over the last 12 months, it has announced pay cuts for some of its male stars, including broadcasters John Humphrys, who was paid more than \u0026pound600,000, Jeremy Vine, who was on more than \u0026pound700,000 and Huw Edwards, on more than \u0026pound550,000.  This year, alongside publishing what people have earned over the year, the BBC will also publish a separate table setting out the levels of pay for 2018/19 showing totals of men and women in bands, taking account of pay revisions being made.  The BBC recently published figures showing it had reduced its gender pay gap by nearly a fifth.  A BBC source said: \u0026ldquoThe BBC has come a long way in a short period of time. The job is not done yet, but we are making good progress.  Radio 2\u0026rsquos Chris Evans topped the list on more than \u0026pound2 million last year, followed by Gary Linkeker, on more than \u0026pound1.7 million.  The highest paid woman was Claudia Winkleman on between \u0026pound450,000 and \u0026pound499,999.

Backbencher Andrew Bridgen became the first Tory MP to declare that he has sent a letter of no confidence in Mrs May to the\u0026nbspchairman of the backbench\u0026nbsp1922\u0026nbspCommittee, Sir Graham Brady. Some 48 letters are required to trigger a vote.  Writing in The Sun, arch-Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg denounced the Chequers deal as \u0026ldquoa dud which \u0026ldquowill not deliver Brexit.  Mr Rees-Mogg, who chairs the European Research Group of Tory Eurosceptics, said Mrs May would have to U-turn on her plans or rely on Labour votes to force them through Parliament.  And he warned: \u0026ldquoA government that depends upon the opposition to get its business through is like the gingerbread man on the back of the fox crossing the river.\u0026nbspAt the end of the journey it gets eaten.  But former Conservative leader William Hague warned party rebels that voting against the Prime Minister\u0026rsquos final deal could result in Brexit being indefinitely delayed or halted altogether.  And Mrs May herself insisted that her plan \u0026ndash agreed by the Cabinet on Friday, only for David Davis and Boris Johnson to resign days later \u0026ndash would make good on her promise to deliver Brexit.  Set to be published in a white paper on Thursday, the plan envisages Britain continuing to trade freely with the remaining EU in goods under a \u0026ldquocommon rulebook, while accepting restrictions on trade in services.  Arriving at the Nato summit in Brussels, the Prime Minister said:\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos there because it delivers on the vote that people gave on Brexit, it delivers the fact that we will have an end to free movement, we will have an end to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in the UK, we won\u0026rsquot be sending vast contributions to the EU every year, we\u0026rsquoll be out of the Common Agricultural Policy, out of the Common Fisheries Policy.  \u0026ldquoWe deliver that Brexit and we do it in a way that protects jobs and livelihoods and meets our commitment to Northern Ireland.  Unnamed Brexiteers were quoted in the press as saying the PM should brace herself for \u0026ldquoguerrilla war to kill off her deal, with Eurosceptic Tories withholding their support in the Commons.  But leading Eurosceptic Bernard Jenkin played down the prospects of more walkouts from Mrs May\u0026rsquos administration.  \u0026ldquoFor the record \u0026hellip ERG is not expecting any further resignations, nor were we expecting any in the first place, said Mr Jenkin.  \u0026ldquoNor do we expect a leadership challenge. We are supporting Theresa for PM.  Lord Hague told BBC Radio 4\u0026rsquos Today programme that he did not think that a free trade agreement alone would solve the twin issues of keeping the Irish border open and keeping Northern Ireland in the United Kingdom.  He said: \u0026ldquoWhen it comes to a vote sometime around the end of this year, let us say that Theresa May has done a deal that bears some resemblance to what was put forward at Chequers with the EU.  \u0026ldquoIf anyone in the Conservative Party is then thinking about voting that down, that is the point at which they are going to endanger everything they have been trying to achieve.  \u0026ldquoThere is a whole range of scenarios in which they get no\u0026nbspBrexit, or an indefinitely delayed\u0026nbspBrexit, or a change of government or a second referendum.  Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns, a vocal critic of Mrs May, said it was time to \u0026ldquoput country first.  She told BBC Two\u0026rsquos Newsnight: \u0026ldquoI think if the Prime Minister makes further concessions with the EU then there will no doubt be more resignations from Brexiteers in the Cabinet, from junior ministers to PPSs, because there is only so much that you can give in a negotiation.  Tory former minister Mark Francois said a confidence vote in the PM was not the \u0026ldquoright thing to do.  But he warned he felt \u0026ldquovery strongly about the future of my country and said Tories had \u0026ldquoreal concerns about the direction of Brexit.

In recent years, both businesses encountered challenges and delays on a number of development projects.The resulting additional costs, combined with difficult conditions in the sector and the wider challenges in the Aberdeenshire housing market, left the firms with reduced margins, significant levels of debt and a lack of funding to acquire new sites.Following an assessment of the immediate funding requirement, the directors determined they had no choice but to place both companies into administration to protect the creditors’ position as best as possible.

He later chaired AEA Technology and in 2004 took on the role of leading the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) which was responsible for decommissioning Dounreay.In 2008, the then local MP John Thurso asked Sir Anthony to chair Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership. He took on the role and says it has been \u0026ldquoan honour and a privilege to do it.\u0026ldquoI have enjoyed all my time here in my various jobs, he said. \u0026ldquoI do think the partnership has made a major contribution.\u0026ldquoTen years ago the mood was pretty depressed. People were very gloomy. I would say the mood now has changed and is pretty optimistic, although there are challenges. That will always be the case.\u0026ldquoThe big advantage we have here is that it will be a number of years before Dounreay is closed so we had an opportunity to plan for the future. If it had been a car plant it would have been closed in three months.Sir Anthony highlights positive developments such as the improvements at Scrabster and Wick harbours as well as the pioneering MeyGen tidal energy project and the Beatrice offshore wind farm.The North Coast 500 is also making an impact and bringing economic opportunities to the area. The Nucleus archive across from Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport is another plus for Caithness, he adds. Sir Anthony played a part in bringing the facility to the county during his time as chairman of the NDA.Engineering and environmental courses at North Highland College UHI can also help regenerate the Caithness economy. \u0026ldquoThere are real opportunities here, he declared.Improving infrastructure and transport links in the far north are key to helping the area\u0026rsquos economy. Good schools and hospitals are another factor.\u0026ldquoI think the partnership has made a real contribution in the last 10 years, Sir Anthony said. \u0026ldquoWe have worked with other agencies to help create around 1000 jobs over that time but we all had to work together to do it. I am very pleased to see progress being made.Sir Anthony feels it is important to make Caithness as \u0026ldquoattractive as possible for people to come and work in the area.\u0026ldquoThere are still issues to be addressed but, overall, I think significant progress has been made. We played a part but it has always been a contributory role. The partnership is an enabler. The Scottish government has said this area could be an example for other places to follow.Sir Anthony says there is an expertise at Dounreay which \u0026ldquoa lot of places would give their eye teeth to have and it could be used to help the local economy.Caithness strengths are its people, their skills and the natural beauty of the place, but access to the area needs to be improved.Asked about any disappointments during his time as chairman of the partnership, he replied: \u0026ldquoI hoped MeyGen would have got the Contract for Difference \u0026ndash it covers an agreement on the price for the electricity generated \u0026ndash from the UK government, but they did not. That was disappointing. They will now have to find another way forward but are looking at opportunities.Sir Anthony decided to retire as he felt 10 years as chairman was long enough. \u0026ldquoI wanted to leave before people wanted me to, he said. \u0026ldquoIt was time for a change.\u0026ldquoI am delighted with the choice of Ian Ross as my successor. I have had discussions with him and would be willing to help him in any way I can.Sir Anthony, who is 80, will keep a watchful eye on what is happening in Caithness and plans to stay active with his many other interests and hobbies. He enjoys opera, and swims five times a week.He started his career as a systems engineer with IBM in 1962 and went on to become its chief executive and chairman.Sir Anthony and his wife Jennie live in London and have a son, Paul, and a daughter, Caroline.Wednesday 11 Jul 2018 12:36 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Subsea 7 order hailed as very good news for Caithness","story":"A MULTIMILLION-pound order that has been won by Subsea 7 and will create up to 130 jobs was described yesterday as \u0026ldquovery good news for Caithness.The company has been awarded a contract by Shell for a development at its Penguins field which lies 150 miles north east of Shetland.Subsea 7, which has yards at Wester and Hastigrow, will build two pipeline bundles in Caithness as part of the deal.

Not only will this bring benefit to local bus users, who would otherwise be isolated in their communities, but it also has potential to benefit the tourist market, providing services to link with the Gills Bay ferry.However, she is concerned about the review in 12 months time and said: \u0026ldquoWe will be working with Stagecoach and the local community to see what can be done to promote usage of the route, and will also be discussing with public sector partners such as Highland Council to see what might be done to secure the route on a non-commercial basis in future.Bill Mowat, the chairman of Gills Harbour Ltd, claimed public pressure had an impact on Stagecoach and pointed out there was strong opposition to the plan.Wednesday 11 Jul 2018 12:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"July 10, 2018 at 4:27 pmThe story of a little girl from Orkney who lost her teddy bear has inspired Loganair to launch their own cuddly companions.

This could run into millions of pounds and put at risk the future viability of the business.The company have also met with local Orkney MSP, Liam McArthur, to express their concerns about the delay.As the start of this month, as Mr Matheson stepped into the shoes of the previous minister for transport Humza Yousaf, it was announced that lack of agreement between the Scottish Government and Pentland Ferries had led to no discounted fares being introduced in Pentland Firth ferry routes, by the Government\u0026#8217s self-set deadline of the end of last month.Andrew Banks, Managing Director and Owner of Pentland Ferries said: “We want these passenger subsidies implemented as soon as possible but we need to be 100 per cent sure that the scheme complies with state aid rules.  We have never had any subsidy from the government and even though this scheme gives money to the passenger, not the operator, the minister has told us that we would be liable for any repayment if at a future date the scheme is deemed illegal. This could run into the millions and could finish us off.“We cannot take that risk and we have a responsibility to our staff, our community and family to make sure the scheme works for everyone. We want to work with the Minister and his team to discuss a way forward so that we can all benefit from reduced fares. This scheme will be fantastic for our business, attracting more visitors to the islands and making it cheaper to travel to the mainland for residents. So we want this unlocked as soon as possible. We welcome the Minister’s willingness to gain a full understanding of the detail and very much hope to be able to meet him in Orkney soon.”The minister, Mr Matheson, was asked for a response to the comments from Pentland Ferries and Mr Banks. At the time he replied, Transport Scotland said the invitation had not yet been received so the minister could not comment.However, Mr Matheson did say: “The Scottish Government remains committed to delivering reduced ferry fares to the Northern Isles. I am conscious that there is a great deal of interest in this issue amongst users of the services. As I begin my new role as Transport Secretary, I want to ensure that I gain a full understanding of the detail — it is already very clear to me that planning to introduce reduced fares on the Northern Isles network has been a complex and challenging piece of work.“As a first step, we will cut fares on the Aberdeen-Lerwick and Kirkwall-Lerwick services from June 30. These reductions will be around 20 per cent for both passengers and cars.“On routes to Orkney, it has been necessary to engage with commercial operators on the Pentland Firth. We set out a very fair and reasonable proposal that would maintain competition, enabling them to protect their existing market share. Unfortunately, not all the commercial operators have felt able to agree to our proposals. This means we cannot currently implement reduced fares on any of the routes to and from Orkney without the risk of legal challenge.“This is both disappointing and frustrating, but I am determined to work through the issue to see what more can be done. I have asked Transport Scotland to undertake some further work to see what measures, if any, we can take. As part of that, we are willing to reopen talks with commercial operators.  I will provide a further update to stakeholders and to Parliament as soon as I can, with a view to bringing the full benefits of the scheme to the people of Orkney and Shetland.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This will help reduce the initial barrier of connection for a defined period of time.Two events are planned at the St Magnus Centre in Kirkwall, from 6pm to 8pm on Wednesday July 11 then from 10am to 12pm on Thursday July 12 with a further event at the Doubletree by Hilton, Glasgow Central, from 10.30am to 12.30noon on Friday July 13 and finally, a webinar will take place on Tuesday July 17 from 10am to 12pm.Registration is required for the Alternative Approach consultations via the following link: https://www.ssen-transmission/news-views/articles/2018/6/solving-orkney-s-catch-22/Commenting on the Alternative Approach consultation events, Lauren Milligan, commercial policy manager, said: “As a customer-driven initiative, stakeholder engagement has shaped the Alternative Approach proposal to date.“We want to ensure that we develop a solution that not only works for network companies but also the wider industry and other connection customers and would therefore encourage anyone with an interest in our proposed Alternative Approach trial to register for one of our consultation events.”The final stage of consultation is planned to take place in Autumn on the various components of the transmission reinforcement project in advance of submitting planning applications to the relevant planning authorities, the Scottish Government, Marine Scotland and Orkney Islands Council.The progression of the project is subject to all necessary planning consents and securing regulatory approval from industry regulator Ofgem, with the Alternative Approach trial also subject to regulatory approval.For more information on the proposed Orkney transmission reinforcement, including links to both consultation documents, click here.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It is likely that a further consultation will take place once specific options have been drawn up, giving all stakeholders a further opportunity to provide us with their views.“This means that final decisions will be made next year, rather than in September as first envisaged.

Each of the three winding barrels will have a small motor fitted, and a sensor, which will automatically detect when the clock has wound down to a certain level. In addition, the clock will also be fitted with a pendulum regulator, which will ensure the clock time is more accurate.Cathedral custodian Fran Hollinrake said: \u0026#8220It is the end of an era. It was always a great workout climbing the tower stairs and manually winding the clock, but it was just becoming too impractical with all our other duties. The clock will still be the clock, it will just have a couple of new bits added on.\u0026#8221The previous clock on St Magnus Cathedral dated from 1761, and was made by Hugh Gordon, a clockmaker in Aberdeen. But during the early 20th century, as part of the Sheriff Thoms bequest, a new timepiece was commissioned that would see the cathedral through the 20th century and beyond. The present clock was made when the world was at war, in 1915, although it was not actually installed until 1919, the same week that the Treaty of Versailles was signed that ended the First World War.James Ritchie and Son (Clockmakers) was founded in 1809, and the company specialised in large steeple and public clocks, both making and restoring. If you are familiar with Princes Street Gardens in Edinburgh, you will know the world-famous Floral Clock, not far from Waverley Station. It was made in 1903 by Ritchie\u0026#8217s, and was the first of its kind in the world.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

What you’ll need:              • 500g Canadian strong white bread flour (or a flour with a high gluten content, i.e. at least 14 per cent) • 30g lard or vegetable shortening • 10g sugar • 10g salt • 5g fast action yeast             • 400ml cold water For the Coating • 50g plain flour • 50g rice cones/flourView our STEP BY STEP GALLERY HERE            Method: 1 Rub the fat into the flour in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the sugar, salt and yeast. 2 Now pour in the water and mix until it is all incorporated. This is a wet dough but when you are using bread flour with such a high gluten content it can easily take that much water without becoming sloppy. 3 Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it for 1 minute until the dough has just become smooth with all the ingredients thoroughly combined. 4 With such a long ferment you don’t need to knead it too much. Put the dough back into the bowl and cover loosely with cling film. Put the bowl in the refrigerator to leave it to ferment for 12 – 16 hours.             5 The next morning combine the rice cones and plain flour for the coating. Take a large baking sheet and dust it liberally with the coating mixture (make sure to leave enough to coat the rolls). 6 Empty the dough on to a work surface which has been liberally dusted with the rice/flour coating mixture. This is where a large silicone spatula or scraper is useful. 7 Now using a dough scraper divide the dough into 8 pieces. Don’t worry if it is sticky or messy as these rolls aren’t supposed to look perfect. 8 Dust your fingers with the coating mixture and take each piece of dough, one at a time, and dip it into the coating mixture and place it on the baking sheet. They don’t need to be in the shape of a roll but try to keep in the air that is inside the dough. 9 Do this with each piece, placing them near to each other so that when they rise they will bake together. Despite the stickiness of this dough the coating mixture works wonders for stopping the dough from sticking to everything. Leave them to rise for 1 – 2 hours or until doubled in size. 10 Bake in a 250˚C preheated oven on a high shelf for 15 – 20 minutes or until the tops are dark. The rolls should be well fired for the right flavour.• Recipe submitted by Fraser Wright Read more: The history of morning rolls, including a recipe for making your ownRead more: A history of the square sausage, including a recipe for making your own"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4766638.1531226348!/image/image.jpg","title":"brian monteith may must resign and be replaced by true brexiteer","story":"        Are we witnessing the beginning of the end of Theresa May\u0026#8217s premiership? With genuine disappointment, I have to say I hope so.                The resignation of David Davis and Steve Baker on Sunday, then Boris Johnson on Monday suggests if not the end then the beginning of the end. Why has it come to this?            There are those who have been quick to say how they are glad to see the back of Davis and especially Johnson, arguing they have not been up to their jobs.             In respect of Davis, I think that is highly disingenuous having created the Department for Exiting the EU and putting him in charge of it, the Prime Minister then progressively emasculated him on developing the policy required to ensure “Brexit means Brexit”, leaving him with only the parliamentary process to oversee.Davis was being treated abominably while she surrounded herself with Brexit-hating advisors Olly Robbins and Gavin Barwell, who were given the role Davis should have been delivering. Robbins and Barwell are not accountable – but as the Prime Minister’s trusted officials, the buck stops with her.READ MORE: Brian Monteith: Brexit no longer means BrexitJohnson was ill-suited to the role of Foreign Secretary, and it showed, but is not the buffoon some allege. A good Mayor of London (as his successor Sadiq Khan is demonstrating) Boris is far more able and thoughtful than given credit for, but discretion is not in his armoury.             A crowd pleaser for many Conservatives, he should have been moved to the role of party chairman, where he could have raised morale and gone on the political offensive – rather than being offensive to our allies and enemies alike.It was Johnson, however, who stood up to the Prime Minister before last October’s Tory party conference when she was already deviating from her own promises to take us out of the Single Market and Customs Union and Johnson who would throw his weight in Cabinet when others would not speak up.Now, with Davis and Johnson gone – and Michael Gove going rogue by being the first to ditch his colleagues and being all things to everyone – who will speak up to make Theresa May be true to her word? The reason May’s premiership has descended into chaos is, like so many of our political leaders, she said she would do one thing and then did the exact opposite.             She has broken the trust that people placed in her and must reap the consequences.READ MORE: No-deal Brexit ‘would clear Scottish supermarkets of food in two days’Over the last year, she has conspired to betray her own party and many who held their noses and voted Tory for the first time or voted “leave” and thought she would deliver Brexit.By repeatedly saying over and over again that we will leave the Single Market and Customs Union and be outside the jurisdiction of the European Courts of Justice, she has been believed as being as good as her word.To now try and pass off the UK remaining in the Single Market for only goods and foods and accept “common rules” is to use weasel words. What we shall be accepting is the whole EU rule book, the Acquis Communautaire, meaning we shall not be free to make our own rules and, as a direct result, not be able to establish trade agreements with the US, Australia, China and others.             One example of what this means is we shall not be able to prevent live animals being exported for slaughter, a horrible practice the EU insists on keeping. There will now be countless other bad laws we cannot change.The Prime Minister’s Chequers policy will unravel, for the EU will use it as the starting point to demand further concessions. Why have a referendum, why put pledges in manifestoes, only to ignore them? Theresa May has brought this chaos on herself and the only way to correct it is for her to hand over to someone who believes in Brexit and keeps their word."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4766840.1531245886!/image/image.jpg","title":"henry mcleish scots need to ditch anyone but england attitude","story":"        Obsession with the \u0026#8216Auld Enemy\u0026#8217 is a distraction and Scotland must focus on creating its own team of footballing world-beaters, writes former first minister Henry McLeish.                Tonight, the World Cup semi-final between England and Croatia will attract record-breaking TV audiences, not only in England but in every part of the United Kingdom. For Scots, given our long memories of epic struggles with England on and off the pitch, who will we be supporting?            This has been an unpredictable and enjoyable World Cup, where Russia and Fifa have exceeded my expectations and have delivered a spectacular reminder of what the beautiful game represents. But England’s role in this festival of football, has, for Scots, always to be seen through the prism of history, identity, nationalism/patriotism, politics and yes, the irritating, arrogant and overblown remarks of English football commentators!            But let’s not overlook the major issue in this discussion – Scotland didn’t qualify for Russia. We haven’t qualified for 20 years, so our ambiguity and ambivalence towards England, is understandable in historical terms but irrelevant to our immediate and dire predicament as a declining football nation.England’s progress in the competition has benefitted from a very easy group stage, but no one should underestimate the improvements made under Gareth Southgate. England has done well so far and have never had a better chance to reach the final. If Scots want to support them, that’s okay by me, but I will retain my neutrality and hope that the best team wins, preferably without a penalty shoot-out. You can’t transfer your football loyalties, but you can certainly give praise where it is deserved. We need to learn from other countries, not resent what they are doing. It makes little sense for Scots to adopt the attitude “anyone but England”! Winning the World Cup is the “landing on the moon” moment for any footballer and their country. If Harry Kane is asked next Sunday to step up and accept the trophy as World Champions. What a fantastic achievement that would be and “well done England”.Our football relationship with the “Auld Enemy” goes back a long way. It is now time to recalibrate, move on and focus instead on our own dismal international football performance. This should be the focus of our anger, frustration, and national despair. We have wasted too much emotional energy on England and its football team over the years. Too often in the past our football rivalry has become a vehicle for the worst excesses of being Scottish. At a time of rapid modernisation, political renewal and a new sense of national confidence, there are bigger priorities.READ MORE: Scotland ‘could host World Cup 2030 matches as part of joint UK bid’On a recent visit to Inverness to deliver a talk on Brexit – another product of delusion, nostalgia, and sentiment on the part of England – I stopped to have a cup of coffee on the battlefield on Culloden Moor. This is always a good venue to charge batteries, not in any nostalgic nationalist way, but merely to enjoy a great historic place to reflect, in what is a strangely peaceful part of Scotland.            In 1746 Culloden was the last battle ever fought on British soil. The Jacobites were routed and destroyed by the Hanoverians in the same time it takes to play the first half of a Scottish Premier League game. Accepting a bit of historical license, let’s read Scotland versus England for Jacobites versus Hanoverians. So much historic and emotional capital has been invested in our games with England. This is not to say these historic clashes – with crowds we can now only dream about – didn’t matter. The fixture between Scotland and England was played annually between 1872 and 1983. In the early days of the game, after the SFA was created in 1873, the Scotland vs England match made a great deal of sense. These were the first two countries to form associations. Some of the games were spectacular battles, providing some magnificent football and some of the highest attendances ever seen in world football – ten of the largest attended games, attracted nearly 1.5 million fans at Hampden. But its importance, to Scottish football, was past its sell by date. In my view the Home Championship and the Scotland-England fixture – covering over a century of football – had become a major distraction for a country that needed to invest more in European and International football, direct the patriotism and nationalism of Scotland to bigger ambitions, and call time on a fixture that seemed to be more than just a football match. Defeating the Auld Enemy – not always guaranteed – became an obsession and a major distraction. It made sense for this fixture to be abandoned in 1983. I also enjoyed my own piece of nostalgia that day, thinking back to 1967 when Celtic won the European Cup and Scotland defeated England at Wembley where Jim Baxter tormented the English team, only a year after they had won the World Cup. Football memories are especially precious in a country where we seem to have stopped dreaming about future glory and have instead to content ourselves with arguing about who we should support in Scotland’s absence. We must get the Ghost of England Past off our back.READ MORE: Euphoria to defeat: the untold story of Scotland’s 1978 World Cup            Success can have a spectacular impact. I was enthused and inspired by the reaction of England to their victory over Sweden. Nearly half the population of their country watched on TV, it was party time and a nation celebrated the success of their team. The pride, passion and patriotism of a nation expressed through football was remarkable. But I wanted it to be Scotland. Why were we not there I kept asking myself? We think we have better fans than the English, so what if it had been Scotland clinching a penalty shoot-out or scoring a spectacular last-minute goal, what might our reaction have been?Everyone would have been glued to their TV screens, the country would have come to a standstill, and there would have been an incredible outpouring of national pride and that sense of achievement only success on the world stage can bring. This is the reality that should fire our desire for the transformation of the game in Scotland. Scotland has the potential to be successful. It has nothing to do with the size of population. It has nothing to do with England. It has everything to do with the size of our ambition and the determination to make the national team – both male and female – our number one priority.Our preoccupation with beating England, and on many occasions, hating England, may have been at the expense of investing more emotional capital and national fervour in other directions. Our football, like our politics, has too often seen England as an historical focus for our weaknesses and opprobrium, not our strengths and ambition.For 20 years and five World Cups, we have failed to qualify. We are fading fast from the minds of the international footballing community. This is not acceptable, neither is it inevitable. This crisis is home grown. The founding fathers of this great game must be turning in their graves, as we squander the legacy of the early years, ignore our undoubted football DNA, and replace the golden age of Scottish football, from the 60s to 90s, with decline, lesser ambitions for our national teams and a failure to take responsibility for what we are doing. The advent of devolution and the growth of nationalism have shifted some of our energy, enthusiasm, and passion for the game, away from football and in to politics. The time when nationalism was worn on the back of a football jersey is over. But hopefully we haven’t bought into the idea that the present state of the game is all we can expect. Scotland was a successful footballing nation with a self-belief that created so many legends and beautiful memories. Agonising over England isn’t going to solve our football problems but winning the World Cup might!"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4766791.1531292198!/image/image.jpg","title":"maggie chapman scots radicalised by indyref are ditching neo liberalism","story":"        The politics of SNP are, as might be expected from a \u0026#8216national\u0026#8217 party, representative of politics more broadly, both in Scotland and throughout Western Europe. We are at a point of rupture between neo-liberal consensus and several competing programmes for the future.                In 2014, the SNP-led Scottish Government produced a white paper that set out a vision of continuity: an independent Scotland would be slightly better in every regard than a devolved Scotland, but would not be in any way different (we would keep the monarchy, Sterling, the dominant economic model etc). As such, it was a manifestation of the dominant politics of that period: all changes proposed were in continuity with the prevailing system rather than seeking to change it.            It now appears that this was one of the final acts of that period of neo-liberal consensus: the Scottish independence referendum opened up a new, radically different space for politics in which the old certainties had truly melted into air.             A referendum that was supposed to change nothing but the constitutional status of Scotland appears to have changed everything but the constitutional status of Scotland. We have ended up with an ever more energised public making their opinions felt on issues as diverse as fracking and the renewal of local democracy. READ MORE: Nicola Sturgeon: Growth Commission report candid about indy challengesAn SNP Government most comfortable managing a neo-liberal consensus has been pushed into all sorts of uncomfortable positions as the rupture in our politics opens up the earth beneath them.In the last couple of years, I have found Gramsci’s analysis that “the old world is dying, the new world cannot yet be born” becomes truer by the day. And this brings us to the Growth Commission: it is an attempt at reclaiming ideological space, and the commander of this political venture in revanchism is former SNP MSP, Andrew Wilson.It is hard to separate Wilson the author of the Growth Commission from Wilson the PR man at Charlotte Street Partners, whose company’s clients include the fracking firm, Cluff Natural Resources. In the SNP, as in our politics more generally, we see a contest between the dying ways of the old world and the attempt to create a new world.            We are familiar, whether we know it or not, with the way in which neo-liberalism weaves its story: things that are opinions become truth things that are possible become impossible choices are constrained before the debate has even begun. As Noam Chomsky outlined in The Common Good: “The smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion, but allow very lively debate within that spectrum.” It is telling, therefore, that Wilson’s attempt to recapture the ideological direction of the independence movement has not been accepted as an unproblematic truth but has been cast into the public realm for debate.The first victory for the radical independence movement has been to deny this report the veneer of being uncontested. That Nicola Sturgeon was unable to accept the report but had to insist that it was “starting a debate” shows how far politics has come since the White Paper in 2014.             READ MORE: Growth Commission is ‘second biggest mistakes of Nicola Sturgeon’s career’It is important that we recognise and claim this victory and use it to start building our own project for an independent Scotland that creates a new world of genuine equality and social justice, and in which we deal with the urgent economic and environmental crises.Predicting what will happen in politics is a mug’s game. But, there is the strong likelihood that there will be an independence referendum soon. We need to take Nicola Sturgeon at her word: the Wilson report must start a debate. The approach we took in the first referendum since devolution charts a course for this. Ideas like Universal Basic Income, the creation of an industrial strategy to create a zero-carbon economy, and the case for a Scottish currency have become widely accepted in the popular imagination. We need to build on these and develop new ideas to shape the debate and make the case for an independent socialist Scotland.            Our focus must be on ways to harness Scotland’s renewable energy industry for social good, and to democratise the economy. The Scottish National Investment Bank should capitalise renewables projects for all public bodies. We should give workers the right to buy their own businesses to be run as cooperatives. We must build new housing to end the housing crisis to be owned through councils and cooperatives. We must find ways to create a publicly owned, zero-carbon public transport system that makes the most of the shift to electric vehicles and automation. And, we must have a debate that brings these ideas and others into the public imagination. I was proud of the role Green ‘Yes’ forces played in helping to create this debate in the referendum four years ago. And I will ensure that it does the same thing in the next referendum.• Maggie Chapman is co-convener of the Scottish Green Party and rector of Aberdeen University.

As the economic, political and cultural power of China grows, the prominence of Chinese is also growing.                 Many cities, including Edinburgh, are training guides and providing signage in Chinese in order to be ‘China ready’. British business is also starting to realise that being ready to trade overseas will in future mean being ready to speak Chinese to China.            But, given the average Brit’s unwillingness to learn any foreign language, it is perhaps unsurprising that there are few confident non-heritage Chinese speakers in Britain and opportunities to learn Chinese in school are limited.             In Scotland, students were first able to sit Chinese exams in 2009, yet in 2017 only 144 did so. We must do better than that.In Edinburgh, we are doing our bit. In partnership between my school and two state schools and with generous funding from the Swire Chinese Language Foundation, we’ve established the Swire Chinese Language Centre Edinburgh (SCLCE) to extend opportunities for pupils to study Mandarin Chinese from primary school to Higher exams.\u2028READ MORE: Boom in Scotland’s Chinese tourism market revealed by Nicola Sturgeon in BeijingIn the past, too many Chinese learning schemes have struggled on account of a lack of long-term commitment. You can’t expect pupils to commit to learning Chinese unless their school can guarantee that they will be able to take at least a Higher in Chinese and that their path through to the examinations will be well resourced and supported by high-quality teachers. That is exactly what the Swire Centre does – and it also provides a rigorous system of leadership and quality-assurance, something that can be difficult to achieve where Chinese teachers are working in isolation and often in part-time roles. In all, the SCLCE can call on five Scottish trained and fully registered teachers and at any one time at least three of those will be teaching in state schools in Edinburgh. In the last academic session, more than 600 pupils across 12 different state schools have benefited from this approach.We’re proud that our latest recruit to SCLCE, Brooke Walker, was recognised by the General Teaching Council for Scotland last month as one of their National Probationers of the Year. Brooke is employed by George Watson’s College but she spent her time during her probationary year in five state schools – two primary and three secondary – where her enthusiasm and passion helped to spread opportunities to learn Chinese where they did not previously exist.READ MORE: Study reveals details of first Chinese citizen who became a Scotsman            Amongst those to benefit most have been pupils facing some huge challenges in their lives and who have previously found foreign language learning unrewarding. Chinese is different and pupils engage with it differently, helped by opportunities to experience elements of Chinese literature, music, dance and cuisine. And soon a fully-funded visit to Beijing that Brooke is helping to lead will expand pupils’ horizons in new and exciting ways.Whatever the future holds it is difficult to imagine that China will not have an influential voice in shaping it. We must do all we can to understand that voice and, what is more, to grasp this opportunity to place a non-European culture at the centre of young people’s educational experience for the first time in our educational history. There’s no excuse for our schools not to be “China ready”.Melvyn Roffe is principal of George Watson’s College, one of the three schools to establish a collaboration to secure funding and set up The Swire Chinese Language Centre Edinburgh"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4766842.1531290621!/image/image.jpg","title":"nicola sturgeon boris may just have paved way for softest brexit","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...        The resignations of Boris Johnson and David Davis make the least-damaging form of Brexit more likely, writes First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.                The twin resignations of David Davis and Boris Johnson are the first time in more than 35 years that two UK Cabinet ministers have walked out within the same 24 hours. The last time it happened, the UK was grappling with the Falklands crisis.            That fact alone is a measure of how serious the situation facing the Prime Minister now is.            But the truth is, Monday’s events were always on the cards – it was just a question of when, and which of the Brexiteers would finally break ranks.That it happened within not much more than 48 hours of the Chequers summit, which was finally supposed to have brought unity to a warring cabinet, shows how perilous the position is for Theresa May.Before examining what this means for Brexit, it is worth recounting the fact that we are now more than two years on from the referendum result, but the UK Government has still not published the white paper outlining what it actually wants in leaving the EU. That will finally emerge later this week, unless more unforeseen events delay it further still.But that two-year delay in spelling out any kind of coherent position is simply inexcusable. The truth is that Brexit has always been more about the internal politics of the Tory party than it has been about the national interest.First of all, it was about the Conservatives’ attempt to see off the supposed threat from UKIP, and then, since the referendum, it has been about the ongoing battle of ideological purity within Tory ranks, as many of their MPs have sought to outbid each other in who can call for the most extreme Brexit possible.            READ MORE: Second Brexit vote in 2019 possible, says article 50 authorThe last two years have been, in some ways, the culmination, or at least the latest and perhaps defining chapter, of a 40-year civil war within the Conservative party.But that internal obsession, in putting party interest ahead of the national interest, is a simply unforgiveable abdication of responsibility for any government.The irony is that, for all the talk of Brexit being betrayed, the UK Government is still determined to take the UK as a whole out of the EU, the single market and the customs union. Scotland, of course, voted for none of these things.            I believe the Chequers plan is a step forward in that it appears to offer more realism than we have heard from the UK Government to date, although that may not be saying much. And, of course, we still do not know whether or not as a package it would be acceptable to the EU, in that it still appears to be cherry picking, trying to divide the four freedoms which are the cornerstones of the single market.It is also horrendously complicated and, of course, it excludes provision for services, which account for almost 80 per cent of the Scottish economy, and a similar proportion of the UK economy as a whole. Around a third of our exports are services exports, so while the plan is a step forward from where Theresa May and her Cabinet were a couple of weeks ago, it is nowhere near good enough to protect all our vital economic interests. An extreme Brexit, of the kind threatened by the Tories, also poses a direct threat to Scotland’s long-term economic well-being for many decades to come in the shape of the risk it poses to our working-age population.That threat is one that hangs over the whole of the UK, but the differing demographics of Scotland mean that it is more true of the Scottish economy. Immigration is a subject that may be difficult for politicians to talk about, but it is one that we have a duty to be honest with people about, because the simple fact is that we need to continue to attract the best and the brightest talent from elsewhere. That is an economic imperative for Scotland, but is something that is directly threatened by Brexit.READ MORE: No-deal Brexit ‘would clear Scottish supermarkets of food in two days’            Some commentators have speculated that the events of recent days have raised the prospects of a no-deal Brexit, whereby the UK crashes out of the EU next March with no agreement at all to take its place.However, looking at the arithmetic in the House of Commons, I do not believe there is a parliamentary majority for a no-deal outcome. And I also think that after the Davis and Johnson resignations it is highly questionable whether there is a majority for the Chequers plan as it stands.In my view, the only thing that actually stands a realistic chance of commanding a majority in the House of Commons, as well as being the right thing for the interests of the economy, is continued membership of the single market and customs union. I have been consistent in saying that I do not want to leave the EU, in line with what people in Scotland voted for, but if the UK is to leave then the least worst outcome is one that keeps us in a single market which is around eight times bigger than the UK market alone.That is supported by practically all mainstream economic analysis. And it is significant that in recent days we have started to see more and more businesses speak out about the very real threat which Brexit poses to jobs, investment and living standards right across the UK.There is now a chance, I believe, that the events of this week will help pave the way for the least damaging Brexit. That was not the intention of David Davis or Boris Johnson in resigning, but it may yet be their legacy."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4767027.1531300954!/image/image.jpg","title":"nato summit uk to send 440 additional troops to afghanistan","story":"        Theresa May is to commit 440 additional British troops to the Nato mission in Afghanistan amid pressure from Donald Trump for European allies to contribute more to their collective defence.                The US president set the tone for his attendance at the two-day alliance summit starting on Wednesday in Brussels with a typically combative tweet reminding the Europeans that the US spent “many times more” on their defence than any other alliance member.            “Not fair to the US taxpayer,” he wrote, “Nato countries must pay MORE, the United States must pay LESS. Very Unfair!”            His intervention is likely to increase nervousness among European and Canadian leaders about Mr Trump’s commitment to the alliance and the wider international following the acrimonious break-up of the G7 summit in Quebec in June.Ahead of the gathering, Mrs May was keen to emphasise that as well as supplying additional troops for Afghanistan, the UK was one of just five alliance members to meet the target of spending 2 per cent of GDP on defence.“The alliance can rely on the UK to lead by example, not just in meeting the 2 per cent pledge but by contributing our cutting edge capabilities to operations around the world,” she said.READ MORE: Politicians urge Nicola Sturgeon to join Donald Trump protests“In committing additional troops to the Train Advise Assist operation in Afghanistan we have underlined once again that when Nato calls the UK is among the first to answer.”            The extra troops, from the Welsh Guards, will bolster the UK-led Kabul Security Force which provides protection for Nato civilian staff engaged in capacity-building programmes in Afghanistan, as well as mentoring Afghan forces in the capital.They will begin deploying in August with a second contingent to follow in February taking the total UK military presence in the country to 1,100.In a momentous week for Anglo-US relations, Mr Trump will follow his attendance at the Nato summit with his first visit as president to Britain before going on to hold talks with Vladimir Putin in the Finnish capital Helsinki.His willingness to meet the Russian president unnerved some in the diplomatic community at a time when Mrs May has been seeking to isolate Moscow over the Salisbury nerve agent attack on ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, which has since claimed the life of 44-year-old Dawn Sturgess.            The president also ruffled feathers with decidedly undiplomatic remarks before leaving Washington, saying Britain was in “turmoil” and that it was “up to the people” whether they wanted to keep Mrs May as Prime Minister.He also suggested he could find time to talk to his “friend” Boris Johnson, who has just rocked the Government with his bombshell resignation over Mrs May’s Brexit plans, and that he would find it easier dealing with Mr Putin than America’s European allies.READ MORE: MPs say immigration review should consider devolution of powers“So I have Nato, I have the UK, which is in somewhat turmoil. And I have Putin. Frankly, Putin may be the easiest of all”, as he and his wife Melania prepared to board the Marine One presidential helicopter on the White House lawn.Mrs May, for her part, insisted that she was looking forward to meeting the president, both in Brussels and when she hosts him in the UK.            “There’s much for us to discuss.“As you know, the special relationship we have to the United States is our longest and deepest defence and security relationship, so we will be talking about those issues but also talking about trade issues,” she told a press conference to mark the end of the Western Balkans summit in London.“There are particular issues between the EU and the United States because of the trade tariff issue at the moment, when he imposed those tariffs on steel and aluminium and the EU responded.“We will be talking positively about how we can continue to work together in our special relationship for the good of people living in the UK and the United States and, actually, for the wider good.”"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

Despite a brave and thrilling attempt, resulting in an 11-point victory, realistically the overall result was never really in doubt.\n The Shetland swimmers, led by triple record-breaker Jasmin Smith, once again defeated their hosts by nearly 20 points.\nSuperiority in the water is now a regular occurrence in inter-counties, and the days when Orkney maintained a stranglehold on that event have been confined to distant memory.\nPart of the reason for the continued success could well be the number of swimming clubs around the isles, with Shetland, Lerwick, Delting, South Mainland, Whalsay and the West Side all competing for honours.\nRegular events in Shetland could be just as important as the trips to the mainland, as it helps to forge the competitive element necessary in the inter-county.\nThe only disciplines in which Orkney were successful this year were hockey and netball, where apart from school tournaments in the latter there is no recognised league structure here.\nHuge credit is due to the swimmers and their coaches, and also the many others who put in so much time and effort at the other sports involved in the Stuart Cup.\nHere’s hoping that the hockey and netball contestants will not have long to wait for their own success.\n: : : : : : : :\nOn the subject of hockey, mention needs to be made of former goalkeeper Sarah Couper who is now a qualified A grade umpire.\nShe travelled away last weekend to take charge of two international matches and is off to Swansea today to umpire a home international masters game.\nThis is the pinnacle of officiating in hockey and should be seen as a fine achievement both Couper and the sport in Shetland, which faces the perennial battle for getting a new playing surface.\n: : : : : : : :\nCongratulations are due to the Lerwick Spurs football team which is now through to the fourth round of the Highland Amateur Cup.\nSpurs defeated Ness from the Western Isles 3-0 at Dornoch on Saturday and now face Caithness side Staxigoe in the last-16 clash.\nIt was the first of two successes against a team with the same name in three days and no hangovers were obvious as they returned and picked up an important victory over Ness United in the local premier league on Monday.\nThe other Ness may not mean much to the average Shetland football follower, but some may know it was the club that Angus Murray represented for a long time.\nMurray, who played for Lerwick Thistle for a couple of seasons in the mid-1980s while working at the town’s Co-op, commented on Facebook this week that it was the “wrong half of Lerwick but well done Spurs”.\nHe continued: “The competition is in the doldrums and in need of new talent.

Maybe he intends to have a deletion mark added on top of the offending image?\nApparently, Gary Lineker of all people has jumped to Sterling’s defence, claiming it is “weird, unpatriotic and sad” for him to be criticised by the media in such a way prior to the World Cup.\nI’m sorry, but it’s not the fault of newspapers that Sterling appears to be lacking in grey cells.

It’s a crass act by Sterling and just as daft a move by those who support him.\n: : : : : : : :\nTo end on a more postitive note, surely cyclist Chris Froome has to be one of the UK’s best ever sports performers.\nThe way he destroyed the field to secure the recent Giro d’Italia, the third Grand Tour title he currently holds along with the Tour de France and the Vuelta a España, was incredible.\nSadly this country has not really taken to Froome, otherwise he would have surely already been a recipient of the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award.\nIf he wins another Tour de France this year, which would be his fifth victory, it would be a travesty if he didn’t receive the personality trophy.\nBarring Harry Kane scoring a hat trick in the final and lifting the World Cup for England next month, which I can’t really see happening, hopefully this will be Froome’s year at last.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"kia pro ceed ","story":"3dr Kia pro-ceed sr7, 4 year warranty remaining, one owner, full Kia service history, VGC inside \u0026amp out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 20 ","story":"As I write this all the teams have played at least one match at the World Cup, with hosts Russia and Uruguay becoming first to qualify for the last 16 from group A.\nOn the whole it has been a decent tournament so far, helped by a few shocks along the way and some memorable goals, although perhaps the less said about the commentary and punditry the better.\nFew would have expected Germany to lose to Mexico, or Argentina to be held by Iceland. One of the most remarkable performances in the latter game came from Kari Arnason, recently deemed not good enough by Aberdeen but still able to do a pretty fair job on shackling Lionel Messi.\nThe introduction the Video Assistant Referee system, or VAR as it is commonly known, has caused a few talking points. There was the decision to allow Diego Costa’s first goal for Spain against Portugal, and also to award penalties to France and Sweden against Australia and South Korea respectively.\nThese “assistants” are apparently not even at the game. They are sitting in a office somewhere in Moscow, but bizarrely kitted out in full referees’ uniform!\nWhy on earth they didn’t disallow Switzerland’s equaliser against Brazil is beyond me, however. Everyone seemed to notice Steven Zuber’s push on his marker before making room for himself to head the ball home.\nEveryone that is except the boys in black in Moscow. The ITV panellists were unanimous in their opinion that the goal should have been ruled out. Even Roy Keane, who used to think decapitation was just about permissable, appeared to agree with the others.\nOkay, so we will mention the commentary and punditry. Apart from Keane and Slaven Bilic – I loved it when he said he couldn’t really care less about whether the Swiss leveller should have been allowed or not – there is really no-one who comes with an opinion which makes you think.\nMost of the time they are prattling on about how far England are likely to go, even when the focus is on an entirely different group. And surely it is high time Gary Lineker was pensioned off. His pathetic attempts at puns, which could have been written by a five-year-old, had their day a long time ago.\nMeanwhile in our office “World Cup Sweepstake”, which requires the entrant to basically predict the results all the way through the competition, things aren’t going too badly. Despite obviously getting the Argentina/Iceland and Germany/Mexico games wrong, plus a few others, I remain in contention on the leaderboard.\nSo what about the last 16? I will still stick with the Germans and Argentinians as surely they must improve. My line-up is: Russia v Portugal, Spain v Uruguay, France v Argentina, Croatia v Denmark, Brazil v Sweden, Belgium v Japan, Germany v Switzerland and Senegal v England.\n: : : : : : : :\nThere has already been a healthy entry for our competition to name Shetland’s greatest football team of the past 60 years, but potential selectors still have a week and a half to make their minds up.\nThe main prize, a return trip for two people with car and cabin courtesy of NorthLink Ferries, is definitely not to be sneezed at. And there are also leather footballs from Cee \u0026amp Jays Intersport for the runners-up.\nSo whether you are a subscriber to the theory that the best players all hung their boots up decades ago, or you believe the standard of today is much better than yesteryear, get your thinking caps on and have a look at the details above. If the price of a stamp puts you off just email your entry to editorial@shetlandtimes\n: : : : : : : :\nEven those who detest cricket most may have raised a modest eyebrow last week when the Scottish team shocked England with victory in a one-day match at Edinburgh.\nReaders, whether they follow the game or not, may be interested that there was actually a player in the home side’s ranks with Shetland connections.\nA glance at the Scottish team sheet may suggest possible contenders – how about Michael Leask, Mark Watt or even Dylan Budge for instance?\nBut it was none of those. The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure. It just didn’t go our way on the day. Only two years ago it went Shetland’s way where we won on Orkney’s home turf. It’s always a great competitive game.”\nI am happy to set the record straight on this.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another. But sadly, and I can envisage a few whistlers spluttering over their cornflakes at this, the words “consistent” and “referees” are an oxymoron as far as I\u0026#8217m concerned.\nOn the subject of the English progression in the tournament, it has once again thrown up the perennial question of whether Scottish people should support their oldest rivals.\nThere are no doubt many north of the border who would find the prospect of England winning the World Cup a terrifying one. They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships.

I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say.

Alley.\nScott Duncan (24), a former Kingussie High School pupil, has just returned from his dream adventure to the United States with a team of fellow meteorologists.\nHe got up close and personal with several tornadoes and massive electric storms during the trip of a lifetime which started on May 19, with the quartet returning on Saturday.\nThe daredevil and talented photographer captured breathtaking snaps of the huge storms as they crossed Nebraska, Kansas, Colorado and Texas.\nScott told the Strathy: \"The four of us flew out to Tornado Valley in the hope to witness some of the planet\u0027s most extreme weather.\n\"We decided to put our meteorological skills together and chase the storms ourselves.\"\nThe group of Reading University graduates rented a car and travelled 7000 miles over the course of the three weeks.\n\"We do it for the buzz as we all have a passion for extreme weather and it is also a great way to hit the open road and explore new states,\" he added.\nHe agreed that it can be a dangerous hobby but not for the reasons you would think.\n\"People often think tornadoes are the main concern but lightning, giant hail stones and flash flooding are often the hazards that prove most deadly,\" he said.\n\"Careful planning before and during a storm chase is absolutely essential.\"\n\u0026nbsp\nScott now works for MetDesk, a UK-wide weather service, and he took those skills across the Pond with him.\nThe friends used the latest weather model data, satellite and radar observations and invested in a portable internet device to ensure they had the best chance of remaining connected to signal while on the move.\nScott said it is incredibly important that the driver can access accurate directions quickly when faced with dangerous and often changing conditions.\nAlthough they had a few close calls, they managed to avoid getting themselves into \"major trouble\" by knowing when to back off and take shelter.\nThe Newtonmore man explained: \"We avoided driving through storms with tennis ball sized hail stones and 70mph straight line winds.\n\"But at one point we did have to take shelter in a gas station freezer room \u0026ndash the strongest room in the building \u0026ndash due to a tornado with confirmed flying debris just upwind of us.\"\nScott admitted that storm chasing is not for the faint-hearted but that \"it is an experience\" and in the US it is becoming an increasingly popular attraction.\nBecause the adventurers did not know where they would end up at the end of the day, accommodation had to often be found late and in an obscure towns in the middle of nowhere\nScott, who is now safely back in Hertfordshire where the weather is rather less dramatic, added: \"That alone makes the trip more exciting as it holds an incredible depth of freedom.\"\nTornado Alley is the name of the area in the United States where tornadoes are most frequent.\nThe term was coined in 1952 as the title of a research project to study severe weather in areas of Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, South Dakota, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Nebraska, Colorado, North Dakota, and Minnesota.\nWednesday 11 Jul 2018 12:38

Even with the introduction of new flights our air connections remain some of the most fragile across these isles.\n\u0026ldquoThe Smith Commission was very clear when it stated that: \u0026lsquothe power to charge tax on air passengers leaving Scottish airports will be devolved to the Scottish Parliament. The Scottish Government will be free to make its own arrangements regarding the design and collection of any replacement tax\u0026rsquo, yet, as we have seen time and time again with this Government, the arrangements on offer, limits the ability of the Scottish Government to make changes to benefit the Scottish economy.\u0026nbsp\nIn his response to the Highland MP, Mr Jenrick confirmed that his department was willing to work closer with the Scottish Government to find a solution to the problem, recognising the commitment outlined in the Smith Commission.\nResponding after the debate, Mr Hendry said: \u0026ldquoI am glad that the UK Government recognises it has failed to hand over APD in a workable way, and that Airport Departure Tax cannot be implemented by the Scottish Government without a solution to this problem.\n\u0026ldquoI hope that the assurances from Mr Jenrick today, are followed up by meaningful action from the UK Government, to enable the Scottish Government to introduce its reduced Airport Departure Tax, while protecting the Highlands and Islands exemption.\"\nWednesday 11 Jul 2018 12:38 PM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/CARS-PLOCKTON-HS-1.jpg","title":"former sabhal mor ostaig chairman","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nFormer Sabhal Mòr Ostaig chair Duncan MacQuarrie was celebrated this week with the first road in the new Kilbeg Village development, Rathad MhicGuaire (MacQuarrie Road) named in his honour during an official ceremony held on Monday.\nThe ceremony was carried out by Kate Forbes MSP and recognised the key role which Mr MacQuarrie has played in the college\u0026#8217s development over many years. Sabhal Mòr Ostaig principal Prof Boyd Robertson said, \u0026#8220This is a richly-deserved honour for Duncan which recognises the hugely important contribution he has made to the development of the college over many years and the vital contribution he has made to the development of the Gaelic language and culture and to the advancement of Gaelic and Gaelic-medium education, both as a teacher and as a former HM Inspector.”\n“Duncan\u0026#8217s critical input to Sabhal Mòr Ostaig’s development in its challenging formative years was marked by his steady stewardship, as a former chairman and his pioneering work, alongside that of his fellow trustees, demonstrated an exemplary vision and commitment without which what is now the National Centre for the Gaelic Language and Culture would not have existed.”\n“For that, all who have benefited from this wonderful and inspiring place, over the intervening years, owe him a great debt of gratitude and it is for that reason we celebrate with him here today.

The change came when my grandmother remarried, and so then the family name became Davis.”\nFor 37 years “MacKenzie country” has been his base, and these days it’s fishing rather than football which is his passion. Yet before making the move north with wife Vi to build the Craigmore Hotel in Gairloch, Harry Davis had enjoyed a remarkable sporting life — recovering from multiple bullet wounds in the Korean War to carve out a glittering football career with Rangers.\nTalk about “dual contracts” may have loomed large over Scottish football in recent months, but here was one ex-professional who really knew what it was like to serve two paymasters.\nA native Fifer, but brought up in Perth, Harry was an emerging talent with East Fife when he signed up as part of his national service to join the Black Watch. He soon found himself in the thick of the bloody, but often forgotten, Korean War where in the midst of conflict he suffered injuries from which it would take him over two years to recover.\nRemarkably, not only did he return to full health, he resumed his football career with gusto — signing for Rangers in 1956. He would enjoy a memorable eight-year spell with the Ibrox club, winning three league titles, two league cups and a Scottish Cup, as well as playing in the first Scottish side to reach a European final.\nA fearsome defender known as the “Iron Man”, he was never one to shirk a tackle on the pitch, and he’s not afraid to offer an opinion off it either — as he documents in a compelling autobiography which recently hit the bookshelves.\nHis is a tale far removed from the anodyne offerings served up by today’s breed of pampered millionaires. Having witnessed and experienced what he did on the battlefield, it’s hardly surprising that Davis had little time for those less appreciative of their sporting talents.\nTake, for example, the Rangers and Scotland great Jim Baxter.\n“I don’t dispute Baxter’s talent — he was a class player, but he wasted it,” he says ruefully. “He got privileges no one else got and it upset a lot of players in the team. He only turned it on once every three games and for the rest of the time, when your backs were to the wall, Baxter was nowhere to be seen.”\nHe describes Willie Waddell, the man who led Rangers to their only European trophy, as a “lucky manager” who had used his position as a sportswriter to undermine predecessor David White — a man Harry Davis had returned to Ibrox to assist.\n\nIT SEEMS CLEAR that wartime experience — and the discipline and work ethic it instilled — would leave a lasting imprint on everything Harry Davis did thereafter. But, ironically, his prowess on the football field might actually have spared him from active service altogether.\nHis military call came just after he had broken into East Fife’s excellent post-war team under Scott Symon — the man who would later bring him to Ibrox. And he adds: “I had a couple of opportunities, one to be a PTI in the army, and the other to take an airborne course.\n“It was all a scam to get you to play in the army team and I turned them all down. I was quite happy to go and thought it was all a bit of an adventure.”\nThat sense of wide-eyed wonder would soon give way to the full-blooded horrors of war, as he found himself fighting off Chinese forces intent on advancing further south on the Korean peninsula.\nHe remembers that many caught in the thick of the fighting were simple conscripts — scarcely prepared for the brutality they would encounter. Indelibly marked in his memory is the image of one desperate soldier running deliberately into enemy fire and to his death.\n“He was away with the birds,” he added. “I tried to stop him, but just at that moment a shell landed on top of our trench — all the hairs on the back of my hand were singed, but we were sheltered and escaped the full impact. But by the time I got up he was off again, and disappeared.\n“I couldn’t do anything about it, but that stayed with me. You can’t blame the guy — he was just a conscript as well.\n“There was always a little bit of ill feeling in that these conscripts were shipped out to the battlefield, yet regular, more experienced soldiers from the Black Watch were left behind in Germany.”\nHarry’s contribution to the war effort ended in the spring of 1953, though to this day he has no idea where the bullets which left him wounded actually came from. Years later, a former colleague contacted him to say he believed he had been responsible.\n“I said to him it might have been him, it might not have been. Who knows? But everyone was in a state of panic, and again we go back to conscripts. I certainly wouldn’t place any blame on him.”\nThe stray bullets had caught him on the back of the foot — fracturing his heel, but mercifully just missing the Achilles tendon. Having also suffered abdominal damage, Harry Davis would spend months recuperating in a Japanese hospital before returning to the UK to continue a slow road to recovery.\nIn the far east a nursing sister from Stornoway would become something of an inspiration, but it is Harry’s biggest regret that on leaving Japan he would never see the woman again.\n“She was marvellous and encouraged me so much through all the operations, the bad nights and bad days,” he added. “I made a point that I would go and see her, and when I built the hotel up here I thought I’d be able to find her. I only knew her as Sister MacKenzie, but she was from Stornoway and I believe she had something to do with the Post Office over there.\n“But then I did hear from one source that she had died — I never got to make contact with her. It’s one of the great disappointments of my lifetime.”\nON HARRY’S RETURN HOME doctors gave him little hope of ever playing top-level football again — sometimes in fairly graphic terms.\n“One doctor at the military hospital in London told me that my only hope was that my bowels were in such a state, defenders were likely to slip on what would come out! It didn’t look very encouraging.”\nYet after being helped back to fitness by David Kinnear — a physiotherapist and former Ibrox player — Harry Davis would eventually get his career back on track.\nHe resumed action for East Fife, and in 1956 got the call from Symon to follow him to Ibrox.\nIn Glasgow, he initially learned the ropes in the reserve side — one of his memorable early encounters bringing him into direct contact with the Celtic legend Charlie Tully, who by this time was at the opposite stage of his career.\nBefore too long Davis would join a first-team pool that included vintage names likes George Young, George Niven, Sammy Baird and Alex Scott, and Rangers lifted the league at the end of his first full season in 1957.\nIn something of a golden era for the Scottish game, Davis regularly played in front of crowds topping the 100,000 mark, and he remembers a vibrant and competitive league where in his first few years the main challenge came from a Hearts team which claimed two league titles.\n“If we had fewer than 40,000 at a game it was a disaster,” he said. “But regularly the crowds were 60-70,000 and for big games the 100,000-mark wasn’t unusual.”\nA degree of European success followed, as Rangers reached the European Cup Winners Cup Final in 1961. There they would be outclassed by a fine Fiorentina side, and tellingly Harry feels the Scots simply refused to heed their continental lesson. Half a century on, and the same basic mistakes continue to be made.\n“They were ahead of us,” he said. “Scott Symon was a great manager, no question, but he didn’t keep up with modern techniques. He still said get the ball to the winger, get the winger up the field and cross it and get the centre forward to head it into the net. That worked in the old days, but it didn’t work when you played these continental teams.”\nAfter winding down his playing career with a season at Partick Thistle, Harry took the manager’s job at the grand old institution of Queens Park. It was a time he enjoyed immensely, though the lure of Ibrox once again tempted him back across the city — this time to hook up with White.\nThat spell in the dugout was to prove less successful than his playing days, with Rangers then in the shadow of Jock Stein’s great Celtic side. Yet some redemption would arrive at Dundee where White and Davis led the Dens Park club to a memorable league cup final triumph over Celtic in 1973. A few months later the pair gained revenge over their old nemesis Waddell, dumping Rangers out of the Scottish Cup at Ibrox.\nDundee would prove to be Harry’s last staging post in football — and thereafter he set his sights on the quiet life in the north west Highlands.\nTHESE DAYS his football involvement is limited to appearing alongside former team-mates at charity fundraisers for the Erskine Trust, for which he is also to donate most of the proceeds from his book. However, he still keeps one eye on developments at Ibrox, even if he struggles to comprehend the team’s recent high-profile fall from grace.\n“The honest answer is that I just don’t know what to make of it all,” he said. “One conclusion is reached one week, and a week later it’s turned around again. But I do believe a number of teams were quite happy to get rid of them because they were strong competition. I don’t think that was right.”\nAsked for his personal highlights in the game, his answer is a simple one.  He just reels off a list of the players he played with, and it reads like a who’s who of greats for fans of the Ibrox club.\n“I joined Rangers and played with George Young, George Niven, Baird, Billy Simpson, Bobby Shearer, Alex Scott, Jim McColl — a great team. And then by the end I had also played with John Greig, Ronnie MacKinnon, Ian MacMillan, Millar, Brand, Baxter and Wilson. How many people can say that?”\nA Scotland cap may have proved elusive — “in those days they only picked 11” — with a place on the reserve list as close as he got to pulling on the dark blue.\nNevertheless, Harry Davis had long since proved his mettle on the international stage — and he still has the scars to prove it.\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/7s.jpg","title":"comhairle must replace barra housing","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nComhairle nan Eilean Siar must replace land they gave away for housing in Castlebay, Barra, because it was meant to be kept in perpetuity for recreational use.\nLast month, Housing Minister Kevin Stewart cut the turf on the Corran Ciosmul development at Horve. However, the six houses are to be built on what was a King George V Playing Field, which was set aside and protected in 1962.\nFor anyone to build on this land they must notify and obtain the consent of Fields in Trust, a charity that acts to protect all KGV land. Even though the comhairle took over the management of the land in 1984 they must still obtain the trust’s consent.\nThe Barra Sports Forum have been pressing the comhairle for years to transfer a piece of derelict land near the Co-op, which is adjacent to the KGV area, for use as an all-weather pitch.\nA spokesman said: “The sports forum urge the comhairle to fulfil their legal and moral obligations to the people of Barra and Vatersay to protect the sports and recreation land in Horve by righting this wrong: firstly, by filing for a change of land use to Fields in Trust from ‘sports and recreation’ to ‘housing’ and secondly, by transferring an equivalent area of land to the KGV playing field in compensation for land lost to housing. Only by doing this will the comhairle avoid the danger of stalling the desperately needed new housing that helps secure the future of our islands.”\nRichard McKeever of Fields in Trust the charity recognised that that “sometimes it may be necessary” to change the use of recreational land.\nHe added: “As part of our protection, we have a responsibility to ensure the local owners and managers of these spaces seek our consent to undertake any changes regarding land ownership, land transactions, erection of buildings and structures \u0026#8211 and that proposed changes fit with the purpose of the protected space and benefit its recreational use. We are currently in constructive dialogue with the council and await their proposals for replacement recreational land of an equal or better standard which will be protected for the local community to enjoy in perpetuity.”\nThe housing development at Corran Ciosmul is being undertaken by the Hebridean Housing Partnership, which has owned the land since 2006.\nKatrina Rowlands, HHP development manager, said: “Due to the nature of how the titles were transferred to HHP, the burden in relation to the Fields in Trust was not recorded therefore the responsibility to meet the Fields in Trust conditions remains with the comhairle. We are aware that the comhairle’s legal team are in discussions with Fields In Trust to resolve the matter.”\nA spokesman for the comhairle said discussion with Fields in Trust were continuing.\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n"}]
