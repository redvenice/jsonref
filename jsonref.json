She has since appeared in the TV series Inhumans.Her exes include pop star Justin Bieber, whom she dated briefly in 2016, and Anwar Hadid, the brother of supermodels Gigi and Bella.They split ‘amicably’ after a year, but she unfollowed him and his entire family on Instagram after he was pictured kissing model Kendall Jenner.It has been widely speculated that she is the ‘Hollywood mean girl’ described by actress Bella Thorne in a 2015 interview.In it she said: ‘I have a mean girl. She’s in the business, and she’s very, very mean. I stay away from her at all costs.I never say hello to her. ‘Her siblings are not mean like she is. It’s just her. One of the reasons I don’t like her is because she’s been a billionaire since she was very little, and she’s never had to work for anything in her life.’Thorne knows Peltz because her boyfriend Gregg Sulkin also co-starred in the film Affluenza with Nicola Peltz in 2014.Nicola has never commented on the speculation."},{"url":null,"title":"Convoy cars waving Russian flags marked Z symbol spotted IRELAND","story":"Share this article       \u0027All war is awful and can never be justified,\u0027 said Rene Hermann, 50, who also helped to organise the Berlin convoy.Hermann said he has \u0027no position\u0027 on the Ukraine conflict, but also runs a TikTok page with thousands of subscribers, which was recently suspended after repeatedly spreading pro-Kremlin propaganda, including allegations that Kyiv had staged a massacre \u0027to manipulate Western thinking\u0027.\u0027The motives for taking part in these demonstrations are very erse,\u0027 said Jochen Toepfer, a sociologist at the Otto-von-Guericke University in Magdeburg and an expert on Russian society.\u0027They were organised as demonstrations against discrimination in Germany.

A spokesman for Mr Donnelly said he is currently reviewing the report from his department’s secretary general Robert Watt. Dr Holohan was appointed as professor of public health strategy at TCD on March 25th and announced on the same day he was stepping down as chief medical officer. While Dr Holohan had no intention of returning to the role, his transfer was described as an “open-ended secondment”. Mr Watt is understood to be the official who sanctioned the move.  Mr Donnelly only learned on April 5th that he would continue to remain a departmental employee on a salary of €187,000 per annum. Following the disclosure, Taoiseach Micheál Martin announced that the appointment would be “paused” pending a report from Mr Watt. However, over the weekend, Dr Holohan announced he would not take up the TCD role but would retire from the department on July 1st. Once reviewed by Mr Donnelly, Mr Watt’s report is due to be considered by the Government. A spokesman said that it is the intention to publish the report but said the Department was not yet in a position to say when that would occur. Meanwhile, spokespeople for Mr Donnelly and the Taoiseach repeated that they had only learned of the secondment arrangement last Tuesday, April 5th, contrary to media reports at the weekend that suggested both were aware of the arrangement at an earlier date."},{"url":null,"title":"more than 100 mps resign as sharif becomes new pakistani prime minister","story":"Newly elected Pakistani prime minister Shehbaz Sharif addresses the National Assembly  in Islamabad on Monday. Photograph:  APMore than 100 MPs loyal to Pakistan’s ousted prime minister Imran Khan resigned on Monday, creating a headache for the new, western-friendly incumbent, Shehbaz Sharif, as he tries to drag his country out of political and economic crisis. His departure from power sparked street protests and a mass resignation of MPs from Mr Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party in protest at the impending change of government. If the resignations are accepted by the speaker, Pakistan would face the prospect of more than 100 by-elections within two months, a major distraction for Mr Sharif and his coalition partners and a potential platform for Mr Khan (69) to mobilise his support.That in turn could ensure the nuclear-armed nation of 220 million people remains prone to political and economic turbulence. Mr Sharif has a reputation domestically as an effective administrator more than as a politician. He is the younger brother of three-time prime minister Nawaz Sharif. Analysts say Shehbaz, unlike Nawaz, enjoys amicable relations with Pakistan’s military, which traditionally controls foreign and defence policy.Economic malaiseAfter Monday’s vote, Mr Sharif vowed to tackle an economic malaise that has seen the rupee hit an all-time low and the central bank implement the biggest hike in interest rates in decades last week. “If we have to save the sinking boat, what we all need is hard work, and unity, unity and unity,” he told parliament. “We are beginning a new era of development today.” The younger Sharif emerged as the leader of a united opposition to topple Mr Khan, a former cricket star who has claimed that the United States was behind his downfall, which Washington has denied. Mr Sharif said in an interview last week good relations with the United States were critical for Pakistan for better or for worse, in stark contrast to Mr Khan’s prickly ties to Washington.In his maiden speech, he also spoke of improving relations with neighbours India and China. “We want good relations with India but a durable peace can’t be possible without Kashmir’s solution,” he said, referring to the contested Himalayan territory the countries have fought several wars over. He said his government will speed up construction of the $60 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) – a part of Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative.Full termNo elected prime minister has completed a full term in Pakistan since it won independence from colonial power Britain in 1947, though Mr Khan is the first to be removed by a no-confidence vote. The military has ruled the country for almost half its nearly 75-year history. It viewed Mr Khan and his conservative agenda favourably when he won election in 2018. That support waned after a falling-out over the appointment of a military intelligence chief and economic troubles. Mr Khan remained defiant following his defeat in parliament. Thousands of his supporters in several cities held protests against his ousting. Nawaz Sharif was barred by the supreme court in 2017 from holding public office and subsequently went abroad for medical treatment after serving just a few months of a 10-year jail sentence for corruption charges. “There can’t be any bigger insult to this country,” Mr Khan told reporters on Monday on the prospect of Shehbaz Sharif being elected. – ReutersStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"russian forces ramp up efforts to gain control of mariupol","story":"Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, speaking in a video address to South Korean lawmakers, has said that the besieged city of Mariupol has been destroyed and that tens of thousands of people have been killed. Video: ReutersA Russian tank that was knocked out during fighting on a highway to Kyiv. Photograph: Efrem LukatskyAPRussian forces are pushing hard to establish control over the southern port city of Mariupol, the linchpin between Russian-held areas to the west and east and already devastated by weeks of siege and bombardment.Thousands of Russian troops were massing for a fresh offensive in the east, according to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Monday. He added that Moscow said it would not halt its military operation in Ukraine for any further peace talks.British intelligence indicated that Ukrainian forces had already repulsed several Russian assaults in eastern regions. Britain’s defence ministry said Russian shelling continued in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. But Ukrainian forces had beaten back several assaults and destroyed tanks, vehicles and artillery equipment, it said.For now at least, the invading forces have abandoned their attempt to capture the capital Kyiv but they are redoubling efforts in the east.The invasion – which Russia calls a “special military operation” – has left a trail of death of destruction. Moreover, the attack has drawn condemnation from western countries and triggered concern about President Putin’s broader ambitions.Russian claimsRussia’s defence ministry said sea-launched missiles had on Sunday destroyed S-300 anti-aircraft missile systems which had been supplied to Ukraine by a European country. The batteries were concealed in a hangar on the outskirts of Dnipro in central Ukraine, it said.The United States did not have evidence that any S-300 missile defence system had been destroyed by Russia, said a senior defence official. Washington believes Russia has started reinforcing and resupplying its troops in Donbas in eastern Ukraine, the official added, but that the US does not believe this is the start of a new offensive in the region.President Zelenskiy appealed to South Korea’s parliament by videolink to provide his country with military aid to assist Ukraine’s struggle against the Russian onslaught.About one-quarter of Ukraine’s 44 million population have been forced from their homes, cities turned into rubble and thousands have been killed or injured, many of them civilians.Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov confirmed that the Kremlin would not halt its operation for any new round of peace talks. And he accused Kyiv of failing to reciprocate in previous sessions. Mr Lavrov told state television he saw no reason not to continue with talks. But although President Putin had ordered a suspension of military action during a first round in February, Moscow’s position had changed, he said.Austrian leader Karl Nehammer met President Putin in Moscow on Monday and was expected to call for an end to the conflict. It was Mr Putin’s first face-to-face meeting with a European Union leader since the invasion started. “This is not a friendly meeting,” Mr Nehammer was quoted as saying in a statement issued by his office, reiterating that he had hoped to help bring an end to the war or improve conditions for civilians. “The conversation with President Putin was very direct, open and tough.”Urged to fleeMounting civilian casualties have triggered widespread international condemnation and new sanctions.Luhansk governor Serhiy Gaidai said shelling in the region was increasing day by day.He urged all civilians to evacuate. “Those that wanted to leave have already left, while now many are left in bomb shelters who are perhaps frightened to come out . . . or scared to lose their possessions.”Moscow has rejected accusations of war crimes by Ukraine and western countries. It has repeatedly denied targeting civilians and says its aim is to demilitarise and root out dangerous nationalists in its southern neighbour. Ukraine and western nations have dismissed this as a baseless pretext for war.German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock, speaking before a meeting of European ministers in Luxembourg, said Berlin saw “massive indications” of war crimes in Ukraine.Meanwhile, French bank Société Générale became the latest company to retreat from Russia. It agreed to sell its stake in Rosbank and the Russian lender’s insurance subsidiaries to Interros Capital, a firm linked to billionaire Vladimir Potanin.The invasion has triggered a wave of financial sanctions from the United States, Europe and Britain, prompting western companies to sell their Russian assets. Several European Union ministers said on Monday the bloc’s executive was drafting proposals for an oil embargo on Russia, although there was still no agreement to ban Russian crude.The World Bank forecast the war would cause Ukraine’s economic output to collapse by 45 per cent this year, with half of its businesses shuttered, grain exports mostly cut off by Russia’s naval blockade and destruction rendering economic activity impossible in many areas.The bank forecast Russia’s gross domestic product would contract by 11.2 per cent this year due to sanctions.Full coverage of the Russian invasion of UkraineStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"johnny depp and amber heard face off again in us libel trial","story":"Amber Heard  and Johnny Depp are about to clash once more in court. Photograph: Getty ImagesThe latest chapter in Hollywood star Johnny Depp’s legal battle with ex-wife Amber Heard started on Monday as a US defamation trial began over allegations Heard made about domestic abuse.Depp (58) has sued Heard for $50 million (€46 million). He alleges she defamed him after writing a 2018 opinion piece in the Washington Post about being a survivor of domestic abuse.The article never mentioned Depp by name, but his lawyers have said it is clear Heard was referencing him and that the piece damaged his film career and reputation.Depp has denied all allegations of abuse. He notes in the lawsuit that his ex-wife’s claims were an “elaborate hoax to generate positive publicity for Ms Heard and advance her career”.Jury selection is expected to begin on Monday.Depp and Heard both submitted long lists of potential witnesses whom they could call.Heard’s list includes her ex-boyfriend and Tesla chief executive Elon Musk, who she texted with about Depp. Also on the list of potential witnesses is actor James Franco, who Heard testified in the London case inquired about bruises on her face following an alleged abusive incident with Depp.Depp wants the Fairfax County jury to find that Heard knowingly made false claims.Heard, for her part, will argue that she is shielded, or “immune”, from liability because her 2018 opinion piece on domestic violence dealt with a matter of public concern.“I never named him. Rather, I wrote about the price women pay for speaking out against men in power. I continue to pay the price, but hopefully when this case concludes, I can move on and so can Johnny,” said Heard on Saturday.The Washington Post is not a defendant in the trial. Depp’s lawyers have said they filed the case in Fairfax County, outside the District of Columbia, because the newspaper is printed at a facility there. Heard unsuccessfully tried to transfer the case to Los Angeles, where she and Depp lived.Heard’s lawyers alleged “forum shopping”, saying Depp’s attorneys sued in Virginia because they perceived it as a more favourable venue than California.California has a more strongly worded “anti-Slapp law,” a type of legal protection meant to shield journalists and others from frivolous lawsuits designed to silence them.The US trial comes less than two years after Depp lost a libel case against The Sun, which labelled him a “wife beater”. A London high court judge ruled he had repeatedly assaulted Heard and put her in fear for her life.The United States is a difficult forum for libel plaintiffs, especially public figures like Depp, who faces several hurdles in the Virginia case. Depp must prove by clear and convincing evidence that Heard knowingly made false claims.Under English defamation law, the person being sued has the burden of proving their claims were true.Depp and Heard met while making The Rum Diary in 2011 and married four years later. She accused Depp of domestic abuse after filing for orce in 2016.Depp’s Hollywood careerDepp ascended to Hollywood stardom in the 1990s with portrayals of loners and outsiders in cult classics such as John Waters’s Cry-Baby and Tim Burton’s Edward Scissorhands.He became a household name with the swashbuckling Disney franchise Pirates of the Caribbean, playing fan favourite Jack Sparrow.Heard (35) is known for her roles in Aquaman and Justice League. She has brought her own libel claim against Depp, saying he smeared her by calling her a liar.Heard’s counterclaim will be decided as part of the trial, which could last for six weeks. Heard is seeking $100 million in damages from Depp, according to court papers.In her evidence to the London High Court, Heard said Depp would turn into a jealous alter ego, “the monster”, after binging on drugs and alcohol and had threatened to kill her.She detailed 14 occasions of extreme violence when she said the actor choked, punched, slapped, head-butted, throttled and kicked her.The London judge accepting 12 of these accounts as true.Following the November 2020 ruling in the London libel trial, Depp was replaced with Danish actor Mads Mikkelsen for the third film in the Fantastic Beasts franchise, a spin-off from the Harry Potter books and films. – ReutersStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"An Irishman and a local joined forces to build a surfing community at the beach in Bureh\u0026lsquoEntertainment is such a good way to bring forth change,\u0026rsquo says play\u0026rsquos narratorPhenomenal success of Nigerian artists is bringing both opportunities and criticismAuthors are tackling topics from transgender rights to Islamic extremism, and picking up plenty of awardsTom Saater has a rags to riches story and a unique insight into Nigeria\u0026rsquos biggest cityIn one of the world\u0026rsquos most dangerous places to attend school, teachers lead lessons and the students comeAfrican country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"perilous moment conservative party","story":"And we have the ongoing police investigation into whether Boris Johnson himself broke lockdown rules by attending events in his flat and the offices within Number Ten. Here there is already a concerted attempt by loyalists to downplay the significance of the moment should the Prime Minister be fined by the police. Their job has been made easier by the strength Johnson has shown in arming Ukraine and standing up to Russia. They are aided too by the sense that Sunak’s recent difficulties mean he is less likely, for now at least, to win the race to succeed Johnson. And they will use Sunak’s example as a warning against taking a chance on other less experienced candidates.Regardless of their good fortune, however, the loyalists’ arguments will not wash. It is not sustainable, for example, for Downing Street to keep the names of senior staffers or officials secret after they have been fined. Nor is it sustainable for fines issued in relation to events in the Downing Street flat to be kept secret. Nor can the Prime Minister or his spokesmen get away with refusing to accept that it will be established, if he is issued with a fine he accepts and pays, that he has broken the law.However much the loyalists may wish to convince themselves otherwise, the idea that a prime minister should survive a process that finds him guilty not only of breaking the law, but breaking extraordinary laws he imposed and implored the public to respect, is simply absurd. So too is the idea that he should survive after denying breaking those laws and issuing emphatic denials in Parliament.The Conservative Party might be capable of deluding itself thus, but if it does the public will draw very different conclusions. They will see a Government – already struggling with inflation and finding it difficult to get things done – closing ranks and showing appalling double standards.This is dangerous enough for the Tories, but if part of the strategy to prop up the Prime Minister is to limit and discredit potential successors, there follow two more problems. Keeping tall poppies away from high office will mean the quality of day-to-day government will continue to suffer. And it will risk a crisis of leadership following the Johnson premiership, whenever it ends, as the choices are narrowed unnecessarily. It is ridiculous that the likes of Tom Tugendhat and Jeremy Hunt remain on the backbenches, and ridiculous that some in Downing Street see only advantage in Sunak’s recent difficulties.With notable exceptions – such as Nadhim Zahawi’s vaccine rollout, Ben Wallace’s work arming the Ukrainians, and Priti Patel’s forthcoming plans to establish offshore processing for asylum claims – much of what the Government is doing is piecemeal, technocratic and often contradictory. The Tories want to intervene in the economy, but have junked their industrial strategy. They say they want lower taxes, but keep putting them up. They promise to level-up the country, but while Michael Gove has the ideas, he lacks the spending power for them to make a difference quickly enough.As with the questions of ethical standards in government, this lack of coherence can be explained in part by the Prime Minister’s style of leadership. Johnson has deliberately formed a third eleven cabinet, to avoid creating powerful rivals. He has set lofty targets, but neither formed detailed plans to achieve them, nor empowered ministers to do so. He has appointed a chancellor with whom he was always going to clash thanks to their contrasting methods of working and starkly different views of fiscal policy.Tired governments, made complacent by years in office, come to believe that their position of power will last forever. They lose sight of the bigger picture, drift into technocratic decision-making, and their fights with one another grow more important than those with opposing parties and vested interests.Unfortunately, this government now suffers all these ills.So now seems a good time for Conservatives to remind themselves of the binary nature of power in our parliamentary democracy.

A young man, who despite every advantage in life, had achieved precisely nothing in his 26 years.That was until October last year, when he achieved notoriety.The savage murder of the much loved and widely respected MP and father of five, Sir David Amess, means Ali’s name will forever be synonymous with hatred, ision and terrorist violence.The son of middle-class Somali migrants, Ali was born in Southwark and brought up in Croydon with his three younger siblings.His father, Harbi Ali Kullane, was the former director of communications for the prime minister’s office in Somalia.An outspoken critic of Islamist terrorism in the troubled east African region, Mr Kullane had himself been the subject of numerous death threats from the murderous al-Shabaab group.It was in the early 1990s that Mr Kullane relocated to London from Mogadishu, amid rising tension and violence in Somalia.He and his wife settled in Croydon where they adapted easily to the British way of life.Despite coming from a Muslim family, Ali attended the local Parish Church Infant and Junior School, where he was remembered by staff as a “friendly and polite boy”.He was a keen chess player and like his siblings, took part in the school’s annual Christian traditions.His family, while observant Muslims were not particularly religious and the children mixed well with youngsters from all backgrounds.One of Ali’s former primary school teachers, who did not wish to be identified, said: “He wasn’t a high flier, but was a hard working child who was especially good at maths.”With a father who was a senior figure in the Somalian government and an uncle who was the country’s ambassador to Beijing, a lot was expected of Ali.From a young age his parents let it be known he wanted to pursue a career in medicine.School friends insist he never showed much ambition for anything.At the age of 11, he moved to Riddlesdown High School in Purley, where the supermodel Kate Moss had once been a pupil.Despite his parents’ lofty expectations, his academic prowess did not quite match up. Fellow pupils remember Ali as being “distinctly average” and lacking any direction, drive or determination.He had friends but was not especially popular, enjoyed sport but was not particularly talented.One of his former classmates said: “He was the sort of person who was easily forgettable. He didn’t have a big personality and didn’t make much of an impression on you. He just kept his head down. “I never remember him causing any sort of trouble but equally he never really stood out academically. He had a small group of friends who would hang around together and he would have a kick about, but other than that I can’t recall a single anecdote about him.”It was clear by his mid-teens that he was not going to achieve the grades to study medicine but he applied to do a radiography degree instead. He was accepted onto a course at City University in London in 2014.While it was not quite a medical degree, friends of the family – particularly in east Africa – were under the impression Ali was training to become a doctor.One source in Somalia told The : “Ali was training in the NHS and it was a great source of pride for his parents. His father was especially proud when he was back in Somalia to tell people that his eldest child was working at a top London hospital.”By now his mother and father had separated and while she remained in the family home in Croydon, Mr Kullane began splitting his time between London and east Africa, where he retained homes in Somalia and Nairobi, Kenya.Ali moved into his grandmother’s home in north London and started attending lectures at university.But it was soon clear his heart was not in radiography and in 2016, part way through his second year, he dropped out altogether.He wrote to his course tutor and said he was leaving university because he had decided to take a “different path in life”. That different path was terrorism.By his own admission, Ali had become self radicalised in 2014, becoming completely obsessed with events in Syria.In 2013, British MPs had narrowly rejected a proposal to launch air strikes against Bashar al-Assad’s government to deter the use of chemical weapons.But as the Middle East continued to descend into violence Ali became more and more fixated by the rise of Isis and saw any attempt by the West to suppress it as a modern crusade against Islam.However, unlike many idealistic young extremists, he was not tempted to travel to the region to join Isis, preferring to wage jihad from his keyboard in the safety of his bedroom. With no job to go to, Ali would often stay up all night looking at extremist websites. He idolised the British born Isil killers dubbed The Beatles, following their murderous exploits online.Around two years ago Ali moved out of his grandmother’s home in the Bounds Green area of north London and moved into a flat with a female relative in Kentish Town.One local resident, who would regularly see Ali smoking outside the flat, said he believed he had clashed with his father, possibly over the fact he did not appear to be doing anything with his life.By this stage he had become determined to wage a holy war or jihad in the UK, but was just not entirely clear how to go about it.Sources in the security services do not have any evidence that Ali was in contact with a wider network and he does not appear to have shared his intentions with anyone else.He was the archetypal lone wolf, poisoned by toxic Islamist material online. But unlike many of his fellow terrorists, he took an extraordinarily long time to put his plan into action.The knife he used to murder Sir David, was purchased a full five years before the attack.By May 2019, a year after MPs had voted for airstrikes in Syria and three years after the murder of Jo Cox, Ali settled on a politician as his target.He decided that any of the 317 MPs who had voted in favour of taking action against Assad were fair game.But even having come to that conclusion, it was another two years before he did anything practical about it.Whether his plans were frustrated by the lockdown or whether he was simply gripped by procrastination, we will probably never know.Between March 9, 2021 and July 5, 2021, he visited the home of Michael Gove, the cabinet minister, even drafting a plan of how he might attack him when he went out for one of his regular morning jogs.He also considered the possibility of simply kicking down his front door and bursting into his home late at night.By September last year he had changed his mind about Mr Gove and began looking instead at Mike Freer the MP for Finchley – whose constituency office was an easy Tube ride from his Kentish Town flat.After losing interest in that idea, he then spotted a Tweet by Sir David Amess’s office, offering surgery appointments at his constituency in Southend.Never one willing to expend too much effort to pursue jihad, Ali realised he could travel to Southend relatively easily by train from the nearby Gospel Oak station and so he sent an email requesting an appointment.Providing a false address and lying about wanting to discuss the state of Christian churches in Southend, Ali was granted an audience with Sir David, who was desperate to meet constituents face to face following the isolation of lockdown.On the morning of October 15 last year, having been awake most of the night, Ali left the Kentish Town flat and made his way by train to Leigh-on-Sea, where Sir David was holding his constituent meetings.CCTV footage of his journey shows him calmly engaging with rail staff and fellow passengers, seemingly without a care in the world.At around midday he arrived at the Belfairs Methodist Church where Sir David was hosting his fortnightly surgery.After being introduced to the MP, Ali began questioning him about foreign policy, before suddenly standing up, apologising and then repeatedly stabbing him with a kitchen knife.There were no shouts of “Allahu Akbar”, but witnesses described him having a look of self-satisfaction.He immediately messaged a number of family members and associates to inform them what he had done and his younger sister rang him, screaming down the phone: “Why have you done it?”Ali replied: “I’ve done it because of Syria, I’ve done it because of the innocent people. I’ve done it because of the bombing. He deserved to die.”He told witnesses he wanted the police to shoot him so he could become a “hero”.But in the event his “heroism” departed him and he was tackled to the ground and arrested by two unarmed officers.During his police interview Ali calmly admitted to the murder, telling detectives he had done it for reasons of “terrorism” and “religion”.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Russia issues new warning against Finland and Sweden joining Nato‘We are holding back the horde’: Mariupol fighters battle on weeks after experts said city would fallBritish scheme to take in Ukrainians needs enhanced ‘matching’ elementCharities and MPs call for urgent rollout of mental health nurses in GP surgeriesThe iron will of the railway workers keeping Ukraine runningExtinction Rebellion protests threaten Easter getaway... but police too helpless to stop themMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"calls sea eagle cull lambs torn limb limb","story":"Sea eagles should be culled because a reintroduction of the predators to the UK has led to them terrorising rural communities and killing lambs, an MP has claimed.  Angus MacNeil, who represents the Western Isles, claimed numbers of the raptors, which were extinct in Britain before they were brought back in the 1970s, were now “out of control” following successful breeding programmes.He said plans to drastically expand the population further would drive crofters out of business due to rising cases of lambs being “torn limb from limb” by eagles which had moved away from feeding on fish. His call for a cull of the protected species provoked a backlash from conservationists, with the reintroduction of the birds seen as a major success story by wildlife bodies.The RSPB suggested the number of lamb deaths attributed to sea eagles had been exaggerated.However, the MP, who keeps 33 ewes, criticised city-based commentators who he claimed had little understanding of the impact the eagles were having on rural livelihoods.Two of his neighbour’s healthy four-day-old lambs in Barra had been “ripped apart” by eagles at the weekend, Mr MacNeil said.He posted gruesome images of the carcasses online, saying the birds would be more accurately named “lamb eagles”.  Mr MacNeil, a veteran SNP MP, said he had also heard reports of a woman in Fort William fighting off an eagle with her umbrella after it attacked her chihuahua, and another bird killing a Jack Russell on Uist, in the Outer Hebrides.Sea eagles were driven to extinction in the UK in 1918 but were reintroduced to the Isle of Rum in 1975.There are now believed to be more than 150 breeding pairs of the birds in Scotland, a number that experts say could rise to 400 in coming decades.Mr MacNeil claimed this would spell disaster for crofters and claimed there were already “too many”.“I’m not saying wipe them all out,” he said. “They are majestic birds. But clearly we need to manage it, and inidual birds are getting a taste for eating stuff provided by man.“Rather than searching for their food, they’re having a buffet laid on by farmers and crofters.“A lot of crofters are just scraping by and are now facing a cost of living crisis.“People sitting in their arm chairs with double glazing and central heating are saying a few lambs is a price worth paying. But would they be happy to take a pay cut or to live among rats, wolves and bears?”He added: “This re-introduction has got out of control. They are taking people’s livelihoods. Crofters and farmers are losing hundreds of pounds and they are threatening crofting as a way of life.”Nature Scot, the Scottish Government agency, said the reintroduction had benefited tourism and ruled out a cull. A spokesman said a scheme had been introduced to help businesses manage the problem, including offering equipment designed to deter eagles, although direct compensation is not provided for killed lambs. The two lambs killed at the weekend had cost his neighbour £168, Mr MacNeil said. He said he had challenged those opposed to a cull to meet the cost themselves but that “no-one has come forward with a penny”. In Argyll, crofters have claimed there are so many lamb-eating sea eagles that there is now one for every sheep farm in their area. Some have said they have been forced to move ewes to rented fields to escape the predators. Patrick Krause, chief executive of the Scottish Crofting Federation, said the attacks were “definitely” becoming more common and claimed conservation bodies were “in denial” about the growing scale of the problem.“This is a very large and dangerous predator that has been reintroduced,” he said. “There aren’t the same number of fish so of course they are going to look for mammals on land. One of the reasons they are such successful predators is because they can eat a wide variety of  things. The number of complaints we are hearing of lost lambs are rising all the time.“It’s not just lambs that are being attacked, it’s adult sheep as well. We believe there does need to be a reduction in numbers, but unfortunately I think a cull just isn’t going to happen.”NFU Scotland said sea eagle reintroduction had been “very challenging” to the livelihoods of farmers and crofters because of lamb attacks. However, the organisation stopped short of backing calls for a cull.A spokesman said: “The Sea Eagle stakeholder panel, which includes NFU Scotland, NatureScot, RSPB Scotland and others, is committed to working together to try and resolve all conflicts, balancing the conservation of sea eagles with the needs of farmers and crofters to sustainably rear livestock.”More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Russia issues new warning against Finland and Sweden joining Nato‘We are holding back the horde’: Mariupol fighters battle on weeks after experts said city would fallBritish scheme to take in Ukrainians needs enhanced ‘matching’ elementCharities and MPs call for urgent rollout of mental health nurses in GP surgeriesThe iron will of the railway workers keeping Ukraine runningExtinction Rebellion protests threaten Easter getaway... but police too helpless to stop themMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"easter holidaymakers urged travel night country braced busiest","story":"Easter holidaymakers have been urged to travel at night to avoid road chaos as travel woes are set to worsen.An estimated 21.5 million leisure trips will be made between Good Friday and Easter Monday, making it the busiest weekend on Britain’s roads in at least eight years, according to the RAC.As families seek to avoid chaos on the railway network, with 2,500 train routes due to be delayed or cancelled, and in airports, where Covid staff shortages continue to cause disruption, more are expected to travel by car for the first bank holiday in two years with no legal restrictions.Long delays are also expected to continue on roads in Kent because of a shortage of cross-Channel sailings caused by the suspension of operations by P\u0026ampO Ferries after it sacked nearly 800 workers.The RAC, which began tracking motorists\u0027 Easter plans in 2014, has urged drivers wishing to avoid congestion this weekend to set off before 9am or delay their journeys until after 7:30pm.Around 2,000 roadworks will be in place over the Easter weekend, and the busiest single day on the roads is expected to be Good Friday.In addition to increased congestion, motorists also face the most expensive Easter on record when it comes to fuel prices.Latest government figures show the average cost of a litre of petrol at UK forecourts on April 4 was 161.9p, with diesel at 176.0p.Likely congestion spots will include the M25 clockwise from Junction 8 (Reigate Hill Interchange, Surrey) to Junction 16 (Denham Interchange, Buckinghamshire), the M6 north between Greater Manchester and the Lake District, and near Stonehenge, Wiltshire.Meanwhile, several airlines and airports are struggling to cope with staff sickness and shortages, prompting thousands of flights to be cancelled by easyJet and British Airways in recent weeks.Manchester Airport is warning departing passengers to expect delays of up to 90 minutes, whilst rail passengers are being warned of delays as Network Rail carries out 530 engineering projects costing a total of £83 million.The West Coast Main Line will be closed between London Euston and Milton Keynes between Good Friday and Easter Monday because of upgrades of the existing line and HS2 work.This will affect football supporters as Liverpool and Manchester City meet in an FA Cup semi-final match at Wembley on Saturday.Rod Dennis, an RAC traffic spokesman, said: After two years of relatively quiet Easter bank holidays on the roads, our research suggests a return to traffic levels that are much more typical of this time of year.It\u0027s very possible this weekend could turn out to be one of the busiest for leisure journeys for many years.Add in the impact of disruption on the rail network and one of the biggest fixtures of the sporting calendar taking place this weekend, and you have all the ingredients needed for problems on the roads.Traffic volumes will likely be even higher if some warm spring sunshine makes an appearance.Mr Dennis urged drivers to make sure vehicles are prepared for getaway trips.This is even more important for anyone travelling longer distances than they have for several months, he said.A breakdown is much less likely if a car\u0027s oil and coolant levels, as well as tyre pressure and tread depth, have all been checked before setting out.A Network Rail spokesperson said: 2,500 train services over the four-day Easter weekend will be affected by works. Some will be running on alternative or shorter routes with buses.Over 95 per cent of our network is open for business but works will affect some routes.

The French public has delivered a first-round result in their presidential election that leaves political nerds unable to reach a consensus about where events are likely to go from here.On the one hand, a four-point margin for the incumbent Emmanuel Macron over Marine Le Pen was bigger than some polls had predicted. The Western world’s “centrist dad” brigade might have been inclined to breathe a sigh of relief and claim there is no discernible path to victory for Madame Le Pen in the second-round run-off in a fortnight’s time.But the centrist dads have been wrong before – about Brexit, about Donald Trump and about Britain’s 2019 general election, to cite just a few recent examples. There is at least as strong a case for looking at yesterday’s result and concluding that the establishment-minded centre cannot hold and that it is now not a question of whether there will be a populist Right takeover of the apparatus of government in France, but merely of when.For a start, there is a simple comparison to be made with the first-round vote of five years ago. Back then the charismatic insurgent Macron won 24 per cent, to Le Pen’s 21 per cent. Half a decade has added an unspectacular two or three percentage points to the vote shares of both and the same to Jean-Luc Melenchon, the far-Left populist who scored 19.5 per cent five years ago and 22 per cent last night.But look at what has happened to the traditional establishment parties of centre-Left and centre-Right, the Socialists and the Republicans. Five years ago the former was thought to be at its lowest possible ebb when its candidate won just six per cent, while the latter was deeply disappointed with a 20 per cent share. Last night those scores slumped to two per cent and five per cent respectively.So France is in a vigorously anti-establishment mood and it is hard to see how five years of incumbency and presidential peacocking will enable Macron to harness that as well as he did in 2017. There is a widespread feeling that he is a “president of the rich” with an entourage dominated by privileged young Parisians swanning around in made-to-measure suits and harbouring luxury liberal beliefs.Le Pen, by contrast, has sought out the populist sweet spot of being to the Right on cultural issues and to the Left on economic ones. Her campaign has taken her around the market towns of France, speaking to the common people who formed the bulk of the “Gilet Jaune” protestors and who care more about the price of petrol than the high politics of EU summits or even the suffering of Ukraine.In the first round this time, Le Pen has not only established a strong lead among working class voters but also among the young, with a radical plan to scrap income tax for the under-30s being the core of of her economic offering.Macron himself appears to understand that he will not win the run-off as a conventional capital city centrist given the current public mood and last night pledged to represent the aspirations of those who voted for Le Pen and her fellow Right populist Eric Zemmour, the bulk of whose seven per cent vote share is surely currently heading her way.The decisive factor now will be where the voters of Melenchon end up. Many despise the values of the Paris-based elites just as much as Le Pen’s supporters do and many also are firmly traditionalist on social and cultural matters. Last night Melenchon did Macron a favour by urging them not to vote for Le Pen, though he could not bring himself to endorse the French president.The next two weeks will see French elites attempt to kill Le Pen’s ambitions in the usual way – using her surname and previous leadership of the Front National against her, as well as her unwise past praise for Vladimir Putin, in a bid to persuade voters that she is simply not a respectable choice.But Macron himself seems to understand that, barring Le Pen malfunctioning disastrously again in a televised debate as she did last time, this will not be enough. During his first term Macron has tried hard to keep onboard voters who are anxious about the state of French society and has made a series of speeches about enforcing integration into the French way of life for migrant communities.If he holds on in two weeks’ time – as he is just about favourite to do – it will surely be because he remains a sufficiently canny campaigner to keep one foot in the populist camp himself rather than because the French public are gravitating back towards establishment norms.Nobody expects anything like the crushing two-to-one drubbing he gave Le Pen in the run-off last time. Even if they beat her this time, how the French establishment would fend her off again in 2027 is very difficult to see.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Russia issues new warning against

attempt","story":"The “male gaze” in a Manet masterpiece has been highlighted by the Courtauld Gallery after curators introduced new labels addressing “misogyny” in art.The London gallery, which holds the UK’s foremost Impressionist collection, reviewed the labelling of all of its paintings as part of a three-year, £57 million refurbishment, and some information panels now address issues like artists’ racism and sexism.Manet\u0027s masterpiece, A Bar at the Folies-Bergère, has been reinterpreted with a new label which suggests that the painting has an “unsettling” quality because of the presence of a man on the canvas.The 1882 work depicts a barmaid staring out at the viewer of the painting and - in a mirrored image - towards a male patron of the eponymous Folies-Bergère (a Parisian cabaret club) who returns her gaze.The female subject’s “enigmatic expression is unsettling”, a new information panel states, “especially as she appears to be interacting with a male customer”.The suggestion that an “unsettling” quality of the painting is enhanced because the woman talking to a man has been criticised for unwitting “misogyny” because it diminishes the position of the female model in the work.Ruth Millington, a historian whose book Muse chronicles the female inspirations for great art, said: “It completely shifts the viewer’s attention away from her and onto the man in the picture.“This interpretation, in a woke attempt to call out misogyny, unwittingly centres the male gaze. The writer implies that the woman is unsettled by the man’s presence, framing her as a passive victim of her circumstances.“Curators must stop trapping female muses and models with male-centred interpretations such as this.“In a painting of multiple gazes, it’s unfair and misogynistic to emphasise the male perspective.  I’d rather read a fresh new label which invites viewers to imagine what the woman is thinking.”The model Manet used for the painting was a real-life woman called Suzon who worked at the Folies-Bergère, a venue frequented where prostitutes plied their treade, and it has been suggested that a subtext of the painting is the exploited barmaid’s availabilty to male customers, along with the alcohol she is selling.The Courtauld holds the UK’s leading collection of Gauguin works, but the French painter known for his time in Tahitian subjects - and teenage brides -  has now been reappraised by curators for “taking advantage of his position as a European coloniser”.A label on his Post-Impressionist work Nevermore states the painting depicts “one of several teenagers that he took on as ‘wives’”, adding that “the widespread racist fantasy of Tahitian girls as sexually precocious led to their unabashed exploitation”.An information panel for his 1897 painting Te Rerioa now informs visitors that its subject matter was intended to “appeal to a white European audience” by “exoticising” Polynesians.Further information on Gauguin’s memoir Avant et Apres - recently acquired by the Courtauld - states that the 213-page manuscript is “peppered with examples of his own racism and misogyny”.The treatment of other cultures as “primitive” has also been addressed in a new label for the self-portrait of Roger Fry, the Bloomsbury group painter, known for his advancement of Gauguin-inspired “Primitivism” in Western art.Updated information on the portrait states:  “For modernist artists and writers, African art belonged to an earlier stage of civilisation known as “primitivism ““This reveals the reactive ideas of the time, which underpinned even the views of progressives like Fry”The Courtauld’s relabelling comes following widespread reassessment of problematic artists, with the Picasso Museum in Paris recently inviting artists to critique the painter’s personal life, and the National Gallery highlighting Gauguin’s sexual proclivities in a 2019 show.Manet has also faced reappraisal over works like Olympia, a bold nude that scandalised the Paris Salon in 1865, and which has invited more recent criticism at the Musée d’Orsay for its sidelining of a black woman in the painting.The Courtauld has been contacted for comment.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Russia issues new warning against Finland and Sweden joining Nato‘We are holding back the horde’: Mariupol fighters battle on weeks after experts said

practice and “move back to normality”, as it tries to tackle fly-tipping. Many councils introduced a booking system for households to leave their rubbish at their local dump during the pandemic, citing the need to maintain social distancing. But the practice could be increasing fly-tipping, the Government has warned, as people find they cannot book a slot to get rid of their waste for months. Government guidelines said council waste disposal should be available “at all reasonable times”, which it said is hard to reconcile with booking systems. It asked councils to confirm why they had introduced booking systems and committed to reviewing the number. The move is part of the Government efforts to clamp down on fly-tipping, which has grown 16 per cent since the start of the pandemic and costs the UK nearly £400 million annually. Among the councils that have brought in booking slots for their rubbish dumps since the pandemic is Kent, which last year voted to make the changes permanent. This was despite strident local opposition, with one councillor arguing the issue had become “more isive than Brexit”. Craig Mackinlay, South Thanet MP, called for the decision to be reversed. These outdoor sites present no risk and doubt ever did,” he said. Defending the decision to extend the scheme, the council said it had brought “environmental, operational and communication benefits”. Under the Government’s latest plans, households will also no longer have to pay to get rid of DIY waste including plasterboards, bricks and bath units, which it argued were being unfairly classed as construction waste. The move could save households around £10 a year and help stop around 60,000 annual fly-tipping incidents with construction, demolition and excavation material. The Local Government Association argued that getting rid of the payments for collecting household DIY waste would put a strain on council resources and could be abused by builders dumping their waste. Councillor David Renard, environment spokesman, said: “Some councils have had to introduce charges for this waste due to the rising costs of providing the service and the financial pressure they are under.“Money raised from charges goes back into services so councils can continue to offer disposal facilities for these materials to residents, who would otherwise find them difficult to get rid of and will ensure that the system is not abused by those seeking to dispose of trade waste for free.”Under the plans, the Government will also provide £450,000 in grants to 10 councils to measures to tackle fly-tipping, including CCTV and artificial intelligence. The Country Land and Business Association (CLA) welcomed the move, but said not enough was being done to help private landowners, who have to bear the cost of any waste dumped on their land. Mark Tufnell, president of the CLA, said. “One CLA member, who is a regular victim, is having to pay £50,000 each year to clear waste dumped on their land.”Jacob Hayler, executive director of the Environmental Services Association, said: “There is no single ‘silver bullet’ to tackle the scourge of fly-tipping, so we are pleased to see the Government announcing a range of new measures to help deter this deeply anti-social criminal behaviour.“Of particular importance is stopping this material from falling into the hands of organised waste criminals, leading to larger scale fly-tipping.” More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Russia issues new warning against Finland and Sweden joining Nato‘We are holding

Downing Street confirmed that Boris Johnson had ordered his ethics adviser Lord Geidt to probe the Chancelloraposs conduct after a request from Mr Sunak himself.Mr Sunakaposs family finances have been in the spotlight after it emerged that his we Akshata Murty had non-domicile tax status, allowing her to legally avoid paying UK taxes on overseas income. She U-turned on Friday to save her husbandaposs job by vowing to pay UK tax on herforeign income, which includes an estimated £. million-a-year in shares from the Indian IT giant Infosys - founded by her billionaire father Narayana Murty.Mr Sunak attempted to defuse the row by asking Lord Geidt to investigate, as he said he was confident he had declared everything properly.  The Prime Ministeraposs deputy spokeswoman said: Iaposm not aware of whether Lord Geidt himself has begun his work. But I can confirm that the Prime Minister has agreed to the request from the Chancellor for Lord Geidt to undertake this work. Here are some of the questions the Chancellor needs to clear up. How much has his we saved in UK tax through non-dom status  Mr Sunakaposs nightmare week began when it emerged that his we held non-dom status, potentially saving her millions of pounds in tax. The arrangement, which is legal, allows people who are domiciled abroad to avoid paying UK tax on their overseas income. Her spokeswoman initially tried to claim it was because she was an Indian citizen but she then admitted that Ms Murty paid the British Government £,-a-year to keep the status.Ms Murty was forced to into a U-turn on Friday and said she would now pay UK tax on her foreign income. This includes a .% stake in Indian IT giant Infosys, founded by her billionaire father Naranya Murty. Her share is worth an estimated £ million and provides around £. million in idends per year. Under non-dom rules, Ms Murty was not obliged to pay UK tax on this income - and it is unclear how big her tax bill could have been.The BBC estimated she would have saved £. million in UK tax based on these figures.Ms Murty remains domiciled in India where she eventually wants to . What did Rishi Sunak declare about it  Mr Sunak is understood to have declared his weaposs tax status to the Cabinet Office when he first became a minister in . Sources said the Treasury was also aware, so as to manage any potential conflicts of interest. However, what happened after he made the declaration is not clear, because her status is not on his public declaration of ministerial interests.  Mr Sunak has asked for Lord Geidt to review all his declarations of interest since he became a minister in  to ensure they had been properly stated. He said he was confident he had acted appropriately at all times, but his overriding concern was that the public should have confidence in the answers. Guidance to ministers says the list is not an account of all the interests or financial arrangements held by a Minister or members of their close family, adding: Rather it is a list of any such interests, which are, or might reasonably be perceived to be, directly relevant to that particular minister’s public duties. Why did he hold a US green card until last year  Mr Sunak confirmed on Friday that he held a US green card for more than a year while he was Chancellor. A spokeswoman said he sought guidance ahead of his first US trip in a Government capacity in October - despite taking on the top Treasury job in February . People with green cards are treated as lawful permanent residents by US tax authorities, and it is seen as a step towards full citizenship.  Mr Sunakaposs spokeswoman said he filed US tax s, but specically as a non-resident, in full compliance with the law. The Sunaks met at Stanford University and worked in the US before moving to the UK to pursue Mr Sunakaposs political career. They are understood to have a holiday home in Calornia.At a Downing Street press conference, Boris Johnson said he was unaware of Mr Sunak holding a US green card, but stressed that the Chancellor had done absolutely everything he was required to do. Is he a beneficiary in tax havens  The Independent reported on Friday that Mr Sunak was listed as the beneficiary of trusts set up in the British Virgin Islands and Cayman Islands to help manage the tax and business affairs of Ms Murtyaposs family interests. But a spokeswoman close to the Sunak family said: No-one in Akshataaposs family is aware of this alleged trust. Labour called on Mr Sunak to explain the situation.Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves said: We need full disclosure now. Has he broken the ministerial code  Labour has accused the Chancellor of breaking the ministerial code, the set of guidelines that top politicians must follow.It states that outside interests must be reported to the Permanent Secretary of their department. It is understood Mr Sunak did report his weaposs status to the Cabinet Office and the Treasury was also aware. The ministerial code says the register of interests should also cover interests of the ministeraposs spouse or partner and close family which might be thought to give rise to a conflict. Lord Geidt will examine this as part of his investigation. Politicians who break the ministerial code are traditionally expected to resign.

The under-fire Chancellor tonight took the dramatic step of referring himself to Boris Johnsonaposs independent adviser on ministerial interests, Lord Geidt, following a growing row over his familyaposs financial arrangements. It comes hours after he had ordered a Whitehall inquiry into how his weaposs tax arrangements were leaked to the media. Mr Sunakaposs political future hangs by a thread as he faces fresh calls to come clean over his tax affairs and US immigration status. The Tory minister tried to claim his we Akshata Murty was the victim of a smear campaign, after it emerged she held non-domiciled tax status, which allows people to avoid paying UK tax on overseas income.  The Chancellor, whose Spring Statement last month failed to help struggling families cope with the UKaposs biggest fall in living standards since the time of rationing, was reportedly weighing up whether to quit after a string of damaging stories. His team has previously argued all declarations to the register of ministerial interests were above board. In a statement posted on Twitter on Sunday evening, Mr Sunak said: “I have always followed the rules and I hope such a review will provide further clarity.” In a letter to Mr Johnson, Mr Sunak said his “overriding concern” was to maintain public confidence.  “My overriding concern is that the public retain confidence in the answers that are given and I believe the best way of achieving this is to ensure those answers are entirely independent, without bias or favour,” he said. “To that end I would recommend that Lord Geidt makes all his conclusions public. “I am confident that such a review of my declarations will find all relevant information was appropriately declared. “I have throughout my ministerial career followed the advice of officials regarding matters or propriety and disclosure and will continue to do so.”  The White House has been urged to investigate after Mr Sunak admitted holding a US green card until October  - while he was the Chancellor.Mr Sunak has been hit with reports that he is listed as a beneficiary of tax haven trusts in the Cayman Islands and British Virgin Islands, despite pledging to close tax loopholes. Meanwhile, Infosys, an Indian firm founded by his weaposs billionaire father, where Ms Murty holds £m of shares in, is urgently reviewing its base in Moscow. Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said it was a matter of “basic fairness” that the Chancellor’s family should pay tax in the same way as everyone . “I don’t think the Chancellor gets that. That raises real questions about his judgment,” she told BBC’s Sunday Morning programme.  Policing Minister Kit Malthouse admitted Ms Murtyaposs status as a non-dom - something she gave up last week amid public fury - was “not ideal”, but nonetheless rushed to defend Mr Sunak from colleagues who declared the Chancelloraposs career to be toast. He said the Chancellor was a “smart, clever, committed politician” who had helped steer the economy through the worst of the pandemic. Ms Murty, who is an Indian citizen, dramatically announced on Friday that she would now pay UK taxes on all her worldwide income as she did not want her tax status to be a distraction. It has been estimated that her non-dom status could have saved her £ million in taxes on idends on her shares. Mr Malthouse admitted it was “not a brilliant time” for the details to come out when the country was struggling with a cost of living crisis. “Rishi Sunak has been a remarkable force for good in this country over the last two years, he said.“He put in place some incredible support schemes during the pandemic at enormous speed. “It is not ideal, but we all when we sign up for this job know that there is going to be rough times and smooth times,” he added. Meanwhile sources close to Mr Sunak have played down reports that he was moving his we and two daughters out of Downing Street to escape the glare of the media. The Sunday Mirror published pictures of removal vans arriving in the street on Saturday to take their belongings away. One source said however they had always intended to spend more time in their west London home as their elder daughter, Krishna, entered her final term of primary school before moving on to secondary school. Mr Sunak is still expected to stay in Downing Street during the week while joining them at weekends. Labouraposs Angela Rayner said: “The chaos caused by the Conservatives over the last week must be brought to an end. “A fish rots from the head. It is the Prime Minister’s responsibility to bring this debacle to a close by ensuring that standards are upheld across his Cabinet. When it comes to the Tories hiking up taxes on working people, it seems it is one rule for them and another for the rest of us.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Breaking NewsRishi Sunak\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Fishy Rishi is a beached Chancellor without credibility, struggling to survive and contemplating resignation over the Rishi Notax scandal. The nets trawling the sordid financial affairs of his incredibly wealthy family may yet produce another jaw-dropper that will force the Tory moneybags to resign in disgrace. And the morally corrupt Prime Minister he’s now unlikely ever to succeed – charlatan Boris Johnson, who presided over widespread law-breaking during Covid, his head on the chopping block until Putin spared him – remains a rotten man. Downing Street’s decaying neighbours represent a Conservative government decomposing rapidly, with ministers mocked for regurgitating on the airwaves pathetic excuses for indefensible behaviour.  Draw a Venn diagram and the fools spouting drivel to shield slippery Sunak and an heiress we, Akshata Murty, who’d pay £, to avoid millions of pounds in British tax, overlap with idiots who ly claimed Johnson didn’t hold parties and is innocent of all charges. Whether what non-dom Murty and Green Card Sunak did was legal misses the point that it is unacceptable for a Chancellor to put up taxes for the little people while his family lawfully dodge them. Sleaze taking the Tories back to the John Major era is a glorious opportunity for Labour – and a challenge. Leader Keir Starmer is receiving conflicting advice. Either he sticks with Ed Miliband and Jeremy Corbyn’s proposals to end the non-dom scam, or he listens to those who say it would be seen as anti-business. Championing fairness could draw a thick red line between Labour and the Tories at the election. The Conservative fish is rotting... Labour needs to use its head.

We are all agreed that you can’t go around slapping people, even though this column remains of the opinion that we are in a weird place with so-called comedians at awards nights: Dead set against violence but prepared to normalise the kind of bullying and humiliation of iniduals at these types of events that would probably earn you a trip to HR in the workplace. Again, shame on Rock who made Smith’s we Jada the butt of his jokes because of her shaven head. It is well known she suffers from alopecia. Would she have been fair gameshe’d had breast cancer  Reading Smith’s autobiography on holiday last week , I was also struck by this in the second chapter. “When I was nine years old, I watched my father punch my mother in the side of her head so hard that she collapsed. I saw her spit blood. That moment in that bedroom, probably more than any other in my le, has defined who I am today. “Within everything that I have done since then – the awards, the accolades, the spotlights and the attention, the characters and the laughs – there has been a subtle string of apologies to my mother for my inaction that day. “For failing her in that moment. For failing to stand up to my father. For being a coward.” None of that excuses his actions two weeks ago. But it does explain why he snapped on that night. His book also details a string of examples he would come to recognise as double standards in his negative treatment over the years. A furious debate is understood to have raged within the Academy’s , members in Whats App groups in the fortnight after Smith’s slap.It would be fascinating to see a Venn diagram of which members were dead set on Smith’s suspension and which ones signed a  petition calling for Polanski – who admitted raping a child four decades ago – to be released from detention in Zurich.It took  years for the Academy to take a stand over Polanski, only expelling him in . Before then he’d won a Best Director Oscar in  to a standing ovation. No statement from the Academy back then blasting his “unacceptable” and “harmful” conduct, as there was last week over Smith. Allegations over the conduct of a string of other big names, including Kevin Spacey, Woody Allen and Mel Gibson have not seen any of them exiled over the last few decades either, even temporarily. But consistency doesn’t appear to be paramount in the minds of the Academy or its members – only appeasing the social media mob.

Removals vans were seen lining up to take furniture and personal items from the flat shared by Mr Sunak and we Akshata Murthy and move them to their newly-refurbished, luxury West London pad. A red velvet armchair, a shelving unit and several bags and boxes were loaded onto two trucks, which arrived at Downing Street’s back gate early on Saturday morning. But the Sunday Mirror understands the move was planned before Mr Sunak’s popularity noseed this week. The family are making the move because their eldest daughter is about to go into her final term of primary school, the Mirror understands. They want to be nearer to her school for the last few months before she goes to boarding school.  Mr Sunak is expected to split his evenings between the Downing Street flat and their Kensington home, but continue to work from Number .Previously a shoe-in to replace Boris Johnson as the next Prime Minister, Mr Sunak’s fortunes have been on the wane since last month’s disastrous Spring Statement failed to provide help for families facing a cost of living crisis. This week it was revealed Mrs Murthy enjoyed non-dom tax status - and Mr Sunak had held on to his Green Card as a ‘resident’ of the United Sates for more than a year after becoming Chancellor. It comes amid calls for partners and spouses of ministers to be banned from being non-doms - and avoiding paying tax on money made outside the UK. Labour said Mr Sunak and his family potentially saved tens of millions of pounds in taxes through his weaposs non-dom status. And Shadow Transport Secretary Louise Haigh blasted the chancellor for not being transparent about his family’s tax status. “He has come out on a number of occasions to try and muddy the waters around this and to obfuscate, she said. Mrs Murty announced on Friday that she would voluntarily pay UK taxes on all her worldwide income as she did not want her financial arrangements to be a distraction for her husband. But she will keep her non-dom status, which allows her to take advantage of India’s zero rate of inheritance tax on her family’s multi-million pound business empire. And the SNP called on Mr Sunak to publish his tax s.Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the scandal showed the Chancellor and his we lived in a completely dferent universe in financial terms from ordinary people left struggling by the cost-of-living crisis. The Lib Dems have called on the PM to ban the wives and partners of ministers from using the non-dom “loophole”.

And he was reportedly weighing up quitting after admitting holding a US green card while Chancellor – which foreign ministers are supposedly not permitted to do. The White House was urged to probe the claim. Mr Sunak also faces reports that he is listed as a beneficiary of offshore tax haven trusts, despite pledging to close tax loopholes.  Meanwhile, Infosys, an Indian firm his we holds £million of shares in, is “urgently” reviewing its Moscow base amid claims the Sunaks were benefiting from Putin’s regime. But Mr Sunak was again accused of being out of touch after aides briefed yesterday that he had ordered an “aggressive” Whitehall inquiry into how his we’s tax details were leaked. Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said it was a matter of “basic fairness” that the Chancellor’s family should pay tax like everyone .She said: “I don’t think the Chancellor gets that. That raises real questions about his judgement.” Policing Minister Kit Malthouse said Ms Murty’s status as a non-dom, which she has given up, was “not ideal”, but defended Mr Sunak from colleagues who called his career “toast”. He called Mr Sunak a “smart, clever, committed politician” who steered the economy through Covid.Heiress Ms Murty, who remains an Indian citizen, said on Friday that she would now pay UK tax on all global income so as not to be “a distraction”. It was estimated her non-dom status could have saved her £mil-lion in taxes on share idends.Mr Sunak yesterday said he has written to Boris Johnson asking him to refer his ministerial declarations to the Independent Adviser on Ministers’ Interests.He said: “I have always followed the rules. I hope such a review will provide further clarity.” Sources close to Mr Sunak played down reports that he is moving his family out of Downing Street to escape the media’s glare, saying they want to spend more time in their West London home as elder daughter Krishna completes primary school.

Amid an ongoing row over Rishi Sunakaposs weaposs non-dom status, the Health Secretary came clean about his own use of the scheme before entering Parliament in . Mr Javid also admitted to benefitting from an offshore trust when he worked for Deutsche Bank but said he voluntarily collapsed the trust when he became a minister in . Labour blasted him for hypocrisy over the revelations, which came after the Tories hiked national insurance contributions for millions of Brits last week.Non-dom status is a legal scheme that allows people domiciled abroad to avoid paying UK tax on their overseas income.  The arrangement has come under scrutiny after it emerged that Mr Sunakaposs we Akshata Murty held non-dom status, which could have spared her paying millions of pounds in UK tax.Ms Murty bowed to intense political pressure on Friday and said she will now pay UK tax on her overseas income, which includes an estimated £. million a year in idends from her billionaire fatheraposs IT firm Infosys.In a statement first reported by the Sunday Times, Mr Javid said: I have been domiciled in the UK for tax purposes throughout my entire public le. Given heightened public interest in these issues, I want to be open about my past tax statuses. After a posting in New York between  and , where he paid US taxes, Mr Javid ed to the UK where he was a tax resident.He said: “For some of those years I was non-domiciled for tax purposes, but I paid all UK taxes due on my income and have always done so. It is unclear where he was domiciled during this period but it is understood not to have been Pakistan, where his father was born. Mr Javid went on: “In  I moved to Singapore with my family and was therefore no longer a UK tax resident. In , upon myto the UK, I became tax-resident in the UK again and also proactively chose to give up my non-domiciled status by making the UK my ‘domicile of choice’. He became an MP in  and went on to hold a number of Cabinet jobs, including Chancellor from  to . Mr Javid also admitted to having some financial investments based in an offshore trust before he ed to the UK and entered Parliament.  He said: While this was an entirely legitimate arrangement, on becoming a minister in  I decided to voluntarily collapse that trust, repatriate all assets to the UK and pay  per cent income tax on those assets. “This approach deliberately incurred the heaviest possible tax burden, and offset any accrued benefits from the previous trust arrangement, but I believed it was the right thing to do.”Shadow Health Secretary Wes Streeting said: Last week Sajid Javid was lecturing struggling taxpayers about their duty to pay higher taxes, but this is the guy who spent six years as a non-dom and had an offshore trust to avoid paying his fair share of tax in Britain.Even now, he refuses to sayhe was using a tax haven. The hypocrisy stinks. The luxury of being able to choose how much tax you pay, where you pay it, and when you pay it, is not one that is enjoyed by most people in this country.

Her contracting the virus at the age of  was downplayed by Buckingham Palace. Understandably, the monarch was unable to fulfil a number of engagements and wider poor health caused her to miss ceremonies at which her attendance was once a given. Like many vulnerable and older citizens, even a head of state must look after herself and be cared for carefully because age doesn’t travel alone, as Labour MP Dennis Skinner once observed.

John Wallman, , was astonished at the early morning notication on his mobile phone after having played EuroMillions via the National Lottery app.The retired construction manager, who now spends his spare time entertaining the public and raising money for charity as part of a barbershop chorus, is planning a new house and a holiday getaway to celebrate. He won the special EuroMillions UK Millionaire Maker draw on March .  John, who is originally from Cornwall but now lives in Falkirk, said: I woke up in the early hours of Saturday morning and turned on my phone. A notication came up from the National Lottery app but I didnapost think anything of it until I sat down to breakfast later that morning. I read the notication and it said I had won £,, but I didnapost really believe it. I called the National Lottery Line and even when I heard those words - aposcongratulations, youaposre a winnerapos - I just couldnapost take it in. My we came downstairs and when she saw me in tears on the phone she thought Iaposd been scammed or that something bad had happened. I have played The National Lottery since it started and I normally buy Lucky Dips through the National Lottery app but I also had another ticket Iaposd bought on a whim.  I popped into the shop on my way to tell some family members about my win and won another fiver. Johnaposs great love is singing and he is part of Sweet Harmony Barbershop Chorus, a local group who regularly flex their vocal chords to raise funds for charity. I find singing so liberating and I love performing with Sweet Harmony. We perform for all sorts of local groups and at events. All we ask is for a donation then at the end of each year everything weaposve raised is split between six nominated charities. Now that the news is starting to sink in, the first thing on Johnaposs to-do list is to book a holiday in the sunshine.  Itaposs been such a rollercoaster and I get emotional every time I talk about winning so Iaposve not really had a chance to think about what I am going to do with the money. Booking a holiday, perhaps a cruise, is definitely the first thing though so we can relax, unwind and make some plans. A new house is on the cards too. In fact, thataposs how I broke the news to my step-daughter. I said to her that weaposd decided to move house. Oh and by the way Iaposve won the lottery too!

Alpha was born via C-section on October  last year, weighing in at a chunky lbs oz, making him Britainaposs third largest newborn.Despite not yet being six months old, big boy Alpha - who now weighs st lbs, is already wearing clothing designed for nine to -month-olds. Mum Cherral Mitchell, , told the Sun she has had to wean her hungry little man off milk.Now Alpha loves to chow down on porridge and rusk biscuits, even though most babies donapost do so until at least  weeks. Cherral said: We knew he was going to be a big boy as my bump was huge, but we didnapost realise quite how big he would be until he was here. Iaposd had three babies before and with Alpha it felt like we skipped the newborn stage altogether and went straight to him being three months old.” People often mistake Alpha and his sister Twyla-Bay for twins, despite her being more than three times his age, Cherral said, because Alpha is already almost the same height as her.Alpha starts the day with baby porridge, followed by a oz bottle of baby milk every three hours and a baby rusk biscuit in the evening. Cherral who is also mum to Rouge-Angel, five, Lyon, three, and Twyla-Bay, one, with electrical engineer husband Tyson, , said none of her other children were anywhere near Alpha’s size at the same age.

Cherral added: “When we first saw him, my first thought was he was not going to fit into any of the clothes I’d brought in the hospital bag. Tyson even had to go home to bring back some three to six-month clothes for him.” Hospital staff measured Alpha and began to google records for the largest babies born in the UK right there in the delivery room.

The airline offered the pair an alternative flight but it would not have got them to Dubai in time for their scheduled New Years Eve celebrations. Instead David and Lotte made a mad dash over to Terminal  to catch a last-minute Emirates Air flight at their own expense. David said: The whole point of the holiday was to go for the New Year celebrations. At best after the cancelled flight with British Airways, their rescheduled one would have got us there the day after. After an enjoyable five-day getaway, David and Lotte ed home to Heathrow, in what was a less eventful leg of the journey with only a few hours delay. After months of continuously attempting to contact British Airways, however, David has still not been compensated for the majority of his trip.  The £, sum which he says he was originally owed includes the price of two business class flights from London Heathrow to Dubai, a one night stay at the Wardlow Hotel and a £ airport transfer. Of that huge sum, he has only received £, compensation, which is the industry standard for cancelled flights of that nature. David, who recently ed from a trip to Thailand, was hoping to use some of the money that is owed to him from British Airways in order to fund that. However, his holiday has been and gone, and there are still no signs of getting a full refund any time soon. He insists that he would not be content with a voucher, and has vowed never to fly with the airline again. He added: After hours on hold and countless phone calls over a period of months, the customer relations department got back to me and paid out £, compensation with is the standard aviation compensation for cancelled flights. But British Airways holidays still have not contacted me to pay back my cancelled flight, hotel and transfer costs. Despite continuously trying I still canapost get hold of them.  I recently flew with Emirates Air to Thailand and I had absolutely no problems. Even when I had a slight issue with myflight, I was able to phone someone and they actually picked up. Iaposve even had cancelled flights with Ryanair in recent years - but even with them, I was able to get a refund no problem. Their telephone systems are rigged so you can never get hold of anyone and eventually it hangs up. I have tried for hours and hours. I have sent numerous e-mails to their complains department, you eventually get a response and a case number but nothing happens, it’s a scam. As I see it British Airways have purposely set their systems up so they hold onto customersapos money - and then you can’t get hold of them to sort it out. As time goes on, I try less and less to sort it out because Iaposm in their hands. No one picks up and I just feel hopeless. I am truly at a loss. The whole system is rigged, there is nothing I can do. British Airways has been contacted for a response. It comes as British Airways CEO Sean Doyle was forced to send an apology email to tens of thousands of flyers in response to the barrage of complaints that the airline has received recently - particularly in response to people who have struggled to speak to call handlers about urgent matters.

When the UK was part of the European Union, you only needed to make sure your passport wasnapost expired to travel across the continent. However, new rules as a result of Brexit say you need to see how long your passport has been valid, NorthWalesLive reports. The UK Government website states that UK citizens should have a passport with an expiry date valid for at least three months after the day you plan to leave. However, ABTA warns how much time needs to be left on your passport depends on where you’re travelling to. To add to the confusion, it appears that the requiredof time left on your passport that allows you to travel also ies depending on which airline you are flying with.Polices appear to dfer between EasyJet, Ryanair and British Airways. All countries will have their own rules concerning passport validity and expiration rules. Here’s a list of the most common ones:Australia - Your passport should be valid for the duration of your stay.Barbados - Your passport should be valid for the duration of your stay.Canada - Your passport should be valid for the duration of your stay, butyou have less than six months of validity it may take longer to pass through immigration control.China - Your passport should have at least six months of validity.Egypt - Your passport should have at least six months of validity.European Union - For most European countries, HM Passport Office recommend that on the day you travel you have at least three months left on your passport.Those countries are:AustriaBelgiumCroatiaCyprusCzech RepublicDenmarkEstoniaFinlandFranceGermanyGreeceHungaryIrelandItalyLatviaLithuaniaLuxembourgMaltaNetherlandsPolandPortugalRomaniaSlovakiaSloveniaSpainSwedenIndiaYour passport must be machine-readable, with two blank pages for your visa and valid for a minimum of  days at the time of entry into India.Japan - Your passport should be valid for the duration of your stay.Mexico - Your passport should be valid for the duration of your stay.New Zealand - Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of one month from the date of exit.Singapore - Your passport should have at least six months of validity.South Africa - Rules state that your passport should be valid for at least  days from the date of exit, but it’s recommended that you have at least six months on your passport before it expires. Your passport should also have at least two blank pages when you enter or leave South Africa.Thailand - Your passport should have at least six months of validity.Turkey - Your passport should have at least six months of validity.USA - Your passport should be valid for the duration of your stay. However, your passport must be a biometric ePassport with the silver camera symbol on the front. There are also a number of other rules concerning entry to the USA, which you should check before travelling. If your passport is due to expire, you may be denied entry into the country that you are visiting. The Post Office website states: While most countries such as Australia, Canada and the USA, just need your passport to be valid for theof your stay, other countries such as China, Thailand, Egypt and Turkey need at least six months. You need to have at least six months left on an adult or child passport to travel to most countries in Europe . In general, many countries that require a visa to enter will require at least six months validity on your passport when entering the country, so make sure you find out whether your passport has long enough before it expires before you travel.  If you are flying with Ryanair, you need a valid passport to travel anywhere in the world. If youaposre travelling outside the European Economic Area, your passport must be valid for the period of intended stay exceptyou travel to Jordan, Turkey, Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina. If you hold a non-EU passport, like a British passport, and are travelling into a Schengen member country you must make sure your passport is valid for at least three months from the date you will leave the Schengen member country. There is an exceptionyou have a Schengen-issued residence permit or long-term visa. If you are flying with EasyJet on an international flight, you must hold either a valid EU EEA Swiss National Identity card or Passport, and, where required, a valid Visa. The passport needs to be signed and in good condition and some countries require your passports need valid for a minimum of the period beyond your trip, usually three or six months. For UK passport holders travelling to the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland, your passport must have at least six months on it from the date of your departure. Most European countries have a time frame of three months. If you are flying with British Airways you need to have a passport or equivalent that will be valid for the duration of your trip. All children need their own passports, including infants under two years old.

Frances Fricker complained when her boss, Giuseppe Ajroldi from international business consultancy firm Gartner, continuously used the term despite her asking him not to. The tribunal heard he also mocked Ms Frickeraposs weight by saying she looked aposfatapos in photos and once tried to kiss and touch her on a business trip. On several occasions he replied to her working saying “good girl”. The tribunal found in her favour, noting how “language evolves over time” and once “harmless phrases” are now seen as racial, homophobic and sexist.”  The  heard Mr Ajroldi also aposfrequentlyapos referred to Ms Fricker as a aposgood girlapos, which she responded to on one occasion with a aposfacepalmapos emoji alongside the female gender symbol. She added aposIaposm an independent woman for goodness sakeapos, to which Mr Ajroldi aposplayed dumbapos and replied aposgood girl is not appropriate... apos. After telling him the phrase was aposjust a little condescendingapos he hit back saying apossorry, I didnapost want to offend an independent womanapos. The tribunal heard Mr Ajroldi used the patronising phrase twice more that month in February , with Ms Fricker telling him: Iaposm not even going to respond. After he promised not to call her the name again she answered his original question, and Mr Ajroldi replied: Ok, thanks good girl. In August  Mr Ajroldi aposinsistedapos in joining Ms Fricker on an overnight business trip and was rebuffed after making aposunwanted sexual advancesapos towards her including attempting to aposkiss and touchapos her in her hotel room. He apologised the following morning and Ms Fricker told him explicitly that this behaviour aposneeded to stopapos. But the following month she felt aposshocked, disgusted and threatenedapos after Mr Ajroldi suggested it would be aposfunnyaposhe organised a date with her aposdisguised as someone apos on a dating app she used. When she raised a grievance against Mr Ajroldi, Ms Fricker was told managers regarded his behaviour as aposreciprocalapos and that she had aposparticipated in the behaviourapos. Now, after being forced into resigning, mother Ms Fricker is in line to win compensation after suing Gartner for sexual harassment. The tribunal heard Mr Ajroldi was part of a apostoxicapos and male-dominated culture at Gartner, which has a Europe headquarters in Egham, Surrey, and an office in London.Mr Ajroldi later left the company - but was not sacked - but Ms Fricker was still harassed by other male colleagues, including being called an aposoxygen thiefapos. She resigned in October , telling bosses: The continued bullying, victimisation and less favourable treatment Iaposve received as a result of a previous harassment grievance, not creating a safe environment to work in, forcing me to work in a hostile environment and not sporting a reasonable request to move into a dferent team to allow me to perform well is the final act and one I can no longer tolerate. Employment Judge Gary Tobin said the extent of such a aposdiscriminatoryapos culture was aposrareapos in his experience, and added language which may once have appeared aposharmlessapos now had a dferent meaning. He said: We are an experienced tribunal and note that documentary evidence indicating such a discriminatory culture is rare. The harassment started slightly at first with comments, particularly about her appearance and her standingwhich then escalated into inappropriate advances. Language evolves over time. Words and phrases that might once have seemed harmless are now regarded as racial, homophobic and sexist slurs. Some phrases, whilst not regarded as taboo, are generally regarded as inappropriate in the workplace. Referring to a woman in her late-s with a school-age child as a girl is demeaning. We find Ms Fricker was sexually harassed and treated less favourably because of her rejection of the harassment. Ms Frickeraposs claims of constructive unfair dismissal also succeeded, though other complaints of sex discrimination and victimisation failed. Compensation will be determined at a later date.

The couple, who live in Melksham, Wiltshire, have been forced to give up their social lives as cash is so tight and have even stopped using their oven to keep bills down. Gerald served in the Royal Air Force for  years and feels the country he devoted his le to is letting him down. He tells The Mirror: “I don’t want to complain really because I‘ve had a good le, but it comes as a huge disappointment.In the quiet hours when you sit and think, well we did all that and we’ve ended up with all this worry. You’re sort of living on the edge really. “I don’t knowit’s a matter of age but you think, what did we do all that for  Le has changed completely. Before, we would go out lunching and that sort of thing, meeting friends - but we don’t do that anymore. We can’t afford it, every penny has got to be watched. For years, I’ve contributed to causes like the Salvation Army or UNICEF. I give them maybe £ or £ a month - not much - but that’s all stopped. I just can’t afford it. It grieves me to do it, but there you go, I just can’t do anything about it.” Since their bills jumped from £ to £, Gerald and Mair have started setting strict budgets for their daily gas and electricity usage, which means giving up the use of their central heating altogether. Gerald has worked out that it costs him p to boil his kettle - a cheaper solution that allows both him and Mair to surround themselves with multiple hot water bottles to stay warm while at home.They’ve also stopped using the oven to keep costs low, relying instead on their microwave. He said: “We’re on a fixed income so there’s nothing we can do about it. I can put it on and go into debt but I just want somebody to do something. “I can’t imagine a time that I can turn the heating on again, there’s nothing in sight and there’s nothing  I can do” “The dference between £ and £ - it’s a chasm that I can’t cross. I’m not putting the heating on because I refuse to go into into debt.” Gerald added: At night, we cover the bed in coats and use an extra blanket because Mair is particularly susceptible to the cold. We wear coats indoors now. They’re like long jackets lined with synthetic wool. We’re having to use those in bed too just to make sure we keep warm. As you get older, the extremes of heat and cold affect you more. “We’ve got an Aga, but we have no plans to use that. Putting it on would be absolutely catastrophic. We just use it for storage - it’s just a nice piece of furniture now, nothing .And yet this isnapost the only dficulty that the couple are facing, as the cost increase came shortly after -year-old Mair was diagnosed with vascular dementia. Gerald added:I’m trying to take it in my stride. It’s unavoidable, but just another thing to worry about really. Iaposm afraid with my weaposs illness, they sort of retreat within themselves. She doesnapost have opinions now. She has very basic feelings like aposI’m too coldapos or aposI’m too hot.aposGerald went viral on Twitter last month after sharing a message about how the price hikes are impacting their lives. He said: “Our heating is the biggest expense we’ve got. We live on very average pensions, and the reason why I put the tweet out wasnapost an appeal for help or anything, it was anger.

She thinks the trio worked as a team to fleece her in the shocking broad daylight theft.  Since the incident Lola, who is a widow, has struggled to sleep and has become wary of leaving her home in Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire. The mother of four told Express: I have been told this activity is re, particularly in some supermarket car parks in and around London. Itaposs affected me very much. I have been struggling to sleep because I think about it all the time.It is just so clear in my mind. I have felt sad and worried, and stupid to be honest. It is just very upsetting. I have been very very upset and I no longer trust people. It was absolutely disgusting. The money is yet to be reimbursed into Ms Sledmereaposs account although police are investigating the theft. Ms Sledmere, who worked in psychology, added: Of course, it has impacted me financially too.I am a pensioner. I have a state pension but Iaposm not well off at all. I live alone, so of course it is going to affect me financially.I have seven grandchildren who all need money and it is upsetting I canapost help them at the moment. After Ms Sledmere paid for her shopping, itaposs thought she was followed out of the supermarket and to her car by the man who saw her PIN. She put her shopping and handbag in her vehicle, left it unlocked as she turned to push the trolley to the bay just yards away. But another man spoke to her at the bay, asking for directions to Chesham, which is less than three miles away. Ms Sledmere said: I thought this was strange.I thought he was being a bit stupid actually as there are plenty of signs for Chesham and itaposs only around the corner. But I offered help.Someone previously must have looked over my shoulder and got my PIN number when I was paying at the checkout.The checkout was the very one closest to the enclosure where people pay for their own groceries so it is pretty open and easy just for someone to stand there and not to be noticed.

Britains are being encouraged to break out the sunscreen as another mini heatwave is set to boost temperatures over the coming days, following the hot weather earlier in March.Over the next  days the weather is set to get warmer and more stable as high pressure builds pulling air in from the Atlantic.James Madden, forecaster for Exacta Weather, told the Express : “After the weekend we expect to see more in the way of high pressure building over the UK.“This could bring temperatures back up to something like we saw at the end of March.  “It will also turn more settled, again as we see high pressure taking more of a dominant effect over the weather.” But a risk of spring showers remains, with the possibility of downpours on Monday and Friday for much of the UK, despite rising temperatures. The start of the week will mark the end of the colder weather seen over the past week in parts of the country. Parts of Scotland and Northern Britain will be slower to catch up with the rising temperatures, with the possibility of frosts and wintry downpours remaining during the start of this week. Rain is also predicted early in the week for northern and western regions as low pressure moves in from the Atlantic.  However for many, Monday will see temperatures raising as the sun breaks through for the run up to the bank holiday. Met Office meteorologist Aidan McGivern said warmer weather is on the way for the start of the week.“With a southerly air flow, it is certainly going to feel warmer,we get some brightness in the southeast, temperatures could top out at C, mid-teens where,” he predicted. “For the next  days, the general trend is for it to turn warmer with higher pressure increasingly through next week and into the following next week.”  Britons could be in for a barbecue Easter weekend with highs of C possible next weekend, according to some forecasters. High pressure will build keeping chilly northerly winds out and allowing warm gusts in from the south. Jim Dale, meteorologist for British Weather Services, said: “It is going to warm up from where we are at the moment. “Next week we could see temperatures in the high teens, and I would not be surprisedby Easter weekend we saw C. “It is fair to say that the week to come is not going to be a bad one.”  Balmy forecasts have prompted books to slash the odds on an Easter scorcher with Ladbrokes offering - on an Easter sizzler. Spokesman Alex Apati said: At last it looks as though Brits will have something to smile about on the weather front, with a record-breaking Easter scorcher potentially on the cards. However, allergy sufferers should watch out for rising tree pollen levels as experts sound the hay-fever alarm. Airbourne allergens expert Max Wiseberg said: “High pollen counts are forecast across the south and east of England on Monday. “Tree pollen could be released earlier than usual and in a shorter space of time leading to a more severe tree-pollen season. “People with allergies should prepare a hay-fever kit to suit their needs which may contain antihistamines and a nasal balm.” Met Office meteorologist Dan Stroud said: “The mild theme is going to persist for a good part of next week. “The wind direction goes into reverse after the weekend bringing milder temperatures. “This is down to tropical maritime air from the southwest which could also bring some cloud and rain. “But, through the start of the week it is going to feel very pleasant, and we expect mild conditions to hold out for a good chunk of the week.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON WeatherHolidaysHeatwave\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Fancy an escape to the Chill newsletter for weekly inspiration and advice on UK holidays Sign Up!Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Charlene Brown was with her two daughters while taking out cash from a Tesco Express in Peckham Rye to buy them all a Chinese takeaway on March .But to Charleneaposs horror, her two girls Azariah, eight, and six-year-old Kimoire were thrown to the floor while two men were tussling with each other outside the supermarket, reports MyLondon.The mum-of-two claims the attacker, a -year-old man who is non-verbal and has disabilities, hit both of the youngsters as his signicantly shorter carer struggled to restrain him. After calling  the police rushed to the shop on Rye Lane and got there very quickly, Charlene said. Speaking to MyLondon, Charlene, who lives in Brockley, said: My girls ran to me and screamed aposhe pushed meapos while crying hysterically. I went up to the men and screamed aposwhat’s going on  You’ve hurt my childrenapos. He kicked Kimoire, then I realised that Azariah was crying and her nose was bleeding. A Tesco security guard asked us to come in the store so they could attend to my eldest daughters bleeding nose. The police arrived within seconds and eventually, they explained that because the attacker is autistic and non-verbal, that meant that an arrest could not be made. Charlene, who works in a mental health inpatient ward at Lambeth Hospital, claims that both her daughters are emotionally scarred following the incident and that they are now too scared to leave the house.She added: I’m in the process of trying to arrange counselling as they’re having struggles with social spaces now. The worst part is nothing can be done. I think accountability should be taken somewhere. My children have been hurt and no one is responsible, which I think disgraceful.  Azariah and Kimoire are currently staying at their grandmotheraposs house in Bedfordshire over the Easter break - and mum Charlene is glad that they are able to enjoy some downtime in a quieter area following the unprovoked attack.Now, the NHS worker is concerned that the same thing could happen to a pregnant woman, or a baby, or another vulnerable person.Charlene says she felt disheartened that no one stopped to check that her daughters were alright, other than two local schoolboys, even though plenty of people witnessed the incident. She added: I just want to make the streets safe andpeople are hurt someone needs to take accountability. A politan Police spokesperson confirmed the incident took place. They said: Police were called at around .pm on Thursday, March , to a shop on Peckham Ryefollowing reports that a child had been pushed by a man. The girl fell to the ground and suffered minor injuries.Officers attended and detained a -year-old man who was with his carer. Due to his vulnerabilities, the man was not arrested. The circumstances were explained to the child’s mother. No further action will be taken.

Iris Jones, , fell for Mohamed Ahmed Ibriham, , three years ago in  despite their massive -year age gap.The loved-struck couple married a year later in  but have had to spend time apart the past month after Mohamedaposs father fell ill and he rushed back to Cairo to visit him.But their month spent thousands of miles apart has lead Iris to a major revelation, and has helped her realise what a priceless gem her hubby is, Manchester Evening News reports.  Iris welcomed him home last weekend, then reflected on how lucky she is to have him on Facebook.The British grandma, from Somerset, was swept off her feet when she met Mohamed in  through a Facebook page for atheists. They tried to get married in Cairo just four days after they first met in person, but they didnapost have the right paperwork. They were eventually able to wed a year later, and he was able to move in with her shortly afterwards when he was granted a three-year visa. Iris wrote on Sunday: Love is knowing you look like s**t after a days housework and gardening, without a scrap of make up on dressed in my scruff! After a monthaposs absence, my wonderful husband will welcome me just the way I am, because thataposs what love is all about.Welcome home, Mohamed. Missing you this past month has made me realise what a priceless gem you are. This rough diamond of a we will be more appreciative of you in the future. In an earlier Facebook post, Iris uploaded a photo of a suitcase, and explained in the comments: My husband had to make an emergency dash to Egypt as his father was ill. The update comes after the pensioner made headlines in January  by sharing intimate details of their sex le.Speaking on ITVaposs This Morning, she had hosts Philip Schofield and Holly Willoughby blushing. Describing their first night of passion, Iris said: “Pretty rough. Nobody had been near me for  years. I thought I was a virgin again.“Can I say we used a whole tube of KY Jelly  I couldn’t walk the next day. I felt asI had been riding a horse. Saddle sore wasn’t in it. Anyway we got over that.”  The pairaposs romance caused a rt in Irisapos family, with her previously opening up about how her two sons, both in their mid-s, had struggled to come to terms with their mumaposs relationship with a man  years her junior.Speaking with the Sunday Mirror back in , she said: Darren [one of her sons] is worried Mohamed is just after my money and we had a big row which resulted in me asking him to leave the house.We have made up since, but I’ve asked him not to talk about it – I don’t want to argue. Her other son Steve, , was aposa bit wary,apos according to Iris, but said she thinks he will eventually accept Mohamed as his dad.“If he’s marrying me for my fortune he’ll be sadly disappointed because I live on a pension, she said to those who questioned why Mohamed was with her. I don’t suffer fools gladly. I’m honest and I’m truthful and I told him straight away he couldn’t be a freeloader. “In Egypt we were quite frivolous, going out to the best restaurants all the time and we split everything  . She said Mohamed had agreed to sign a pre-nup to prove his love for her. It’s me he wants – not my house, she said. “I’ve spent years making other people happy, now I just want to marry the man I love before I die.

And the topic of debate would be whether to toast it or simply eat it fresh, obviously with lashings of butter. But now, the supermarkets have decided that the traditional flavour was not enough. From every angle, youaposre bombarded with dferent flavours - from salted caramel to triple cheese. If youaposre a purist like me, itaposs enough to make you weep. In my opinion, the humble hot cross bun needs nothing more than plenty of fruit, a hint of spice and a glazed topping. But this isnapost enough for the modern world, so, I sampled some of the unusual offerings on sale this year. We sampled a range of hot cross buns from Waitrose, MS, Co-op, Aldi, Lidl, Sainsbury’s and Tesco and gave each one a score out of five. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter hereMS  Extremely Cheesy Hot Cross Buns Blurb: Loaded with Extra Mature Barberaposs Farmhouse Cheddar  Smooth Red Leicester.What I thought: It’s a delicious cheese bun. But I just can’t get on board with the idea it’s a hot cross bun. It has none of the elements that turn it into one- except that it’s mockingly marked with a pastry cross. I would give this a ⅖ and only because there was cheese involved. Co-op Spiced Masala  Chilli Hot Cross BunsBlurb: Hot cross buns with caramelised onions, sultanas, ground spices and dried jalapeño chillies.What I thought: Surprisingly good. This is an elevated hot cross bun - the sweet caramelised onion pairs well with the spiced bun, while the jalapenos give a little kick. A delightful savoury treat.   Sainsburyaposs Chocolate  Caramel Hot Cross BunsBlurb: Hot cross buns made with salted caramel pieces, dark chocolate chunks and caramel fudge piecesWhat I thought: Adults should have no more than seven teaspoons of sugar per day, but this feels like that would exceed it. It is a sugary nightmare, but the caramel fudge pieces offer something dferent. Overall itaposs quite stodgy and at times, it tastes a bit synthetic.   Lidl Deluxe Triple Chocolate Hot Cross BunsBlurb: Delightfully soft, triple chocolate buns filled with indulgent milk, dark and white chocolate piecesWhat I thought: Iaposm a big fan of chocolate, so I really wanted to like these, but while they look pretty good, the first bite was dry and stale - as was the next and the next. The taste was slightly improved when the chocolate melted as it gave a little more sweetness, but it wasnapost enough to make me want to eat a whole one.  MS Salted Caramel  Blond Chocolate Hot Cross BunsBlurb: Delicately spiced hot cross buns enriched with golden blond and milk chocolate, salted caramel fudge and toffee pieces.What I thought: Hard to see how these are ‘delicately spiced’ when all you can taste is chocolate and caramel. These pack a serious sugar punch, rather than the more delicate flavours you’d normally expect from a traditional bun. If you’d like to eat a sweet pick-me-up, this is perfect, but book a visit to the dentist afterwards.   Aldi Rhubarb and Custard Hot Cross BunsBlurb : Packed full of delicious candied rhubarb with custard flavouring.What I thought : Definitely the sweetest hot cross bun I have ever tasted. The bun itself was quite light in colour and the actual taste was quite similar to that of brioche. They did not have as much fruit in them compared to a traditional hot cross bun but the candied rhubarb was a welcome sugar fix.  These are a very sweet treat and the flavours in their work really well together. Maybe they arenapost that traditional but they are certainly inventive. MS Blueberry Hot Cross Buns Blurb: Four butter enriched hot cross buns with juicy Vostizza currants and sweetened dried blueberries. Best served toasted with a spread of butter.What I thought: These were a total disappointment. Similarly to Dr Ashenden, I brand these an outrage. Itaposs basically a brioche bun with blueberries on it, and a white cross draped on top as an afterthought. The fruit is lovely and juicy, and they smell great, but I wonapost be buying another pack. ⅖The winner: Frankly, only Co-op stood a chance here, the rest were far too sweet and stodgy. I’d recommend sticking to a traditional hot cross bun.

Months before her wedding to Harry, Meghan along with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge held the Royal Foundationaposs first forum event. At the event, the two couples talked about the charity foundation and its plans for the future.The foundation was set up by Prince William, Kate and Harry with Meghan joining them and speaking at the event in February .During the forum, she remarked how she was keen to hit the ground running when it came to working with royal charities. However, according to The , in her new book The Palace Papers, royal author Tina Brown recalls that Meghanaposs comment caused shudders at the Palace, where things work a lot slower.In an interview with the newspaper, Ms Brown, a former editor of Vanity Fair who was friends with Princess Diana, said: I think Meghan felt she could get in there and change it all. Frankly, she could have done a great deal to change things had she stuck around, but the thing that’s most baffling is such impatience. She could have spent a year away and come back with a great game plan.

Paige Rice, , was a passenger in an Audi S when it was involved in a fatal smash with a a Mercedes taxi in the Queensway Tunnel in October last year.Her ex-partner Callum Miller, , a labourer from Stockport, was clocking speeds of mph as he drove the Audi through the tunnel - which connects Liverpool and Birkenhead.An inquest into their deaths, held at Gerard Majella Courthouse in Kirkdale on January , heard Merseyside Police initially launched a criminal investigation into a potential offence of causing death by dangerous driving.But the probe was dropped when it became clear Callum would not survive.Dashcam footage of the crash, which also left the taxi driver with le-changing injuries to his leg and hip, has now emerged on social media, the Liverpool Echo reports. Clare Rice, Paigeaposs mum said she has not been able sleep since finding out that the video was circulating online as she asked people to remove any posts containing the footage. Ms Rice wrote: Yesterday, I found out there’s a video circulating on social media, a video of the crash that killed my daughter. Now I have no idea who has this video and how it’s got online but I want you to know, I’ve not slept since and I feel sick to the stomach. After we lost Paige I was askedI wanted to view the footage, I chose not to for my own sanity. When you grieve someone who’s died and in such a tragic way, Your mind chooses what to think about and what to block out.Finding out the video was online has been really triggering for me, moments which I’d been blocking out to survive my days were now at the forefront of my mind. Why would you want to watch my daughteraposs last moments  I’m heartbroken, the thought of strangers, people who don’t know Paige or me watching something so traumatic and distressing. When people post such personal pictures or videos without consent, it can have a serious impact on people’s lives. Ms Rice said her le has been turned upside down by the death of her daughter as she shared a series of photos of herself with Paige growing up. She continued: I’m still Paige’s mum and I still have that protective instinct. I know Paige would hate that this video is online. Look at these pictures, this is my beautul baby girl Paige.  She was taken from us in October, only  years old. No matter how old your child gets, they’re still our babies. I had Paige at a young age and it’s Pretty much always been us three. My le has revolved around my children and making sure they never went without. I can’t tell you how much my le has been turned upside down since loosing my daughter. When you lose a child, just getting through an hour is an accomplishment.  The last five months has been a blur when it comes to time and I don’t know how I’m surviving each day with this heartache, a pain you will never know, unless you’ve lived it. To cause added stress and upset is disrespectful and thoughtless. My le will never be the same again. I’ve lost my daughter and my friend and my son has lost his sister and we’ve all lost a massive piece of our lives. Paige left behind many broken hearts, she is loved and now missed by so many people, someone’s daughter, sister, granddaughter, niece, cousin and friend. We don’t deserve any more upset. I hope the posts are removed, I’d be extremely thankful.

The monarch had already faced months of mobility issues that saw her pull out of high-profile public events before Buckingham Palace revealed she contracted coronavirus in February.On Sunday Her Majesty spoke about her condition during a video call with the Royal London Hospital to mark the official opening of its Queen Elizabeth Unit. Talking to former Covid patient Asef Hussain and his we Shamina, the Queen said: “It does leave one very tired and exhausted, doesn’t it   This horrible pandemic. It’s not a nice result.”This has led to increased speculation that her Jubilee appearances will be signicantly scaled back this summer, with royal biographer Angela Levin telling the MailOnline she believes the Queen will limit her activity.She said: Itaposs going to be very dficult and I think they will only show her in a few instances, maybe at the service at St Paulaposs. That will be very important to her because she is a Christian. I don’t think weaposll see her around and about. Maybe sheaposll be well enough to sit and watch horses. It wonapost be her, everywhere. Butshe is there, she will appreciate the fact the public will be wanting to be there and supporting her.  I imagine that the aides are worried thatthe public donapost see her, people may think thatsheaposs not there itaposs not worth us going. Iaposm sure everyone in the Palace hopes that people will turn up to show their respects and say thank you for an extraordinary reign both inand in breadth. The Palace has been approached for comment. The Queen, who had “mild cold-like” ­Covid symptoms, has recently been suffering from mobility issues, forcing her to cancel a number of public engagements. Buckingham Palace announced on Friday that she had decided not to attend an annual Easter church service.Prince Charles will for the first time represent his mother at the Royal Maundy Thursday service at St George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle, Berkshire.It will be only the fth time she has missed the event in her -year reign.

Brendon Grimshaw, from Dewsbury, in Kirklees, West Yorkshire, abandoned his high-pressured old le in the face of unemployment - before the age of  - and took an extended holiday. In , he purchased Moyenne, a tiny island just half a mile wide in the luxurious Seychelles, a cluster of islands in the Indian Ocean.The ex-journalist immediately fell in love with his new home, with its tranquil silence and wild tangle of vegetation, Yorkshire Live reports.Brendon lived almost completely alone on the island. Moyenne had been left abandoned for decades, prior to his arrival and was so overgrown that falling coconuts were said to never reach the ground.  It has previously been likened to a tiny rainforest erupting from the ocean. With the help of -year-old Rene Antoine Lafortune, the son of a local fisherman, Brendon set about forging paths through the undergrowth. They also planted trees in an attempt to transform the island. Brendon built a humble wooden home for himself. But to truly transform the island he knew he would need to nurture itaposs wildle back to full health. He gradually introduced giant tortoises to his corner of the Indian Ocean and eventually shared Moyenne with  of the indigenous creatures.  Brendonaposs relentless hard work inevitably attracted the attention of wealthy investors, who viewed the Seychelles as a tropical paradise and an ideal spot for a luxury holiday destination. The aposreal le Robinson Crusoeapos - also since compared to the Tom Hanks character in the  film Castaway - is said to have turned down close to £million for his small island. But he wanted to ensure its future in a dferent way, and not to line corporate pockets. As he had no children to pass the island to at the time of his death, Brendon signed a perpetual trust with the Seychellesapos Ministry of Environment in . The agreement marked the islandaposs transformation into a National Park. To this day, it remains the smallest island in the world to hold that title. Brendon passed away in  and his grave sits alongside that of his father, who came to live with him in later le. His tombstone reads: Moyenne taught him to open his eyes to the beauty around him and say thank you to God. The island is now overseen by the Moyenne Island Foundation and remains largely undeveloped.A restaurant serving local dishes, a small museum dedicated to Brendonaposs le, and two nurseries for giant tortoise hatchlings form the only additions to the area, reports the BBC. No more than  visitors are allowed on the island at any one time, even during peak tourist season.

Sabina Nessa, , was murdered by Koci Selamaj in a park in South East London last September. He has been jailed for le after pleading guilty to the horric crime and had refused to attend sentencing proceedings in court last week, with Mr Justice Sweeney calling this decision cowardly - a video link was made available to him, but he turned it down. Sister Jebina Yasmin Islam told BBC Radio aposs Today programme this morning she didnapost feel her sisteraposs murder received enough press coverage. She said: My sister didn’t get as much headlines, I feel, at the start. Maybe was it down to her ethnicity  “She didn’t get the front pages on some of the papers and, in Sarah Everard’s case, she did. I think it’s just down to our ethnicity, to be honest. And I feel likewe were a normal British white family we would have been treated equally, I guess.” She also said that there has been no support from the Government, describing people in senior positions as useless. She added: Theyaposve not said nothing.  Priti Patel has done a tweet on Friday and I was not happy about it because all of a sudden sheaposs using my sisteraposs name for publicity reasons. And to be honest she has no right.Afterwards, Jebina appeared on ITV to speak about her sister.Speaking about the huge loss, Jebina explained: Itaposs all surreal, it feels like a bad dream that weaposre all going through. Itaposs just heartbreaking, you would never have thought that your young -year-old sister was brutally taken away.  If she was like ill, we could have had some time to spend time with her, make memories. But her le was taken away without a second thought and out of nowhere. Itaposs impacted us a lot, itaposs impacted myself, my sisters, weaposre scared to walk the streets alone now, and also given the time of day as well. It was also revealed that Sabina had plans to one day become a headteacher. On Frida, Selamaj was jailed for le and must serve a minimum of  years. Sabina was strangled after being struck on the head  times with a hazard triangle. Following Koci’s sentencing, Sabina’s sister Jebina Islam hit out at Home Secretary Priti Patel for her “lack of support”.She responded to a tweet from Ms Patel, who insisted she was doing “everything in her power” to tackle violence against women and girls.Jebina wrote: Yes @pritipatel you don’t know what we as a family are going through and to be honest you haven’t even bothered to ask since the death of my sister.

Several homes in Beville Street, Fenton, have had chalk marks left on the walls, sparking fear among families.Plain circles and circles with a diagonal line have been drawn in white chalk on the properties. The method is often associated with burglaries and has also been linked to dog thefts, the Stoke Sentinel reports.However, utility workers are also known to leave signs on walls to indicate an area has been checked for potential issues like a gas leak or to earmark where a water pipe is located.  Nick Taylor lives in one of the homes that has been marked in Beville Street. The -year-old says it has left him feeling aposworriedapos. He said: Iaposve heard about people doing it. Itaposs usually done for dogs. My doorbell picks up on anyone who walks outside my house, so I will have a look through my doorbell footage for anyone suspicious. Iaposll be keeping an eye out and Iaposll wash the mark off and have a look up the street. Cha Colemanaposs property, in Beville Street, has also been marked. The -year-old said: Itaposs peculiar. A lady messaged me a few weeks ago about people using chalk to mark houses.  I never saw anyone do it. Iaposm a bit creeped out. Iaposll just be keeping an eye out. Touch wood, weaposve lived here since  and had nothing other than two bikes stolen last year. I work from home, so Iaposd see themthey tried to break in as Iaposm home all the time. Maybe itaposs just a utility company because itaposs on almost every house. George Millwardaposs property in Beville Street has not been marked with the chalk, but he says everyone in the street is keeping an eye out. The -year-old said: Iaposve been told itaposs burglars. We donapost have one on our house, but one or two have got them. Iaposm not worried about it because Iaposve got nothing for them to pinch. But everyone is keeping more of an eye out. We always do, me and the we.  I hope itaposs just something innocent. The police have been informed by a woman up the road. She told the police about it after she had a marking appear. The Safeguarding Hub - which shares home protection advice and information across the UK - previously said: Between us, we have a fairly extensive knowledge of burglary. We have spent many hours speaking to distraught victims, visiting crime scenes and dealing with burglars. We have actually seen and experienced these symbols being used by criminals. This is not to say that this is a common practice between bands of thieves, for most burglars work alone. We do not want to scaremonger and we can say confidentially that the use of these symbols is very rare.  But,you are a caregiver to an elderly or vulnerable person and spot strange marks outside their home, do you really want to dismiss it out of hand without just ensuring that the symbol is legitimate  Elsewhere in the country, the symbols have been dubbed the aposDa Pinci Codeapos with dferent signs for aposnothing worth stealingapos, aposwealthyapos and aposgood targetapos. A triangle symbol is used to show a single woman lives in the property on her own, or vertical lines could imply a house has obvious valuables inside. Also keep an eye out for the letters ‘M’, which tells other burglars to strike in the morning, whereas ‘N’ means a night-time intrusion.

The NHS Confederation has accused the Government of abandoning any interest in Covid whatsoever and says hospitals are set to deal with a brutal Easter as bad as any winterapos.Last week Covid cases hit the highest since February  at , infections. That is despite official tallies having plunged because of Noaposs decision to axe the £billion-a-month mass-swabbing regime. The NHS Confederation, which acts as a representative for hospitals and ambulance trusts, called for mitigating actions such as not meeting people indoors and mask-wearing in crowded spaces. This would help prevent the spread of the virus, the health and wellbeing organisation told The Times.It also said the Government needs to introduce a public information campaign in England to ask people to stay away from AE unless they have an emergency.The so-called coronavirus dashboard shows casesdecreasing, however hospitalisations and deaths are still rising although both statistics usually lag behind infections.It is estimated a record one in  people currently have coronavirus in England.  Confederation boss Matthew Taylor said: NHS leaders report a clear disconnect between the Governmentaposs Living with Covid plan and the realities at the NHS front line. We have a Government that seems to want to wash its hands of responsibility for what is occurring in plain sight up and down the country. No  has seemingly abandoned any interest in Covid whatsoever.It comes after Boris Johnson said he canapost rule out another Covid lockdown after previously promising the route to normality was irreversible following two years of draconian restrictions. Mr Johnsonaposs plan has been for us to learn to live with Covid, and the lack of panic from rising cases appears to be due to reports that the latest strain doesnapost cause any more severe illness. Free Covid tests have now ended for the majority of people in England. Only the vulnerable, including those with health conditions and high-risk jobs, will be eligible to pick up swabs without paying. Health bosses still say that vaccines are the best line of defence and spring booster jabs are being rolled out for certain groups.

Trafford Builders uncovered a -year-old nuclear bunker under Trafford town hall as part of its multi-million pound renovation. A maze of bricked tunnels, foot-thick steel and reinforced concrete, the vast chamber was designed to house top brassthe nuclear sirens sounded. The ,sq ft fall-out shelter was designed as part of the council’s s extension to the town hall. Its inclusion in the plans caused outrage among anti-nuclear campaigners, who furiously attacked it as a waste of money. But town hall chiefs said it was an ‘essential’ part of its civil defence against an all-out attack. Now empty apart from a generator and air filtration system, the labyrinth, built by structural engineer Ray Higham once included a cavernous storage room of dried food, government radio equipment and – rumour has it – a morgue. Cheadle Built in the height of The Cold War, The Mill Lane bunker in Cheadle, which was designed to withstand direct missile attacks, was intended to house bigwigs while they sat out nuclear hostilities before emerging into a devastated but presumably fall-out free world.Ten years after being put up for sale by the Ministry of Defence, the bunker was demolished to make way for more car parking spaces for staff working at the nearby Alexandra Hospital.Although it had  rooms, the musty-smelling bunker, built with five feet-thick concrete walls, was built to accommodate up to  people, the bunker was intended as a command post for ministers in the event of a nuclear holocaust and contained an antiquated telephone switchboard as well as emergency generators and telecommunications equipment. Manchester city centre  Manchesteraposs nuclear bunkers - hidden ft beneath the streets between St Peteraposs Square and Piccadilly Gardens - were refurbished and offered for rent as offices. The network of tunnels, which spreads under the city out to Ardwick and Salford, removed from the protection of the Official Secrets Acts in the s, are still guarded around the clock by security staff. But they are unknown to the vast majority of people who walk above them daily. The entrances to the tunnels, including two in George Street, are surrounded by barbed wire and security gates. Telephone Exchange, as it is called, has a main tunnel running more then  yards from St Peteraposs Square up to the Piccadilly Plaza Hotel in the city centre. Smaller tunnels run across the city. They were built in the s when the fear of nuclear war was at its height and were so secret that Polish immigrants unable to speak a word of English were employed to build them. In the event of the city being damaged by an atomic bomb, the tunnels would have be used to maintain vital telecommunication networks with other cities across the UK. Worsley Woods Tucked away in a far corner of the RHS Bridgewater site in Worsley, a relic from the Cold War is now camouflaged by graffiti as well as foliage, and has been a destination for so-called aposurban explorersapos.Dug into hillside in , the bunker was constructed when the potential of a nuclear strike by a Joseph Stalin-led Soviet Russia was deemed to be at its height.It was built by the War Office as an anti-aircraft operations room on land at Worsley New Hall, and was part of a national network of defences which included an alternative seat of government to the House of Commons - underground at Box Hill near in Corsham in Wiltshire. Oldham  At the height of global panic, a nuclear bunker was built under the then newly-constructed Oldham Civic Centre. It was designed to act as a safe room to protect the town’s decision-makers and civic leaders from any nuclear attack or fall-out. Thankfully it was never used, but many thousands of people have walked into the ft-high tower off West Street ever since without knowing what lies beneath their feet. Today the bunker, made up of subterranean corridors and rooms, is used for storage. The dferent chambers, reinforced by concrete and brick, were part of the centre’s overall design. It opened in  but the bunker wasn’t publicised.

Growing up in Italy, Claudia Serra knew something was dferent about her voice. She realised that she couldnapost scream in the playground like other children and singing in school plays was hard as well.Even just talking in a noisy environment or with a group was exhausting,My London reports. When Claudia was , she decided to see a doctor, and was diagnosed with left vocal cord paralysis, a rare condition which causes the voice to sound breathy, quiet and weak, and can affect the breathing.If both cords are affected, the voice can disappear altogether.In Claudiaaposs case, the condition was caused at birth as she was been born prematurely at just six months old. The -year-old said: Despite the pathology, it was a relief to know what was happening. It was the answer I had been waiting for for a long time, especially in adolescence...I was ready to do what I could to find my voice. Once she had finished school, Claudia started speech therapy, which aimed to move the working cord towards the paralysed one. After nine months of twice-weekly sessions and daily breathing and vocal exercises, she found out that, despite some nodules on her vocal cords being removed, her voice still sounded the same.In , Claudia opted for a surgical intervention, known as an Injection Laryngoplasty. The surgery works by injecting fat into the vocal cords to increase their volume - and means that Claudia lost her voice entirely for a week, communicating with a pen and paper. When it re-emerged, it had increased in strength - but only temporarily. The following year, Claudia says she re-attempted the same surgery, only to find that the results were similar: a brief period of improvement, before her voice ed to its previous state. For the next six years, Claudia tried dferent forms of speech therapy, to little success.  Eventually, she says her doctors in Italy told her that there was nothing more that they could do for her. She said: This brought me a lot of sadness...I have never been able to enjoy a nice evening in the pub, or go out for dinner with a group because it is dficult to be heard in noisy environments. Otherwise at the end of the day, vocal fatigue assaults you and you no longer want to talk to anyone. A vocal problem affects everyday le. Itaposs not just about having a hoarse or lower tone - the voice is a delicate communication tool. [We use it to]communicate, to work, have social relationships and to express our feelings. The voice is the mirror of the soul.In October , having moved to London two years earlier, Claudia had her third surgery: a thyroplasty, where an implant was inserted through the cartilage into her voice box. She was optimistic, and at first pleased with the results. She said: After surgery in November my voice was much louder, as was my laughter and coughing. I had less respiratory fatigue while walking, for example, and in noisier environments it seemed easier to raise my voice and speak. But in December, Claudia felt disappointed again, as her voice began to strain in loud environments. [Itaposs like] I miss the air, asI were climbing a mountain. I have to rest, plus [I have] neck and throat pain. At the time, Claudia says she was working at a dog grooming salon. With the sound of dogs barking, pets being washed and people talking, Claudia says it became dficult for her to communicate - leading to fatigue and severe neck pain - and she left the job. It was a real blow that Claudiaaposs third surgery hadnapost altered her voice. She said: I was hoping that with the last intervention I would finally be able to get my voice, to get more vocal stability, but it didnapost happen. Of course, there are those very dficult and despondent moments, but then I look inside myself and I see that there is still that strength and courage to go on and keep fighting.

In terms of her work, she is having a hard time finding a job which will accommodate her needs. She enjoyed her role at the grooming salon, and loves cooking, flowers and photography, but requires a quiet working environment where she does not have to strain or raise her voice. All this has made me a very empathetic, sensitive person who knows how to listen, said Claudia. I would also like to expand my knowledge on the voice - and maybe one day help someone like me.  And, despite her long struggle to be heard, Claudia is finally speaking out: she runs a YouTube channel and Instagram account where she shares her experiences, and intends to write a book about her vocal journey.She said: Despite the ups and downs, these years in search of my voice have given me the strength not to give up. There are many people with dferent vocal problems, who do not feel understood, who feel alone, who do not know how to treat their pathology, or who give up. I want them to know that they are not alone and that they donapost have to give up...I know how hard it can be, but one day you will find your voice!

However, now theres official confirmation of the best starting word now to make sure you keep the streak goingThere have been many speculations about the best word to start a game of Wordle Image: PAByMalvika PadinTrends Writer:,  Apr |comments Online word game Wordle has become a part of many of our lives since its launch in late . The viral game involves players guessing one five-letter word within six tries and solving the daily puzzle has become a routine for many over the past few months.

Hereaposs what you need to know about the best Wordle starting word to keep your streak going on the game. What is the best starting word on Wordle   Previously, people have speculated that words like spire, nears or death, are good starting words, with adieu, which makes use of four vowels at once also being considered an ideal word.

Looking at skill, the bot determinesyou minimised the expected number of turns it would take to solve the puzzle, and in terms of luck it looks at whether your guesses eliminate more solutions than expected. WordleBot gives a step-by-step breakdown of your attempt at the puzzle, with recommended words marked by a gold tick.

The Times explained: WordleBot has perfect knowledge of the , solutions stored in its memory. It’s likely that you do not. So while the bot might know the precise optimal path to take from a given guess, it’s possible that you might not and that a dferent guess would be more likely to lead you to the answer.

Police responded to a distressed  call from the model, also known as Courtney Tailo, around pm on April , according to reports. Clenney, who has not been charged in Obumseliaposs death, was hospitalised and evaluated for  hours.She appears to have since been released and was staying at the Grand Beach Hotel in Miami when she was confronted by hotel guests who filmed the encounter.In the video, which was posted to Twitter, guests can be heard saying you killed your boyfriend as Clenney and a man who is thought to be her father look at each other. Clenney then storms off into the hotel lobby. An eye witness said: She was just sitting at the bar like everything was normal and people started to recognise her. Guests were telling her to leave and repeating the allegations of murder to her. People had their phones out and thataposs when sheaposd had enough and went back to her room.Clenneyaposs lawyer Frank Preito has said the influencer was acting in self-defence. Preito told reporters that Clenney and her father were staying at the hotel on Miami Beachaposs Collins Avenue because they are cooperating in the Miami Police Departmentaposs investigation of the incident, and she did not want to stay at her apartment where the fatal stabbing occurred last weekend. It is unfortunate that a member of the public, knowing absolutely nothing about the circumstances and events surrounding the death of Mr Obumseli, would take the opportunity to harass the Clenney family during a time when they are trying to be supportive of Courtney, Prieto said. Courtney was seated at a table in the hotel lobby area where there is also a bar. Courtney’s father was standing there trying to order a drink to take outside so they could be in private on the beach. The video was filmed on April .

Nigel Castle, , had been driving through Yeovil, Somerset on the morning of Thursday, April  when he clocked the worker trying to remove weeds that had grown up through the aposgrassapos by trimming away at it.The Yeovil-based father-of-three tweeted the pic in the hopes of putting pressure on the council to get rid of the plastic grass altogether and opt for a more environmentally friendly solution.Heaposs also since backed a petition which calls for a complete ban on articial grass being sold to residential addresses, emphasising, covering our planet in plastic is not an option.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Nigel, who works as an aircraft engineer, wrote: Nature needs as much help as we can give it at this time of ecological crisis. Covering our planet in plastic is not an option For me, itaposs about the use of plastic grass which they shouldnapost be using. It is terrible stuff - there are so many dferent choices that they could have used. Clover, for instance, is low maintenance. Thereaposs lots of plant cover that they could have put down that doesnapost take a lot to maintain and is a lot better for wildle. Going forward, Nigel now wants to draw attention to the nationwide issue of plastic grass becoming more and more prevalent up and down the country. He continued: Too many people are putting plastic down in their gardens and they shouldnapost be. Itaposs got nothing for wildle and all it does is it breaks down and ends up in the waterways. We are pumping far too much into the environment. A South Somerset Council spokesperson said: We are aware of the understandable concern caused by a recent photograph shared on Twitter and we thank the resident involved for raising this issue. First of all, we would like to offer sincere apologies to anyone who was upset by the image. The operative involved should not have been using a strimmer on this site. Weeding on this roundabout is instructed to be carried out by hand and additional training will be provided to ensure this does not happen again. Secondly, we would like to explain why articial grass has been installed at this site. This is the only roundabout in South Somerset that we maintain where articial grass is in place. It is not a decision that we took lightly. This roundabout was recently subject to much-needed major improvement work by Somerset County Council which increased traffic flow and traffic speed in this area. As such, the ability to access the roundabout to undertake maintenancebecame increasingly dficult and dangerous. According to this spokesperson, the council was forced to decide how they could ensure the operative safety by reducing the frequency of visits as well as the type of operation undertaken.Wanting to still have a green feel within the design, the council, therefore, chose to use articial turf as a one-off, with the spokesperson accepting that this is in no way an ideal option but we also had to consider the safety of our crews. They continued: Our team, alongside teams from across the council, take our responsibility to the environment and tackling climate change extremely seriously. If you visit South Somerset, you will find multiple roundabouts, parks, and spaces where we work continuously to ensure wildflower growth and the establishment of pollinators which boost the local ecosystem. In recent years, the issue of plastic use has been widely discussed, with the UK aiming to become carbon-neutral by . While energy consumption plays vital role in this, items such as conventional jewellery often also have substantial carbon footprints, according to Moissanite Rings and Jewelry, a company that sells ethically-made rings.

Chlamydia, she revealed. Apparently, the mum-to-be has been obsessed with the name ever since reading The Odyssey in school and always liked her Greek Mythology stories. Realising that her friend was referring to the character Clytemnestra, she corrected her, but this only annoyed the mum.

Right apos And sheaposs all, aposNo, I meant Chlamydia.aposAfter a quick Google search proved that she was right, the friend backed down - but she was noticeably annoyed for the rest of the night.When the Reddit poster went home that night, she received a long text from the mum, calling her a bad friend for embarrassing her in front of everyone. She says I could have brought it up in private and didnapost need to be so condescending about it.She was just talking about a name she liked and I made her feel like an idiot. The woman said she ignored the text, as she thought her friend was being an idiot, for basing her childaposs name on a book she hadnapost read in years and mixing it up with an STI. A simple google search before getting so attached to the name would have solved the problem before there was one, she said. But then she started getting texts from the other girls in the group telling her how upset the mum was and how she should apologise.I donapost think I have anything to apologise for, and besides, they were perfectly happy to sit there and let her think her std baby name would be a good choice, she continued. Imagine how embarrassed she would have been after she found the mistake later and realised that none of her friends had the decency to tell her the truth. She concluded her post by asking Reddit users whether she was in the wrong but the majority said she did the right thing. One person said: You didn’t embarrass her - every single person within earshot already clocked her mistake - you were the only person decent enough to correct her. Another wrote: If sheaposs old enough to be pregnant, she should be old enough to know what chlamydia is. She embarrassed herself.

John West, , has toured the country to compile a catalogue of chilling experiences for his new book, Britainaposs Haunted Heritage.In the tome he writes of mountain beasts, a fleet of phantom Viking longships and the spirit armies from each side of the English Civil War battling even after death. The folklore expert has compiled two books on ghosts after visiting Edinburgh and its spooky surrounds. He said Scotland is particularly re with the supernatural and spectres, calling it the most-haunted part of the UK, due to its history of war and plagues. John told The Sun : “Scotland is a country steeped in history. It’s endured invasion, war and plagues.It’s no wonder it must be the most-haunted part of the UK. I believe Celts are much more in tune with the paranormal. But even now, there are places which make my blood run cold. “The atmosphere becomes oppressive in these places and you just need to get out of there. Scotland has them in abundance.” The folklore expert revealed one particularly blood-curdling sighting is of a ft grey man which is said to haunt the hills of Ben Macdui in the Cairngorms. Reports about the humanoid monster go back  years, with climbers saying they were terrorised by the monster. Another story involves the ghost of a wizard stalking the grounds of a medieval building in Edinburgh.  John also wrote of the chilling case of Major Thomas Weir and his sister Jane- who were both accused of witchcraft before being executed in . But a part of their home is still standing in the city - and visitors claim to hear laughter and chanting ringing out from its rooms. John, who says heaposs been interested in haunted sights since he was a boy, has been ghost hunting for  years. He said he became fascinated by the paranormal realm after sneaking away to read his mumaposs books of ghost stories. John would be transfixed by the phantoms on the covers, he added. The ghost hunter, who lives in London, says that rural communities and Scottish islands are just as haunted as the big cities like Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh and Glasgow.  He says Iona - which is situated in the Outer Hebrides - is haunted by a fleet of ghostly Viking longships. Meanwhile, spectral armies have clashed at the Pass of Killiekrankie in Perthshire, John says. Earlier today, it emerged that a hotel dubbed the UKaposs most haunted terried the workmen tasked with its demolition after thinking they were trapped in rooms by unseen spirits. The former Birkdale Palace Hotel was once the talk of the town in Southport, attracting the likes of A-listers such as Frank Sinatra and Peter Sellers. The Hungarian Football Team, one of the best sides around at the time, called it home during the  World Cup before losing in the quarter finals to the USSR.Known for its luxurious reputation, the , room hotel had a dark history, Liverpool Echo reported.Its architect was said to have taken his own le when it was built in the s facing inland, rather than having its grand façade facing out to sea. In  night porter Alan Wills was found guilty of murder of six-year-old Amanda Graham, whose body was found under a bed in room .

But due to him living overseas and restrictions in place because of the coronavirus pandemic, she has only met him a couple of times.This past weekend, her family was having a big reunion. My fiancé complained about the reunion and told me he could not attend, she said, despite her saying how much it would mean to herhe met more of her relatives. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. However, when the day rolled around, he told her that he would meet her there. While we were chatting with family members, my aunt asked him what he did for a living and he answered, and everything seemed to go well, she said. When I got home, I saw my fiancé sitting on the couch playing a video game. I askedhe had a good time at the reunion and he told me he did. But, having felt like something was off, she asked him to tell her what her cousinaposs name was - and he couldnapost answer. He thought about it for a long minute and then started laughing, she said.He told me that his twin brother attended the reunion and he was dropped off by a friend. I was so angry with him that I asked him to leave so I could think everything through. He went to stay with a friend and Iaposm still so devastated that he would pull this kind of prank on me. My parents are very upset with him and are being very supportive. He thinks Iaposm being dramatic and there was no harm in what he did. She concluded her post by asking users whether it was unreasonable of her to be angry with him, but people were quick to assure her he was in the wrong. One person said: This is gold! I have siblings that are twins. They pulled the olapos switcheroo in grade school. But by age  you should know better.Another wrote: That wasnapost a aposprankapos but a horrible stunt attempt for him to avoid a family reunion. I would evaluate this relationship and askpulling that aposprankapos was really worth upsetting his future in-laws. Not to mention how the extended family will feelthey find out about this stunt. A third commented: Itaposs honestly really weird, though. Itaposs like they watched way too many kidaposs shows where twins swap places and thought it would still be hilarious even though theyaposre grown men. Someone  wrote: Homie dropped these, along with a number of red flag emojis. And one person said: Really better rethink marrying this guy.

Play was more scrappy in the second period but Kilmory managed to close out the match.The club thanks Crinan Construction for sponsoring the match and all the supporters who came out to watch.In the same ision, Inveraray and Bute juniors drew - at the Winterton.Bute started the match strongly, using their pace and youth to advantage.

All her walks can be booked as bespoke guided experiences.*The  bus service is only available on schooldays term time you would need to start and finish at Muasdale. The Scottish Citylink bus times are not suitable.**If you start and finish at Muasdale, carefully check tide tables and aim for an ebb low tide for the whole coastal section from Killean to Muasdale.With sandy beaches, an igneous dyke splitting red sandstone and the impressive waterfalls on Clachaig Water reflecting geological history, man’s time here is reflected in a prehistoric dun, the old settlement of Achaglass and abandoned dwellings that span right through the centuries.Amongst these are the wonderful old ruins of St John’s church at Killean, parts of which date back to the th Century.Although you can no longer go inside it is still possible to walk around the graveyard and view the impressive carved tombstones from a distance.According to Canmore records the burial vault is that of the MacDonalds of Largie it is believed they helped prevent further deterioration of the church in the mid-th Century.The start point is A’Chleit Church, which replaced St John’s in the th Century. Leaving the car park head south via a short path to the beach.Follow the beach south for the next .km. En route a couple of small streams are crossed.It is sometimes easier to go above the beach, especially as you approach the large rocky outcrops near Muasdale.Look out for a path that takes you up to a stile just before you reach Clachaig Water .Cross the stile and main road. Turn right to gain a view from the new bridge to the old bridge over Clachaig Water.The village store is m south of the bridge should you need refreshment. Return north from the bridge and take the first turning right .Follow the track up the hill for m until you reach a field on your right. Cross this diagonally towards the west corner of the forestry plantation.On reaching it turn right into the woods to look at the waterfalls at the bend, which, I gather, are called Peter’s Hole . The drop is sudden and vertical, so take care!From the falls head upriver, descending into the plantation, before re-ascending northeast above the river and trees.Follow the field edge you will go over a small knoll and reach a fence line. Turn left up the side of South Crubasdale farm to rejoin the track you left earlier.Turn right, then after m turn right again. The track will drop you down to a bridge over Clachaig Water before rising to a T-Junction.Turn left. After m look for a gate on your left. To visit the Duncross the field diagonally andthe same way. Please keep dogs on a lead.Continue northeast on the track for m to a Y junction. Bear left past the now empty Low Clachaig farm and bear left again at the next Y junction. Continue to High Clachaig. There is a ruined farm off to your right en route.At High Clachaig it is best to go round the buildings and walls to the right before rejoining the little used track that heads northeast into the forestry.The track is grassy and boggy # especially near the stream crossing # but easy enough walking for the km to Achaglass.Achaglass is an old settlement that appears to have been rented to a shepherdand his family back in . It has now partially disappeared amongst forestry, like so many old sites in Argyll.Continuing northeast up the Clachaig Water from Achaglass there is a fine sheep fank, m beyond this there is a bridge.Cross the bridge and take the forestry track northeast for the next .km until you reach the Kintyre Way.Note there is a cattle grid with no side gate en routeyou have a dog you may need to lt them over the fence.Turn left. You will now follow the Kintyre Way down to the coast for over km.You can take a slight short cut by taking a left at NR and then bearing right at NR down to the ruin of Braids, but it is muddier.Near the bottom, after a small dam, a left turn will drop you down through the eerily empty houses of Killean to the main road. Opposite is St Johns’ church. Cross over with care.After visiting the church take the lane on the north side of Killean burn towards the sea # gate climbing may ensuelocked. Always climb gates at the hinge end.On reaching large farm sheds take the small bridge over Killean burn and cut through the field to the shore.Your route once more wends its way down the beach, over an igneous dyke and Permian red sandstone, all the way back to A’Chleit. Allow an hour for this section when checking tides.If you finish early enough there may even be time to pop down to Glenbarr stores for a well-deserved cuppa."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures may 28 2021 2 2 2 3 2 2 2 2 2 2 2","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowTaken just across Loch Fyne from Tarbert, this week#s featured photo was submitted by a reader from Cowal # too modest to be named, sadly # from the site of the controversial #ark# on the hills above Tighnabruaich.The sculpture of Noah#s Ark was built # without planning consent, though later permitted # to provoke thought about the climate crisis by local environmentalist and woodworker David Blair.The sculpture has been featured many times in this and other publications, but the site on which it sits is stunning, and the photographer was standing close to the ark for the photograph.To the left is the Isle of Bute, with Tighnabruaich and Kames on the opposite side of the Kyles of Bute.

As the country emerged from its second lockdown, football was one of the few after-school activities available. As a result, many more girls came along to try the sport for the first time with the existing mixed teams at the club.Sensing the enthusiasm, Ally Robb, LVSC chairman and one of the club’s coaches, saw the potential to develop an all-girls team for the first time. With the support of fellow coach Bob Campbell, he ran an initial training session for P-P girls. This was quickly followed by another mini milestone: a first ever LVSC U girls’ game in a friendly against Penicuik in June .“After a great first game, coaches and parents alike were keen to ensure this new chapter in the club’s history was given every opportunity to succeed,” said Ally.In the nine months since the inaugural game, the club has extended training to include girls from P to P. Three new coaches subsequently joined the team and, with the support of parent helpers, they organise weekly training sessions and games.The club and team are now affiliated with the Scottish Women’s Football Association and this year have attended tournaments in Lauder, Galashiels and Coldstream, playing a mix of three, four and seven-a-side games..removeAnd it’s fair to say that the girls are loving the experience.

If you look at a sunflower, you can’t help but smile. Not only does it remind us of the sun, but its head will track the sun through the sky and wherever the light is a sunflower will find it.Snapdragons are great because they come in a iety of colours and sizes, and you can pinch the blossoms so they open and shut just like a dragon’s mouth.Snapdragon flowers are specically designed for bumblebees, which are just the right weight to trip the opening mechanism of the lower lip of the flower to gain access to the nectar.The four o’clock flower, also known as the marvel of Peru, is a bushy plant with trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, yellow or white.The fragrant flowers don’t open until late afternoon, around four o’clock – so they are good for telling the time.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to start sowing tomatoes, so you can enjoy them throughout the summer.To grow tomatoes successfully, you need rich, fertile soil or peat-free potting compost, and a good sunny, sheltered spot.Water regularly and feed regularly once the plants start to flower.Tomatoes are split into two main growing types – bush and cordon.Bush types are usually planted in containers and their stems trail around the edge. Cordon types are trained to grow tall and are supported by a cane or stake and will require pinching out.Growing tomatoes from seed is best done under cover, into seed trays, then when the seedlings get to -cm tall, transplant to small cm pots. Keep potting on as they grow in size.They can be planted outside with cane supports once the last frosts have gone, so around May time.For best results, choose trusted ieties like Gardener#s Delight, Money Maker or Sweet Olive.As usual, April really kick-starts the gardening season.As the Royal Horticultural Society says, spring is finally in evidence as daffodils and flowering trees start to bloom.#Expect the inevitable April showers this month but with sunny days too, when you can turn your attention to the lawn,# said a spokesperson.#It#s an exciting month, with indoor-sown seeds well into growth, and it#s also time to start sowing outdoors.

Since God is eternal and therefore stands outside of time, it may be that every moment in time is always present with him.And yet, the Bible often speaks of God not remembering something – people’s sins.One example is Jeremiah chapter  verse : ‘For I will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more.’It is not that God forgets in the way that I forget where I have left my wallet or car keys.In the Bible, ‘to remember’ is another way of talking about keeping a promise. We use ‘to remember’ in that way too.‘Don’t forget to phone me when you arrive home,’ shouts Morag, as her daughter heads home after visiting her.‘Don’t worry, Mum. I’ll remember.’Sure enough, Morag’s phone rings later, and the voice at the other ends says: ‘It’s me. I’m home.’God does not forget our sins in the sense of pretending they never happened or ignoring our failure and refusal to do what he wants.Instead, he remembers his promise to forgive the sins of anyone who asks him to do so.He is able to do this because Jesus has died on the cross to deal effectively with sin’s penalty.So, when you trust in Jesus, God refuses to hold your sin against you, but treats you in the way you do not deserve. He forgives you and remembers your sins no more."},{"url":null,"title":"west road overnight surfacing works rescheduled","story":"Due to operational reasons, the project will now begin on Sunday, April , for  nights.No works will take place on Fridays or Saturdays.

sunshine was breaking through the last remaining wisps of morning mist. Signs of spring, my favourite season, were visible all over our garden. The blackbird was perched on the fence and I opened the window so I could hear his song better.I watched him for a moment. He is a regular visitor but he seemed particularly vocal this morning. Then I noticed there was a female blackbird as well. I felt privileged that I could witness their visit to our small rewilded garden, which we have tried to make bird friendly.Then the singing stopped and they both seemed to be peering down at the patch of soil where we have recently planted wildflower seeds and vegetables. The male landed on the soil and began hopping in a zig-zag fashion, stopping every now and then. At first I wonderedthis was a dance to impress the female, but soon realised he was looking for breakfast.Blackbirds love earthworms and I supposed the overnight rain on the exposed soil of our newly seeded flowerbed meant it was a good moment to go hunting for his favourite food. He was looking for worms, but also listening for them, as blackbirds can hear the sound of them moving underground. I find that almost dficult to believe, but apparently it’s true. It was fascinating and joyous to watch.But I don’t knowhe caught any worms. My attention was taken by the sound of our kids getting up. School day morning routine beckoned. Time seems to vanish in the drama of it all, and so after I kissed my we goodbye as she headed for work, I quickly got busy making the kids’ breakfast.It was at this moment an emotion overtook me: guilt. I often feel a sense of guilt when I know others are suffering terribly. One solution could be to disconnect from it, not think about it, or even try not to care. After all, we have our own family worries and problems to sort out.But the guilt comes from the empathy I feel and I don’t want to disconnect from that. I don’t think I could stop caring evenI tried. The world needs more empathy, not less. But there is a downside to it: it can become overwhelming and even affect my mental health.Guilt in this context is such a useless emotion. It doesn’t help those who are suffering and it certainly doesn’t help the person feeling empathy. So as my guilt arrived at the breakfast table that morning, I gave it short shrt and became determined to replace it with two things.The first was to learn the lesson the blackbird had taught me moments before, to enjoy the moment and the gts around me. It put me in mind of a beautul short film of the artist David Hockney, made by Louisiana Museum of Modern Art. It’s titled The World is Beautul and he talks about the beauty around us and that when bad news is dominating our senses, the arrival of spring is good news. The important thing is to really notice the gts around us, which Hockney says he does with “intensity”.So I took up his advice and, on my walk to school with my son, I made sure I was fully present for him as he talked about monsters, Dr Who and his favourite scenes from Clash of the Titans. I savoured every moment of our connection and conversations.On myto the house, I made an extra effort to notice the beauty of spring’s arrival and other gts: the diamond-like sparkle of the dew drops on the grass, and the patterns made by the children running and playing amongst them, the dedication of George the lollipop man in keeping us all safe, the brief and faint rainbow in the sky above us, and the shimmer of the sea below the trees in bloom, and the yellow carpet of daffodils dancing in the breeze the birdsong, the smiles and greeting of people, the sense of community, the warmth of the sun the fact of being alive and having loved ones in my le.The walk was only four minutes, but when we notice the beauty and gts we have around us with the intensity that Hockney mentions, then we don’t measure with time.The second thing was to change my guilt into acts of compassion that can make a dference, no matter how small. Donate, write a letter, send a message of support, whatever. That way, empathy works for positive change for those in need.I already knew all this, but it seems I constantly need to relearn it. And that morning, the blackbird helped me to do so. His song was an awakening gt, his zig-zag hop across the soil a reminder that we should have moments when we pause to look and listen with “intensity.”Asto confirm this, he was still there on the fence when I ed home.

Unfortunately, I still have a job to do and won’t be holidaying for a few months, but it doesn’t stop me dreaming of sun and sea. I do love the south of France and hopefully I’ll be heading there soon.But what about my pets  When I’m away for a short spell, I like someone to look after my pets in their own home. They are relaxed in their own environment.However, when on a longer holiday, my pets are looked after extremely well by boarding kennels and cattery in East Lothian. Cats are not usually the best travellers but you can try using calming cat pheromones to relax them. Your vet can advise you on ‘Feliway’ cat calming products for any journey. My dog Lucy, on the other hand, loves travelling and adores going to the boarding kennel. She gets so excited when she knows she is on her way to the kennels.But whatyou want to take your pets with you on holiday  In Britain today, pets can travel by road, rail, sea or air. Each form of travel presents its own unique set of problems.The Highway Code is very specic about animals in cars. They should be under control in vehicles and unable to distract you while you are driving. If you want your dog to be loose in the car, he should be separated from you, and thus an estate vehicle, SUV or hatchback with a strong dog guard is ideal. Alternatively, a crate or cage can be used, the dimensions of which should be comfortable for the animal.Travel, or more correctly motion sickness, affects many dogs. It is due to the effect of the motion on the organs of balance located in the inner ear. Signs are usually excessive salivation, restlessness or excitement. Consult your veterinary surgeon as there are several prescription medicines that are extremely effective for this condition. Excitable dogs can be tranquilised but make sure you do not give too much, which may result in your pet becoming very drowsy, since the dose depends largely on the temperament and amount of excitement.Remember that even the most well-behaved dog can take fright at the sight and noise associated with a railway station and trains. Make sure that the collar and lead are strong and secure.Today, dferent railway companies have ying conditions regarding the transport of pets and therefore you should always enquire prior to your trip. Cats should be transported in secure carriers at all times. When travelling on the underground with your dog, remember it must be carried up and down any escalators. If you have a large dog, seek other means of access to the .Many ships and ferries today have permanent kennels into which your dog must be placed for the duration of the trip. The provision of a familiar blanket or toy helps to ease the tension of the journey for your pet.International Air Transport Associationregulations regarding carrier size apply to all international flights. Remember the container will be your pet’s home for theof the flight and also for an appreciable time prior to and after the flight after you have checked in and until he is collected after the flight. The carrier should be large enough for your dog to stand up and turn around freely. It is useful to use several thicknesses of newspaper, plus an acrylic dog bed of the VetBed type as bedding. A familiar article in the container helps to calm the animal. It is always worthwhile checking with the airline regarding their particular requirements.Not only has Covid- had a marked effect on travel, Brexit certainly has in respect of travelling overseas with your pets. Previously, for travel to EU countries, we vets could issue passports for your pet to travel with you to Europe. This is no longer the case.If you are considering travelling to an EU country with your pet, please start to plan long before your trip. Animals, specically dogs, cats and ferrets, require an Animal Health Certicateto travel to an EU country, including Northern Ireland. Any other pets require an Export Health Certicate or,you are travelling to non-EU countries, you will require a specic certicate issued in combination of DEFRA and the country you are travelling to.If you are travelling to an EU country, your pet needs to be microchipped and registered to you in the UK. This has to be read and confirmed by a vet prior to your pet being vaccinated against rabies.Recently, Mr Andrew Finlayson came to our Tranent surgery with his beautul greyhounds Celt and Lassie for their rabies vaccines. I checked their microchips and their paperwork prior to giving their vaccines. The AHC can only be issued more than three weeks after this rabies vaccination. The vet must be a registered official veterinary surgeonin order to be able to complete the certicate. The certicate cannot be issued until within  days of your travel from the UK date. Your vet needs to check your pet at this time.If you are travelling to Northern Ireland, Eire, Malta, Norway or Finland, your pet needs to be given medication against tapeworms between one and five days of you travelling. At Dunedin Vets, we combine this with the examination for the AHC.Each AHC is unique to your pet or pets. Up to five animals can travel on one certicate. The certicates are only valid for one journey from the UK. You have to state the country where you are entering the EU and there only certain designated ports or airports you can travel to. There is a specic AHC for each EU country and each one issued has its own unique certicate number, for your pet or pets. The AHC is valid for up to four months you mustto the UK before this time is up, but you can travel around EU countries during this time.These AHCs are long documents which have to be completed accurately with all the correct details, which owners have to provide in advance to the veterinary surgeon who completes them.If you are considering taking your pets to the EU this summer, contact your veterinary surgeon as soon as possible to ensure all the required paperwork is in order. We want to avoid disappointments at all costs.If you are wanting to travel further afield, contact DEFRA as soon as you know. A recent Export Health Certicate for dogs travelling to Dubai took almost six months to arrange.Plan in advance and hopefully everyone can have a lovely summer holiday."},{"url":null,"title":"dunbar-park-new-home-french-sport-petanque","story":"Visitors to Lauderdale Park will be able to try their hand at the sport of petanque.The sport, which involves trying to score points by having boules closer to the target than the opponent, dates back more than  years.Now, after work between ious groups, a petanque piste has been created in the town, similar to that found in Haddington and North Berwick.Stuart McCombie, who has represented Scotland in petanque, is behind the idea to bring the sport to Dunbar.He said: “I used to play petanque many years ago at ious levels with ying degrees of success.“I retired to Dunbar three years ago and there are no petanque facilities within Dunbar.“For the last of couple of years, I have been playing in Haddington.“They have got a beautul piste set up beside the river and the church.“I play there with the UAand it was not until I moved here and joined that I was playing regularly again on a Wednesday.“They also play on a Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday and it is a long-established nice group of folk.“I looked round and North Berwick have got a small piste by the tennis courts but there’s nothing in Dunbar.”Dunbar already has its own French connection, having been twinned with the town of Lignieres for nearly  years.Discussions took place between Mr McCombie, Dunbar and District Twinning Association, Dunbar Community Council and Dunbar and East Linton Area Partnership . An appeal was put out on social media to check levels of interest in the facility being created.Mr McCombie told the Courier he was “quite taken aback” by the feedback and decided to move forward with the plans.Funding was sourced from both the community council and DELAP, with work to create the piste in Lauderdale Park well under way.Mr McCombie said: “The building is near completion.“The piste is now almost up and running and I’ve had the first throw, just testing the surface.“It is a fantastic setting, a beautul setting. I did not think for a moment we would get inside the walled garden of Lauderdale Park.”Members of the public will be able to play the sport whenever there is not an organised event being held.Anyone without their own boules can hire them for £ – which covers everyone involved in the game – from the park’s cafe.Disabled access has also been created at the piste, with an official launch expected to coincide with Dunbar Civic Week, which runs from June  to  this year.Pippa Swan, community council chairwoman, was delighted to see the plans moving forward.She said: “Several dferent options were considered and the conclusion was Lauderdale Park was the best.“It is protected, it has a wall, a cafe, when children are playing in the garden the parents can play petanque.“The other big thing is that it is entirely accessible to anybody. Little kids can play, adults can play, disabled people can play and I just thought it was fun.”"},{"url":null,"title":"outlander-heading-east-lothian","story":"John Muir Country Park, near Dunbar, was converted into an -century battle camp on Sunday, with residents spotting rows of identical old-fashioned tents.Other period pieces were also spotted, including horse-drawn carts, cannons, old-fashioned woven bags for sand or grain and other smaller props.The area remains cordoned off to the public, with cast and crew not having arrived on the site as of yet.The period drama has become an international sensation, following the history of Scotland from the Highland clearances to the Jacobite rebellion and beyond.Actor Sam Heughan has been spotted filming already in Fe and Edinburgh, leading many to believe he will soon be visiting East Lothian as well.More details about what historical battle will be filmed in the county remain unknown, but locals will be hoping to get a glimpse of their favourite actors as they eagerly await the next instalment of the series."},{"url":null,"title":"met-office-easter-bank-holiday-scotland-weather-forecast","story":"It’s not all bad news though, the weather is set to clear up towards the weekend and it should certainly start to feel a little warmer than it has of late.While it might not be time to pack away your umbrella just yet, spring-like weather is on the way.If you havent already heard, its warming up in the run up to #Easter, but just how high will #temperatures climb  📈Find out in our updated weather for the week ahead 👇 pic EfHeVdpPIt is a rather wet and chilly start to the week rain is expected across most of Scotland today and tomorrow.

Money is created by the government and the dference between government expenditure and taxes raised is added to the “National Debt” under double-entry accounting rules. It is a debt to the Bank of England which is in turn owned by government so “repayment” would simply deflate the economy.Banks create money under licence from the government. To maximise the economy there should be full employment at decent wages. If banks create insufficient money to achieve this in the private sector then government should do so by spending in the public sector.The only limit to public expenditure is from the onset of wage-driven inflation which government can address by reduced expenditure and increased taxes.Current inflation is due largely to the rise in international commodity prices. No amount of interest rate fiddling by the Bank of England can address this.There is no reason why Rishi Sunak cannot help the impending poverty and hardship for those at the bottom of the social scale. Only political dogma, economic ignorance and characteristic meanness of spirit prevents this. He did so when Covid hit so why cannot he do it again John Moreland, Killearn.COST OF LIVING WILL BE KEY FACTORREBECCA McQuillanputs forward some interesting analysis regarding voting patterns and the forthcoming local elections. The cost of living crisis is going to impact on every household in the country as she says, but it will disproportionately affect the vulnerable who include those on benefitswho received a lower-than-inflation increase from the Chancellor.Ms McQuillan mentions recent opinion polls one of the findings was that % of voters felt Finance Secretary Kate Forbes should be doing more in the midst of the crisis, sentiments I am sure Ms Forbes would agree with. However, the Scottish Parliament has no borrowing powers, its hands are tied and is dependent on Rishi Sunak – whose response to the cost of living crisis was to give every household a £ loan, to be paid back, and to reduce household council tax bills by £ per year. All very well, butyou are exempt from paying council tax, you may well be missing out on £ andyou are living in fuel poverty, paying back a loan could be the straw that breaks the camel’s back.This cost of living crisis is a real one for millions of hard-working families, millions who depend on benefits and millions who have been grateful for the Scottish Government’s mitigating measures in the form of its welfare fund, which has increased massively during the pandemic. The Scottish Government has prioritised tackling child poverty, as Ms McQuillan alluded to, with the Scottish Child Payment due to more than double this year to £ a week.The cost of living will certainly be a factor in the local elections – how could it not be  Voters will have the final say and they have given a clear verdict over the last decade and half here in Scotland. At no time during this time has Scotland voted for a Conservative government at Westminster, or for that matter, a Labour or LibDem majority in Scotland, and with the present opposition in Scotland I don’t think that is about to change any time soon.Catriona C Clark, Falkirk.LET DOWN BY OUR LEADERSTHINGS are not working in our country at the moment, nor have they been for several years. I agree with Kevin McKennas columnwith regards to Scotland. Boris Johnson should now not be the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, and those in his own sycophantic party who voted him into that very important position should hang their heads in shame.Rishi Sunak, Sir Keir Starmer and others are not fit to hold the positions in which they find themselves – the former because he is currently living up to the oft-quoted phrase \"there are three kinds of lies lies, damned lies, and statistics\", and the latter because, as Lawrence Pertillar says in his poem Wishes to be Liked\", \"Nor will I ever believe one I suspect, To have a leadership position.But cannot make a decision. With kept wishes to be liked.\"I am so, so angry about the political state of our country, and indeed the world, that I spent time tracing a copy of a poem called Parable of the Talents by the American Octavia E Butler, which I wish to repeat here:\"Choose your leaders with wisdom and forethought. To be led by a coward is to be controlled by all that the coward fears. To be led by a fool is to be led by the opportunists who control the fool. To be lead by a thief is to offer up your most precious treasures to be stolen. To be led by a liar is to ask to be told lies. To be led by a tyrant is to sell yourself and those you love into slavery\".Sadly the last sentence cannot be heard by the Russians who are living under the rule of Putin.Walter Paul, Glasgow.BUCK STOPS WITH THE VOTERSI WOULD disagree with Nicola Sturgeons mealy-mouthed acceptance of blame while tying herself in knots with the double negative – \"I didnt not say to sign the ferry contracts\" – and \"we are a collective therefore the buck stops with me\".I say this, not in her defence, but because she is simply exploiting the gullible electorate who have voted her and the SNP back into power despite her previous \"judge me on education\" Curriculum for Excellence lying in tatters, and they may vote for her again. No, the buck stops with them, not Ms Sturgeon.Fool me once, shame on you fool me twice, shame on me. But it seems she can fool some of them all the time.Voters should remember this the next time they or a loved ones consultation or medical procedure is cancelled or comes too late, when they cannot get an appointment or procedure this side of Christmas. Many still seem unaware it is the Scottish Government that has full autonomy over the NHS in Scotland but clap like performing seals when the First Minister deflects this as the fault of a big bad posh Tory in Westminster.No, its not Ms Sturgeon the buck stops with us.Allan Thompson, Bearsden.CREDIT TO THE PM WHERE ITS DUESTEWART F Falconer , asserts that there is not one thing that Boris Johnston can be proud of.I will give off the top of my head just two examples. The first was his swt decision-making when this dreadful Covid virus first raised its head and showed it was a truly deadly danger to mankind. Whilst other countries dithered and procrastinated, especially the EU members, Mr Johnson acted by investing billions to find and secure a safe vaccine from scratch. Had he waited like everyone  who knows how many extra thousands would have died or been seriously ill and of course as a result of which, the NHS would have fallen over.The second is the leadership role the Prime Minister has taken in Ukraine in terms of sanctions and aid. It is on record that its President acknowledges the vital role undertaken by the UK Government in supplying the defensive armaments that has helped to mitigate the still-dreadful death toll being suffered by the Ukrainian people.So yes, I agree with the sentiments expressed in the letter of April  from Allan Sutherland which so upset Mr Falconer. Partygate, Wallpapergate and the rest of the gates still to be unearthed can wait their time to be answered, but in the meantime give credit where it is due to this Prime Minister.James Martin, Bearsden.It should have been a safe space for informed debate, somewhere for readers to discuss issues around the biggest stories of the day, but all too often the below the line comments on most websites have become bogged down by off-topic discussions and abuse. heraldscotland is tackling this problem by allowing only subscribers to comment.We are doing this to improve the experience for our loyal readers and we believe it will reduce the ability of trolls and troublemakers, who occasionally find their way onto our site, to abuse our journalists and readers.

Obviously many can donate generously to charities relieving some of the suffering of the Ukrainians and some are in a position to take in refugees from that benighted country.However. Andrey Kurkov, once described as being “Ukraine’s most famous and successful living writer” who currently has a weekly slot on BBC Radio , Letter From Ukraine, when asked what we can do to help Ukraine recommends we “find out more about Ukraine. If you really want to know why this is happening read about our history”.I myself have just finished reading The Ukrainian Night: An Intimate History of Revolution by Marci Shore of Yale University. I did not find it the easiest of reads due to the plethora of Slavic names but it is well worth the effort based as it is on the personal reflections of participants in the Maidan Revolution of February . A more straightforward historical account is The Conflict in Ukraine: What Everyone Needs To Know by Professor Serhy Yekelchyk, a Ukrainian-Canadian historian of Ukrainian and Russian History.Anything  we can do  Yes indeed, write to The Herald Letters Pages with our thoughts on Ukraine.John Milne, Uddingston.WHEN WILL RUSSIANS LEARN THE TRUTH THOSE of us living in countries within Nato membership and their allies, and in fact many observers throughout the world, are looking on with horror and despair at the human misery, destruction and carnage which have occurred since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. One has to appreciate that most of what is going on there is subjected to a process of disinformation at the hands of the Russian state through its ious media outlets.One asks the question, how long can the Russian people remain unaware of the following facts: the vast numbers of Ukrainians, mostly women and children, having to leave their homes and to seek safety from attack in other countries the killing by Russian military of many civilians, including children the wanton destruction through air strikes, artillery bombardment and tank assaults of many residential areas the obstruction of humanitarian access in many areas the eradication of potential witnesses to atrocities attacks on hospitals We learn that President Putin wishes to have some kind of success to announce at the military celebrations on May . On that date Russia marks the surrender of Nazi Germany. One is left to wonder how disinformed about the despicable conduct of the Russian military forces in Ukraine the thousands attending that celebration in Moscow will be. It may not be likely to happen before May , but surely the day will come when the Russian people will be faced with the truth.Ian W Thomson, Lenzie.LET THE UN OBSERVERS INAFTER reading about, and seeing television reports, on apparently-substantiated Russian war crimes in Ukraine in the areas now retaken beyond Kyiv, I dread to think what other horrors will surely follow. I have also noted that International Criminal Court prosecutors representatives are monitoring the atrocities found, so that the crimes may be veried and hopefully prosecuted at a later date. My heart, however, goes out to the residents of Mariupol in particular, who must be going through a living hell.Surely there must be some way that Russia can be made to allow UN observers in to see just what is going on in the town, especially since Russia insists that no war crimes atrocities are taking place in the whole conflict by their troops. and more help be given with safe passage to the elderly, mothers and children, out of the town to safe areas in Ukraine George Dale, Beith.NUCLEAR IS NOT THE ANSWERDAVID Bonemight be too young to remember when the South of Scotland Electricity Board planned to construct a nuclear power station at Chapledonan just two miles north of Girvan in the early s. At the time there was a huge local campaign against this proposal, which thankfully was successful.Would Mr Bone like to start a local campaign to have a nuclear power station in the Girvan area  I doubt it. In his letter he infers it is the SNP alone which is telling him there is a worldwide climate emergency. I have to ask: was Mr Bone hiding under his duvet during COP With regard to nuclear power, of which Mr Bone admits he has limited \"technical knowledge\", anyone just has to google \"Windscale\" to see why it is a really bad solution to the energy crisis the world faces.Alec Oattes, Ayr.It should have been a safe space for informed debate, somewhere for readers to discuss issues around the biggest stories of the day, but all too often the below the line comments on most websites have become bogged down by off-topic discussions and abuse. heraldscotland is tackling this problem by allowing only subscribers to comment.We are doing this to improve the experience for our loyal readers and we believe it will reduce the ability of trolls and troublemakers, who occasionally find their way onto our site, to abuse our journalists and readers.

Like … this big.” I pulled a rolling pin out of the cutlery drawer.“Lucky! And was he generous ”This confirms all men’s worst nightmares of how women describe these occasions.The full account of the previous evening’s exertions are outrageously funny and gloriously manky.In all the spilling and leaking and splashing, though, there’s humanity and compassion as one girl struggles through shame and self-doubt to find what everyone is looking for: love and a little tenderness.“I was really touched by the messages I was getting from other women when I first started posting my blogs. They were telling me that they’d been waiting for years for someone to describe how it really is for them in real le.“There was a time when people tended to be judgmental about dating websites, as though it was for desperadoes. But it’s totally mainstream now.”I ask herit’s not fraught with a greater degree of peril for women than it is for men. Are they taking a bigger risk Several of my female friends have relayed tales of meeting blokes who think that the simple act of agreeing to go on a date is a contractual guarantee of sex.“I’ve never agreed to date someone with whom I haven’t had a prolonged period of chatting beforehand. Therefore, you can usually tell who the roasters are. Are they over-affectionate or too complimentary about the way you look “Andyou’re only agreeing to have a coffee then that sets its own boundaries.“When I was younger I was probably quite naive about all of this, but you learn from experience. I think you can get a sense of someone from the way they dress and their chatthey’re bad news.“My friends call this ‘The f***-boy vibes’.”This is one of several revelatory locutions with which Sophie acquaints me during our conversation. I strive to appear knowledgeable and seasoned about all of this and affect an insouciant man-of-the-world vibe that soon crumbles.I’m treated to some other new concepts. One of these is “dropping a pin”.Sophie explains this is a safety mechanism where her friends can electronically embed her location on their smartphones in case anything untoward unfolds.Another one is the “Tinder-walk”. This, Sophie explains, became one of the big features of Scotland in lockdown while people like me were watching old football videos and trying to decipher cookery books.Yet this Tinder-walk malarkey possesses a reassuringly vintage aesthetic. “Everyone got a dog and went on Tinder walks during lockdown,” she says. “It helped to ease us all through the social restrictions and was a way of keeping the flames of romance enkindled.”Heather Suttie, the Scottish events and PR specialist, was thrilled when she first read A Glasgow Kiss. “It just seemed to be what a lot of us had been waiting for,” she said. “I can’t remember laughing so much at a book – and crying too.“It’s just so honest and it could only have been written by a Glaswegian because it’s got that honesty and directness that’s usually missing from fiction that deals with sex and relationships.”Suttie is founder of BookFace, an international, online book club that holds monthly events in Glasgow with modern authors. “When Sophie appeared at one last month the response from women and men was overwhelmingly positive. Yes, some of the scenes are outrageously graphic, but they’re leavened with humour and honesty.”There are several astonishing aspects to A Glasgow Kiss. It’s been written by a first-time author who had not the remotest idea of how to break into the publishing world and yet has secured her a two-book deal featuring the further adventures of Zara.And as well as hitting top spot in the Erotic Fiction charts, Waterstone’s made it one of their books of the year. Yet, she’s still looking for a literary agent.Perhaps the most startling is that Sophie wrote the book while juggling the demands of being a full-time nurse in a busy Glasgow hospital during lockdown with the responsibilities of being a single mother to two children.“I didn’t really stop to think about that,” she said. “Writing the book probably helped me cope during the pandemic.”And while the majority of the responses to the book have been from women, quite a few blokes responded too.“I can honestly say that all the responses from men, including from some former internet dates, have been very positive. They all got the humour.“One messaged me last night and said: ‘F*** me, it was like reading an old scuddy mag when I was a lad. If you ever feel like ditching the halo just give me a shout and I’ll take you out’. I mean, where did he even get his hands on the book ”Any worries she may have harboured about the reactions of friends and family were ill founded.“I’d only initially told a few of them and they were all so supportive. I was a bit more anxious about my family’s reaction, to be honest.“They’re all pretty committed and traditional west of Scotland Catholics, but my mum says she’s very proud of me. She hasn’t read it and I don’t really want her to. But she knows what it’s about. And my family have also said that, of all of them, I was the one with no filters.“I recently bumped into one of my gran’s friends, a woman in her s. She waved over and said: ‘I bought your book. I sat down with it at  o’clock last week and I didn’t stop til am.’ And she’s the holiest wee woman ever. She’s lovely.“And then she said: ‘Your granny would have been so proud of you’. “I was also a bit worried about how it might be received at my workplace. And then I saw that some of my patients were reading it. One of them was sitting in our dialysis unit reading it and asked me to come over and sign it for her.”Recently, on the gogglebox, there have been some howlers posing as provocative television drama that are about as edgy as Classic FM.You find yourself unconsciously casting A Glasgow Kiss even as you’re reading it, as it’s perfect for a six-part comedy drama.

The channel’s salad days are in the past. Being owned by the Gov is restrictive. Time for C to fly the nest towards a very exciting future.”Ms Dorries also apologised to Allsopp after spelling her name incorrectly.She said: “Apologies, I know your name is spelt Kirstie, @KirstieMAllsopp. My autocorrect disagreed, I should have double checked!”Plans for the sale will reportedly be set out in a White Paper later this month and will be included in a new Media Bill for next spring.A string of Tory MPs and peers, including Sir Peter Bottomley, former Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson, chairman of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sportcommittee Julian Knight, and former cabinet ministers Damian Green and Jeremy Hunt have publicly questioned the plans.Sir Peter, who represents Worthing West, said he opposes the sale “because I am a Conservative”.On Monday, Lucy Powell, Labour’s shadow culture secretary, dismissed the suggestion the sale of Channel  would help the regions.She tweeted: “Selling off C to a foreign media giant is the opposite of levelling up. It will cost jobs in Yorkshire and across the North where C has been investing for years.“Apprenticeships, HQ and support for independent productions companies are all at risk.”It should have been a safe space for informed debate, somewhere for readers to discuss issues around the biggest stories of the day, but all too often the below the line comments on most websites have become bogged down by off-topic discussions and abuse. heraldscotland is tackling this problem by allowing only subscribers to comment.We are doing this to improve the experience for our loyal readers and we believe it will reduce the ability of trolls and troublemakers, who occasionally find their way onto our site, to abuse our journalists and readers.

People are also being advised to take a test prior to visiting someone who is vulnerable.If you develop symptoms, you should continue to get a PCR test.On vaccination, the First Minister said: “The advice to everyone, of course, remains as important as ever – please do take the opportunity to get vaccinated as soon as you are able and make sure you get all doses of vaccine that you are eligible for.

But we’re being realistic and we’re not expecting that to happen.“If we were to beat England, it would be an unbelievable achievement in itself, in isolation to the group.”England have a  per cent qualying record and are almost certain to top the group after hitting a remarkable  goals without reply.Northern Ireland were beaten - at Wembley back in October having been level until the th minute.They are eight points adrt of the leaders, while last week’s damaging - defeat in Wiener Neustadt put Austria in pole position to claim the runners-up spot.Shiels’ side complete their campaign away to Luxembourg and Latvia in September but, before then, are scheduled for another meeting with England on their major tournament debut at this summer’s European Championship.Captain Marissa Callaghan says Northern Ireland will take a positive approach against Sarina Wiegman’s visitors, with one eye on the future.“These are the games you dream about,” said the -year-old midfielder. “Every player is looking forward to it and will give it their all.“We have fantastic players in our squad: game changers and goal-scorers. Who knows what can happen “But the big thing is it’s going to be great preparation for going forward and we have a lot to look forward to.“We took them on at Wembley, so why not take them on at Windsor  We know England are a fantastic side but so are we.“We go out with a positive attitude, we go out to win games, score goals, defend for our lives, we’re taking this occasion on.

If Mr Khan’s followers take to the streets, as he has vowed, it could create more pressure on lawmakers and deepen the crisis.Mr Khan, a former cricket star whose conservative Islamist ideology and dogged independence characterised his three years and eight months in office, was ousted early on Sunday.He lost a no-confidence vote after being deserted by his party allies and a key coalition partner.In a show of strength and a precursor to the political uncertainty ahead, Mr Khan rallied hundreds of thousands of supporters on Sunday night to protest over his ouster, describing the new leadership as an “imposed government,” charging they colluded with the US to oust him.His backers marched in cities across Pakistan, waving large party flags and shouted slogans promising tohim to power. The crowds were dominated by youths who make up the backbone of Mr Khan’s supporters.The political drama began April  when Mr Khan sidestepped an initial no-confidence vote demanded by the opposition by dissolving parliament and calling early elections.The opposition, which accuses Khan of economic mismanagement, appealed to the Supreme Court. After four days of deliberations, the court said Mr Khan’s move was illegal and the no-confidence vote went ahead, leading to his ouster.Mr Khan has demanded early elections — the balloting is not due before August . He has tapped into anti-American sentiment in Pakistan, accusing Washington of conspiring with his opponents to topple him. That conspiracy theory resonates with his youthful base, which often sees the US war on terrorism after   as unfairly targeting Pakistan.Mr Khan claims Washington opposes him because of his independent foreign policy favouring China and Russia.

Despite their benevolent roots, the modern pressures facing the sector, they say, simply make it too dficult to keep their Portree home open.The building needs too much work and they don’t have the money to pay for it.The only option, families were told, is closure – with the suggestion that the  residents could all be accommodated nearby in a refurbished and expanded Home Farm.It is not dficult to understand why families are so aggrieved at this proposal.Things may well have improved at Home Farm since the horrors of Covid, but have all the lessons been learned The blanket national policy of shting patients from hospitals to care homes in the frantic weeks of early  was a huge factor in the devastating Covid death toll that followed.Yet now, with the pandemic still not behind us, families in Skye are being told they should accept the transfer en masse of their elderly relatives to the very home so ravaged by coronavirus when it was proven to be over capacity and understaffed.At Budhmor, they managed to keep the home safe from the worst of Covid-. Relatives of residents will tell you that was no fluke – but down to good standards, diligent management and conscientious staff.There will be some truth in the financial and staffing pressures that CrossReach cite in their reasons for closure. But two years on from the outset of Covid, should the sector not be doing all it can to preserve and build on the success of an institution which proved such a good example during the pandemic, rather than bowing to the bottom line and accepting its loss.There is also the matter of an options appraisal on health and care needs in the north of Skye, currently being prepared by NHS Highland.Closure must at the very least be halted until this review is complete – andthis requires support for CrossReach, our Government should find it.In the longer term what we really need are alternative models to those that are currently governed by economies of scale than on inidual or community needs. An agenda of rationalisation and centralisation has taken hold of far too many of our public services and is ultimately driving decisions like the closure of small care facilities offering a homely, personalised environment in favour of a vast, but possibly distant one many miles from an inidual’s home community.No-where has this been more obvious, or dangerous, than in the west Highland health and care sector.We should start the fightback by backing Budhmor care home, and keeping it open."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4008432.jpg--_the_people_you_are_visiting_may_be_particularly_vulnerable_.jpg?1629440923000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20220407newsthe people you are visiting may be particularly vulnerable","story":"The public has been urged to keep wearing face coverings when visiting hospitals, care homes and other health and care settings.

The families are bringing in their ious harvests and making preparations for next year. It’s October, and on the shores of Strangford Lough the Elliott family rear turkeys. The family have years of experience looking after the birds and yet Mark and Olive are still fascinated by their behaviour. Olive comments that they are ‘extremely inquisitive’. While Mark is making sure the turkeys are well fed, his mum Olive can’t help giving them an extra treat. She comments too, “I can’t do without my family, I have to be so nice to them at the minute!” Mark points out that they have been receiving orders for Christmas since August, which is ‘absolutely nuts.’ Near Kilcoo in the Mourne Mountains, Aine Devlin is preparing her flock for the most critical part of her farming year- breeding season. Aine is keeping an eye on her rams to make sure they’re doing their job. She coats their chests with paint to see which ewes they have been with. Aine laughs, “This is his cologne for the girls!” For her AI is not the way to go as the ewes would then all lamb on the same day on the mountain. She loves this time of year and is proud of the part she plays in the economy. “What’s better than buying produce from down the road from your neighbours and local communities ” she says. Outside Crossgar, Richard Orr is thinking ahead to next year’s wheat crop. It’s all about the planning and attention to detail to make sure the groundwork is done right. He’s conscious of the environment, saying, “The major thing in the world is carbon footprint. Chemicals have made farming easy, and modern machinery has damaged the structure of the soil - we need to rebuild that.” Meanwhile, just outside Portadown it’s all hands on deck for apple harvest at the McKeever family farm. There isn’t a high yield this year but sometimes things not going to plan can be a blessing. Pat talks about the seven to eight weeks of hell and this year pickers have been hard to get. Peter comments, “It’s half the battle when you have good people around.” On the Donegal   Londonderry border, potato farmer Jamie Rankin and his team are coming towards the end of their harvest. He enjoys the early starts and says, “What you do before dinner time’s your day’s work.” While it’s a job Jamie enjoys, it also comes with challenges as winter months close in.

Start by thinking how much water you are using each day. Whether you are washing your hands, cleaning endless amounts of dishes or getting through that mountain of washing, you start to realise just how important water is and the sheer amount we use. NI Water’s Environmental Outreach  Learning Officer, Anna Killen, explains how we can save water by looking at everyday habits, “It’s amazing to think that each day each person uses around  litres of water! However, saving water can be really easy, there are simple things we can all do that can make a huge dference. “Did you know that the average time people in Northern Ireland spend in the shower is  minutes, over % of people still overfill the kettle and less than frac of people have a waterbutt ”  “We want that to change and it’s easy, start by looking at small changes for example, your kettle, since working from home it has have been working overtime, but just fill with as much water as you need. Overfilling can use twice as much energy and water, each time you boil. “With rising energy costs, it might be time to think about reducing the time spent in the shower, hot water costs money! Why not try the  minute shower challenge, put on your favourite  minute song and seeyou can finish before the end.” To help you embed with these new habits and ‘Get Water Fit’, complete our online water audit at https:www.getwaterfit or take part in water saving challenges and receive your free water saving items including  minute shower timer, toothy timers and swell gel bags for the garden. Some water saving tips:  Turn off the tap when brushing your teeth - A running tap can use  litres ofwater per minute.  Use a bowl for washing vegetables - Then you can reuse this water for plants.  Make full use of your washing machine - Half load programmes on washing machines use more than half the water and energy of a full load, so wait until the machine is full before switching it on.  Fix leaking taps - A dripping tap can waste more than  litres of water per week.  Keep a jug of water in the fridge, instead of letting the tap run cold.

The seat, which they lost in , is being actively targeted in next month’s poll.Their candidate there, Paul Doherty, is a Turf Lodge native who runs the local food bank. The SDLP are hoping that, during a cost-of-living crisis, he will be the man to snatch back those lost votes.Party leader Colum Eastwood pointed to the toxicity that has marred the first few weeks of the election campaign.Mr Doherty was threatened while putting up posters in the Shankill, but Mr Eastwood said his party were putting the “cost-of-living crisis” front and centre.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseSDLP party leader Colum Eastwood, West Belfast candidate Paul Doherty, former SDLP politician Dr Joe Hendron, North Belfast candidate Nichola Mallon and South Belfast MP Claire Hanna FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueSDLP party leader Colum Eastwood, West Belfast candidate Paul Doherty, former SDLP politician Dr Joe Hendron, North Belfast candidate Nichola Mallon and South Belfast MP Claire Hanna“People don’t have the time to worry about all the shenanigans at Stormont, about who is going to be first or deputy first minister. The vast majority of people are really struggling and really annoyed that politicians were willing to walk away when they can’t heat their homes or fill up their car,” he said.“We have the best possible candidate: Paul Doherty is feeding  families a week he is a genuine community activist.”Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Dr Joe Hendron, the former MP for west Belfast, showed up at the launch in the Cultúrlann McAdam Ó Fiaich, the Irish language cultural hub on the Falls Road, on Monday morning to offer support for the launch.At  years of age, he is SDLP royalty, a veteran of the party who knows what it’s like to battle Sinn Féin at the polls.The Belfast West MP between  and , he lost his Westminster seat to Gerry Adams and it has stayed in Sinn Féin’s hands ever since.When a tearful Alex Attwood declared he had “let his party down” when he lost his Assembly seat in , he would have been aware that once the party relinquish a seat in west Belfast, the chances of taking it back are remote.Mr Attwood’s loss was a direct result of the number of MLAs being cut from  to .With four Sinn Féin MLAs and one People Before Profit ed in , the SDLP know they can’t take out Mr Carroll, who has a safe personal vote.Instead, they will be targeting that fourth Sinn Féin seat, potentially at the expense of newcomer Aisling Reilly.An upbeat Mr Eastwood, while not stating numbers, pointed not just to nationalist west Belfast as a possible gain, but Strangford, where the transfer-friendly Conor Houston is a first-time candidate.He also called for tactical voting, saying borrowed votes in Upper Bann could help Dolores Kelly take out DUP veteran and former minister Diane Dodds.The party will also be battling to keep their seat in Lagan Valley, where Pat Catney is under severe pressure from the DUP.“I don’t think they can take him out,” said Eastwood of Catney, a former pub landlord who is one of the party’s more colourful characters.“In Derry we are in the hunt for a third seat. Places like South Antrim, Fermanagh and South Tyrone, these are places where people need to think about tactics,” added Mr Eastwood.“In Upper Bann, for example, Dolores Kelly is [battling] with Diane Dodds for the last seat. If a few people lent us their vote I think we could take Diane Dodds out.“This is not about who the first minister is, as I think that’s already been decided, it is about how many DUP are left in the Executive — and we’d prefer there were fewer.”The loyalist anti-protocol rallies have so far dominated the discourse around the election.There was a round of applause from the party faithful when the Foyle MP said that those who placed a poster with a noose around the neck of the UUP leader in Lurgan at the weekend “couldn’t lace Doug Beattie’s boots”.“This campaign has got off to a fairly bad start. The tone hasn’t been good, our posters have been burned, our canvassers have been threatened, Paul [Doherty] was himself threatened on the Shankill Road and was back the next day handing out food parcels,” added Mr Eastwood.“I am convinced that those determined to drag this place back will fail.“I would say to ordinary unionist people: I don’t think the DUP, for example, will have your best interests at heart. They are the people who delivered Brexit, they delivered the protocol, they trusted Boris Johnson.“People are entitled to protest, %, but with every right comes responsibility and they have to be responsible for the impact. And we’ve seen Doug Beattie being threatened, our people have been threatened — I’m not sure how that’s going to deliver and [effect] change to the protocol.”Related topicsSDLPColum EastwoodSinn FéinPat CatneyDemocratic Unionist PartyDolores KellyBoris JohnsonDoug BeattieMore On SDLPAndrew MaddenOpinionElection briefing: From mysterious rally organisers and a problem in East Antrim to an SDLP sing-song PremiumViewpointOpinionDivisions still exist within unionismUnionists snub group which aims to improve cross-community relationsNorthern Ireland Assembly election: Who will top the poll in your constituency and whose seat is at risk How Northern Ireland’s electoral system will prevent any landslide victoriesMost ReadCharity fight event in Belfast marred by violence outside hotel‘Beautul and kind-hearted’: Newry woman Jody Keenandied waiting for an ambulance from BelfastAllison MorrisOpinionDUP’s Jeffrey Donaldson is now at the mercy of loyalist angerMan arrested after street brawl on Belfast’s Dublin RoadVideo: Feral teenagers’ attack on police in Co Down village caught on cameraTop VideosPlayCCTV shows moment device is detonated at Ballysillan ATM PlayPolice attend fatal road collison on Toome BypassPlayBehind-the-scenes as Curry#s fun park opens in Portrush Latest Northern Ireland Assembly election Andrew MaddenOpinionElection briefing: From mysterious rally organisers and a problem in East Antrim to an SDLP sing-songNorthern Ireland Assembly election: Who will top the poll in your constituency and whose seat is at risk How Northern Ireland’s electoral system will prevent any landslide victoriesDUP won’t run females just to tick a box, says candidateAllison MorrisOpinionDUP’s Jeffrey Donaldson is now at the mercy of loyalist angerLatestLoyalist blogger Jamie Bryson in new bid to have  statement charges droppedCatholic activist group petition against QFT’s Good Friday ‘fraud’ film BenedettaWatch: Police release CCTV footage of crimes across Northern Ireland in latest appealReview to be carried out after woman dies waiting for ambulance in NewryFuel protest ends as hauliers leave Dublin,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Press EyeLisa SmythTwitterApril   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailThe DUP has defended the low number of female candidates it is running in next month’s Assembly elections.With just a quarter of women making its list of candidates, the DUP has the lowest number of females in the running for election out of Northern Ireland’s five main political parties.By contrast, % of Sinn Fein candidates are women, followed by the Alliance Party, where half of its runners are female. The SDLP is next, with % of candidates women, while a third of the UUP’s runners are female.The DUP’s South Down candidate has rejected accusations of gender bias and said the party does not run females as a tick box exercise.Diane Forsythe, who has replaced Jim Wells as the DUP’s candidate after  years at Stormont, said: “I am an accountant and mother of three young children.“I am the only DUP candidate in this constituency.“A lot of parties field female candidates in seats where they have little chance of winning or they field women as a second candidate but then ide the area in way which makes it very dficult for the female candidate to win. This shouldn’t be about tokenism. The DUP run female candidates in seats where we can win.”Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Ms Forsythe also pointed out the fact that the DUP was the first major party to have a female leader and female First Minister.“We want to see more females in politics but it should be on merit rather not than tokenism,” she added.Meanwhile, UUP leader Doug Beattie said ensuring more women represent the party at Stormont remains a priority and that efforts will continue to increase the number of female UUP MLAs.“When I took over as leader of the UUP in May last year, I made it one of my absolute priorities to encourage more female candidates to come forward,” he said.“We have not yet reached where I want us to be — % of our Assembly candidates are female, but I desperately want this to increase at the next Assembly elections.“They may have been selected, but the most important thing now is getting them elected alongside their male colleagues, so that we have a base to build on for the future.“We are on a journey and I want to bring about further change as we head towards next year`s council elections and every election after that.”Mr Beattie said he wants the make-up of his party to “reflect society”.He continued: “Diversity and inclusion can only increase the strength of any organisation. We need more role models and I hope that the exceptional candidates we are standing at this election will be future leaders in our party and society.“We are not yet there yet, but I am absolutely committed to taking us in the right direction.”Connie Egan, who is running for the Alliance Party in North Down, welcomed the gender make-up of her party’s candidates which she said had happened without a quota being set. However, she said more needs to be done to tackle sexism faced by female candidates: “We each have a role to play in ensuring we continue to encourage more women to participate.”Related topicsDemocratic Unionist PartySDLPAlliance PartyNorthern Ireland AssemblyJim WellsDoug BeattieMore On Democratic Unionist Party PremiumColum Eastwood urges people to vote tactically and lend SDLP their vote, as he launches election campaignUnionists snub group which aims to improve cross-community relationsNorthern Ireland Assembly election: Who will top the poll in your constituency and whose seat is at risk How Northern Ireland’s electoral system will prevent any landslide victories PremiumAllison MorrisOpinionDUP’s Jeffrey Donaldson is now at the mercy of loyalist angerMost ReadCharity fight event in Belfast marred by violence outside hotelMan arrested after street brawl on Belfast’s Dublin RoadAllison MorrisOpinionDUP’s Jeffrey Donaldson is now at the mercy of loyalist angerVideo: Feral teenagers’ attack on police in Co Down village caught on camera‘Beautul and kind-hearted’: Newry woman Jody Keenandied waiting for an ambulance from BelfastTop VideosPlayCCTV shows moment device is detonated at Ballysillan ATM PlayPolice attend fatal road collison on Toome BypassPlayBehind-the-scenes as Curry#s fun park opens in Portrush Latest Northern Ireland Assembly election Andrew MaddenOpinionElection briefing: From mysterious rally organisers and a problem in East Antrim to an SDLP sing-songColum Eastwood urges people to vote tactically and lend SDLP their vote, as he launches election campaignNorthern Ireland Assembly election: Who will top the poll in your constituency and whose seat is at risk How Northern Ireland’s electoral system will prevent any landslide victoriesAllison MorrisOpinionDUP’s Jeffrey Donaldson is now at the mercy of loyalist angerLatestWatch: Police release CCTV footage of crimes across Northern Ireland in latest appealReview to be carried out after woman dies waiting for ambulance in NewryFuel protest ends as hauliers leave DublinCalornia utility to pay  million dollars over massive wildfiresMP expelled by Tories after being convicted of sexually assaulting teenage boy,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

By working in partnership with Ards and North Down and Newry, Mourne and Down councils, we have an opportunity to develop a sustainable, international walking route, which has the potential to attract visitors, both from home and abroad, to explore our outstanding countryside and learn about our incredible Christian Heritage.Cllr Enright believes that developing a trail of this scale will also encourage walkers to visit existing tourist attractions such as the Livingston Centre at Killinchy Parish Church and stop off on the way in restaurants and stay in local accommodation which in turn will bring much needed income and business to the local economy.Hinch Distillery owner, Dr Terry Cross mdash who set up the David Cross Foundation in memory of his son mdash said he was very impressed with the application for funding from Friends of Columbanus Bangor.ldquoThis project has the ability to bring people from all walks of le to meet and greet one another, regardless of their community background, he enthused.ldquoBuilding relationships, peace and reconciliation across Europe is now more important than ever given the critical situation that has erupted in Ukraine. I wish them every success with their proposal to develop a walking route, which will bring much pleasure to local and international visitors. .prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Down High star in event  ","story":"ST Patrickrsquos Day is always a special occasion in the sporting calendar and this year thankfully events at The Meadows Equestrian Centre were back to normal.The annual inter-school showjumping competition attracted teams from across the province, and the open class, which was a qualier for Balmoral Show was particularly competitive.In the novice class, Sarah Carse, Emily Carse, Ellen MacNabb and Sophie Herron were narrowly beaten into second place.In the open class, Down High had been drawn th in the competition, and just before they entered the arena, only one other school had finished the course on a zero score.The spectator grandstand was full, the weather was close to perfect and the fences were set to be executed with precision.It had proved reasonably tricky so far and understandably the four riders from Down High were more nervous than usual.However, after a breath-taking effort the Down High Flyers managed to finish on a zero score and the clock showed that they had also beaten the time of all the other teams.The presentation of awards quickly followed.Abby Cummiskey, Annie Gibson, Megan Nelson and Zara Sharvin entered the arena once again to receive their rosettes and coveted ticket to Balmoral Show.It was a proud day for their chef drsquoequipe Ruth Adams, their parents and indeed for Down High School.They are now looking forward to a great day out at the Bluegrass Open Championship at Balmoral Showgrounds on May ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Down U","story":"DOWN came into this game on the back of a strong finish to their league campaign to secure second spot in Ulster and earn a Platinum final against a highly fancied Armagh team.During the league when these two teams matched up, just three weeks ago, it took until after half-time before Down registered their first score. However, at the weekend they were determined to not give Armagh a head start and to be as competitive as possible from the first whistle.During a frantic first  minutes the Down girls did not disappoint, fighting for every ball and matching Armagh in every position around the pitch.At the first water-break Down led - to Armagh - in a very even game with Clodagh Simpson scoring a great goal and the lively Orla Owens scoring two points.During the second  minute period of the first half, the Down girls raised their own standard again and pushed Armagh back into their own half.Although Down scored a further - during this period they could have had more, and it was the Armagh team and management who were the happier team to hear the half-time whistle.Scorers in this period were Annie McEvoy with - and Orla Owens again with another point. The half-time score of Down - to Armagh - did certainly not flatter Down as their performance up to then was excellent.Into the second half and Armagh tightened up a lot and restricted Down to less clearer opportunities to score.At the other end Armagh took their own chances and scored a couple of quick goals which gave them the lead for the first time in the match. A point for Owens was the only score for Down during this period.At the second water-break the score was - to - to Armagh.Into the final  minutes and Down made changes to get fresh legs on the pitch. Another Owens point, her fth of the day, levelled up the score at Down - to Armagh - with ten minutes left.Armagh scored two points take the lead for the second time and with time running out, Down went for the goal to win the game.With the ball seemingly stuck in Downrsquos attacking third they just couldnrsquot break down the Armagh defence. With time up Armagh broke up field and scored a goal with the final play to win the match.Full time: Down - Armagh -.The Down girls were disappointed with the result but the management team were delighted with their overall performance. All of the  girls used for Down played their bit.Scorers for Down were Annie McEvoy , Clodagh Simpsonand the top scorer was Orla Owens .Best performers for Down v Armagh were Lily Magee in nets, Eloise Austin, Therese Cowan, Ava McArdle, Zara Kelly, Isa McCarron, Aoe Wolfe, Anna McArdle and captain Maia Murdock but it was Orla Owens who took the player of the match award with her five points.With the Platinum All-Ireland series still to be played in the coming weeks, and the way these girls continue to improve week by week, who knows how far they can go.The management and girls would like to thank everyone for all the messages prior to the final and for all the support on the day.Down: L Magee E Austin, F M Morgan, T Cowan A McArdle, M Murdock, Z Kelly A Wolfe, I McCarron A McArdle, H Donnelly, A McEvoy O Owens, C Simpson, E McKee.Subs: D OrsquoShea, E OrsquoKane, H McGeough, R Horisk, E Farrell, C McDermott, C McGrath, G Kelly, G McMullan, E McHugh, A McKay, H Cassin, C Lundy, T Ryan, L Elmore..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C  April 8%2C 1992  ","story":"NEWCASTLE mdash The RNLI has unveiled plans for a major new pound, leboat station for Newcastle.The station, which is at the planning permission stage, will house the new Mersey class leboat which is due to arrive at the seaside town towards the end of November.If the station plans get Department of the Environment approval, the new complex will be constructed to the north of the harbour beside Newcastle Yacht Clubrsquos car park.The RNLIrsquos tractor house and the old Coastguard station will be demolished to make way for the building and a  metre-long slipway will be constructed to just beyond the high water mark.The new station will replace the existing boathouse which was built in  and, apart from some superficial work, has never been updated. The leboat crew and the shore team have to wash at a stand-pipe and the only toilets are an old Victoria public lavatory adjacent to the boathouse.In addition to a modern launching facility, which is clear of the problem-bedevilled harbour, the new station will provide the leboatmen with a crew room, equipped with toilets and showers, a kitchen, training room, lookout area and souvenir outlet.Work on the new complex is likely to take up to six months to complete and,planning permission is granted, is expected to start in June.The longest part of the work will be the construction of the slipway which will be cut down through the steep shore bank and will involve reinforced piling.Once completed the station will be ready to take delivery of the new leboat, which will be named the Bryant and Eleanor Girling after a generous RNLI benefactor.SAINTFIELD mdash Three workmen and two police officers required hospital treatment after a chemical spill in Saintfield last week.Four  gallon drums containing a mixture of acid and caustic soda, fell from a lorry on the Old Grand Jury Road at around am on Friday morning, initiating a full-scale emergency response from the Fire Brigade.Appliances from Ballynahinch and Downpatrick were sent to the scene and a specialist equipment carrying emergency tender unit was also despatched from Belfast.The incident occurred as the articulated lorry was leaving a yard on the Old Grand Jury Road carrying a large number of the chemical-containing drums.The four drums fell from the lorry, with two spilling several hundred gallons of the corrosive mixture onto the road.The lorry driver and his two assistants quickly righted the drums but suffered from fume inhalation, as did two police officers who arrived on the scene minutes after the spill.All five were treated at the Downe Hospital but were later released.STRANGFORD LOUGH mdash The Department of Environmentrsquos proposals for the management of Strangford Lough have been welcomed as a ldquotriumph of common sense.The comment comes from the Strangford Lough Nature Conservation Associationrsquos chairman, Mr Sam Davis, who is urging all lough users to unite in supporting the new administrators.Mr Davisrsquo confidence-boosting commendation of the new body comes a matter of weeks before its inaugural meeting.SLNCA was born out of the conflict felt around the Lough by controversial DoE management proposals put forward a few years ago.The recommendation to support the new administrators on the eve of their activity will be seen as a wholehearted effort by people who are anxious to make the new management structure work.Mr Davis and the Associationrsquos joint council declared after last weekrsquos meeting that the new structure represents what the loughside community have been looking for.ldquoThe new body represents a wide spectrum of community support, including the pockets of power which were driven largely by their own self-interests, he said.MOURNES mdash Health officials have been accused of ldquoplucking figures from nowhere to justy closure plans for Newcastlersquos Mourne House.The Eastern Health Council heard this week that a renovation figure of pound, for the residential home has been produced without the benefit of a quantity surveyorrsquos report.The claims were made by a deputation from the Friends of Mourne House which addressed the councilrsquos monthly meeting in Dundonald on Thursday afternoon.Friends spokesman, Mr Damian Smyth, told the meeting that the renovation figures which were produced by the Down and Lisburn Unit of Management, are completely dferent from early figures produced by the Eastern Health Boardrsquos building control officer.The officerrsquos report said Mourne House was in good repair, was free fro structural faults, and had a lespan of  years, explained Mr Smyth.He added that a more recent set of figures, produced by the unit of management on April , indicate that only minor works are needed at the home.ldquoThese latest figures say it would cost pound, to raise the standard at the home, including pound, which would have to be spent on fire safety, said Mr Smyth.ldquoThis patently does not square with the unitrsquos first report, which was used to initiate the consultation process, that it will cost a total of pound, to bring the home up to standard, said Mr Smyth. ldquoThis figure includes pound, for fire safety, pound, for a new roof, pound, for a new electrical system and pound, for a new kitchen.ldquoThese figures are bald figures produced by the unit of management with no specications and without the benefit of a quantity surveyorrsquos report, he added.PORTAFERRY mdash Portaferry has become the first town in Northern Ireland to benefit from a pioneering emergency response scheme which will save the lives of heart attack victims.The British Heart Foundation this week handed over a le-saving defibrillator which will enable doctors to provide a first response to cardiac emergencies pending the arrival of an ambulance.The presentation was made on Monday to Portaferry GPs Dr Desmond Compton and Dr David Peacock by Mr Peter Welsh, the Foundationrsquos regional organiser.The doctors believe the equipment could provide a le-saving service for , people in Portaferry and lower Ards Peninsula.It takes around  minutes from an ambulance based in Newtownards to reach the lower Ards.Even so, it would be virtually impossible to put a permanent ambulance in the area because it would be seldom used, according to the Eastern Health Boardrsquos chief ambulance officer, Mr Alan Murray.The Ambulance Service has funded the inclusion of sophisticated diagnostic facilities on the defibrillator, as well as communication systems for the doctors to ensure their immediate availability.BALLYNAHINCH mdash One of Down Districtrsquos biggest charity events of the year will take place in Ballynahinch next month.The Ballynahinch Lions k and fun runs will be staged on Saturday, May , and once again look likely to raise several thousand pounds for charity.In its third year the event has already raised pound, and the organisers are hoping that next monthrsquos event will top the pound total which was raised last year.This yearrsquos beneficiaries will be the Leukaemia Research Fund, the Marie Curie Trust, Beaconsfield, and Lions charities.The event, which is over a proven course and backed by the Northern Ireland Amateur Athletics Federation, has already become established as one of the major events on the athletics calendar

In the case of Jim Fitzsimons, you can take a man out of Downpatrick, but you canrsquot take Downpatrick out of a man.Jim Fitzsimons was born and reared in Downpatrick. He left the town as a young man, having graduated from Queenrsquos University, and spent the next  years or so in England where he had a successful career in further and higher education and in management training.Jim ed to Northern Ireland  years ago and for eight years lived in a cottage at Inch. Now , he and his we, Anne, live in Hillsborough where they enjoy regular visits from their three sons and seven grandchildren.But the lure of Downpatrick remains strong. When the coronavirus struck in March  and the world went into lockdown, Jim decided that the time was ripe for him to write about the town of his upbringing.The result is My Downpatrick: Reflections of  years ago, an affectionate account of happy times. For local people of a certain age, it will be a joyous trip down memory lane packed with names and places comfortingly familiar even with the passing of the years. For those who have no connection with Downpatrick, it is a story which is both educational and entertaining.Jim says he is pleased with the outcome of his efforts. ldquoI am very pleased with the book and I certainly enjoyed writing it. Growing up in Downpatrick we were modestly off, but we had all the things that we needed. It was a good place to live.Jim was born in March , six months before the start of the Second World War, the eldest of three children of William Henry Fitzsimons, a bread server, and his we, Marion. He and his younger brother and sister were reared in Saul Street in the warmth of a loving family and surrounded by many friends.He was educated at Fountain Street School and the Southwell School for Boys, where he and his schoolmates trembled in front a ldquosadistic master who ruled with the cane, before enrolling in Down High School in .Outside of school, there were plenty of opportunities to play sport, as well as trips to the cinema, church socials, the Boysrsquo Brigade and dancing. There were holidays at Tyrella, the annual BB camp, Sunday school excursions to Newcastle and trips to Coney Island, Belfast, Warrenpoint and Dundalk, among other places.It was a time when there were no supermarkets and there was an abundance of bread servers. Like his father, Jimrsquos grandfather was also a bread server, as were some of his other relatives. It was a time when bread servers they didnrsquot just serve bread. Butchers and grocers used them for deliveries. They also carried letters and parcels from the countryside to be posted in Downpatrick and also delivered a sizeable quantity of Down Recorders each week. In short, they were something of a social service.Jim writes about helping his father on his bread cart and also his paper round, which ended when he started in high school, collecting scrap metal during the Korean War and then ersying into collecting waste paper before getting a summer job in the County Surveyors Office in Downpatrick before starting university.He also writes about Downpatrick when it was a market town with a monthly fair and a weekly Saturday market. As the county town it had had many government offices and institutions, as well as hospitals and large factories offering plenty of employment, the county courthouse and two grammar schools.The factories have gone and the hospitals are much diminished since Jimrsquos childhood, but the town has grown considerably mdash its postwar population of around , is now over ,.Of Downpatrick then and now, Jim writes: ldquoDownpatrick was small enough to have a village feel about it. I donrsquot think this is still the case. People donrsquot know each other as they did in the past they live less in town centre terraced houses and more in detached houses in the outskirts.ldquoIn the past many men would go to the pub every evening, not to get drunk, but for perhaps a single drink while catching up with all the local news with friends. Going out to public houses is less common now and the public house and other entertainments is not solely for males. Women in the s and s ands were largely unseen, now they are much freer to do and go as they please. In  it was unheard of for a woman to go into a pub.He goes on: ldquoAlthough there is much to regret about the passing of the Downpatrick that I knew, it is a much better place in which to live. The slum houses that I remember are no more there are modern schools, an imposing new technical college with a nearby state-of-the-art fitness centre, a much expanded campus at St Patrickrsquos Grammar School and advanced plans for a new building for Down High School.ldquoDownpatrick has a range of educational, cultural and sporting opportunities for all ages, for those who wish to take advantage of them. All these opportunities define the quality of a town.My Downpatrick: Reflections of  years ago costs pound and is available at the Saint Patrick Centre and the Grove Post Office in Downpatrick..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Minister waste treatment refusal is blow for Arc 21  ","story":"THE decision by Stormont Minister Nichola Mallon to refuse permission for a large scale waste treatment facility at the site of a former quarry in Newtownabbey has ramications for Newry, Mourne and Down Council.The local authority is a member of Arc which was seeking permission for the multi-million pound plant which could thermally treat , tonnes of municipal waste each year.Ms Mallon said the incinerator plant, which drew over , objections, could discourage recycling, with her decision due to be discussed at the next meeting of the local councilrsquos Neighbourhood Services Committee.Currently, black bin waste collected across the district is transported by sea for incineration in Europe, with council officials keen for the districtrsquos ratepayers to continue focusing their efforts on recycling their waste.There is currently a particular emphasis on ensuring that all food waste is not dumped in black household bins, but in brown bins whose contents is treated and turned into compost.Arc mdash which is considering the decision to refuse permission for the proposed incineration plant mdash is an umbrella waste management group representing six councils on the eastern coast.It was established in  and formally incorporated in  following a process of increasing co-operation amongst its constituent councils.The organisation works on behalf of its partner councils to guide, support and help them deliver their statutory waste management obligations, drive forward innovative waste management programmes, including developing infrastructure and address greater circularity of resources.In addition to Newry, Mourne and Down, the other councils which are members of Arc include Antrim and Newtownabbey, Belfast City, Ards and North Down, Lisburn and Castlereagh and Mid and East Antrim.Ms Mallon said: ldquoI am not persuaded that there is a need for this specic facility. In that context, I do not consider there to be any need for this proposal.A spokesperson for Arc said there was still a ldquoclear need to develop a ldquonew, modern waste infrastructure for the region.It said the proposed facility would boost recycling, reduce emissions and provide green electricity.ldquoIt is essential that Arc has an opportunity to review the planning reasons behind the ministerrsquos statement and we will carefully consider todayrsquos announcement in that light over the next few days, added the spokesperson..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Museum to shut doors over Easter  ","story":"THE Down County Museum in Downpatrick will be closed over Easter.The announcement came just hours after Newry, Mourne and Down Council refused to confirmthe museum would be open to the public over the busy Easter holiday period.Initially, the local authority would only confirm that a decision on the Easter opening would be made in ldquodue course, but within hours of informing the Recorder of this and the paper being printed, it was finally revealed that the museum would remain closed.The council has subsequently confirmed that a reduced staff team is delivering services at the museum mdash which only opens between am and pm from Wednesday and Friday mdash and it is ldquowith regret that it will not be open at Easter.The Recorder understands that are six vacant staff positions at the museum and that up to five staff members are currently off sick.Adverts to recruit new museum staff have been published this week with the local authority looking to appoint and assistant curator, education and outreach officer, museum assistant and a cultural assistant.While council officials are hoping to have new employees in place next month, the local authority has not made clear how many new staff are being recruited and what the Downpatrick museumrsquos future opening hours will be.The museum has been at the centre of a controversial staff restructuring process.Downpatrick SDLP councillor Dermot Curran said thee council should have made it clear last week that the museum would be closed at Easter.Welcoming plans to recruit new employees, he suggested that councillors should be briefed at a one-off council meeting by senior local authority officials on exactly what is happening at the museum.ldquoI remain disappointed that the museum will not be open at Easter. While I understand that work is underway to recruit new staff, many will be disappointed the museum is closed as it is one of the many jewels in the districtrsquos tourism crown, he said.ldquoTourism is something we do very well in our district, but not opening what is a county museum at this time of year is frustrating and very disappointing.He added: ldquoWe need a fully ing museum in the heart of the county town. The Down County Museum is one of the districtrsquos main attractions and the visitors it draws spend time in Downpatrick and support other businesses, especially those in the hospitality sector which boosts our economy.ldquoGiven tourism is a prime driver for our economy, I am very disappointed that our museum will be shut to visitors over the Easter period and know this view will be shared by many.Alliance councillor Patrick Brown has also criticised the councilrsquos decision to keep the museum closed over Easter.He also called for staff to be moved from Newry to alleviate what he described as ldquostaffing pressures.He said: ldquoI am frustrated to see yet another blow to the Down Museum. Our county museum is so important to the area, and leading into the summer months it should be able to play its essential part in our local tourism industry.ldquoThis is particularly important this year, as we try to bounce back from the pandemic. We have already seen huge controversy over councilrsquos downgrading of the museum, and the news that the museum will remain closed over Easter is very unwelcome.ldquoI, along with other councillors, have secured a full review of museum services across the district as a whole, which is due to start this month. I look forward to seeing the results of this so that we can begin to make changes. Council urgently needs to resolve these staffing pressures, reflect on how the downgrading of the museum has contributed to them and seek the urgent reopening of the Down Museum.He added: ldquoI am disappointed that the Down Museum has become another example of how services are being moved from Downpatrick to Newry. I see all the potential Downpatrick has to be a thriving city, but time and again our services are being redirected to Newry.ldquoI want to see Downpatrick on the map as a destination town for the whole of Northern Ireland, andelected to the Assembly in May, I will fight to bring an end to the lack of delivery for Downpatrick that we have seen from the political establishment in the area for so long.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokesman confirmed that the organisation is currently operating with a reduced team of staff to deliver the services at the Downpatrick museum.He said: ldquoIt is therefore with regret that the museum opening times over the Easter holiday period will be Wednesday to Friday between am and pm..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Portaferry man Peter hoping to lose 50lbs in 50 weeks during fundraiser for Air Ambulance NI  ","story":"PORTAFERRY man Peter McGrattan set himself a target of raising vital funds to Air Ambulance NI by losing lbs in  weeks before his th birthday.He started last October and has already lost  pounds, with just  pounds to go before his birthday on September .Peter is a driver for Coach Connections and coaches the Down U- hurling team in his spare time.He explained why he wanted to get involved in such a public way of losing weight.lsquoMy father Kevin was involved in a road traffic collision in Portaferry in , sustaining a traumatic head injury, said Peter.ldquoThankfully Air Ambulance NI were there on the day to treat him and swtly transferred him to Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast.

The team will be announced in due course.Aaron McGrady was in the Peak District along with  other runners for the annual Chicken Run which is a fell race approximately . miles distance and includes , feet of climbing.He had a strong run and placed second overall in a time of .. Aaron was more than happy to be runner-up to the winner Steve Vernon, who is a triple British cross country and mountain running champion ndash He also set the Chicken Run course record in .Steve and Aaron were the only two to break  minutes for the testing course and only nine runners made it home in under the hour so it was a creditable performance from Aaron from all angles.Sunday saw the rescheduled Titanic K. This race was due to take place in  but was called off due to Covid-.At the time a large number of runners deferred their entry to a new date in  but this also fell foul of restrictions at that time so for some runners this was a two year-old ticket.With the ers bolstered by new entrants there were  excited participants in the Harbour Estate ready for action.Paul Lloyd was delighted to finally take to the roads in a race as he has been hampered by a long term injury and has only managed a modicum of training.He last raced in June  so it was a long time coming.He finished in . which placed him th overall. This is a good marker for further improvement as he s to previous form and he commented on how good it felt to be back at a mass participation event. Hopefully he will now feel ready to enter more races in the near future.Manchester MarathonAs anyone who has done a marathon will know, the preparation required is gruelling. Most runners start months in advance and gradually increase their mileage so that they have the stamina to cope comfortably with . miles.They also need to include speed workthey want to set a good time so it is a juggling process.Gordy Graham, coached by Ryan Maxwell, had followed his schedule to the letter and had many promising race results in his build up so it was a hammer blow when he developed a knee injury with only three weeks to go.He eased off the miles in the hope that it would settle and right up to the morning of the marathon, he was debating whether racing was in his best interests.This head versus heart is not a new thing to runners. With the hours spent training for that day, sitting it out would have been too much to bear.In the end he set off with equal amounts of hope and caution and for the first hour or so maintained the pace that he needed to match his . personal best set in Belfast last year.He was in a group banging out miles at an incredible . minutes per mile pace and he felt pretty good until mile .At this point the niggle became enough to disrupt his natural rhythm and as a result his pace wavered. However, true to form he persisted to the line recording .. as he passed the tape.This result is one that would cause celebration for most and it is, in fact, his second fastest marathon but for Gordy there is still a time out there that he wants to achieve and we know that when he has assessed and treated his injury, he will be back pushing for his goal.We wish him luck in his recovery and future endeavours.Hannah Somani was also out chasing specic targets firstly to better her time of . which she set in London Marathon last October and secondly to come home in under three hours. This sub-three barrier is regarded as a holy grail for many and for Hannah being so close on in London was enough to convince her to give it another shot.She continued consistent training throughout the autumn and into the winter with multiple sessions per week as well as long runs at weekends.On her recent trip to Downpatrick she was so committed to the plan that she ran -odd miles on the morning of Jimmyrsquos Ten before heading to the start line.She then went on to run quick enough in the K to lead with two other high performing EDAC ladiestoclinch victory in the team competition.All this must have stood her in good stead as she absolutely nailed it on Sunday. She arrived at the start with quiet resolve and executed her race with precision pacing.Her time of .. was well deserved after her hard work and she was naturally over the moon. Super work, Hannah.Steph Graham was equally determined in her approach. A small matter of a wedding and a baby in the last  months might seem reason to hold back from committing to race targets but when your husband is also your coach then the lines become blurred.Gordy has had prior mention above for his own race but Steph would be quick to acknowledge his part in her achievements. She entered Manchester due largely to his encouragement as she had doubts as to whether she would be ready in time.She had been hacking chunks off her marathon times in the last few years and in Berlin  she ran . so sub . was her aim. This was a big ask as training with a young baby is never easy but she pulled it off with style.Gordy was brimming over with pride when she finished in ... Steph deserves kudos for this performance but even more so for the fact that she had to resort to the treadmill for daily miles.Despite the tedium of running miles looking at a wall, she never missed a session and her hard graft has paid off. What a team.Same distance but dferent city ndash Dee Murray had decided that Paris in the spring would provide the incentive to train over the winter months and he had racked up his miles motivated by excitement of a European marathon.The day dawned bright but chilly and it took a bit of effort to get warm enough to shed the layers before the start.Fortunately once they were lined up on the famous Champs Elyseacutees, the sun came out in fulland the , runners had perfect racing conditions for the rest of the day.Dee ran with his usual metronomic rhythm ticking off the miles and the iconic landmarks as he ran the winding route.Apart from a bit of cramp in the last couple of miles, he felt comfortable and was delighted to get a sub three hour finish in .. shaving a few seconds off his previous best which had held since .Dee is known as lsquoMr Consistentrsquo and running as quickly as he did five years ago endorses that nickname no end.

And then that same year, he collected the Open Championship at Royal Liverpool.It was a truly astonishing tally for a sportsman who was then still only aged . It also cemented Northern Ireland as a golfing superpower — not only home to numerous fine golf clubs including two of the best in the world, Royal Portrush and Royal Co Down, but also to three recent major winners, Graeme McDowell and Darren Clarke as well as Rory. England, a country with  times the population of NI, has never had three major golfing winners in such a limited period of time. If Rory McIlroy’s career had come to an end in , it would still have been a glittering one.But we have all been hoping that he can go a step further, and win the one major title that has so far eluded him — the prestigious Masters at Augusta. That would be a truly astonishing feat, and put him up in a select group of currently only five players, including the greatest names in the history of the sport — Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods.Rory almost did it yesterday, coming second at the Masters to the US golfer Scottie Scheffler. But what an achievement! Rory has been one of the few players to challenge American dominance of the majors in the last decade.His second place yesterday comes after years in which he rarely seemed to be within reach of the very top.Rory is a testament to dedication and perseverance, an inspiration to young people, and a fine ambassador for Northern Ireland.See the back page"},{"url":null,"title":"prince harry and meghan markle watch how the royal romance blossomed in a new documentary with expert analysis ","story":"Paying hospital bills and higher taxes trump desire for Irish unity: Survey   There is ‘no evidence’ that Irish speakers are ‘marginalised second-class citizens’ says former education ministerNewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisUkraineSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensHomes  Gardense-PaperFarmingRecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPuzzlesPublic NoticesFree Happy AdsNewsPeoplePrince Harry and Meghan Markle: watch how the Royal romance blossomed in a new documentary, with expert analysisPrince Harry and Meghan Markle’s story has been one of the most talked about romances of the st Century.By Bill Smith, Latest TVFriday, th March , : pmUpdated Friday, th March , : pm  \"       \"  How did it start  Where did their love bloom  Who were the original Duke and Duchess of Sussex  With exclusive footage, this is the full story of their love covering what happened on the night they met their engagement, the royal wedding, and the challenges they faced as they searched for a home.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe study suggests birds may inherit their ability to forge the appearance of their hosts’ eggs from their mothers.This mimicry dupes host parents into accepting a parasitic egg as their own rather than throwing it out of the nest.Around the world, many birds sidestep the responsibilities of parenthood by laying their eggs in the nest of other species.While this lestyle, called brood parasitism, has advantages it also presents challenges such as how to convince the other species to accept a foreign egg.Many birds who engage in the practice achieve this by mimicking the colours and patterns of their host’s eggs.However, some winged animals exploit the care of several dferent host species whose eggs all look dferent.Scientists have long wondered how a single brood-parasitic bird species can do this, and how these forgers can pass this ability on to their young despite interbreeding between birds raised by dferent hosts.Now genetic research by an international team led by Professor Claire Spottiswoode from the University of Cambridge’s Department of Zoology and the FitzPatrick Institute of African Ornithology, University of Cape Town, and Professor Michael Sorenson at Boston University, has made a major breakthrough, and their findings may be bad news for the egg forgers.The research reveals that female cuckoo finches inherit their ability to mimic the appearance of their hosts’ eggs from their mothers, via the female-specic W chromosome – comparable to the male-specic Y chromosome in humans.According to the scientists, this maternal inheritance allows cuckoo finches to sidestep the risk of inheriting the wrong mimicry genes from a father raised by a dferent host.It has also allowed distinct lineages of cuckoo finch females to evolve specialised egg mimicry of several dferent host species..removeThe researchers suggest such mimicry tricks host parents into accepting a parasitic egg as their own rather than throwing it out of the nest, and so has been crucial to the success of these African birds.However, they believe this long-established system of maternal inheritance may come back to haunt the cuckoo finches.Dr Spottiswoode said: “In this particular coevolutionary arms race between species, natural selection has created a double-edged sword.“While maternal inheritance has allowed cuckoo finches to exploit multiple host species, it’s likely to slow their ability to evolve counter-adaptations as their hosts evolve new defences.“In particular, parasites face a daunting challenge because some host species have inevolved an astonishing ersity of egg colour and pattern ‘signatures’, that help hosts to distinguish their own eggs from parasitic mimics.”The study, published in PNAS, focused on the genetics of egg mimicry in the cuckoo finch, a species which adopts a brood-parasitic lestyle and exploits many species of warbler across Africa.The data was collected at a study site in southern Zambia.Cuckoo finches in this area trick four dferent species of grass-warbler to devastating effect.If host parents fail to detect and remove a parasitic egg in their nest, the young cuckoo finch typically outcompetes the hosts’ own hatchlings, which soon starve to death.But in their fightback against the forgers, grass-warblers have become skilled quality controllers, rejecting eggs that dfer from their own in colour and pattern, and all four species have evolved the ability to deposit unique signatures onto their own eggs to enhance their detection of intruders.The study argues that selection from host defences drove cuckoo finches to transfer control of egg appearance to the maternally inherited part of the genome at least two million years ago..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Scientists crack egg forging evolutionary puzzle article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

As a result, the original camera nest lay empty for most of the summer.Mr Anderson said: “Louis and his new mate Dorcha raised two chicks, so it was a successful year for the ospreys, but a disappointing one for their internet fans.“We wanted to give ourselves the best odds of seeing a full summer of activity this year, so we fitted a second camera to Louis’ new nest.“It’s a few kilometres away from his original tree. Depending on osprey activity, we may revert to follow just one of the nests as the season progresses, butwe are lucky and both nests are occupied, we will keep streaming from both.”.removeIn the hours after histo the nest, Louis’ mate Dorcha also ed to her Loch Arkaig home.The Trust says that Louis gted his other half a fish upon her .Installing just one camera in the forest is a technical challenge, with no visitor centre nearby with wi-fi and electricity to plug into.All of the camera kits are powered by solar  and a signal is beamed across the loch before it enters the Locheilnet system and goes out across the world..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Lockdown star Louis back on screen after camera installed at new osprey nest article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

If Mr Khan’s followers take to the streets, as he has vowed, it could create more pressure on lawmakers and deepen the crisis.Mr Khan, a former cricket star whose conservative Islamist ideology and dogged independence characterised his three years and eight months in office, was ousted early on Sunday.He lost a no-confidence vote after being deserted by his party allies and a key coalition partner.In a show of strength and a precursor to the political uncertainty ahead, Mr Khan rallied hundreds of thousands of supporters on Sunday night to protest over his ouster, describing the new leadership as an “imposed government,” charging they colluded with the US to oust him.His backers marched in cities across Pakistan, waving large party flags and shouted slogans promising tohim to power. The crowds were dominated by youths who make up the backbone of Mr Khan’s supporters.The political drama began April  when Mr Khan sidestepped an initial no-confidence vote demanded by the opposition by dissolving parliament and calling early elections.The opposition, which accuses Khan of economic mismanagement, appealed to the Supreme Court. After four days of deliberations, the court said Mr Khan’s move was illegal and the no-confidence vote went ahead, leading to his ouster..removeMr Khan has demanded early elections — the balloting is not due before August . He has tapped into anti-American sentiment in Pakistan, accusing Washington of conspiring with his opponents to topple him. That conspiracy theory resonates with his youthful base, which often sees the US war on terrorism after   as unfairly targeting Pakistan.Mr Khan claims Washington opposes him because of his independent foreign policy favouring China and Russia. He was criticised for a visit he made on February  to Moscow, where he met with President Vladimir Putin as Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine.The US State Department has denied any involvement in Pakistan’s internal politics..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Shar sworn in as Pakistan us new PM after week of drama article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Do something instead‘Don’t worry!’ How often have we heard that and how often do we say it to others  I suspect it’s being said quite often at the present time, when there seems to be so much to be worried about, writes Rev. Ron Elsdon.By The NewsroomSunday, rd April , : am  \"       \"  There’s the state of the Health Service, the never-ending fallout from Brexit, the war in Ukraine, and the spiralling cost of living which is already inflicting so much hardship on so many. ‘Don’t worry!’ But the problem is that it’s far easier said than done. So when you come across it in the bible as well, you could be excused for writing it off as unrealistic.

It points you to something rather more than that. I offer you two examples where it offers you responses that are practical – strategies,you like.Ron ElsdonFirstly, Paul directs people to pray instead, and to pepper their prayers with thanksgiving . The trouble is that we’re so good at finding things to complain about, often trivialities, that finding things to give thanks for doesn’t come easily, even to people who pray regularly, but why not switch course and actually do it, then keep on doing it  Then, says Paul, the protecting peace of God is there to be discovered, even in the midst of stressful situations. Secondly, Jesus talks about worry in the Sermon on the Mount . When it consumes us, he says, what we need is a new set of ambitions which point us beyond ourselves “Seek first God’s kingdom and God’s righteousness” is His command to His followers. As I write, I’m thinking about a local politician, one I shan’t be voting for. I know he spends Christmas Day at a place for the homeless, helping to serve up hot meals for that I admire him greatly. As I write, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians are fleeing the army of a tyrant from the east, many with nowhere to go in freezing weather. In neighbouring countries, churches and other organisations are swinging into action to help support these folk in their hour of desperate need. So, in their dferent ways, Jesus’ and Paul’s words in the bible are saying to us all, ‘Don’t worry! Do something instead.’Read: Covid travel requirement set to change"},{"url":null,"title":"wit wisdom this too shall pass ","story":"Fuel costs: NI’s most expensive and cheapest petrol and diesel prices   Toome road tragedy: woman dies after crash and man is arrestedNewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationPeopleEnvironmentRead ThisUkraine CrisisFootballIrish League FootballSportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCars FamilyYour NIRetroOpinionAdvertise My Businesscanonical_urlCANONICAL_URLhostnameCANONICAL_HOSTNAMElocationCANONICAL_URLreferrerEXTERNAL_REFERRERpage_view_id_PAGE_VIEW_ID_scroll_SCROLL_HEIGHTgeo__INJECT_GEO__cid_ga:CLIENT_ID,comScore:CLIENT_ID,compass_uid:CLIENT_IDversionsha-wJFtySqNnAxBmRbBZGkmXyZeJTYkxlpMdJsFNIrrGVlru-DcIEIZ\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-container\" i-amphtml-layout\"container\"Loading...NewsAdam Harbinson. WIT  WISDOM: This too shall passWith our recent fine weather I’ve been doing more than my usual five-to- miles a day walking, an activity that, with many of my countrymen, I developed during the lockdown, when there was little  to do, writes Adam Harbinson.By The NewsroomSunday, th April , : am  \"       \"  Last week was idyllic as I walked along the Donegal coast from Moville to Greencastle it was magical, and it struck me again, that while we all know the value of regular exercise, fresh air and social engagement, we might never really know just how beneficial such days are for our physical and mental health.But what perhaps, on the flipside, will our memories of - be in  years time  We’ll be asking ourselves, how on Earth did we remain sane  Brexit has wreaked havoc on our economy, piled on top of which was Covid-. I can still feel the cloud of gloom that settled on me when a radio announcer was suggesting that all over s would not be allowed outside the door of their homes for  weeks.Thankfully it didn’t quite come to that.Then came the murderous war in Ukraine, with pictures being flashed onto our screens of European families hiding in cellars in fear or their lives, not to mention the bloody carnage. But how does this bad news affect our mental health To further exacerbate my potential for anxiety I can tell you that five of my close friends and family members are suffering from le-threatening health problems one has even invited me to his rd birthday party, when he and I know full well that in reality it’s a ‘going away’ party. I’m in my mid-s and while I feel as mentally and physically fit as I was in my s, the thing I hate about my age is that so many of my contemporaries are dropping like flies.So, what can we do to protect ourselves  Firstly we must regulate our intake of deadly news regular exercise and getting out into the countryside is helpful too. Gratitude is of vital importance, so let’s get a pen and paper and make a list of the many aspects of our lives for which we can be truly grateful.But is that enough  You might say no, but since there might be little we can do to help our suffering brothers and sisters, we must recognise the need for serenity to accept the things we cannot change and thecourage to change the things we can.One thing’s for sure this too will pass.

The eagerly anticipated successor to the popular Barrys Amusements opened its doors for the first time on Saturday amid great excitement. Hundreds of people young and old filed through the doors all afternoon as the magic ed to Portmagic - and just in time for Easter. The good news is that Currys is now up and running, boasting all the old Barrys favourites and adding some new ones too. And for those with old Barrys tokens - no, you cant use them, but you can help the RNLI by dropping them into collection boxes dotted around the complex. The fun park has chosen the charity as its partner - a thoughtful gesture given the important work volunteers do in the waters off the north coast. But for now, after two years of zero craic because of the pandemic, all roads lead to the Port and what promises to be a fun-filled holiday period.

The families are bringing in their ious harvests and making preparations for next year. It’s October, and on the shores of Strangford Lough the Elliott family rear turkeys. The family have years of experience looking after the birds and yet Mark and Olive are still fascinated by their behaviour. Olive comments that they are ‘extremely inquisitive’. While Mark is making sure the turkeys are well fed, his mum Olive can’t help giving them an extra treat. She comments too, “I can’t do without my family, I have to be so nice to them at the minute!” Mark points out that they have been receiving orders for Christmas since August, which is ‘absolutely nuts.’ Near Kilcoo in the Mourne Mountains, Aine Devlin is preparing her flock for the most critical part of her farming year- breeding season. Aine is keeping an eye on her rams to make sure they’re doing their job. She coats their chests with paint to see which ewes they have been with. Aine laughs, “This is his cologne for the girls!” For her AI is not the way to go as the ewes would then all lamb on the same day on the mountain. She loves this time of year and is proud of the part she plays in the economy. “What’s better than buying produce from down the road from your neighbours and local communities ” she says. Outside Crossgar, Richard Orr is thinking ahead to next year’s wheat crop. It’s all about the planning and attention to detail to make sure the groundwork is done right. He’s conscious of the environment, saying, “The major thing in the world is carbon footprint. Chemicals have made farming easy, and modern machinery has damaged the structure of the soil - we need to rebuild that.” Meanwhile, just outside Portadown it’s all hands on deck for apple harvest at the McKeever family farm. There isn’t a high yield this year but sometimes things not going to plan can be a blessing. Pat talks about the seven to eight weeks of hell and this year pickers have been hard to get. Peter comments, “It’s half the battle when you have good people around.” On the Donegal   Londonderry border, potato farmer Jamie Rankin and his team are coming towards the end of their harvest. He enjoys the early starts and says, “What you do before dinner time’s your day’s work.” While it’s a job Jamie enjoys, it also comes with challenges as winter months close in. The bad weather has led to reduced yields and a late harvest, but he’s very proud to have produced a good crop. UTV’s Mark McFadden narrates the series. Sponsored by Moy Park, ‘Rare Breed – A Farming Year’ continues on Tuesday th April at pm on UTV.  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_dfabdcbcfef   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_bcacabebea   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1649684275157.jpg--april_showers__keep_them_shorter_.jpg?164968427500","title":"april showers keep them shorter ","story":"Spring has finally sprung and with rising energy costs there is no better time to dust off old habits and create some new ones that are good for your pocket and the environment. Start by thinking how much water you are using each day. Whether you are washing your hands, cleaning endless amounts of dishes or getting through that mountain of washing, you start to realise just how important water is and the sheer amount we use. NI Water’s Environmental Outreach  Learning Officer, Anna Killen, explains how we can save water by looking at everyday habits, “It’s amazing to think that each day each person uses around  litres of water! However, saving water can be really easy, there are simple things we can all do that can make a huge dference. “Did you know that the average time people in Northern Ireland spend in the shower is  minutes, over % of people still overfill the kettle and less than frac of people have a waterbutt ”  “We want that to change and it’s easy, start by looking at small changes for example, your kettle, since working from home it has have been working overtime, but just fill with as much water as you need. Overfilling can use twice as much energy and water, each time you boil. “With rising energy costs, it might be time to think about reducing the time spent in the shower, hot water costs money! Why not try the  minute shower challenge, put on your favourite  minute song and seeyou can finish before the end.” To help you embed with these new habits and ‘Get Water Fit’, complete our online water audit at https:www.getwaterfit or take part in water saving challenges and receive your free water saving items including  minute shower timer, toothy timers and swell gel bags for the garden. Some water saving tips:  Turn off the tap when brushing your teeth - A running tap can use  litres ofwater per minute.  Use a bowl for washing vegetables - Then you can reuse this water for plants.  Make full use of your washing machine - Half load programmes on washing machines use more than half the water and energy of a full load, so wait until the machine is full before switching it on.  Fix leaking taps - A dripping tap can waste more than  litres of water per week.  Keep a jug of water in the fridge, instead of letting the tap run cold. NI Water are encouraging customers to sign up to its free text alert service which keeps them updated about anything that may impact on their water supply or any of our other services in the area.here https:www.niwater register-for-keeping-you-informed   addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_dfabdcbcfef   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_bcacabebea   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
