Two others have also been detained, one being the driver of the lorry once owned by the Mahers.Mr Jeliazkov spoke by telephone with the Mahers hours before police swooped and he said they re-iterated in the conversation that they had sold the lorry in December 2018 to an Irish company.He said: \u0027They are 100 per cent not criminals. I have known them for several years and know they have three children who they love very much.

She talks about finding her voice You walk up many flights of stairs to reach Celia Paul’s flat, but the climb is worth it. The windows of her studio and bedroom look down on the courtyard and facade of the British Museum. All the world and its history, in every available London light, is just across the street. Paul has lived and painted here – the two things are inseparable in her mind – since 1982, when she discovered this place with Lucian Freud, her then lover and the father of her only child, Frank, also a painter.“When we first came to look,” she recalls, “the entrance was at the back and the place seemed a bit dingy. It had been bedsits and there were gas fires where you put coins in the meter, but then we came in here and saw these windows and we were just overwhelmed. Lucian put down the cash deposit immediately.”Paul, now 58, rented the flat for a couple of years before the landlord offered it for sale. Freud bought it for her for £75,000, “which seemed such an incredible lot of money at the time”. It has not changed much in all the time since. There are bare boards on the floor she points out an old leak in one corner of the ceiling. The studio is empty except for her easel and piles of discarded paint tubes and rags and a mirror, from which Paul constructs her haunting and soulful self-portraits. The only furniture in the adjoining living room is a battered chaise longue and a chair that is smeared, like much else, with paint. There is a single iron-framed bed in one corner. Paul, whose father was the bishop of Bradford, is married to Steven Kupfer, a teacher of philosophy, but they have always kept separate homes. What faith she has herself, she expresses on canvas.She is not, she admits to me with an apologetic giggle quite early in our conversation, a great lover of conversation. She has struggled her whole life with the terrors of small talk. Her self-containment, her vivid and protected world of interiors, is what gives her painting its enormous affective power. Paul describes herself as an autobiographer rather than a portrait painter by which she means she paints mostly herself and those she loves – her four sisters, her late mother, her husband, her son. Each of those singular figures emerge in her work as if from a private netherworld of thoughtful and anxious attention. For a while the family lived near Haworth, and the Brontës have been touchstones for all of the sisters. They have each lost count of the number of times they have read Jane Eyre. Something of the ghost of that association animates a poetic, sometimes painfully honest memoir that Paul has written, which is the occasion for our interview.Before we sit down to talk she shows me the new paintings that she plans to include in an imminent exhibition of her work at the Victoria Miro gallery in London, which will open at the same time as her book appears. Paul has lately been granted her due as a soft-spoken star of British figurative art, “an artist like no other” according to the New Yorker. She hoists her new canvases, which have their backs to the room, one by one to her easel, while offering a commentary about how vulnerable it feels to show work in this way.The paintings each infuse the room with curious light, and put a pin in the map of Paul’s life. First up is a meditative seascape that she painted on a recent foray out to Los Angeles for an exhibition of her work. “I dreaded going because I never go anywhere…” she says, “but the ocean proved inspiring.” The light and the vegetation stirred memories of her very early childhood in India, where her father worked as a missionary. “And that made me wonder about my dread of going away…”Is the dread about the travel, the flying?“No,” she says. “I don’t mind flying but I suffer from homesickness terribly. I can’t stop thinking about getting back to my space here.”That space is then occupied with an ethereal picture of her younger sister Kate, a writer and former actress, who became her most frequent sitter after their mother, at 80, was unable any longer to negotiate the stairs.In her book, Kate emerges as Paul’s first confidante and soulmate, the sounding board for the fears and excitements of her involvement with Freud, whom she met, aged 18 when she was his student at the Slade School of Fine Art. Freud was then 55. They became lovers almost immediately, maintained a relationship for nearly a decade and a complicated intimacy that lasted until Freud’s death in 2011.The relationship has led to Paul being routinely identified as another entry in Freud’s extensive catalogue of lovers and subjects – she sat for several portraits – rather than as a formidable artist herself. She sees her book, and her self-portraits, as hard-won acts of liberation and defiance at that characterisation.“When Lucian died I was shocked by how I was seen in the world,” she says. “I was ‘Lucian Freud’s muse’. I felt I needed to do something about this. I thought the way to do that would be to make this story my own.”She shows me another portrait, this one of her husband, Steven Kupfer, a tender painting that wants to bristle with its subject’s quickness of mind.She pauses before it. “Steven is very ill,” she says. “Though he does not look it. He has had bowel cancer and now he has liver cancer. I painted this in May. He is having chemo still and tests for which we always hold our breath. Psychologically he is very strong, reading madly, thinking about the transcendental ego. His morale is tremendously good.” When Paul smiles, she becomes a different person, suddenly girlish. “He used to think about philosophy when he sat for me,” she says, “but he often used to fall asleep. So now he memorises cryptic crossword clues before he comes and solves them in his head.”Kupfer, 78, lives in Kentish Town, a couple of miles north from here. I wonder how their marriage works – was it never their plan to live together?Her memoir begins pointedly with the moment she met Freud – he in a perfectly tailored grey wool suit, with a white silk scarf, smoking a Gitane – on one of her first days at art college, fresh from her girls’ boarding school in Devon. The first half of what follows mines her old diaries and letters and poems to reconstruct the love and longing and frequent despair that the affair caused her. Some scenes are hard to read – Paul’s account of Freud’s initial forceful physical advances his insistence that she lie naked for him to paint, imposing an acute vulnerability that made her cry the one-sided demands and frequent betrayals – and the more so because they are rendered in her original youthful voice.Her story emerges from those beginnings, however, to tell a different tale, one that celebrates family and persistent female power. In Freud’s last painting of Paul, she stands fully clothed in this studio, her foot on a tube of paint, with a naked male model, her friend Angus Cook, sprawled on the chaise. Freud seemed to be marking a change in her, a suggestion that she was ready to transition from passive muse to active artist. She is not sure she needed his permission.Her own work subsequently dwelt on just those tensions. Her best-known self-portrait, Painter and Model (2012), was a large-scale intensely layered depiction of herself sitting in a painting smock the painting was a scene stealer in the 2016 Tate Britain survey of post-war British painting, All Too Human, alongside the headline acts, Freud and Francis Bacon. The last two new paintings she shows me in her studio, are both new images of herself, now tentatively standing.“When I first started doing self-portraits – and I didn’t start until I was in my 40s, quite late – I did these portraits where my hand was kind of stretched out toward the canvas, as if about to paint,” she says. “I suppose I was imitating those famous poses of Goya or Rembrandt. But something felt so false about that. Somehow women don’t have a secure place in the history of art and to portray myself in this way standing squarely, about to paint, it wasn’t right.”The new paintings have been inspired in part by the connection she felt to Paula Rego’s recent exhibition, Obedience and Defiance. She laughs. “I think I’m finally ready to stand up from my chair,” she says. She stands back from a version of herself on the easel. “I called it Self-Portrait Standing. This is a kinder one of me than some, I think.”We both stare at the unforgiving, hollow-eyed portrait and I suggest it could be kinder still.“Do you think? This one started as a very much more cruel image. So what I did, there is this painting by Frans Hals, a beautiful painting of a gorgeous young woman I saw, and I did a sketch of it and put it on the easel so that she would look kindly on me while I was doing it.”If Celia Paul had to escape from domineering male presences in her life, she also had to find a role for herself among her sisters (one of whom, Jane, is married to the former archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams).A portrait she made of the four sisters after her mother died in 2015, My Sisters Mourning seemed to capture something of the form of the famous painting of the Brontë sisters, by their brother Branwell. She suggests the reference was conscious.Has religio been important to her?“From the earliest memory every day started with prayer and ended with prayer,” she says. “And it is still in my bloodstream, even though I am not conventionally religious. I am not good at belonging to groups. But doesn’t everyone think about God?”That tendency, her memoir suggests, was one reason Lucian Freud was drawn to her, and one of her own means of keeping herself apart.“I think what Lucian was most disturbed by,” she says, “was my kind of stillness. He had no truck with God. He found that difficult to deal with.”And determined to disrupt?“Yes absolutely. He found it disturbing even if I looked dreamily out of a window. He wanted me firmly in the world.”Freud encouraged her to think of their relationship like that between the youthful Gwen John and the ageing Auguste Rodin. John gave up painting for a time, “to give herself up to this experience of being in love” with the old master. Early in their affair, Freud encouraged Paul to do the same. Could she see the attraction of that?“I think I might have been attracted to it if I hadn’t known something of Lucian’s past history,” she says. “There was another of his girlfriends, Susie Boyt, who had also been at the Slade 25 years before me and had had five children, four with Lucian. She had stopped painting. Lucian and Susie went on being very close, and Lucian admired her tremendously, but I had the feeling that Lucian might have said something similar to her once in regard to Gwen John and Rodin.“For myself, I think Rodin and Lucian were in quite a profound way very different. Some of the greatest things Rodin did were watercolours of naked women. I felt he had a real empathy with women, as separate to himself, and I feel with Lucian there was always this element of control.”Looking back, now she is at Freud’s own age while they were together, does the relationship feel more uncomfortable than it did at the time?“It does, though when I was at the Slade several of the students were having affairs with tutors. The fact that Lucian said to me subsequently that he only came to the Slade to pick up a girl, didn’t at the time seem shocking to me, or to anyone there. Whereas now to me it does seem shocking. I had approached him in the life room wanting to show him my drawings, because we both had drawn and painted our mothers. I had felt that affinity. But really that wasn’t why he was drawn to me and that felt hurtful at the time.”The relationship with Freud was her first experience with men, she says, which, as her diaries make clear, made it harder to comprehend.“I had been at a girls’ boarding school,” she says. “I wasn’t interested in boys or men, I was interested in art. I was shocked by Lucian pouncing on me. But part of me thought: ‘Maybe this is what happens.’ I talked to my mother about it. And my mother said to me: ‘Well, maybe you are in love with him.’ And I thought to myself: ‘Well, maybe I am.’ Somehow her saying that seemed almost to give permission for all of it.”Though Freud had numerous children – there are 14 acknowledged sons and daughters but maybe 30 others – he professed to have no interest in babies. He maintained close relationships with his grown-up offspring – including Frank Paul – but could never have been confused for a hands-on father.Freud began perhaps his most loving portrait of Paul, Girl in a Striped Nightshirt between 1983 and 1985, during which time she became pregnant and gave birth to Frank. “He was very caring while I was pregnant, we were very close during that time,” Paul recalls. “But after, he was very pleased that I was going to ask my mother to help look after Frank. He expected me to come and be available as I had been, but obviously my life became more complicated.” In 1985 when Freud made the portrait of Paul standing, and he bought this flat, they “were drifting apart in all sorts of ways,” Paul says. “When I first met Lucian he wasn’t that famous. He was notorious, but he did not have a big international reputation or anything. He was a genuinely Dostoevskian character it seemed to me, living much more on the edge. And then later he became more a national treasure and was quite seduced by that.”When did she last see Freud?“I saw him actually on the day he died,” she says. “I saw him quite regularly at that time. A few weeks before he died I gave him a bath, and he always used to love having his back washed, and I washed his back with a sponge. He was much more gentle then and, of course, he wanted to regale me with stories about being friends with Princess Margaret and all that.”Though she tried several times, Paul never completed a painting of Freud. “I had a mattress on the floor of my studio and he would lie down on that and curl up,” she says. “I got quite far with one painting and then I just thought this isn’t what I want to do and so gradually I stopped.” She once made a pencil drawing of Freud asleep that she liked, but painted over it with a sketch of a kneeling penitent.Later she says, in another context: “It is quite telling of portraiture that love shines through. It is one of the reasons I know I can’t paint people I don’t love. If it works, it is only in a staged way.”While we talk about this past there is the constant, distant noise from the street below from tourists and school parties visiting the museum. Paul seems suitably raised above that cacophony here.The contrast of stillness is perfect for her, she suggests, though occasionally busking bagpipers below drive her mad. She imagines that in the future she may move away from London in search of greater peace – perhaps to the Preseli hills in west Wales where she spends holidays – but it is hard to imagine her apart from this studio.“I think I’m a braver person, less anxious than I was,” she says. “My son is completely independent now. So I am freer than I’ve ever been before.”I ask about the rhythm of her days. She rises early, at five or six, depending on the light, she says. “I have a cup of tea in bed when I look out at the sky. I know a lot of painters boast about working 14 hours a day. But that’s not me. My things tend to come in great bursts. So sometimes I work long hours and then sometimes not many hours at all.”You would hesitate to describe Paul as a confident person, but she is possessed of a quietly cheerful certainty in her powers of persistence. She feels finally, she says, that she might be granted her own space apart from the alpha males of British painting. “One of the phrases I really don’t like is ‘in her own right’,” she says, as in: “Celia Paul is also a painter in her own right.” Her voice rises slightly in the stillness of the studio. “I want there to be no question that I am a painter in my own right. I feel that my painting belongs to a whole tradition of British art. I can see connections between my work and Stanley Spencer, and Gwen John and Frank Auerbach. And that is the main way I am connected to Lucian,” she says, firmly, “as part of that spirit of British painting.”• Celia Paul’s memoir, Self-Portrait, is published by Jonathan Cape (£20).

It is a pencil drawing, but you would no more refer to it as a sketch than you would refer to a three-course dinner as a snack. Freud would have been 25 when he made it and, if not already married (to Kitty Garman, one of Jacob Epstein’s daughters), then soon to be so – and in some ways, its immaculacy seems to speak to that moment. The artist’s depiction of his youthful self is boyishly sensual: his lips like pillows, his skin as smooth as a sheet stretched over a mattress. Freud’s new status must, at the time, have seemed surprising, not to say alarming, and here he bottles that incredulity for posterity. You can almost hear the sharp intake of breath.But look more closely, and something else emerges. Freud’s head is tipped back, as if there were invisible hands at his throat, or someone yanking his hair from behind. This creeping violence sets the tone for much of what follows. Freud’s self-portraits (there are 56 here, some of them rarely seen in public) are all sorts of things: tender, witty, experimental and – yes, that dread word – visceral. To walk around this show is to be powerfully aware both of his intense single-mindedness – the sheer quality of his concentration – and of his abiding fascination with the idea of the shifting, slippery self the experience is a little like being watched. But if some red thread does link them, it is surely this inescapable menace.The curators, Jasper Sharp of the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna, and the artist David Dawson, Freud’s longtime studio assistant, suggest that his self-portraits have an elusive quality, one that brings to mind a game of hide and seek. I know what they mean – in Untitled (Self-Portrait), 1978, it is as if Freud is being swallowed by fog, like some Victorian spectre – but it’s also the case that I’ve seldom felt the presence of an artist in a gallery so strongly as here. Even when he’s barely in the picture – just a pair of feet in the corner (Naked Portrait With Reflection, 1980), or a shadow falling across an unmade bed (Flora With Blue Toenails, 2000-01) – his presence is palpable, a pulse throbbing in your ear.Though Freud insisted that his work was “purely autobiographical”, he wasn’t keen on the idea of narrative his fixation was with boiling people down to their essence. But this painting tells its own story. Here is a battle (for time, for space, or perhaps even for primacy) in which he appears as the victor. Finally, there is Self-Portrait With a Black Eye, 1978, made after an altercation with a taxi driver, in which the physical result of violence is the source of both pride and irresistible curiosity (another kind of man, and even of artist, would have been resting with a steak on his face, not standing in front of his easel).This is a magnificent and utterly absorbing exhibition: stopped clocks, and all that. Like a er, you go down and down, only to emerge with a slight sense of the bends: outside, the world is not, after all, controlled by the deity that is Freud. It covers a life, and because of this it presents the remarkable scope of the artist’s talents, from the enamelled exquisiteness of the early work to the impasto of the late from the smaller canvases he favoured at the start of his career to the outsize ones he made towards the end. Thanks to this, too, it’s moving in a very human way.Here, paint represents years: the thicker it grows, the greater the intimations of mortality. Somewhere towards the end, he makes Painter Working, Reflection, 1993, a self-portrait that is seemingly without vanity – the slippers the nude Freud wears in it have a singular pathos – but that also, by sheer dint of its size, demands that you pay attention to the ruined realms of its subject’s body. It is marvellous and noble and strange, and you feel better for having gawped at it: ready, as it were, for the long fight ahead.Gauguin Portraits at the National Gallery is a blockbuster show. I don’t mean this as a criticism. But some of these images are so well known by now, even if only in their generality, that it’s hard, sometimes, truly to see them. For focus, I concentrated my gaze on the artist’s self-portraits, of which, thanks to his self-obsession, there are several. Lively and provocative, they are also quite deranged: egomania in mustard yellow and liverish green. In Christ in the Garden of Olives, 1889, Gauguin depicts himself as Christ on the eve of his betrayal, thereby drawing parallels between Jesus’s persecution and the isolation he himself experienced as an artist for whom success was elusive. In Self-Portrait, 1890-94, meanwhile, he presents himself as a “savage from Peru”.As all the world knows, Gauguin travelled from France to Tahiti, where he had sexual relationships with young girls – the gallery is straightforward about this, neither making excuses for him, nor indulging in token outrage – and he died in the Marquesas Islands. In this self-portrait, he attempts to portray the misunderstood “savagery” of his creativity by darkening his skin to a greyish blue. Not only does this merely underline the way that, for all his talk of liberation, his worldview was inevitably bounded by colonialism. It’s also rather comical. His nose is red, like a drinker’s. His lower lip is white, as though he was parched. His moustache is, as ever, rendered with all the pride of a matinee idol.No wonder, then, that I turned to his Anthropomorphic Pot, 1889, with a smile. I’ve always liked Gauguin’s ceramics – they are free-thinking in ways that his paintings only aspire to be – and this is a particularly endearing example: grotesque, humorous, and then, as you realise that the Gauguin-like figure that forms the vessel has its thumb in its mouth, finally rather touching. Here is an artist suddenly at ease: doing as he pleases, cartwheeling in clay.• Lucian Freud: The Self-Portraits is at the Royal Academy, London, until 26 January 2020• Gauguin Portraits is at the National Gallery, London, until 26 January 2020"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bfb2c0d95cfe91262192ff20762209def06c4a6a/0_200_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2248af96f734cd3bd9e11307b8434dbe","title":"20 photographs of the week","story":"Protests in Santiago and Beirut, Turkey’s military offensive against Kurdish forces, wildfires in California and the Darling River runs dry – the past seven days, as captured by the world’s best photojournalists"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d76608a241fcea0662747406c216580cc7c8fca4/1016_691_2508_1505/master/2508.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b0b5b12077e62cd144ae89f1985cf66a","title":"the invisible female workers of london in pictures","story":"London-based artist Caroline Walker takes inspiration from “invisible” women in the UK capital’s service industries – housekeeping staff, tailors, hairdressers, nail technicians – for her large oil paintings (many between 6ft and 10ft wide) inspired by 19th-century French painters such as Manet. “There’s all this stuff happening around us,” she says. “If we open our eyes, we can see a lot – not just about those people’s lives, but about the way we all live.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a29d16944b2611f9c161c06020f9a4e88cc72084/130_0_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6fc87a3fa906fb4feafeaa1c3b42eb11","title":"bbc his dark materials pullman steve mcqueen year 3 photos tate britain national gallery staff","story":"The BBC adaptation of His Dark Materials provokes debate over its suitability for children, while the National Gallery scores a memorable own goalJust how dark is His Dark Materials? The BBC, which has made a splendid adaptation (14-year-old Dafne Keen as Lyra is outstanding) of Philip Pullman’s bestselling trilogy, pondered long and hard about its tone, content and when to show the eight-parter. In the end it plumped for 8pm rather than 9pm, the traditional slot for its Sunday-night dramas. The earlier time gives more youngsters a chance to watch it “live”, even though the series’ lead producer, Jane Tranter, now an independent but who ran BBC Drama in the 2000s, argues that the TV version is “for adults which children can watch”.Pullman has always refused to categorise his Dark Materials books. Yet there is child-snatching and medical experiments on those kids to remove their souls. Tranter counters that “children are going to be the least scared as they will not understand everything”. Probably not some of the physics and religion, but I reckon they’ll “get” being stolen by baddies.This BBC One series, starting on 3 November and based mainly on Pullman’s first book, Northern Lights, will be followed this time next year by a second eight-parter, inspired by The Subtle Knife. The BBC has not, however, committed to a third (10-part) series of The Amber Spyglass. Good thing that His Dark Materials has the deep pockets of HBO and New Line Cinema, owned by Warner Bros, to support the Beeb.Look out for more than 600 billboards displaying seven- and eight-year-old schoolkids going up from Monday week in all of London’s boroughs. The huge posters are a fortnight-long prelude to Steve McQueen’s Year 3 photo project, which will be shown at Tate Britain from 12 November. Great advance publicity for the exhibition, which will show about 70,000 youngsters from the majority of the capital’s primary schools in class photographs that are being brought together in a giant installation in the Duveen Galleries.The aim is to celebrate how erse London schoolchildren are, and in a nice touch the images posted in each particular borough will feature kids from other boroughs. The billboard campaign, plus the considerable expense of taking the photos, is being borne in part by charities set up by Bloomberg and the late Cubby Broccoli, the James Bond film producer.A few months ago, I wrote about the dismissal of 27 lecturers and educators, who had been working for many years at the National Gallery. They took their case to a tribunal earlier this year, receiving a judgment that they had been employed workers and not freelancers as the gallery claimed.So a victory for the 27, which cost the National Gallery nearly half-a-million pounds in legal fees. Now, ironically, it’s inviting them back after realising that their less experienced replacements are not as good. And, despite knowing their backgrounds, the gallery is demanding three referees, proof of identity and assurances of no criminal record. How ridiculous.A literary double for the Observer: both William Feaver, art critic of this paper from 1975 to 1998, and Laura Cumming, who has held the post for the past two decades, are on the shortlist of six for the Baillie Gifford prize, the top award for nonfiction. Feaver has been nominated for his biography of Lucian Freud and Cumming for her story of her mother’s mysterious kidnapping."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/019a761714c550ee7d1cacc9e2742a4994b18d01/0_122_4556_2733/master/4556.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=05dfd704ed7ce0bcd7ce946a463fef89","title":"john humphrys classic fm radio","story":"It’s a long way from the BBC as the veteran presenter starts his new gig this week“Well, I was delighted to be asked!” says John Humphrys, on the phone. “I got an email very soon after I left the Today programme asking me to do it. I did get others, but this was the offer that most appealed, simply because it was so different to what I was doing before.”Humphrys is talking about his new gig as stand-in presenter of the More Music Breakfast show on Classic FM. The ex-Radio 4 presenter will be chuntering between tracks every morning this week between 6am and 9am, while Tim Lihoreau is off.How will Humphrys do? More Music is very different from Today. Lihoreau has perfected a cosy, calm atmosphere, his tone welcoming but not dominating, “a chilled start to the morning”, as Lihoreau puts it. Actually, in the first hour, he doesn’t say too much at all, which Humphrys might find a challenge, though there is the serene presence of Moira Stewart to temper his verbosity: she reads the news headlines every 20 minutes.And I can’t imagine Humphrys getting stuck into Lihoreau’s out-of-studio work. A few weeks ago, he dragged an upright piano from the Classic FM studios in Leicester Square to the Albert Hall, as part of Global’s Make Some Noise charity efforts. (Global is the parent company of Classic FM and Make Some Noise funds projects across the UK that help disadvantaged children, young people and their families.) He raised more than £75,000. In short, Humphrys has big earphones to fill.Classic FM now has 5.1 million listeners, its biggest audience in 12 years. More Music Breakfast gets 1.68 million weekly listeners and John Suchet’s morning show, immediately afterwards, tops 2.5 million. When the station works – and it nearly always does – it slightly reminds me of Terry Wogan’s old Radio 2 breakfast programme: there’s a sense of the world getting on with its hectic life somewhere off to the left, while on air a community is provided by the listeners, who email in about this and that, asking for a school run shoutout or telling Suchet about their local rugby team losing by more than 100 points to nil.Classic FM means easy classical music, often the tunes you already know from film scores or TV themes, as opposed to the trickier, more highbrow stuff on Radio 3. It has a live gig twice a year at the Albert Hall, slickly staged and beautifully presented by glamorous hosts such as Suchet and Margherita Taylor.All this might seem comfy and unmodern, but that would not be right. Global, which also owns LBC, Capital, Heart, Smooth and Radio X, is a dynamic – rivals would say ruthless – media company. Eddie Mair, who joined LBC from Radio 4’s PM, described to me Global’s habit of having a company-wide conference, where everyone, from presenter to PR, sits in a big cinema and the managers talk about the Rajar ratings. “They stand at the front and talk about one programme, saying, in front of everyone, ‘Well, you’re doing well, congratulations’ and to another, ‘You’ve got to pull your socks up’ and it’s quite frank. I was amazed the first time I went.”Global’s bosses poach presenters they like: LBC got Eddie Mair Classic nabbed Moira Stuart from Radio 2 with the offer of a year-round Saturday afternoon show Capital Xtra has Tim Westwood, Semtex and Ras Kwame, all ex-BBC, while Amanda Holden joined Jamie Theakston on Heart to make a national radio breakfast show that instantly became commercial radio’s biggest, with 4.6 million listeners. The fact that 21 local radio shows were ditched to create the new show was not seen as a problem – more than 70 presenters found themselves without a job.Classic FM, for all its gentility, is a Global station. A year ago, it launched Case Notes, about the murky mysteries of classical music, which promptly won best true crime podcast at this year’s Podcast awards. The station knows Humphrys is a draw and its producers and bosses will ensure they help him find his Classic groove. Or grooviness: after all, a visit to Classic FM is remarkably similar to a visit to Capital Xtra. All Global’s national programmes come from the same studios in Leicester Square. There’s severe security to get through, involving bar codes and photographs before you even get to reception, then a modern hangout cafe, with soft chairs and decent coffee, before you reach the studios. And those studios! So white, shiny and luminous as to almost seem space age…“Yes,” says Humphrys. “The Classic FM studios are very fancy, my goodness! No, I won’t be wearing sunglasses indoors. But they do make the BBC seem like a local news station!” Well, yes, in many ways, they do. Humphrys had better watch out. He’s about to be Classic-ed.• Miranda Sawyer is the Observer’s radio critic• This article was amended on 27 October 2019. An earlier version misspelled Moira Stuart’s name and confused John Suchet with his brother, David. With “5.6 million”, we also overstated Classic FM’s number of weekly listeners by 500,000.

So be warned that they had an unusually early and quite nasty flu season down under this year. I mention this because fear of the flu is one of the hidden reasons why Boris Johnson craves a pre-Christmas election.Because a winter crisis in the NHS would be menacing to the Tories’ electoral prospects it would be conversely advantageous for Labour. They would be armed with ammunition for their argument that the Conservatives have run down key public services. Labour people also think they would be able to move the national conversation off Brexit and on to a topic where the party is much more comfortable. The salience of the NHS as an issue with the voters typically rockets after Christmas, whether or not there is a flu epidemic. Labour people won’t say this in public unless they are complete idiots, but I know that the prospect of a winter NHS crisis has featured in shadow cabinet debates about whether to agree to a pre-Christmas election.Politicians are often at their most dishonest when it comes to election timing and neither party is being straight about their reasons for wanting or not wanting to fight a campaign held to a festive soundtrack of perfume ads and gritting lorries.Begin with Boris Johnson. He’s already made two thwarted bids to trigger an election and plans another after MPs stymied his attempt to ram the Brexit legislation through parliament in a breakneck three days. He claims he needs an election because an obstructive parliament is standing in the way of his mission to “get Brexit done”. Yet the means to get on with doing it are in his own hands. He can simply unpause the withdrawal legislation. It was approved in principle by a majority of 30, a chunky margin in the current circumstances. It is notable that Jeremy Corbyn has not disciplined any of the 19 Labour MPs who helped the Tory leader to that victory by joining him in the aye lobby for the bill’s second reading. One of Labour’s frontbench, Jo Platt, voted with the Tories and she hasn’t been sacked from her job, which would be the usual sanction against a member of the shadow team who defied the party whip. This is better than a nod and a wink to the pro-Brexit contingent of Labour MPs that Mr Corbyn would think himself suited if the legislation proceeded through parliament.If the government offered a more reasonable timetable for scrutiny of the withdrawal agreement, it would almost certainly be agreed to. It would also be extremely likely that the European Union would offer a sufficiently ample extension for that to happen. Of course – and this is an important reason why he wants a quick election – the Johnson deal could start to fall apart once it is subject to detailed examination and the coalition that won him the second reading vote might unravel. If parliament wrecked the legislation further down the track, he could always return to his demand for an election – with more force.He wants a swift election because his chief strategist, Dominic Cummings, calculates that this is the way to maximise the chance of victory by framing it as the “people versus parliament” contest that he has been preparing for from the moment he moved in to Number 10. Not all Tories think this a sensible strategy. Some believe, and this includes a fair number of the cabinet, that they’d have a more powerful pitch if they held off until next year and went to the country after Brexit had been “done”. In truth, it would not be “done” at all, but they would present it as such and hope to bank an electoral reward. Other Tories are anxious about the corrosive consequences for trust in our democratic institutions of waging a “people versus parliament” election. A winter election is unpopular with some Conservative MPs for other reasons. Their Scottish contingent, already an endangered species, don’t fancy the thought of canvassing on dark streets in hostile weather. Tories who will be defending Remain-leaning seats against Lib Dem challengers will be made more vulnerable in a campaign that polarises on RemainLeave lines. But the Cummings battle plan regards them as sacrificeable. The road to a Conservative majority that he envisages does not run through Scotland or even Surrey, but through taking seats off Labour in the north of England, the Midlands and Wales.In the old days, Mr Johnson would have got an election by simply dropping in on the Queen and asking for one. Thanks to the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, it is very hard for him to engineer a contest without the cooperation of the opposition. Labour is a mess of splits on the question. There are some hardcore Corbynites who seem genuinely keen on an election and sincerely convinced that the opinion polls are all wrong when they report that the party is dismally unpopular and its leader even more voter-repellent. His residual devotees cling to the faith that the miraculous gifts of Saint Jeremy will stun everyone by leading the party to triumph. When the shadow cabinet met on Tuesday, Laura Pidcock, the shadow minister for employment rights, launched into a little speech in which she declared: “Let’s sweep these establishment Tories from power with an insurgent Labour party!” Once Ms Pidcock had expended herself, Barbara Keeley, the shadow minister for mental health, drily responded: “I don’t see much insurgency in Salford.”At an informal meeting of some of the shadow cabinet on Thursday, two of the strongest voices against allowing an election were John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, and Nick Brown, the chief whip. Both have been bombarded by election-averse Labour MPs telling them that not only should there not be one, but that there will be a massive rebellion if the party leadership tries to whip Labour MPs to facilitate a pre-Christmas contest. “Do I fancy shivering on doorsteps in December trying to explain our Brexit policy?” says one Labour MP. “What do you think?” Another reports: “Various WhatsApp groups of Labour MPs are going wild with people telling colleagues that they won’t vote for an election.”The obvious explanation is that turkeys don’t vote for Christmas, especially when the turkeys can read opinion polls suggesting that they will be stuffed. Members of Labour’s parliamentary committee, senior MPs who act as sort of shop stewards for their colleagues, were alarmed when they had a meeting last week with Jennie Formby, the party’s general secretary. She was asked how many constituencies still hadn’t selected a candidate and which ones were on the key seat list. I’m told that the general secretary couldn’t answer either of these election-critical questions.Many of the senior officials responsible for Labour’s effort during the 2017 campaign have been purged from party headquarters or paid off. I hear that some are now being sounded out about coming back, such are the fears that Labour is not in a fit state to fight a campaign.Mr Corbyn’s instinctive reflexes have previously been to go for it. He’s repeatedly called for an election and he’s finding it an increasing struggle to muster plausible excuses for why Labour won’t agree to one now. A proud man and a stubborn one, he doesn’t like looking scared of a contest and his remaining fans are telling him that he is a brilliant campaigner who will turn things around as he did in 2017. But colleagues who have spoken to the Labour leader very recently have come away concluding that he is “genuinely procrastinating”.It is rarely an appealing look for a party to be frightened of an election and Labour could pay a penalty when it ultimately has to face the voters. To the majority of Labour MPs, that risk is outweighed by the perils of a pre-Christmas contest. Better, they think, to run scared than to get run over.• Andrew Rawnsley is Chief Political Commentator of the Observer"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1df57999047bc9dfdc74b5f92b49e61776963eca/0_344_6557_3934/master/6557.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ce2d2f2a2af3a02bd30d26cbfaa08716","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of blaze","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘blaze’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘blaze’.Share your photos of what blaze means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 30 October at 10am.

At the end of Marvel Studios’ 2018 hit Black Panther, there is a moment that unfailingly reduces audiences to a stunned silence. The film’s villain, Erik Killmonger (played by Michael B Jordan) is carried, dying, by its eponymous hero (Chadwick Boseman) to a high ridge to watch the sun set. Bitter and in pain, he refuses medical treatment and says: “Just bury me in the ocean with my ancestors who jumped from the ships, ’cause they knew death was better than bondage.”In a big Hollywood movie, a superhero movie no less, he delivers a stinging rebuke to those who would overlook the history of racial injustice. It may come from a villain, but the line echoes in our hero’s actions afterwards, as he opens his hi-tech African nation’s borders to help the oppressed. It’s a moment that I’ve been reminded of in recent weeks after the director of Goodfellas, Martin Scorsese, described Marvel’s popular superhero movies as “theme parks” and said that the films were not “the cinema of human beings trying to convey emotional, psychological experiences to another human being”. The director of The Godfather, Francis Ford Coppola, then described Marvel’s output as “despicable”, while British director Ken Loach dismissed the movies as a “marketing exercise”. This discussion – led by extraordinary film-making talents and grounded in serious concerns about the place for independence of thought in the modern studio system – is a valuable one. But the fact is that Marvel makes some of the most thoughtful and nuanced blockbusters in Hollywood right now.Superhero comic books were one of the original, innovative art forms of the 20th century, and in the last two decades Hollywood has seriously begun to capture the essence of what’s special about them. Marvel and its competitors can now capture the visual dazzle, the interwoven narratives and the impossible powers of the original books. But after decades of visual-effects blockbusters and franchise filmmaking, it’s hard to point to any one thing these films do that is wholly new or outrageous only the scale of Marvel’s success has made it a whipping boy.To date, Marvel has made 23 films over 11 years, a meta-franchise (the “Marvel Cinematic Universe” or MCU) that enfolds several sub-franchises (Iron Man, Captain America, Avengers and so on). An interconnected storytelling feat like this has never been attempted or accomplished on this level before, and initially the scale of that ambition made this as daringly experimental as any indie project. While the MCU movies are all described as superhero films, there are characters in them, such as Black Widow, with no special powers beyond intelligence or training, and films that more closely resemble space opera or thrillers in genre, so that each film does feel distinct and fresh. Nor are they uniformly gung-ho or mindless. Captain America: Civil War offers a neat parallel to the start of the last Iraq war in its discussion of unilateral versus collective action, and depicts a devastating internecine conflict between the series’ heroes in which no one is entirely wrong or right. Thor: Ragnarok has anti-colonialist undercurrents, but also a gladiatorial battle between a Norse space god and a giant green rage monster. This year, the last act of Captain Marvel made a feminist statement as compelling as that in Cannes breakout Portrait of a Lady on Fire, even if the rest of the film traded lyricism for action.Their interlinked nature has allowed several Marvel films to reach downbeat endings that other studio bosses would reject outright. The aforementioned Civil War finishes with almost every character beaten and miserable Avengers: Infinity War sees half the population of the universe dissolve into thin air. The films invite not only geeky dissection of comic-book references but also serious discussions about morality, relationships and why, for example, a brainwashed assassin is not technically guilty of murder. Some claim that Marvel’s vision of (mostly) good and evil is inherently reductive, but that seems wrong. Why is the thrill of watching gangsters transgress social norms more valuable than the thrill of watching a decent guy super-punch Nazis? A lack of morality is not, in itself, a virtue. Our current political mess is fuelled by leaders who encourage us to believe that there is no such thing as good or evil, that no one is sincere. In the howling void of cynicism they create, they can tell people whatever lies they want and have them treated as weightily as the truth.Marvel films acknowledge, surprisingly often, that goodness is not easy and that the right thing is not always obvious, but it is still worth striving for. Why would we reject that message? With Scorsese-like gangsters running global superpowers and Loachian misery a fact of everyday life for ballooning numbers of people, escapism with substance is nothing to sniff at.

Latin American correspondent Tom Philips took a 2,000km journey through the Amazon to see the new age of wrecking ushered in by Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, where the environmental agency is being dismantled and gold seekers and soy farmers anticipate an economic boom from deforestation.There are also those attempting to make it better. On 1 September 2018 we published an interview from Stockholm with a 15-year-old who just two weeks earlier, after Sweden’s hottest ever summer, had gone on strike from school in protest at the lack of action by politicians on the climate crisis. Now much better known, thanks in part to articles like this, Greta Thunberg’s solo protest has since become a global movement.Climate can also lie at the root of other stories. Failed harvests and rising food prices can often be the final straw that triggers political upheaval, in recent years notably the Arab spring, but we are now seeing in real time how the climate emergency is affecting migration patterns. As Donald Trump attempted to close the US border to Central American migrants, in some cases separating children from their parents, we spoke to those in Guatemala who after a decade of intense droughts and late rains have seen crops fail and wages fall one too many times. “I have to find a way to travel north, or else my children will suffer even more,” subsistence farmer Esteban Gutiérrez told reporter Nina Lakhani.Business and economics are right at the centre of the climate emergency. Companies are among the biggest polluters in the world – and are key to meeting the Paris agreement’s target of limiting global warming to 1.5C.From giant fossil fuel companies to agricultural and food businesses, retailers, airlines and car manufacturers – all must make big changes, for the sake of the planet, the global economy and their own future sustainability, providing goods and services and employment.These are huge questions, and  readers know there are no easy answers. So we will nurture the debate on what a sustainable economy looks like.Our economics writers are questioning whether traditional capitalism, which aims for perpetual growth, can ever deal with the huge challenges of climate emergency, or whether a new slow-capitalism or green growth – which does not pursue profit at all costs – must come.We are reporting on the changes being made by corporate executives – and alerting readers to those who fall short.Writing in the  earlier this year, the governors of the Bank of England and Bank of France – Mark Carney and François Villeroy de Galhau – underlined the importance of change. “If some companies and industries fail to adjust to this new world, they will fail to exist,” they said.Without action, the climate emergency poses the risk of huge losses for insurance companies as a result of catastrophic weather-related events. Last year’s Californian wildfires, for instance – the worst in the state’s history – cost insurers more than $12bn. Banks that have lent vast sums to fossil fuel companies could be left with mammoth losses if those investments decline in value and become “stranded assets”. The Bank of England has warned that as much as $20tn of assets could be wiped out by climate change if the problem is not addressed.Many companies are making changes. Global businesses including Nestle and L’Oreal have committed to reducing their carbon emissions to zero. We will track and report on their progress.We are reporting on climate crisis initiatives, and our journalists will ask if they go far enough. Last week we reported that British Airways is to offset all emissions from domestic flights from next year, and questioned whether offsetting can ever be the answer.Our reporters will expose companies that are not walking the talk. Last month Amazon announced a series of initiatives, from putting 100,000 electric vans on the road to handle its deliveries to reforestation projects. But, as our reporters also revealed recently, Amazon has also recently introduced plastic packaging that cannot be recycled in the UK.Most corporate bosses know they have to make changes. But progress is nowhere near fast enough. Oil companies are still seeking new oilfields. Giant new coalmines – like Indian billionaire Gautam Adani’s Carmichael coalmine in Queensland – are still being developed. Airbus recently predicted that the number of aircraft in the sky would double in the next 20 years.Investment groups that manage pension funds around the world can exert pressure on companies to clean up their businesses. Legal \u0026amp General, Europe’s second biggest fund manager, admitted earlier this year: “The effects of climate change will soon be irreversible. This will affect economies, politics and, as a result, our clients’ assets all around the world. We all need to move faster.”However, not every investment group is using its muscle – and we are calling them out. BlackRock, the world’s biggest investment manager, with $6tn under its management, says climate change is a big risk to the value of its investments. But it remains at the heart of fossil fuel investing and, as we reported, its chief executive, Larry Fink, still insists that BlackRock’s job is to make a profit for investors. He added: “Our personal views on environmental or social issues don’t matter.”They do matter, and our reporters are now treating the climate crisis as the default setting for how they approach business reporting.Fashion is about the zeitgeist, and climate change is the mostimportant issue of our age. And we know that our readers really *do* care. (Sorry, Melania.) So more than ever before, we want to put sustainability front and centre of our fashion coverage.We aren’t perfect and we don’t pretend to have all the answers. Wewill continue to listen to a wide range of voices – our readersparamount amongst those – to guide us. But we do know that we want to talk about sustainability how we have always talked about fashion – in a way that includes everyone in the conversation, whatever their age, budget, gender or background.We have always championed ethical fashion brands, but now we want to go further. The future of our planet isn’t a niche interest. We aim to continue creating fashion content that is accessible and appealing, desirable and democratic – but now with sustainability as a fundamental metric. We want to inspire our audience to enjoy fashion while being mindful of the impact on the planet.What does that look like? We try wherever we can to include vintagepieces in shoots and gift guides. When we report from London fashion week we talk to the Extinction Rebellion activists outside the shows, as well as having backstage chats with the designers. We championed Secondhand September and a year ago we updated my column in Weekend magazine so that you now see me wearing old clothes from my own wardrobe, and vintage pieces, alongside new clothes. This party season we will be reporting the best places to rent your dress, or source it pre-worn, rather than buy it.None of this means compromising on bringing you compelling, gorgeous, original fashion content. We are passionate about the latest fashion – and about the future of our planet, too.There’s an obvious connection between food and the climate emergency. Look at the deforestation of the Amazon to provide grazing for cattle and soy to feed it. But wherever cows are raised, they generate atmosphere-heating methane. As the global human population grows, it’s clear that we need to think about how to feed it, how to use land and what impact our choices have.Meat eating and animal farming have seized the headlines and the public’s focus. There are many reasons why veganism – or at least flexitarianism – is growing fast and sustainability is one of them.It’s important to talk about all this but what people eat is always going to be a highly personal decision. In many countries where we have the luxury of food options, we are in anxious, uncertain, ided times. Food is joyful. It brings people together – families, friends, communities and strangers – and reminds us both of our uniqueness and of what we have in common. It’s also a time when it’s difficult to know who to believe and to trust. I hope people can be sure of the ."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/afe269d9ec06740a551d25fa8d8e07c902892cd2/0_260_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=08d6b0d86d0b03a66ff9f5ee4bdec8e2","title":"guardian climate pledge 2019 images pictures guidelines","story":" picture editor Fiona Shields explains why we are going to be using fewer polar bears and more people to illustrate our coverage of the climate emergency At the  we want to ensure that the images we publish accurately and appropriately convey the climate crisis that we face. Following discussions among editors about how we could change the language we use in our coverage of environmental issues, our attention then turned to images. We have been working across the organisation to better understand how we aim to visually communicate the impact the climate emergency is having across the world.Our goal is to provide guidelines for anyone working with images at the . We are also asking the agencies and photographers we work with to provide images that are appropriate to the changing narrative.The concern over how best to depict the climate emergency led us to seek advice from the research organisation Climate Visuals, who have found that “images that define climate change shape the way it is understood and acted upon”.It was important to address our own use of images and understand the processes that lead to image selection for our environmental and weather stories. When given a story, a picture editor or subeditor may have a short time to choose an image from our database, which is why the availability and prominence of climate crisis photography is a key element in the process. It can also be difficult for photographers to capture images that reflect global heating, weather patterns and wildlife extinction, especially when trying to depict what cannot always be seen.We know, from years of experience, that people love polar bears and pandas, so it is easy to see how these appealing creatures have become the emblems for the topics of endangered species and what we previously termed as global warming. Often, when signalling environmental stories to our readers, selecting an image of a polar bear on melting ice has been the obvious – though not necessarily appropriate – choice. These images tell a certain story about the climate crisis but can seem remote and abstract – a problem that is not a human one, nor one that is particularly urgent.So it made sense when we heard that research conducted by the team at Climate Visuals has shown that people respond to human pictures and stories. Images that show emotion and pictures of real situations make the story relevant to the inidual. Rather than choosing, say, an image of a smoke stack pumping out pollution or a forest on fire, such as this: … we should consider showing the direct impact of environmental issues on people’s daily lives as well as trying to indicate the scale of the impact, such as these:In the UK, the weather is a national preoccupation and as such a subject of tradition for British newspapers. People enjoying a sunny holiday weekend, or a fresh fall of snow at home or abroad can deliver some delightful and beautiful images:But as we have reported, the science tells us a much more sinister story of regular heatwaves and unseasonal weather being a defining indicator of the climate crisis. So, although scenes of children playing in fountains and everyone racing to the beach can be uplifting and irresistible, we have to be mindful of the tone of our journalism. This summer, the British media published dramatic headlines issuing climate warnings and covered in detail the negative impact of the crisis, but the images were typically of people taking pleasure in the environment. The contradiction in messaging, between the headlines and imagery, can undermine the effect of the reporting and how we perceive the risks.In June this year we published a picture gallery on the heatwave across Europe. In its original form, this was of a lighter tone, but we felt on reflection this was wrong and disregarded the current context, so we amended the publication to include images that covered a range of human experience of the extraordinary temperatures.The photographer Brook Mitchell made an impactful series about the drought in Australia affecting families in New South Wales, which we published as a photo essay in July. The environmental scenes of the scorched landscape were striking, as were the suffering animals, but the portraits and stories of the people battling the catastrophe really anchored the piece and drove the level of engagement.It is an example of how, as picture editors and photographers, we are having to think again about finding the right focus. Many of the impacts to communities, bioersity, agriculture, water and food supply represent the escalating crisis our planet faces, yet visually they can be far more challenging to depict. We need new imagery for new narratives. This can be challenging in a fast-paced newsroom but it is important to be nuanced and creative with search terms to unearth photography beyond the usual keywords of climate change, heatwave and floods.As our stories make a journey from their initial point of publication through the various networks of social media we also have to be mindful of how the image is connected to the headline. We have to consider that the two must work together to allow the reader to make a broad sense of the article often simply at a glance. Relatable images that are not overly abstract have become a good choice.However, in its simplest form, getting the emotional tone of imagery in line with the issue is critical, rather than the visual overload of society universally having fun in the sun. We hope that if we keep having these conversations, we will be able to have even more of an impact with our climate coverage, and others will follow suit.If you are a journalist, a photographer or work with other news organisations depicting the climate crisis, please contact membershipeditorial@ to join our conversation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6aa18d2a32dce609d4eb036565424fe22b3b0a8f/0_78_4256_2553/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=75e821f5ce30ae6fcdc4646cb012cff8","title":"guardian climate pledge 2019 air travel advice","story":" travel editor Andy Pietrasik explains how a flexitarian approach can enable us to enjoy exploring the planet without increasing our carbon footprintWe recently published a guide to Helsinki in which we gave details of how to get there and back without flying. In the comments below the article, a reader wrote: “I think you have to concede that it’s a little disingenuous to pretend that people will be going to Helsinki by train and boat … very few will be willing to allocate six days of the holiday just for the journey. It’s simply not a practical suggestion.”The rise of low-cost flights over the past 20 or so years means we have become so accustomed to flying everywhere for our holidays and short breaks that the idea of taking so long over a journey has become unthinkable. We expect to maximise our time in a location and minimise our time in transit. But maybe that has to change.Another reader put this into context: “In the 70s it was customary to travel around Europe by train (or bus, or hitchhiking). I’ve travelled between Finland and the UK many times by train, and it is quite a pleasant experience.”Travel can have a magical transformation on iniduals and communities. We hope through our pages to encourage people to explore the world, to discover, first-hand, locations they may only have read about in history books or novels to open themselves up to new experiences and tastes to meet people with different ideas and perspectives to try out alternative lifestyles to immerse themselves in beautiful landscapes to have fun. Our writers tap into the joy of new experiences, whether it’s the exhilaration of swimming through a city, as our writer did in Basel, or the thrill of tackling Ireland’s Big Five adventures. And we know that our readers are adventurous and well-travelled because every week we feature their tips from around the world. But we also recognise the need to help tackle the climate emergency by reducing the number of flights we all take. Environment journalist John Vidal explored the dilemma that “people like me, cursed with loving travel” now face, when he reported on the Swedish concept of “flygskam”, or fly shame. And he referred to people applying the idea of the “flexitarian” diet – where they cut back on their meat consumption dramatically but not completely – to flying.The majority of locations we feature in the ’s weekly travel section do not rely on flying to get there, with most easily accessible by train and public transport. These range from Greek island-hopping odysseys to cycling holidays through Europe and city breaks served by train or ferries.Our Local’s Guide series is one of the most popular and widely read features because each one is written by a local resident in the spirit of showing a visitor around their favourite affordable haunts, rather than the big-ticket attractions. Food and drink is probably the easiest way into another culture, and there can be no better recommendation for somewhere to eat and drink than from someone who lives there. We’ve been tapping in to local people’s tips since Twitter started more than 10 years ago, and have found bloggers all around Europe to compile lists of their favourite cheap places to eat and drink.On our website, we have a long list of guides to alternative cities – Łódź, Genoa and Utrecht, Berne, Burgos and Bristol, for example – rather than perennial hotspots affected by overtourism, such as Barcelona, Amsterdam and Venice.One of the benefits of flying less, of course, is the opportunity it affords to explore the rich and varied landscapes of our own islands. Over the summer, we ran a popular series of stories called car-free coast, in which the writer Phoebe Taplin explored the British seaside on foot and by bus. An avowed public transport enthusiast and non-flyer, Dixe Wills, shared 20 of his favourite campsites accessible by train and bus. And Kevin Rushby set out on a UK expedition to less-visited locations that would have been impossible or prohibitively expensive to get to by car.We still occasionally run stories on long-haul destinations when there is an important initiative or project that benefits the environment or local community, such as the development of community-led tourism startups in Chilean Patagonia following the launch of new national parks in the world’s most ambitious rewilding project.Tourism accounts for one in 10 of the world’s jobs and is vital to some destinations. Kevin Rushby, our principal travel writer, explains: “All around the world, people in disadvantaged communities have been working to set up projects that rely on tourism, and so flying. I’ve met hunters who’ve become wildlife guides, fishermen who are now ing instructors, farmers who get cash for showing visitors their land and life. In Kenya the great migration route has been saved by Maasai herders clubbing their land together as conservancies rather than selling to hoteliers and intensive farming interests. Those conservancies are reliant on overseas visitors who pay to see wildlife.”The Travel website now also features a carbon calculator, and we have written about various carbon offsetting schemes – which allow people to balance out their carbon footprints by investing in clean energy projects such as solar or windfarms. Our travel section is printed and distributed in the UK but our articles online are read by a worldwide audience, so in some instances readers do not need to fly to the places we are writing about.John Vidal’s article about reducing the number of flights we take quotes Kevin Anderson, professor of energy and climate change at the Tyndall centre in Manchester: “I don’t have a no-fly policy, but rather a fly-less one … If we are going to fly, it should be for truly extraordinary and important reasons. Otherwise we shouldn’t go, or we should take a slower form of travel and arrange for a longer visit.”Returning to that article on Helsinki, there’s another Scandinavian lifestyle trend that has emerged as a positive counterbalance to “flygskam”, and that is “tagskryt” (train brag). Another reader of the article captured its spirit perfectly in the comment: “The journey is the holiday. Just think of all the places you see along the way.”Because, of course, we’ve been doing long-distance slow travel since the 1970s, as was pointed out. That was the decade when the Interrail scheme was launched. And, as Wills said when he revisited the Interrail experience this summer after a 30-year gap: “How many of us have cherished memories of zipping inexpensively across Europe – delving into new and thrillingly esoteric cultures, befriending the locals, mangling their language beyond all comprehension, and enjoying all manner of mind-broadening episodes.”That is the spirit of adventure we hope you take away with you after reading the travel section."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3858d96ea129929c09d1781ed401f522605d3b80/218_2651_3014_1809/master/3014.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=32a34a700de9e45906839302b85b17e9","title":"have you spotted any new buds or flowers in october","story":"If you have seen any plants flowering unusually this month, we would like to see your photosAccording to former  environment correspondent Paul Brown, “new research published in Geophysical Research letters show that so-called “cold” days in European winters are on average 3C warmer than 70 years ago”.Some people have reported seeing new flower buds in the unseasonal temperatures, leading to worries the flowers will be killed by the winter weather and may not bloom again in spring.If you have seen any plants with new buds or flowers appearing we would like to hear from you.When did you first see them and do you have any concerns about what it might mean for them come spring?

But can LED therapy really be a miracle cure for everything from acne to tired skin?  Rachel Cooke sees the lightIf I said I knew of a sure-fire way to lastingly improve your skin and that all you would have to do to experience this seeming miracle would be to sit for 13 minutes every week beneath a gently pulsing light with your eyes closed, what would be your response? Would you whip out your credit card and rush to book yourself an appointment? Or would you silently mark me down as yet another decadent, middle-aged, straw-clutching desperado who feels bad about her complexion?To be clear, I don’t feel bad about my neck – not yet. But perhaps I am a middle-aged desperado all the same, for how else to explain my appearance at the Light Salon, a clinic that offers the very treatment I’ve just described? The child of scientists, I’m a natural sceptic when it comes to the claims of the multi-billion-pound beauty industry. I still wash my face, just as I’ve always done, with soap and water. I would no more spend a lot of money on moisturiser, Botox or anything else in that vein than I would run down the street in my underwear. Even if I didn’t have strongly feminist feelings about facelifts, I would still find them alarming both in theory and in practice. Yet here I am, hoping that I will shortly look a little rosier: a better version of myself, if not precisely a younger looking one.It is all so easy, that’s the thing. This branch of the Light Salon is in Harvey Nichols in Knightsbridge. You can walk in off the street and because the procedure is non-invasive and has no side effects – no redness, no irritation – when you stroll out again you need not worry about terrifying everyone you encounter. I could turn up for a meeting and no one would be any the wiser. From start to finish, moreover, the whole thing takes only 20 minutes (the extra time is devoted to cleansing your skin before the treatment begins and moisturising it afterwards) I’ve waited in the queue at Caffè Nero for longer. Best of all, it is appealingly de-stressing: an enforced break in a busy day. Tiny goggles in place to protect your eyes, you’ve no choice but to close them and give in to the unseasonal warmth that will soon spread gently across your face. It’s like lying on the beach, save for the fact that you are fully dressed and, somewhere far in the background, you can hear the distant howl of a police siren.What is the kit like? The Light Salon has various machines available, but in my case the aesthetician, Amy Fiddler, will set me up beneath the Healite, a unit developed by Dr Glen Calderhead, the man who is generally considered to be one of the godfathers of low-level light therapy (LLLT). The Healite uses light-emitting diode (LED) technology, delivered at a wavelength of 830nm, to promote cellular function. LEDs may be blue, red, or yellow. Blue lights are used to treat acne, killing the bacteria that are its cause and regulating excess oil. Red lights stimulate collagen and elastin, the two holy grails of anti-ageing. Yellow lights help with wound healing and rejuvenation, and temporarily increase blood circulation. This machine uses a combination of red and yellow lights, arranged on a unit some 15 to 20cm away from my face, and though the results are incremental – a full course of 13 treatments (yours for £350) is recommended to achieve lasting effects – I’m told that I am likely, nevertheless, to see an improvement in my skin in the next 24 hours. And so, I sit back and relax…On the line from Seoul, South Korea, Calderhead is telling me the story of the development of LED therapy and of how he first came to be involved with it. According to Calderhead, who trained in the UK as a pathologist and who maintains a healthy Scottish accent, phototherapy has two true godfathers. The first of these is Endre Mester, a Hungarian medic who, in the late 1960s, began experimenting with the effects of lasers on skin cancer. “He published a paper in which he revealed that he had successfully cured the leg ulcers of patients using a red light laser,” says Calderhead. The second is Professor Harry Whelan, a neurologist who, in the late 1980s, was working at Nasa’s medicine laboratory. Having developed a blue light to be used to activate chlorophyll on the space station’s hydroponic plant farms, he began to examine possible medical uses for the diodes. He then developed a red LED that operated at 633nm, and subsequently published a paper looking at its effect on pain attenuation and wound healing. Could Calderhead be described as a third godfather? “I’m not sure about that,” he says, laughing.In 2002, Calderhead met the CEO of a company called Phototherapeutics, the manufacturer of an LED system named Omnilux. Soon afterwards, he became its clinical director. At this point, Omnilux was working on two heads: red and blue. Patients treated with red light for non-melanoma skin cancers on their faces reported that afterwards their skin was in much better condition generally. The blue had proved effective in treating acne, but only for a limited period. “My first job was to work out why eruptions happened again, and why the light also turned the skin darker,” he says. This led him to use both lights together (previously they had been used separately). He also changed the frequency of the wavelength from 415nm to 830nm. This new, combined head was effective for both healing and rejuvenation: 830nm was, he says, “the magic number”.Calderhead now works at Lutronic, the Seoul-based manufacturer of the Healite. So how does LED therapy work? “LLLT is an exchange of photon energy. Each photon is a packet of pure energy without mass. The energy passes into the energy pool of the cell. If it has a job to do, it will do it better. The part of the dermis that makes collagen, for instance, will make better collagen faster. It produces a viable clinical effect with no damage.” Its uses are not limited to skincare. “In Australia, where clinics are taking it up, it has been found to be fantastic for burns.” Does Calderhead use it himself? “Yes. For pain relief. I have sciatic neuralgia in my left hip – an old rugby injury. I put myself under the Healite twice a week. If I miss this, I’m in agony.”Calderhead believes the future for LED therapy is, well, extremely bright – though hospitals in the west remain reluctant to invest in it. “They have shied away because it is so associated with aesthetics,” he says. “But we can chip away at this reluctance, by making it easier to understand.” He believes LED therapy could, in the future, be deployed far more widely. “Anything that involves wound healing and pain attenuation. It will work on the muscular-skeletal system. It will work on nerve injury. Recently, it has been used in cerebral trauma, such as stroke. This is why I call one of my presentations ‘Join the Healing Revolution’.” What about side effects? Are there any? “No, no. People always ask. For 830, there are really none. For 633, you have to be careful what else is on the skin – for instance, perfume – because you can get a photosensitive reaction.”In the beauty world, the popularity of LED therapy is growing exponentially. In part, this is due simply to its increasing availability. According to Louise Taylor, one of the founders of Dermalux, a Warrington-based manufacturer of LED systems, some 1,000 clinics in the UK now use her company’s devices. “There is a feeling in the market that LED is something you can have on an ongoing basis,” she says. “Unless you have issues of photosensitivity, there are no real limits as to how much of it you can have, and that’s one reason why it is expanding in clinics.” But it is also the result of word of mouth, particularly on social media.When home-use LED light masks came on to the market they became an Instagram trend, Lena Dunham among those who posed wearing one (hers was by Neutrogena, and cost only £27.50 however, last July this product was withdrawn from sale in the US following “reports of visual effects” by users). More recently, Victoria Beckham and Alexa Chung have posted pictures of themselves wearing home-use masks (the effect is spooky: sort of Hannibal Lecter meets the Cybermen, with added colour).Some see it, too, as a cultural shift: not a backlash against Botox exactly, but something close to it. “I think there is that movement, yes,” says Dr Dennis Gross, the American dermatologist and skin-care guru whose home LED mask retails for £430. “I think people want prevention right now, and that is one positive benefit of LED. Botox doesn’t stimulate collagen. LED gets to the heart of that matter: you will have more collagen, and it stays there – it’s yours. It’s one of the most efficacious treatments in dermatology.” His patients love the fact that it requires no down time – no recovery period – and that if they own a mask, they can, as is not the case with Botox, have treatments at home. (Do the masks work? Calderhead says they will never be as good as a clinical-style system the lights are too close to the skin to be fully efficient.)Hannah Measures, one of the co-founders of the Light Salon – which will shortly launch a new LED “bib” to enable clients to treat their décolletage – agrees that clients are increasingly interested in a more gentle, more holistic approach to their skin. “There is a growing body of people who think: we can’t stop ourselves getting older and we don’t really mind wrinkles, but still, we want to be the best possible version of ourselves.” LED therapy, she says, connects to “wellbeing” as much as it does to anti-ageing. “Our new bib can be placed on the shoulder and, in trials, some patients have said it helps with pain relief,” she says. Hence her determination to keep prices at her business fairly affordable: “It’s so important to us that this is democratic.”By now, you may be wondering how I got on in this brave new nurturing world (though a single treatment is hardly a fair test). Well, the experience is rather lovely. I hate the winter and the warmth on my face is delicious. I like having to sit still, too: an enforced period of calm. Afterwards, I do glow a little (though we might attribute this to several things). But alas, I will also develop a somewhat teenage-looking spot the next morning. Am I tempted to sign up for a full course? Yes, but only after my conversation with Calderhead, LED’s great evangelist. As he puts it: “We have proved that collagen and elastin are both improved by LLLT. But education is important. This won’t happen overnight.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc006af9284db8b602536c9bc17ec76106d9007f/0_172_4894_2937/master/4894.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9de71c73e20563dbef08dca891d7d984","title":"terminator dark fate review arnie is back as backup simran hans","story":"With flying debris and strong female leads, the franchise’s opportunistic sixth film gets the job doneThe year is 2022 and in Mexico City, a terminator just dropped out of the sky.

Lucky for Dani, she is soon flanked by two avenging angels Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), still around and hunting terminators, and an augmented human soldier named Grace (Mackenzie Davis, of Black Mirror’s San Junipero episode) who has time-travelled to serve as her protector.

As a genre exercise, it mostly works set pieces are tense, explosive and pleasingly gory, littered with flying scraps of metal and meat. Davis in particular is an authoritative presence.

He was 36 and had a fine career behind him. He could have retired. He could have opted for a sinecure in the Middle East or China. He could have gone into coaching or television punditry. But instead, having spent his entire senior career at Roma, he signed for Boca Juniors.Things haven’t gone according to plan, however. A persistent hamstring injury has restricted him to 334 minutes of football since arriving in July. De Rossi was on the bench for Tuesday’s Copa Libertadores semi-final against River Plate but he did not come on as Boca won 1-0 and went out 2-1 on aggregate. His presence seemed less about him potentially playing than about trying to use his experience to calm others and perhaps even letting him feel a superclásico close up.What is clear is that this is not some ego trip for De Rossi and nor has he come for the money. When he arrived in Buenos Aires after a 13-hour flight, he headed immediately to Boca’s base and trained with the rest of the squad that afternoon. The next day, he turned up at 6am, before anybody else, and put in an order for 100 Boca shirts so he could distribute them among his friends and family.His reasons for feeling such affection for Boca are not entirely clear. It is a club with historical links to Italy – one of their nicknames is Los Xeneizes, the Genovese – but De Rossi’s desire to play for them seems linked more to his respect for Boca’s great icon of the past 30 years, Juan Román Riquelme. He is part of a WhatsApp group with friends whose sole topic of discussion is midfielders the group’s avatar is Riquelme.The danger when such an obvious high-class player arrives is that he might dominate the dressing room or disdain his teammates, but others at the club have been struck by De Rossi’s humility and his commitment in training. His Spanish is decent other than when the talk switches to tactics, when he has to rely on the translation skills of Carlos Tevez, Mauro Zárate and Lisandro López.Perhaps it is down to his lack of pitch time but the most striking aspect of De Rossi’s spell in Argentina is how few ripples he has made. He has done one television interview, and that from the side of the training pitch rather than anything longer and more formal in a studio, and he seems rarely to leave his hotel in the redeveloped waterfront area of Puerto Madero, where he lives alone after his wife and children decided to remain in Rome. The only comment anybody can remember him making about Buenos Aires is to ask why there are so many street protests.De Rossi is highly unusual. He is one of four Europeans playing in the Argentina top-flight, but the other three – José Mauri (Italy), Norberto Briasco (Armenia) and Dylan Gissi (Switzerland) – have Argentinian parents, with the first two being born in Argentina. The first European with no such heritage to sign for an Argentinian club since the Hungarian Ferenc Sas joined Boca in 1938, De Rossi has 117 caps. He was a mainstay of Italy for years.The only player of comparable status to move to Argentina, who was not playing a sentimental final season or two for a former club, is the former France forward David Trezeguet, who played for River Plate and Newell’s Old Boys between 2012 and 2014, but his parents are Argentinian and he grew up in Buenos Aires.That is the grim truth of globalisation, the traffic is almost all one way. In Argentina, they talk of the talent doughnut: anybody of any promise leaves when they are in their teens. Some return in their 30s but anybody who is in their 20s and is playing in the Argentinian league either is not very good or has some particular reason why they cannot travel.Around 1,800 Argentinians are playing abroad. And that, necessarily, has an impact on the quality.Tuesday’s superclásico, for its colour and passion, was a poor game, all free-kicks and corners. Of the impudent creativity of the No 10s, on which the myth of Argentinian football is based, the only trace was the mercurial Colombian Juan Fernando Quintero, who was on the bench for River, but in the circumstances never likely to come on.Despite the poverty of the play – and the dilapidated state of most of the grounds and the continuing threat of violence – Argentina still has the 11th-highest average attendance of any league in the world. Love of the clubs, and perhaps love of the sense of togetherness and common identity that can still be found on the terraces, overrides all else.Or at least that is the romantic explanation. But really, is that saying anything different to the marketing wonk who would about strong brand identification? To western European football, where the money is, where the best football is, Argentina is a market and, in as much as it exists beyond that, it is as a place of theatre, but theatre where the act is in the stand rather than the stage.All those decades of history, the corruption and the crime, the 332 deaths detailed by Salvemos al Fútbol – the Let’s Save Football campaign – memories of a league that at one time was arguably the best in the world, reduced to this. What will survive of us is love? A tourist attraction for wealthier parts of the world? And, yes, I am aware my own presence on Tuesday, the way a video of fans I posted on social media drew thousands of approving views, is part of that dynamic.So, too, for all his good intentions, for all that he is taking it seriously, for all it is refreshing to see a player chasing experience rather than money, is De Rossi. For what is he, really, but a tourist enjoying an end‑of-career gap year?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd18bcb32fc234ffbf47bb4751d1f1302fd8e6da/0_27_2712_1627/master/2712.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5ec2487192c7f6cd721975a0c364e01e","title":"harry kane spurs out to settle old score with liverpool virgil van dijk","story":"Spurs striker ready for Anfield rematch four months after Liverpool centre-back dominated in Champions League finalWhen they meet again on Sunday afternoon Kane should be at full tilt even if Spurs look some distance short of the side that bounced to Madrid. It was not Kane’s fault he could not deliver when their greatest achievement was in sight but the team’s form offers a convincing argument that Mauricio Pochettino needs him just as badly now. In recent times it has not been easy, when the Spurs manager scans the faces in his dressing room, to work out exactly who he can hang his hat on. But there has never been any doubt about Kane’s fierce commitment to the cause, even when there are those who will happily test the quality of the pegging.Roy Keane was the latest to do that last week, saying Manchester United should “just go and get” Kane. It would not be that simple but the comment reached Pochettino, who sidestepped the suggestion by agreeing with an abstract idea that his centre‑forward “deserves everything”. Few would argue with that. Kane’s determination to haul himself into service and perform when, on occasion, he would have been excused an easier time of things is a burning testament to his character. With that dispiriting night in Madrid a notable exception, he has usually come good when the stakes are at their highest for Tottenham.That includes the time 20 months ago at Anfield when Kane dusted himself down from a penalty miss to hold his nerve for a second spot‑kick and silence the Kop in the fifth minute of stoppage time, scoring his 100th Premier League goal just after Mohamed Salah appeared to have settled the issue for Liverpool. Spurs have not emerged from Liverpool’s home with a win since May 2011, when Kane was still a loanee at Leyton Orient. He has scored there three times, though, and, on the back of a morale-boosting performance in Tuesday’s cakewalk against Red Star Belgrade, his appetite to give Van Dijk a sterner examination is evident.“Van Dijk is a great defender but he is not invincible and Liverpool are not invincible,” Kane said. On the former point he might have been harking back to an occasion in 2015 when he had the then Southampton player on toast at St Mary’s, opening the scoring after Van Dijk had let him in by swinging and missing wildly. Those mistakes might as well be hen’s teeth nowadays but they are also the little morsels of knowledge – like knowing an opponent is clearly unfit – that players cling on to in those moments before knife‑edge confrontations.Kane is predictably keen to minimise scrutiny of the head‑to‑head. “From my point of view it’s just about playing my game and making my movements, doing my runs and trying to get on the scoresheet, trying to get assists,” he said. In midweek he scored twice and for long periods dropped deep to act as a de facto playmaker. It was probably his best performance of the campaign, albeit against a poor side that offered none of the resistance Liverpool will present, and although there have been Tottenham players in far worse form it felt like a timely return to something approaching his maximum efficiency.Kane’s figures have largely been down so far this season and, with Spurs grinding rather than flowing for the most part, that is little surprise. Opta statistics present an expected goals per game tally of 0.36 in the Premier League so far, by a considerable distance his lowest under Pochettino the fact that his goal return of 0.56 per game (five in nine), although again on course to be his worst in a single season since 2013-14, comfortably exceeds that suggests the basics are still in good working order. But the numbers also show Kane is creating fewer chances, touching the ball less, engaging in fewer duels and winning a smaller percentage of them than at any point in the Argentinian’s tenure. It is not to say that his performances have been poor rather, that the side’s wider malaise is doing few favours to the man everyone expects to keep on producing.On Friday, Pochettino rejected the notion that three points at Anfield would constitute a reset for his squad a feat that might clear a few heads and persuade a few, inside and outside the club, that Spurs can still mix it with the very best. The idea was strange, he said, given they had already drawn at Manchester City and Arsenal. At the Emirates they frittered away a two‑goal lead, though, and since then the scars from Leicester, Brighton, Bayern Munich, Watford and even Colchester have mounted up.It all carries a faint resemblance to the autumn of 2016, when Spurs did not win in seven games before Kane – who was, familiarly, only just coming back from an ankle injury – turned a defeat into victory against West Ham with two goals at the very end. Pushing on to finish second in the league, as they did then, would be a remarkable feat in the current climate. “Momentum‑wise, it would give us a huge lift,” Kane said of any win against the undefeated league leaders. Through all this year’s doubt and confusion, he remains the player best placed to deliver it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13cbdc16e0d33813e623459d3d9379a3c46550f0/0_351_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ab64571a5ed3774c87a80958b58d2e9","title":"gods gift how to look like actor chris hemsworth fitness app workout","story":"More than 1 million people have already downloaded Chris Hemsworth’s fitness app. Why? Is it because they too want to look like a Norse demi-god?The actor Chris Hemsworth – Hollywood leading man, make-believe Thor – employs a small army of fitness professionals to maintain peak condition. There is the personal trainer he has known since he was eight, and the nutritionist and the Pilates coach and the yoga coach and the meditation guru. Even Hemsworth’s stunt double is part of the gang. Collectively the army is known as “The Chris Hemsworth Wellbeing Team”. Now they can be your wellbeing team too.Earlier this year Hemsworth launched Centr, a fitness app that offers “everything you need” to “train, eat and live better,” according to the app’s website. Its content, aimed at both men and women, has been developed by trainers either previously employed by Hemsworth or newly tapped up by the actor to contribute workouts, meditation routines and healthy-eating recipes. Like the patron saints of wellness before him – Paltrow, Motivator – Hemsworth is keen to spread the gospel of wellbeing: eat well, exercise, de-stress. He has spent the past few years being professionally required to learn how to make his body appear superhuman, and he thinks, admirably, “Why shouldn’t you learn too?” “I feel so fortunate to have worked with incredible experts in the fields of health, nutrition, mindfulness and training,” he says. “So I thought, ‘Why not share that?’”The upshot of the sharing is this: for £15.49 per month, you can eat like Chris Hemsworth, work out like Chris Hemsworth and meditate like Chris Hemsworth. The app is a digital Rolodex of the actor’s trainers and their tailored workouts and regimes. There is a recipe for sesame chicken stir-fry with broccolini (very filling) and another for a breakfast called Choc Magic Cherry Smoothie (sweet, also filling). There are workouts titled Hirt Strength: Push, Pulse and Power Up and Muscle Building: Pound It Out and a mindfulness exercise called Meditation: Forgive \u0026amp Release. Centr’s strapline is “For those in the making.”So far, the app has been downloaded more than 1m times, making it one of the most popular apps this year. (People thought three Hemsworth Bros were enough now there are thousands.) Centr users have watched more than 4.5m minutes of coached workouts which, the brand says, adds up to “3,200 days’ worth of squats, deadlifts and lunges”.Centr’s trainers argue that the app’s appeal lies in the ersity of workouts it offers. There are high-energy exercises and low-energy mindfulness routines. But it is difficult to see past the Hemsworth draw – that people download the app in order to be more like him, a Hollywood star. How many regular fitness apps are out there in the digisphere? How many are fronted by Thor?Is this problematic? Probably. Hemsworth’s appearance is not a realistic body standard. He has muscles on the backs of his arms. Large chunks of his day can be devoted to working out. He is reimbursed for time spent considering what to eat and how to train. His job demands it his physical form might actually be a contractual obligation. In your line of work, do you need to achieve a passable resemblance to an over-muscular Norse god? Me neither! Who has that luxury? Who wants the anxiety of that requirement? Which makes the idea of the app seem pointless. Mega-huge biceps are not required for typing on a keyboard.Still, maybe Centr is worthwhile. The other night I launched the app and played a 30-minute video that involved me mimicking a series of jabs, hooks and squats. My wife appeared halfway through the workout and asked what I was doing. I was in the kitchen, punching the air with my fists. “MMA: tap in!” I said, over the voice of a trainer, sweet Jorge Blanco. She asked why. She had never seen me punch the air before, at least not in the kitchen, and, well, she was slack-jawed.I immediately thought, To be more Hemsworth! But I wasn’t sure she’d understand, so I continued punching nothing in front of me and eventually she carried on with her evening. The routine lasted another 15 minutes. I was enjoying it. It felt good to punch the air. I am in the making, I suppose."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cbe8face00152fb82e97844ad8eaa9c11e2e7dd2/0_2430_4480_2688/master/4480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=56623ab0a151a63ff32d086bbeb9a3b9","title":"makeup artist isamaya ffrench is taking beauty to new levels of creativity","story":"Unmistakable, gorgeous, sometimes terrifying, Isamaya Ffrench’s art is taking beauty to new levels of creativity. The unconventional makeup artist tells  Eva Wiseman how she went from painting kids’ faces to working with YSL, Tom Ford and Christian LouboutinAsk Isamaya Ffrench how to achieve the perfect smoky eye, and her face will take on a glazed, if polite, blankness. As the most important makeup artist working in Britain today, she could certainly do it, she could certainly reel off tips on how to apply a matte lip or blend your bronzer, but within seconds of meeting her it is clear she would far prefer… not to. She would prefer, if it’s OK with me, to scrape all that away, and discuss what’s underneath. Things like: the evolution of beauty ideals, and beauty as a symbol of wealth, and the changing face of femininity. I am fine with this.She arrives for coffee on a Saturday afternoon, having just dashed through London to buy a new suitcase. Her last one broke from overuse, as did the one before that – this is the downside of being extremely successful. She returned from Paris this morning and is flying to LA first thing tomorrow, because there is something Ffrench offers that no other makeup artist does, which is a sense of the uncanny. At 29, she has elasticised the idea of what a makeup artist is for, stretching the brief between prettifying tricks and gender politics – she’s less a makeup artist, perhaps, instead an artist who works with makeup.As she takes off her cap and orders a coffee, I study her own face, which is sort of spectacular, even without the bleached eyebrows and gold shadow of a recent selfie. She has extremely blue, sulky eyes, broad brushed-up brows and wide lips that look bitten into a swollen pout her hair is greyish violet. The effect is that of a computer game heroine who has tricked the matrix and escaped.Her work is unmistakable, gorgeous and sometimes terrifying. She combines classic beauty looks with radical fantasy – at the recent spring 2020 shows she was busy, creating moments. She was responsible for spider-leg lashes at Olivier Theyskens, for wildflowers framing models’ faces at Giambattista Valli, and glittering black discs of eyeliner, like 50s sunglasses, at Halpern. Last September she worked with Nick Knight for British Vogue’s cover featuring Rihanna in a floral mane, black-red lips and razor-thin eyebrows. They were the subject of much debate. Good Morning Britain even went to the trouble of recreating the look. Ffrench does this, daily. She starts quiet conversations about what looks right, and how, and why – a flick of her pen and a celebrity appears in a different light. On her Instagram, she is her own model. Ffrench’s Cindy Sherman-like experimentation with prosthetics, masks and bleach sits alongside the pure glamour of Kendall Jenner gazing out of the frame as a silent movie star.“I feel so honoured to be alive in the time of the Kardashians,” Ffrench says today, with genuine glee. “What an amazing spectacle and cultural phenomenon, don’t you think? I mean, if you can separate that from the growth of such an illness of narcissistic self-indulgence, that pathology.” She sips her decaff thoughtfully. “They’ve dominated ideas of what wealth looks like, they’ve presented themselves as status symbols. They’ve dictated what beauty is. So I think, of course, people want to emulate it.”She likes to subvert traditional ideas of beauty, often using illustration, or digital abstraction. For the cover of Dazed Beauty she used an AI system that analysed 17,000 images from Instagram to learn what society considers beautiful. Using the imagery generated, she created hair and makeup looks for Kylie Jenner – in the pictures, Jenner’s face appears to be melting.This intersection of mainstream glamour and boundary-testing experimentation is what separates her from her peers and what led brands such as YSL, Tom Ford and Christian Louboutin to sign her as a collaborator. But she entered the industry through a side door.Born in Cambridge, her ambitions and skills were various. She was a semi-professional er at school and then, at 19, moved to London to take a place on MasterChef. “I was obsessed with food, still am. there’s a huge amount of creative energy, but you’re not creating anything lasting. It’s the same with makeup.” She pulled out of MasterChef at the last minute because she had a dance audition and went on to join the Theo Adams Company as a dancer.She was studying industrial design at Central Saint Martins at the time, and doing face painting at kids’ parties for cash. And she found she was good at it, slightly too good – her butterflies looked as if they were going to fly away by the time the cake came out. “Just like makeup, kid’s face painting is about spacing things in a nicely aesthetic way and brushwork is as important as speed. When you’re doing a party of 30 kids you’ve got like seven minutes per face. So you’ve really got to bash them out.” It was excellent practice.One weekend a friend asked her to make his girlfriend up as a “sexy tiger”, and the photos led to someone in her dance company recommending her for a shoot for i-D magazine. She was tasked with turning a group of boys into gods – which led to a new career painting a lot of penises, often gold. “I remember on one shoot, I was working with a professional makeup artist. And there was a moment where I was washing my huge brushes in the sink, and I saw her packing away her immaculate little kit, and I was like, ‘Well, that looks much easier…’” She adjusted her focus, moving away from “genital work”, upwards, to faces. Her early work drew on her cleverness with prosthetics, typically requiring her to “cover the model in glitter then make it look like they had a broken nose,” but along the way she taught herself the basics of colour, of “glow”, of makeup tricks. “Like, filling in eyebrows really helps with the structure of the face” and “There’s no such thing as ‘good skin’. To make it look balanced, it’s about learning colour correcting.” Much of what she knows, she chuckles, comes from one of makeup artist Kevyn Aucoin’s books that she pored over at the age of seven.The first time her work appeared in a high-fashion magazine it was for a shoot where she turned an elegant model into a chameleon. Themes of metamorphosis continue to interest her. Last year she created a series of teeth mouldings for an exhibition that examined the future of fashion and body modification. But it was that shoot that led photographers and stylists to notice her, and see that they could trust her skills with an eyeliner, “And maybe that I wasn’t necessarily going to do anything too scary or mental.”“Isamaya is a rising talent,” Christian Louboutin emails, “an artist with something to say and express. She is witty and serious, understated and dramatic, colourful and lively.” They’ve recently developed a makeup collection together: “Isamaya managed to create something still very close to my aesthetic, but twisted with her own contemporary and unconventional creative vocabulary.”For somebody who still works with face paint and prosthetics, famous for their dark creativity, the association with mainstream beauty brands sometimes seems surprising. “Well, there’s an associative element that goes with it,” Ffrench explains. “Just aligning themselves with me says something about the brand and their philosophy, and what they’re trying to achieve. It doesn’t, as I’ve learned many times, mean I’m going to do any crazy shit with them, sadly.” A theatrical sigh.“There’s always a hell of a lot of control over big brands – most of the time it’s three blokes in suits who are calling all the shots. So I’m learning that it’s quite unusual to ever be in a position of creative direction where you’re actually going to make huge changes, because it’s so well protected. And that’s what all those people in suits are there to do, to financially safeguard them. But fashion is helping shift that vision by, for instance, talking about inclusive beauty. So now brands are more open to working with casting more interesting faces, and freshening their image.” She smiles. “Things are definitely moving forward.”Where does she see it moving to?“Ooh,” she grins, leaning back for a brief lecture on the history of beauty. “Well, beauty is often associated with fertility and wealth. So, back in the Renaissance period, chunky women were considered very beautiful, because they were rich enough to eat and therefore have healthy kids, and then we fast-forward to the 90s when it was a status symbol to show you were rich enough not to eat – anorexia culture came into play. Thinness defined one’s wealth. And wealth also often means health as well. Then the Kardashians came along, and linked up beauty and the cosmetic industry, the idea that symmetry means ‘good genes’. It’s a psychological thing as much as a trend thing. And I think what’s interesting right now is the inclusion of gender fluidity. We’ve had ‘perfect’ feminine faces for a very long time, but now we have inclusivity in terms of racial ersity and also gender ersity. So that will also fundamentally change the way that we consider wealth and fertility. Right?”Before I can answer she’s thinking about the future. “What I think will happen next as well is that physical health will become even more equated with beauty. From somehow displaying say, your maximum lung capacity or your energy levels or how long your telomeres, your strands of DNA are. Beauty will be about how healthy a person is down to a cellular level, because, just like in Renaissance times, that’s probably an indication that they’re a fertile person.” These are themes she’s been thinking about in advance of a documentary she’s making that will investigate beauty today, including, but not limited to: beauty ideals for trans people, beauty ideals for a generation that’s grown up on Instagram, women in Iran who wear plasters on their nose to pretend they’ve had rhinoplasty, and the exoticism of the Kardashian face, one that draws on black culture but relies on white privilege."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/34a782187602313989bef73bbd5120d646cda5ea/19_180_3790_2275/master/3790.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3cbf8b4d9ef83fe25ab76533fdb4ee5a","title":"fancy dress is great role play as long as you are under 10 halloween eva wiseman","story":"This Halloween expect to see Naughty Activist, Brexit Bad Boy – and zombie strippers that, just like fancy dress, refuse to dieEvery year Halloween bursts through the slats of Britain’s door and insists it’s a thing. “I am a thing!” it whines. “Ask America!” Out of politeness, perhaps, we invite it in, with its cantilevered cleavage and bleeding eyes, and we compliment its meaty perfume and listen to its suggestions on how to construct a sexy Amazon warehouse worker costume using only objects that can be delivered next-day on Prime. Though Halloween has a lot to answer for, it would be unfair to rest all blame for the rise of fancy dress on its shoulders – the rise, and fall, and zombie-stripper-like rise. Fancy dress refuses to die.Which is odd because, of course, it should have faded away many times, swept into the bin of the British past like Gentleman’s Relish or coatigans, most memorably after, haha, the pictures of Prince Harry as a Nazi. In 2005, he wore a German desert uniform and a swastika armband to a friend’s birthday party in Wiltshire, which had the fancy dress theme “colonial and native”. Imagine even writing the words on your Paperless Post. Dragging your fingers from key to key as a voice inside you screamed: “BUT ARE YOU SURE?”Since then adults have screwed up fancy dress so many times, and with such comic ignorance, that recent revelations – that Justin Trudeau wore blackface not once, or twice, but three times, revealing it to be his signature look and that Atlantic Records boss Ben Cook (who is white) resigned after being reprimanded for attending a “musical icons” party as a member of Run-DMC – are surely mere drops in the fancy dress ocean. Right now, a boy from Eton is humming as he lays out his Grenfell costume on the bed, and a woman in Bray is perfecting her hair before she debuts her Sexy Anne Frank.Show me an adult’s costume party and I will show you a room of rich people in trouble. Out of 30, at least one will expose their extreme politics through an ill-advised accessory, at least five will be wearing 3D versions of the masks they’ve been hiding behind for the last 20 years, thus revealing the flimsiness of their identity – and the rest will be merrily performing a sexuality they formed in front of Eurotrash one Friday night in 1994. One man will be extremely scary, misunderstanding the boundaries between fun and psychopathy. One woman will be extremely naked, misunderstanding the boundaries between knickers and arse. And so gender will be defined in this town for another year. The party themes are telling, their casual “isms”, whether race or sex, revealing more about the party-thrower than any music playlist. Sexualised animals will roam the live-work space with a raspberry beer, free of the true sex characteristics of their species, such as barbed penises or the inclination to eat their lover’s head after mating.But I get it. Largely. I’ve put the time in, from a distance. Made in Chelsea, my primary anthropological source for the evolution of fancy dress, rotated around a series of extravagant costume parties designed to provide a theatre for the themed drama within. You get a whole new understanding of class when a drink’s thrown over someone dressed as a swan, and when else do you get to have sex in your mother’s wedding dress?Though I came of age in the time of ironic 70s disco nights, I was never tempted, perhaps because my daily outfits were often mistaken for fancy dress. Returning to London after college, I met people who’d graduated from university with honours in cultural appropriation through the application of bindis. Their legendary themed parties dripped over whole weekends into their 20s, into fields, and nightclubs and someone’s mum’s house, where wealthy blonde law graduates and trainee doctors would gather for another opportunity to get off with a stranger covered in blood.At Halloween they unsheath their costumes again, either squeezing into the glittery memories of their past or designing a cutting piece of topical cultural commentary assembled off the internet. This year, expect to see Inspector WAG, Naughty Activist, Greased Piglet, Brexit Bad Boy, The Death of Print Media, Plastic Wasteman, and The Only Person That Came To Work In Costume. And, on the one hand, let them have their fun. On the other, for Christ’s sake, you know? It’s like five pints or a pill – if the only way you can work up the courage to dance or flirt or truly express your feelings on the future is by dressing up as a Love Island casualty then, love, I urge you to talk to someone.Given the opportunity I would ban fancy dress for the over-10s. Standing in line waiting for my kid to have her face painted this weekend, the requests ahead of us bounced gloriously from “magic unicorn with talking powers” to “Elsa skeleton”. The subtext for kids’ costumes is political in a way that adults will never understand, but there is no expectation that a fancy hat will release them from the heavy anchor of humanity. They just want to be a pirate for a bit."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95a95ccdb603a7711ccc0017ecd1e2ab4ac9a69f/0_124_3130_1877/master/3130.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a35b5dedc000b11d9a7160ea2b635077","title":"sunday with zandra rhodes i make soup to feed the team at lunchtime","story":"The fashion designer on the busiest day of the week – and not owning a TVWhat time are you up?

When his 1995 debut album, Maxinquaye, went No 3 and made him a media darling, his horrified reaction was to dismiss the “coffee-table” record and the trip-hop movement it birthed, and to move his music firmly left field to evade unwanted critical hyperbole.This aversion to the limelight was best illustrated when he was an unlikely guest during Beyoncé’s headline set at Glastonbury in 2011. Trapped in the spotlights before roughly 100,000 people and a TV audience of millions, he froze, unable to deliver his verse. “I told the press my mic wasn’t working,” he later admitted. “It was working fine.”He made a recent return to the hated spotlight with the publication of an autobiography, Hell Is Round the Corner. It’s a frequently harrowing read, from his revelation that his first memory, aged four, was viewing his mother in her coffin after she killed herself, to the tragic death of his daughter Mazy, aged 24, this year.Tonight though, more than two decades and 12 albums on from Maxinquaye, Tricky is back in the shadows he loves, figuratively and literally. As is his wont, the show takes place in near-darkness: he is a whispering half-presence, a phantom wraith, slipping in and out of the on-stage murk.It is a mesmerising set. Essentially a left-field producer, Tricky weaves hypnotic webs of electro twitches, grunge guitar and husky, half-heard murmurs. The opening track, You Don’t Wanna, both samples Eurythmics’ Sweet Dreams and is on the verge of slipping into a warped, barbed take on Nirvana’s Smells Like Teen Spirit.Co-vocalist Marta Złakowska is an ethereal foil to Tricky’s antic intensity. On the ominous I’m Not Going, she whispers, “I’m not really into it”, as if succumbing to a wily predator. As he does all night, Tricky paces the stage and performs a nervous-tic mime, wrestling his black T-shirt as if trying to peel off a second skin.Every song sounds like a jagged inner monologue that has been externalised. It is claustrophobic, foreboding music, and yet you long to e into it. On Armor, from Tricky’s latest album, 2017’s underrated Ununiform, he pause his restless pacing to muse, “How strange it is to love!” – as if it’s the first time the concept has occurred to him.For the agitated, narcotic Here My Dear, performed twice, he flails at the air as if battling an invisible assailant. It is a violent contrast to his cover of Sia’s Breathe Me, which he reduces to a skeletal, glacial reverie. Virtually nothing happens, and it does so intensely and beautifully.The show is erratic and unpredictable. Halfway through, the musicians abruptly quit the stage. When they return five minutes later, Tricky signals his disinterest during the luscious Overcome, the sole offering from Maxinquaye, by again vanishing into the wings until it is over.He is a genius fractured auteur, an enigma wrapped in a Rizla. He and Złakowska perform brilliant reconstructive surgery on Hole’s Doll Parts, replacing the original’s inchoate ire with oceanic melancholy. For the encore, he is joined by tonight’s support act, bearded soul tyro Murkage Dave, to mumble through the latter’s I Pay My Taxes (You Can’t Talk to Me Like I’m a Dickhead). “We just learned that backstage, then we come out and done it!” ulges Tricky happily.It is a confounding night – and all the better for it. Almost a quarter century after being cursed with unwanted celebrity, Tricky remains an uncompromising maverick a bizarre, bafflingly brilliant musician."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/65f1d17db97c3b4f248da29bd3ac126f545498bd/0_196_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d54cd1b869425cabc24b8d94c9e8c5c7","title":"opinium poll observer uk voters regret brexit referendum conservative lead over labour","story":"Twice as many people now think it would have been better never to have held a referendum on Brexit than believe it was a good idea, according to the latest Opinium poll for the Observer.“To the extent that there is a way out of the impasse, a general election is the most popular inidual outcome, but if Johnson’s deal were put up against the option of remaining in the EU in a binary referendum, the country remains just as evenly split as it was last time we asked.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa60418c4b52355d85e35b75c9fdaae9f9a86a9d/0_197_2969_1781/master/2969.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=70083fd3ca89d418db9fab4fc45c72fb","title":"gutted but gracious stunned new zealanders concede better team won","story":"World Cup loss to England disappointing but not devastating as Eddie Jones praised for tactical masterclassAs New Zealand woke up on Sunday morning, the long weekend had lost its lustre.On Saturday night, the All Blacks had crashed out of the Rugby World Cup in an underwhelming show against England, and the tantalising sweetness of a possible three-time World Cup victory was gone.But New Zealanders, as is their way, conceded defeat gracefully, and were soothed by the impressive and admirable prowess of the England side. This wasn’t a loss due to a controversial ref call or dirty play from the opposition. This was defeat in the face of greatness.Immigration minister Iain Less-Galloway summed up the mood of the nation when he tweeted on Sunday: “1) The better team won. Congrats to England. They were superior in every facet \u0026amp deserved victory. 2) The All Blacks lost with dignity \u0026amp grace even though it hurt like hell. 3) It’s good for the game to see more teams capable of winning the World Cup. Go Wales!”The Herald on Sunday, the country’s largest Sunday paper, turned its entire front page black, and in small print declared gently: “The All Blacks are out of the World Cup. If you want to read more, go to the sports section.”England’s superior play was warmly acknowledged by New Zealanders – and humour emerged amidst the hangovers, as well as a genuine respect for Eddie Jones’ side, who All Blacks coach Steve Hansen has described as “tremendous”.The country’s national Sunday tabloid, The Sunday Star Times, devoted its front page to a bloodied picture of All Black TJ Perenara, under the headline “Yoko, Oh no”, describing the loss as a “horror show”.But retired Auckland rugby player Ben Atiga urged New Zealand to take the defeat on the chin – and get the ball out on Sunday morning as a way to ease the pain.“It’s over, life isn’t,” Atiga tweeted. “Get the ball out and chuck it around. Spark up the feed and put on the jams. Have a laugh.”Will Nelson, 27, of the North Island, said the loss hadn’t hurt as much expected – a sentiment expressed around the country, where sometimes defeat can result in a depressed national mood that lingers for days.“I’m not feeling too bad to be honest. I’m usually really nervous watching the All Blacks but I wasn’t yesterday because I never really felt like we were in the game,” said Nelson.“I’m a bit gutted the All Blacks didn’t play better as it could have been an epic contest but they didn’t seem to turn up for the game – I thought England were pretty incredible.”Amidst the gracious and moderate reactions of most , the opposition National MP Judith Collins took the opportunity to take a dig, tweeting that an All Blacks World Cup defeat “Never happened when we were in Govt” .The National party leader, Simon Bridges, was praised for summing up the mood of the nation with his simple, unadorned response to the loss: “Bugger”.Not all New Zealanders took it so well. One note of discord was the vandalism of a vehicle in Auckland. Painted up in the colours of the Union Jack, the mini has its windows smashed in outside a Devonport pub.The incident appeared to be isolated however, with New Zealand police reporting a “fairly routine” Saturday night around the country, in terms of violence and family-harm incidents. Busy, as weekends always are, “but not out of the ordinary in terms of incidents or demand”.Following significant All Blacks losses, sports analysts and the national media usually dissect in earnest what went wrong, who is to blame, and who should take the fall for it. The All Blacks’ dominance on the rugby world stage is part of New Zealand’s appeal as a tourist destination – “the home of rugby” – and losses can have financial consequences too.But this time around, the blame-game was unusually muted.At the New Zealand Herald, its sports desk compiled the top five reasons the All Blacks lost, and in top billing was the simple reason “1. England simply too good”, followed closely by “Scoreboard pressure” and “Eddie Jones”.At New Zealand’s largest news website, Stuff, Sir Ian McGeechan wrote that he’d never seen the All Blacks so outplayed – putting the spotlight on England’s talent, rather than the All Blacks deficiencies.“This was a technical and tactical masterclass in which England had a complete appreciation of what they were trying to achieve. Eddie Jones, take a bow,” McGeechan wrote.Stuff’s national RWC Mood-O Meter – which was clocked at “no worries” on Friday afternoon, had swung to “gutted” by Sunday morning.But considering the passion many New Zealanders have for the game – often described as the national religion – it was a “gutted” mired in respect, resignation, and continued love for a game that can surprise and even delight a country so used to world domination."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95b46f2d910cfb410d622c6da87134ea32d782ff/0_50_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7609fa1a1e849e11e4d4a96979d6be11","title":"wales south africa rugby world cup semi final match report","story":"• Damian de Allende’s try helps swing tense semi-final • Next Saturday’s match in Yokohama a repeat of the 2007 finalWarren Gatland will get his wish for one final crack at New Zealand before he retires after 12 years as Wales’s head coach, but Friday’s bronze play-off was not what he had in mind. His side were battered and bruised by a typically abrasive South Africa in a match of few thrills but several spills that was settled by a Handré Pollard penalty five minutes from time.South Africa will meet England in Saturday’s final, a repeat of 2007 when Eddie Jones, who was in the crowd here, was part of the Springboks’ management team as a consultant. Their style of play has changed little in the 12 years since and they overcame Wales by protecting the gainline.South Africa kicked the ball the first eight times they took possession as the match lived up to its billing as an aerial contest. It took an advantage for the Springboks to dare to attempt a pass and so shocked was Handré Pollard that he dropped the ball with a defender nowhere near him.•\u0026nbspFixtures, tables and results• Top try and points scorers•\u0026nbspSign up to The Breakdown, our free rugby union email newsletterPollard kicked the penalty to restore the lead he had given his side from the tee after 14 minutes. Wales quickly equalised when an enterprising move from a line-out that saw George North provide an extra man in the line and force Willie le Roux to step offside, for Dan Biggar to turn to profit.Jones and his defence coach John Mitchell were among the spectators who were treated to rather less movement than the evening before when the holders New Zealand were eliminated. The opening half ran at a kick a minute with Wales shading it 21-19 although they made a few more passes than their opponents’ 28.South Africa sought refuge in the set-pieces and mauls as they looked to wear down Wales and force penalties. Pollard kicked his third six minutes from the end of the opening half after Ken Owens entered a ruck from the side, but Biggar reduced the interval deficit to three points with his second kick.Wales had by then lost two players to injury. The prop Tomas Francis left the field clutching his left wrist after Duane Vermeulen was given too much room after gathering a restart and had broken into a gallop when Francis crouched low to bring down the No 8.Two minutes before the break, the wing George North pulled up as he tried to run on to Biggar’s cross-kick and suffered a hamstring strain, but Wales were level shortly after the restart. Faf de Klerk dropped Leigh Halfpenny’s kick downfield into touch and when South Africa jumped across the line-out, Biggar accepted the three points.Neither side was making a case to take on England. There was an awful passage of play when Wales had three kicks charged down in and around their 22 in less than a minute but South Africa were unable to keep hold of the ball and when Gareth Davies kicked it towards halfway, Willie le Roux followed De Klerk’s example.The last tryless semi-final was in 1999 when Rassie Erasmus was in South Africa’s back row in their 27-21 extra-time defeat to Australia at Twickenham. Neither side had come close to the other’s line after 55 minutes: South Africa had not made much of an effort while Wales struggled to achieve quick possession and struggled to get the ball beyond the first receiver as the Springboks protected the gainline.And then, as if from nowhere, Pollard surprised Wales first with an offload and then by running into their 22 where he got away from a prop, Rhys Carré, before being hauled down short of the line. South Africa had a penalty advantage and moved the ball to the left where Damian de Allende shrugged off Biggar’s tackle and took Tomos Williams and Owen Watkin over the line with him.A second try came along almost at once. Rhys Patchell, on for Biggar, kicked a penalty to within five metres of the line. Wales’s driving maul was held up and they spent 20 phases trying to batter their way over without making a centimetre. They were awarded a penalty and surprised South Africa by opting for a scrum.South Africa drove forward, forcing Wales’s front row to stand up. The referee Jerôme Garcés let play continue and Jonathan Davies freed Josh Adams on the left for the wing to score his sixth try of the tournament, more than anyone else. Halfpenny converted from wide out to level the scores.Wales kept coming, but when Francois Louw forced Alun Wyn Jones to hold on, South Africa achieved position and a set-piece to set up a maul. When Dillon Lewis strayed offside, Pollard landed his fourth penalty and time ran out for the team that, at the wrong moment, remembered how to lose."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ed5901bc61a811a652d7d386a3d0118c4b6bc56/0_176_5396_3237/master/5396.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=224eddb0fcb29a183241a9c6113c97ca","title":"wales v south africa rugby world cup semi final live","story":"Handré Pollard scored a decisive penalty four minutes from time to leave Welsh dreams in tattersThat’s it from me today.

But South Africa’s intelligence - combined with massive power and quality off the bench - made all the difference when the scores were locked at 16-16.

Bye for now.Habana talks about Eddie Jones’s coaching involvement with South Africa in 2007: “He brought an outside voice that we hadn’t experienced before, particularly from an attacking perspective. He will have been watching from the stands tonight, knowing what it is like to be in the heartbeat of a South African side that becomes successful at a World Cup.”I was at that match myself and I remember it well. England’s Matthew Tait made the only clean line break of the match to set up that Cueto no-try in the corner, which took an age to produce a decision from the TMO. However, it was referee Alain Rolland’s failure to sin-bin Schalk Burger for coming in at the side in that move that sticks in my mind. I’m over it now though, honestly ...South Africa had absolutely pummelled England 36-0 in the pool stage, of course, and England’s route past Australia in the last eight and France in the semi-finals was an unlikely one. It is a very different story this time.Here’s a video interview with a very disappointed, but very level-headed Gatland:Paul O’Connell: “The only difference between the teams was that South Africa got a few more penalties...but they didn’t create a whole lot. It’s hard for Wales, they are not as big as South Africa and they couldn’t win the collisions.”George Gregan says there were 81 kicks in all.Yes, there was a lot of kicking, and let’s face it, as a spectacle today’s match was very poor. But it was massively tense in the final quarter, especially when Wales brought it back to 16-16.Bryan Habana makes the bizarre point that England would be the first champions to win the Rugby World Cup having drawn a game (the cancelled 0-0 with France - so not really a drawn game). And of course South Africa, he says, would be the first team to win the trophy after losing a match at the tournament.Pollard on facing England in the final: “We will make some plans. It’s going to be another physical one. It will be classic World Cup rugby.”De Allende, who got that crucial try, speaks to ITV: “It was very tough out there, credit to Wales, but there can only be one winner and luckily it was us. We always want to front up and be physical ... if you can draw a line in the sand and take your opponent backwards, you’re winning those small battles. But like I said, Wales were very tough and they just kept coming for us, and coming for us.Handré Pollard is named Player of the Match:“We were never comfortable,” he says:Erasmus: “It was nerve-wracking at the end ... I’ve got so much respect for Wales and their coach. In those last few minutes I thought they might pull it through again.”Gatland speaks: “I’m proud of our guys, we were adjacent to South Africa for a long time. They were good up front and we gave away too many penalties in our own half ... We were in the arm-wrestle but probably three or four penalties were costly in terms of points. The turnover from them, they get a penalty, drive us and get three points...We’re disappointed because we’ve worked so hard. “I’m absolutely proud, we’ve punched massively above our weight, I’m proud of these guys tonight...At 16-16 it was pretty close and you’re dreaming about the three points being the other way. But congratulations South Africa. They were good up front, they won the collisions, but our guys didn’t take a backward step. I can only be proud of them for that and we stayed in the arm-wrestle for a long, long time. Congratulations to South Africa.”Those are brilliant - and accurate - words from Gatland. How about a sign-off win against the All Blacks next Friday?Wyn-Jones: “It wasn’t our day today, but I am still very proud to wear this jersey.” Wales face New Zealand in the bronze final next Friday. Warren Gatland’s time as Wales coach ends (the bronze final notwithstanding) with a second semi-final defeat, after their exit against France back in 2011. But South Africa are such an impressive team and there is absolutely no shame for Wales in the way they went out. The dream was very much alive into the final 10 minutes, and it was replacement Francois Louw whose breakdown work relieved the pressure on the 1995 and 2007 champions.Dillon Lewis gave away the decisive penalty after South Africa got the shove on at a driving maul. Sorry to sound like a stuck record, but that was all about South African power. Pollard drilled the winning three points like he was in a practice session.Before the tournament our rugby correspondent Robert Kitson predicted an England v South Africa final. Chapeau.“It would not surprise me if England and South Africa, as in 2007, turn out to be the last two sumo warriors left standing in Yokohama on 2 November.”England met South Africa in the 2007 final, in Paris. South Africa won.Interestingly, Eddie Jones was working with the Springboks during that campaign and some players have said they couldn’t have won it without his input. This time, Jones will be plotting their downfall in the biggest match in the sport.Chris Kingham emails: “Most difficult job in the stadium tonight was the poor b***ard who had to pick the man of the match from that fiasco.”Erasmus celebrates. His team did enough - just - against a seriously impressive fightback by Wales in the final quarter.Gareth Thomas on ITV: “It was a tough battle. South Africa won deservedly but Wales could have won, as well.”England will meet South Africa in the final next Saturday. Stay right here and I will get as much reaction as possible. Email me or tweet with any thoughts ...Here’s the match report: Heartbreak for Wales. South Africa knock them out for the second tournament in a row. Wales had built a brilliant attacking platform inside the final 10 minutes, but then a crucial turnover by Louw is what swung it back in South Africa’s favour. It was largely an ugly, attritional match. But the way Wales clawed back level after conceding a try was sensational.79 min: De Klerk puts in and South Africa win a scrum penalty. It looks like game over and heartbreak for Wales. “Absolutely the right decision,” says ex-prop and current commentator David Flatman.78 min: South Africa spoil the Welsh line-out. There is a knock-on by Wyn-Jones, according to the referee at least, and South Africa will have the scrum. South Africa think they have won the match with that spoiled line-out. Wales trail by three points and SA have a scrum deep in Wales territory.77 min: Wales try to run it from their own 22. Halfpenny is tackled. South Africa are swarming in defence trying to protect their slender lead. De Klerk then fields another Wales kick and angles a wonderful touch-finder into Wales’ 22.Now Wales must dig even deeper. Four minutes to go and the Boks have edged ahead after Dillon Lewis was penalised for coming in at the side of a driving maul. It was all created by the South African pack getting a massive shove on and splintering the Welsh defence with brute strength.74 min: Francois Louw, who came on a couple of minutes ago, wins a crucial penalty at a ruck with some first-class jackling and SA can clear their lines. A long spell of pressure by Wales comes to an end. Pollard tries a drop-goal with a penalty advantage and now he can kick for the posts, from about 35 yards out. A huge momentum shift in a couple of minutes.72 min: Patchell with a nice flat pass to Beard around the 22. Wales have a real foothold now. More phases, more pressure. Patchell tries a drop-goal but it has neither the required distance nor direction. 70 mins: Line-out for Wales on the SA 22. Patchell makes a dart but is smashed back by Pollard and de Allende. But still, it’s Wales possession. This is where all those vomit-inducing training sessions can pay off in their conditioning.67 min: Wales have the ball. Williams box kicks. Le Roux claims it and it’s kicked back by de Klerk - Patchell does incredibly well to tidy it up under pressure in his own 22. Then, Carre does very well to rip the ball from SA hands and produce a turnover. Wales will have a scrum in their own half as we approach the final 10 minutes. Wales have been on the ropes at times but they have come out punching in the last 10 minutes and the players will be believing they can pull this off. Wainwright off now, for Shingler and all the Wales replacements are on the field. 66 min: All square with less than 15 minutes to play. Wales would have taken that at half-time, right? That is just a massive, massive effort from them to get back on terms. Inspirational stuff.Oh my word. What a call by Wyn-Jones, what a try in the corner. What a finale we have on our hands now. The Wales scrum was under pressure but they get the ball out and put it through the hands to the left. It was No 13 Davies with the final, telling pass to Adams on the wing and he makes no mistake from a simple overlap. That was inspired by Wales - Wyn-Jones knew that a scrum would mean more attacking space. Massive. Halfpenny then belts an utterly fantastic kick from out on the touchline to add the extras. That is just sensational, skilful, gutsy rugby.62 min: Wales eventually opt for a little grubber which de Klerk smothers in the corner. That was the most exciting sustained spell of play we have seen, but it was all about power in defence and attack, bodies smashing into each other near the try line. Wyn-Jones chooses a scrum after getting a penalty. Massive call.61 min: More great counter-rucking from Du Toit. “The South African defenders aren’t having to think too much,” says Flatman in the commentary box. But they are under pressure. The 15th phase ...60 min: Pressure, pressure, pressure from Wales just a couple of metres from the SA try line.58 min: Wales win a penalty at a ruck now. They need to find a score with a little over 20 minutes remaining. Erasmus smashes the table in front of him in frustration. Patchell, on for Biggar, kicks for the corner. Davies is off at No 9 and Williams is on.The first try of the match and that looks significant, shall we say. Wales couldn’t deal with those phases from South Africa and after Biggar can’t hold him in a tackle, de Allende manages to power over. Pollard converts. South Africa had been building pressure for a while.56 min: SA win a scrum penalty and then rumble forward. Pollard makes a dart into the Wales 22 but he is tackled. But it’s more quick ball and de Allende is over for the try.55 min: A couple of minutes ago, Boks coach Erasmus refreshed his whole front row. Now Carre comes on for Wales, too.54 min: Excellent question from Bob:53 min: Biggar with a nice pop pass in midfield for Halfpenny to rush on to, but it’s fractionally forward. Another scrum to South Africa, inside their own half.52 min: Olivier Burel emails: “Is it really the same sport as yesterday ?”51 min: South Africa start to build a bit of momentum, in the Wales half, but then they cough up a penalty for holding on.50 min: Less than 30 mins to play and we are in for a tense finale. Wales take a clever short line-out in their own territory and clear. Then it’s turned over by South Africa and de Allende puts in a good low grubber kick which finds touch. Ken Owens will have a line-out to throw in.David Flynn: “Can we start a petition to the ban the use of that overhead wire camera during kickoffs and scrums?”49 min: Biggar and Nkosi compete for yet another high kick. It’s a South African scrum after Biggar knocks on. It’s just over halfway.48 min: Eli Davies emails: “Why oh why are Wales continually giving possession back to S Africa with the box kicks?”46 min: Davies now with a kick out wide and le Roux makes ANOTHER howler for the Boks, spilling it into touch. There were three chargedowns in the space of about 30 seconds before that.That error by de Klerk ended up costing his team. We are all square, and we are emotional.44 min: Wales possession and Davies takes it down the short side. De Klerk smashes him into touch and then there are some afters. Jake Ball gets involved. Ball v de Klerk?? Wow. They shake each other warmly by the throat. That is a mismatch. “They’re just discussing what shampoo they use in their hair and beards,” says Shane Williams. 43 min: Oh dear! De Klerk looks well set to claim a kick by Halfpenny out wide but he spills it over the touch line. That was a howler. Can Wales capitalise? They have a line-out near halfway.42 min: Paul O’Connell in the stadium: “It’s after getting colder, and the wind is picking up. South Africa are kicking with the wind which is going to give Pollard more range on his kicks. Wales need to be careful of their discipline in this half.”41 min: Davies puts up a high box kick. Vermeulen claims it, then Pollard puts a superb kick beyond Dan Biggar and into the corner, pinning Wales back in their own 22.“The bits we will remember forever are yet to come,” says Miles Harrison, the commentator. You can say that again.When you think about the continuity that England managed to build against New Zealand yesterday ... well, we haven’t seen anything approaching that from either side so far today. After the break against Japan last week, the Boks utterly dominated as their superior power started to tell. But Wales are a more experienced, more battle-hardened team than the hosts. Can they somehow grind out a result and reach their first-ever Rugby World Cup final? It’s going to be nervy.“More of the same for Wales,” says Gareth Thomas. “Look for the edges.”Half-time thoughts from Rob Kitson, our rugby correspondent in the stadium today:“Hmm. Let’s be positive: before kick-off Wales would definitely have taken a three-point deficit at half-time. And everything’s relative: I seem to recall the 1991 Scotland v England semi was a lot worse than this. In the absence of Liam Williams and George North, though, Wales need to find a spark from somewhere. Pollard doesn’t look like he’s going to miss any time soon and not sure Wales want to be running straight at these huge Springbok forwards for 80 minutes. Still looking forward to one of potential highlights of the tournament: Jake Ball’s beard meets RG Snyman’s hair!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5100d6d04f5edcba684b123477260c54228dc7c6/344_759_4506_2704/master/4506.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca2ac4b3197f045b7d0050418f7b1a1b","title":"share tip pilgrim trail europe win 200 pound hotel voucher","story":"Routes all over the UK and Europe follow paths established by pilgrims centuries ago.

I first visited in 2011, and was gripped by an inexplicable love for the African continent and a deep sense of freedom, so returning now I was excited to see if I’d feel the same. A lesser-known land in south-east Africa, Malawi borders Tanzania, Mozambique and Zambia. It’s a comparatively small, land-locked country, beguiling because of its sea-like lake. It is rightly known as the Warm Heart of Africa.I wasn’t prepared for quite how changeable its landscape would be. For the first 10 days of my holiday I am on an organised group excursion. It’s curated by Faraway, a company specialising in diligently planned group escapes. Signing up to be part of a rabble of 16 people of similar age to me but from different walks of life and parts of the world and all looking to go on a fantastic trip, felt a bit like being on a more intrepid 18-30s holiday. But Faraway is a lot classier – and livelier. With regular offerings of the infamous Malawian gin replacing Sambuca shots, it’s adventure travel for the Instagram generation. Group leaders Helen and Al present us with tote bags containing a “survival kit” that includes some lightweight cotton trousers (vital for the long coach journeys) and a black and white disposable camera.There’s a special type of camaraderie that comes from travelling together in a big van and having an itinerary. In times where more people are single and looking for a temporary escape from the pressures of everyday life, Faraway’s Malawian trip is perfect. There’s something for everyone, from trekking in luscious countryside, lakeside sun-kissed afternoons and rugged island camping to high-end safaris and raving at a festival with sand beneath our feet. The experience, from the outset, is a perfect mixture of giddy, brave, backpacking hysteria and once-in-a-lifetime, breathtaking, memorable moments. Staying somewhere new every other night as part of a team adds to the bonding experience, and I quickly make friends with Gid, an Australian tech developer.We spend our first night getting into the group dynamic at a mid-budget lakeside spot called Mgoza Lodge, which consists of simple huts and a very welcome communal “dipping pool” in a shaded garden. The lodge is chill and the food is delicious. It’s also where we are introduced to Malawi’s gin for the first time, which is pretty lethal, and proves a heady mix with anti-malaria tablet side-effects.In the morning we amble into the heart of Cape Maclear, the backpacker’s village that is home to Mgoza Lodge. It has a welcoming, hazy, hippy vibe and a must-visit small shop filled with beautiful handwoven placemats and other locally made homeware. The profits go directly to the makers, a group of skilled local women.Next, we take a boat to Domwe and Mumbo, two remote islands in Lake Malawi’s National Park, though you can also kayak there from Cape Maclear. Domwe is the more rugged of the two islands and offers simple tent accommodation and, in the evening, a big fire and a chance to kick back after watching a sunset that is so potent it sets your dreams alight.We eat fresh fish that I had bought earlier in the day from a visiting fisherman. There’s no phone signal and limited electricity so our night on Domwe has the air of wild romance. The following morning we head to Mumbo, my favourite of the two islands, which we have all to ourselves. Our accommodation is an upgrade from tents to bamboo cabins up in the hills, overlooking a jaw-dropping turquoise waterscape. In the morning we wake and watch the sunrise from our beds. Lost for words, all we can manage is: “This is incredible.”Next, we go trekking. If you like to hike, then Zomba is a must. We stay at the cosy Zomba Forest Lodge, where they serve delicious home-cooked food made from locally grown ingredients. It’s run by Tom and Petal, who can organise a day’s hike that makes you feel like one of the dinosaurs in The Land Before Time. Zomba is under two hours from Blantyre airport and around four hours from the capital, Lilongwe.Then it is time to party, so we head to the Lake of Stars, the international music festival whose hotel base borders Lake Malawi. If you are a swashbuckling explorer in search of the unexpected, then Lake of Stars is a dream. The gloriously patchwork-style programme is a mixture of cultural offerings, with new favourites always on offer from the African diaspora. My own favourites are Malawian rapper Lady Pace and Kenya’s Sauti Sol (the Kenyan equivalent to Take That and one of the biggest pop bands on the planet). I even DJ in a sand storm. It’s worth booking your trip around the festival, though best to stay off-site, and prepare to have the most fun at sunset. If you’re travelling in November, then you might also like to catch the annual Tumaini music and arts festival, which always takes place in a refugee camp. This year’s venue is Malawi’s Dzaka Refugee Camp in Lilongwe.At the end of the trip we go on safari. We are travelling down a dusty road in the Majete Reserve when we suddenly meet with an elephant so huge that Charles, our driver, stops – for a full 20 minutes. He is stunned, not knowing whether our rickety van might agitate the creature. The park itself is “self-drive” though you can also can go on a walking safari (too terrifying) or a boat safari to watch groups of yawning hippos up close. From our vehicle I spot skulking crocs and, that night, during the most majestic moment of all, we go out in a buggy in the dark of night, pull up at a viewing platform and spot a black rhino taking a long glug from a puddle. I freeze, awe-struck.Mkulumadzi Lodge is all-inclusive and our plush bedrooms have big holes instead of windows. It feels like you’re sleeping in the wilderness, albeit under the highest thread count sheets.I extend my stay and took some deep decompression breaths at Latitude 13, a swish hotel in the former Japanese ambassador’s residence 10 minutes from the centre of Llingowe. They serve us some life-giving crisp white wine on our first night. It couldn’t have come at a better time after days of long journeys. When I learn that Rihanna stayed here in 2017, I start to strut. A pool, fresh juices, massages and a laundry service are welcome and ine. The vast, stylish bedrooms work an industrial vibe and include African wall hangings and textiles. This design hotel is contemporary southeast Africa at its most enticing.Also not to be missed, but for very different reasons, is the Mushroom Farm, a breathtaking eco-lodge 3,400ft above ground level. Situated 10km up a dirt track outside Chitimba, a village on the northern shore of Lake Chitimba and overlooking the Great Rift Valley, the sustainable lodge is a 10-hour drive from the capital. The best bet is to break the full-on journey with an overnight stay in the northern city of Mzuzu, the gateway to Lake Malawi. It’s four hours from Lilongwe. We blast through, which is a little hairy. Driving upwards in rural Malawi, off-road once night has fallen, hurtling through the forest isn’t the greatest. Do the drive while it’s still light. A car to take you the whole journey (to and from Lilongwe) will cost around £300. The Mushroom Farm can recommend drivers.We stay in a cob house at the farm (there are various types of accommodation, including a reasonably priced dormitory), where we are on the edge of the world. You have to cross a patio with a sheer drop and no barrier to go to the compost loo. Despite its name, they grow more than mushrooms here in the perma-culture garden.Coming this far north in Malawi is one of the most rural African experiences I’ve had. You can hear trance-inducing drumming in the local villages at night, and we walk the ancestral path down to the waterfall Manchewe Falls. It’s intense, but unforgettably beautiful.Gemma Cairney travelled on Faraway’s group escape. Prices for the SeptOct 2020 trip are £2,950 for the first four early bird spots, £3,100 thereafter, including accommodation, activities, tickets to the Lake of Stars, meals, transport and a donation to a local charity. International flights extra. Rooms at Latitude 13 in Lilongwe from £221. The Mushroom Farm, Livinstonia, has accommodation ranging from cob houses to chalets and safari tents from £5 to £25 a night. For information on the Lake of Stars festival, go to lakeofstars.orgBotswana safari Wild camping in the Okavango Delta and a visit to the Victoria Falls are among the highlights of Responsible Travel’s low-impact safari. A percentage of the cost of each trip goes towards the Okavango SOS trees project. A 13-day trip costs from £1,490pp, plus a local payment of US$300, excluding flights (responsibletravel).Looking for a holiday with a difference?

From travel apps and carbon calculators to free public transport, here’s how you can make a differenceIndustry experts believe that a nationwide transport revolution is required to mitigate the climate crisis, and that smart technology could transform the way we travel. Travel apps are making sustainable transport options more accessible to the growing number of people keen to change their travel plans to reduce their environmental impact.Tools include the calculator at EcoPassenger, which directly compares energy consumption and carbon emissions of planes, cars and trains for any journey. Meanwhile, Lime’s new electric bike and scooter sharing scheme is taking off in London and Milton Keynes, and Europe’s leading train and coach app, Trainline, is making greener travel more hassle-free for customers globally by investing in technology to help make train and coach travel across 45 countries more accessible. “Our long-term vision is to enable everyone to travel from A to B much faster and more efficiently, in a way that’s better for the environment,” says Clare Gilmartin, CEO of Trainline. “We use artificial intelligence and advanced mobile technology so that, via our app, customers can travel by train and coach seamlessly, with on-the-go access to real-time journey information, using digital tickets to skip queues and with access to clever features like BusyBot, which harnesses crowdsourced data to help people find a seat on a busy train. We believe smart tech has a crucial role to play in encouraging and enabling people to travel sustainably.”The government has invested £1.5bn in grants between 2015 and 2020 for electric plug-in vehicles and schemes to kickstart the rollout of charge-point infrastructure, while pledging that all new cars and vans should be zero-emission by 2040, according to its Road to Zero strategy. Childs insists this is not enough: “The only way we can make the scale of reductions we need fast enough is by having a revolution in transportation.”Lisbon has one of the world’s largest electric vehicle charging point networks, while Estonia and Luxembourg have introduced countrywide free public transport. “Free public transport is transformational, not only for the environment – it’s also socially progressive,” adds Childs. Trainline found that a quarter of young Brits would reduce time behind the wheel to be more sustainable, and Friends of the Earth is calling for the government to make bus travel free to under-30s to reduce the need for young people to buy cars and help people switch to public transport.By driving positive change through technology, travel apps help create a more sustainable and efficient transport infrastructure, enabling a smoother transition to lower carbon-impact travel, within the UK and beyond.Book travel in and across 45 countries today with Trainline, Europe’s leading train and coach app"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58c0f14c375f014dbb2e32b4cec28918b11daf77/227_320_4836_2902/master/4836.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eeeecb8be7305c2efcd9f68dd033bfb7","title":"rail adventures five scenic european journeys to savour","story":"With train travel often more sustainable than driving or flying, now’s the time to leave the car at home. Swap the road for the rails, as Nick Inman provides some of the best train trips in the UK and mainland EuropeRail’s sustainability credentials mean it’s a no-brainer to swap the stress of the airport and traffic jams for the more scenic and greener option. With Europe’s extensive rail network ready to take you directly from city centre to city centre or guide you through some of the best scenery on offer, forget flying or driving, hop on the train. You could stay in Britain and explore unfamiliar parts of the country you don’t normally get to see, or you could take the Eurostar from London to mainland Europe and connect with an international system of high-speed trains and quaint branch lines.Rail is convenient, competitively priced and environmentally friendly. It’s also a reminder that travel is as much about the journey as the destination. It allows you to slow down and think.What are you waiting for?Here are five routes – two at home, three abroad – to get you started. All can be booked through Trainline’s app or website.Glasgow to Mallaig via Fort WilliamIf you want to get kids used to travelling by train, take them north to see the magnificent curving viaduct of Glenfinnan, which is used to carry the Hogwarts Express in the Harry Potter films. The West Highland line is regularly described as one of the most scenic in the British Isles, if not the world (beating even the Trans-Siberian), being a procession of mouthwatering lochs, moors and mountains. From Mallaig you can take ferries to several of the islands of the Inner Hebrides.Getting to Glasgow: you have a choice of trains from London (or other mainline stations in Britain).Typical journey time: Glasgow to Mallaig, 5 hours 16 minutes direct.Nice (Provence, France) to Pisa (Tuscany, Italy)Steep wooded hills tumble into the sea all along the beautiful coast of Liguria from the French border near Ventimiglia to the ancient port city of Genoa and beyond. This trip makes a relaxing way to get to Tuscany along the Riviera. If you are tempted to break up the journey, you may want to visit the resorts of San Remo or Portofino, or one of the dramatically sited and colourful towns of the Cinque Terre.Getting to Nice: take the Eurostar and change at Paris Gare du NordParis Gare de Lyon.Typical journey time: 6 hours 30 minutes, with one or two changes at Ventimiglia andor Genova.Vienna to Klagenfurt via the Semmering PassThis trans-Alpine line was built in 1854 to link the capital of imperial Austria with the Mediterranean. It was a huge engineering achievement and set the standard for mountain railways, for which it has been declared a world heritage site. Take a seat on the left side of the train by preference. The views are superb as you cross the 895-metre (2,900 ft) Semmering Pass, the highlight of the journey. You can extend your trip via Villach to reach Venice: travelling from central to southern Europe in one exhilarating journey.To get to Vienna: take the Eurostar and change at Brussels and Frankfurt.Typical journey time: Vienna to Klagenfurt, 3 hours 55 minutes direct.Leeds to Carlisle via SettleIt has been described as the line that should never have been built, being a technical challenge that was financially ruinous and costly in the lives of navvies. When it was threatened with closure in the 1980s, the Settle-Carlisle line was rediscovered by train lovers, day-trippers and hill walkers and given a second life. Leaving industrial West Yorkshire, climb into the Yorkshire Dales national park via the Ribblehead viaduct to reach the highest mainline station in England, Dent, at an altitude of 350 metres (1,150 ft). Great views of the austere Pennines are guaranteed.Getting to Leeds: there are plenty of high-speed mainline trains from London.Typical journey time: Leeds to Carlisle, 2 hours 40 minutes direct.Cologne to MainzFancy a river cruise through the Rhine Gorge – only, by train? There are railway lines on both banks of the river, giving splendid views of the gorge, which stretches for 40 miles between Koblenz and Bingen. The east bank line is more scenic, but not as well-serviced as the western side, which has a wider choice of trains – so take the west-bank mainline through Bonn. Or, if you don’t mind taking a slightly more circuitous route, you could go down one and back up the other. Either way, en route are innumerable magnificent castles – whether real, mock or ruined – and pretty villages with half-timbered houses.To get to Cologne: take the Eurostar from London St Pancras and change at Brussels.Typical journey time: Cologne to Mainz, 1 hour 40 minutes.Journey times and ticket prices vary according to which particular options you choose.Ticket to rideIt is easy to book the train for your next adventure.

The proposal, while limited to remote areas in South America and to married men already ordained as deacons in the church, is seen by many as setting a precedent that could bring an end to the restriction on married Catholic priests throughout the world.The proposals were contained in a final document approved yesterday at the end of a three-week synod on the Amazon held at the Vatican. The synod was called by Pope Francis in 2017 to focus attention on saving the rainforest and better ministering to its indigenous peoples.The document approved by the bishops noted that people of Catholic faith in the region have “enormous difficulties” in receiving communion and seeing a priest. It proposed to “ordain priests suitable and esteemed men of the community”, who had already had “fruitful” experiences as deacons and who “receive an adequate formation for the priesthood, having a legitimately constituted and stable family”.The celibate priesthood has been a tradition since the 11th century, imposed in part for financial reasons to ensure priests’ assets pass to the church and not to their heirs. Married priests are permitted in some eastern Catholic churches as well as where married Anglican priests have converted.Reformers say the change is crucial to meet the needs of the pan-Amazonian region but acknowledge it could lead to similar reforms elsewhere. Shortages of priests are so bad that some Amazon communities go months without a proper mass.Speaking afterwards, the pope said he would reopen the work of a 2016 commission that studied the issue of women deacons. He promised that the Vatican would continue to study the role of women in the early years of the church. “We still haven’t grasped the significance of women in the church. Their role must go well beyond questions of function,” he said.Some conservatives and traditionalists warn that any papal opening to married priests or women deacons would lead the church to ruin. They accused the synod organisers, and even the pope himself, of heresy for even considering flexibility on mandatory priestly celibacy.The celibacy idea was supported 128-41 by the bishops. The report noted that some participants wanted a more “universal approach”, suggesting support for married priests elsewhere in the world.The pope, who is from Argentina, has long said he appreciates the discipline and the gift of celibacy, but that it can change, given that it is not doctrine.Bishops in the Amazon say Protestant and evangelical churches are wooing away Catholic souls in the absence of vibrant communities where the Eucharist can be regularly celebrated."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/680a765db8e2bebf7a8efa2f95796c8536c63d31/0_257_3107_1863/master/3107.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3cbad3e6e9698ba958a8678ce522bb19","title":"peru student roxana quispe collantes thesis inca language quechua","story":"A doctoral student in Peru has made history by becoming the first person to write and defend a thesis in Quechua – the language of the Incas, which is still spoken by millions of people in the Andes.Roxana Quispe Collantes received top marks from Lima’s San Marcos university, the oldest in the Americas, for her study on Peruvian and Latin American literature, which focused on poetry written in Quechua.Scholars say it is the first time in the university’s 468-year history that a student has written and defended a thesis (answering questions from examiners) entirely in the native language – even though it is the most widely spoken indigenous tongue in South America, used by about 8 million people, half of them in Peru.Beginning her presentation with a traditional thanksgiving ceremony using coca leaves and the corn-made alcoholic drink chicha, she presented her study titled Yawar Para, or blood rain.“It has been a long road but it was worth it,” said Quispe Collantes, who travelled to highland communities in the Canas to verify words used in the Collao dialect of the language used in the Cusco region. “I’ve always wanted to study in Quechua, in my original language,” she told the Observer. Quispe Collantes grew up speaking Quechua with her parents and grandparents in the Acomayo district of Cusco.Her seven-year investigation focused on the Quechua poetry of Andrés Alencastre Gutiérrez (1909-84), a landowner from Cusco who wrote under the pen name Kilku Warak’aq. She analysed his work and the combining of Andean traditions and Catholicism.“Quechua doesn’t lack the vocabulary for an academic language. Today many people mix the language with Spanish,” she said.“I hope my example will help to revalue the language again and encourage young people, especially women, to follow my path. It’s very important that we keep on rescuing our original language.”Quispe Collantes’s doctoral adviser Gonzalo Espino said her presentation was hugely symbolic because the language “represented the most humble people in this part of the world: the Andeans, who were once called ‘Indians’. Their language and culture has been vindicated.”Peru has joined a global effort to register indigenous names as part of the United Nations International Year of Indigenous Languages, which is trying to help revive 2,680 at-risk indigenous languages around the world – 21 of which are native to Peru."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Donal de Buitl\u0026eacuteir says luck has played a part in getting him to the starting line for 40 yearsTwo men tied up were not injured but were left terrified after their ordeal on SaturdayMoroccan athlete posts time of 2:08:05 as Ireland\u0026rsquos Stephen Scullion takes secondBishop Fintan Gavin speaks following loss of 320 staff at Novartis Ringaskiddy plantLorry driver Maurice Robinson (25) grew up in the Co Armagh town and still lives nearbyParty members sure of Johnson\u0026rsquos need for them to support Brexit deal in parliamentEamonn Harrison appeared on foot of bench warrant for assault and criminal damagePolice are investigating whether deaths of 39 migrants are part of \u0026lsquowider conspiracy\u0026rsquoRisk of icy patches developing alongside ground frost in some areas overnightDUP \u0027willing to support a sensible Brexit deal\u0027 but \u0027not at any price\u0027, says DoddsFamily said the specially adapted wheelchair was Kyle\u0026rsquos (6) only mode of transportParty leader tells conference DUP is open to doing a deal on the Irish languageOliver O\u0026rsquoGrady previously jailed for possessing nearly 280,000 child pornography imagesSiptu members are in dispute over working conditions and union recognitionGreen Flag awards for parks are judged by experts and assessed on eight strict criteriaToo often DUP has played into its \u0026lsquoenemies\u0026rsquo hands\u0026rsquo, says Emma Little-PengellyMoney was found during intelligence-led searches in north Dublin this weekAssaults on Mary Manning by Sean McDarby lead to the births of her five childrenThree further Irish suspects detained by Essex policeState engagement with local communities on hosting and direct provision to be studied"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4064111.1572176174!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dublin marathon el goumri wins in record time","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            Othmane El Goumri crosses the line to win the Dublin Marathon.

Dr Donal de Buitléir has run every marathon over the last 39 years and is a member of select “39 club”.This afternoon, all going well, he will join the 40 club.There are 13 members of in the 39 club, according to sports journalist Sean McGoldrick in his new recently published book The Dublin Marathon - Celebrating 40 Years.These 13 runners received special medals to mark their achievement before the start of this year’s marathon.There used to be more than 20, but age and injury have taken some and others have gone to the great starting line in the sky.Being part of that elite club would be enough accomplishment for many people, but Dr de Buitléir also has a professional life of success in both the public and private sectors.He turned 70 in August, but the only slowing down he is doing is in relation to his marathon times which have got progressively slower since he ran the first one in 1980.His CV is a marathon read in itself. He has been a senior civil servant in the Department of Finance, an Eisenhower fellow, a director of an Atlantic Philanthropies think-tank, publicpolicy.ie, and a member of the HSE board.In January he took over as the acting director-general of the Institute of International and European Affairs (IIEA). He is also the chairman of the Low Pay Commission.In the last month he has appeared in front of two Oireachtas committees, the first on low pay, the other as the chair of a Government-appointed group looking into private activity in public hospitals.He was 30 before he ran his first marathon.“A few of us used to go down from the Department of Economic Planning at lunchtime and we shared a dressing room with Noel Carroll (former Dublin Corporation spokesman, Olympic runner and marathon founder). Nobody had even heard of the marathon at the time,” he said.“I thought, ‘how can anybody even run 10 miles?’. I started training. It’s extraordinary the limits you put on yourself. If I had discovered running earlier and trained properly, I could have been quite good.”He ran his first marathon in 3 hours and 26 minutes. His fastest time was 2 hours 56 minutes in 1985. His slowest time is 5 hours and 29 minutes. Last year he finished the marathon in 5 hours 10 minutes.It is an extraordinary feat of endurance and durability to be able to participate and then finish the Dublin marathon. “Getting to the starting line without being injured says something about your luck. I never did enough training to get injured,” he says smiling.“It’s not the taking part that counts,” he states, “but the finishing even if it means limping home.” One year he pulled a muscle with 10 kilometres to go.“If you crawl, you must finish.”How does he get time to prepare for marathons? He doesn’t, he says, and only gets out to run in the Phoenix Park at weekends. In the last 10 weeks, he has done 100 miles. “It’s not enough, I’m busy. I’m doing too many things. At my age you should run every second day,” he says.Nevertheless, he approached the start line with a mixture of excitement and trepidation. His four children will be there at mile 23 to cheer him on. “You try and get into a rhythm. The crowd are great. They keep you going. You’re just like a boxer - one last fight.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4057998.1571674594!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the irish times most nominated in newsbrands shortlist 2019","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tRosita Boland with her trophy at the 2018 Newsbrands Ireland journalism awards Photograph: Simon CarswellThe  has received 32 nominations in the shortlist for the NewsBrands Journalism Awards 2019 – the highest number for a publication in this year’s competition.The NewsBrands Journalism Awards are open to any work published in print, website, online, mobile, video, audio or any other news delivery format from any NewsBrands Ireland member title.Five of the six journalists shortlisted in the Foreign Coverage category write for The : Sally Hayden Derek Scally Suzanne Lynch Lara Marlowe and Patrick Freyne.The  received four of the six nominations for Best Use of Video, citing the work of Simon Carswell, Kathleen Harris, Enda O’Dowd and Bryan O’Brien.Jack Power of The  was nominated in three categories Business Story of the Year Investigative Journalism and Young Journalist of the Year.  reporter Sarah Burns was also shortlisted as Young Journalist of the Year as was current  reporter Shauna Bowers for her past work at The Times, Ireland edition.Markets Correspondent Joe Brennan is shortlisted for Business Journalist of the Year.In the Campaigning Journalism category, The ’ No Child campaign has been shortlisted.Fintan O’Toole and Hilary Fannin are both nominated in the Broadsheet Columnist category, while in the Critic of the Year category The  has four writers shortlisted: Catherine Cleary Patrick Freyne Niamh Donnelly and Fintan O’Toole.Three  writers are shortlisted in the Features Broadsheet Writer of the Year: Rosita Boland, Conor Gallagher and Conor Pope.Carl O’Brien is nominated, along with Power, in the Investigative Journalism category.

Photograph: REUTERSRemo Casillifile photoA summit of Roman Catholic bishops meeting at the Vatican recommended Saturday that Pope Francis allow the ordination of married men as priests in the Amazon region. The move would lift a roughly 1,000-year-old restriction and potentially revolutionise the priesthood.It is the first time a grouping of bishops convened by a pope has endorsed such a historic change to the tradition of a celibate priesthood. The proposal is limited to remote areas of South America where there is a scarcity of priests but could set a precedent for easing the restriction on married priests throughout the world.If Francis, who has already signalled an openness on the issue, accepts the bishops’ recommendation, he will turn the remote areas of the Amazon region into a laboratory for a Catholic Church looking to the global south for its future, with married priests and indigenous rites mixing with traditional liturgy.The pope is expected to respond to the proposals by the end of this year. The final document of the summit, noting that many of the faithful in the Amazon region have “enormous difficulties” in receiving communion and seeing a priest, proposed to “ordain priests suitable and esteemed men of the community,” who had already had “fruitful” experiences as deacons and who “receive an adequate formation for the priesthood, having a legitimately constituted and stable family.”“No priest is ordained without first being a deacon,” Cardinal Michael Czerny said at a news conference Saturday night. He characterised the proposals as a great “pastoral change” for the church. Liberal supporters said the change would address the unmet needs of a far-flung community and they expressed hope it would lead to similar changes elsewhere. Conservative opponents called it a threat to the tradition of the priesthood, another troubling sign Francis was willing to dilute the faith to pursue a more inclusive, but less pure church.The proposal came from the Special Assembly of the Synod of Bishops for the Pan-Amazon Region, a three-week meeting of bishops dedicated to “new paths” in the Amazon that has covered topics as varied as the environment and the possible ordination of women as deacons.The bishops did not vote to allow women to become deacons in the church, a change that, if accepted by Francis, would have had significant theological repercussions. Instead, Francis said in remarks to the bishops after Saturday evening’s vote that the Vatican would continue to study the role of women in the early years of the church. “We still haven’t grasped the significance of women in the church,” he said. “Their role must go well beyond questions of function.” The pope convened the bishops to find ways to defend the rights, natural resources and cultures of the 2.5 million indigenous people spread across the nine countries – Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, Brazil, Guyana, Suriname and French Guiana – that constitute the Amazon region. - New York Times "},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Trump set to make a \u0026lsquomajor statement\u0026rsquo amid reports Baghdadi has been killedSecurity forces lobbed tear gas to try to disperse demonstrators in BaghdadArmy fire into the air during incident with demonstrators near TripoliSupporters clash with anti-government protesters, forcing riot police to interveneDemonstrators march towards Baghdad\u0026rsquos Green Zone as they rally against corruptionMichel Aoun makes televised appeal as banks remain closed for seventh day\u0026lsquoAll the countries betrayed us...How could they leave us?

Photograph: AL-FURQAN MEDIAAFP via Getty Images Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was believed to have been killed in a US military operation in Syria, sources in Syria, Iraq and Iran said on Sunday, as US president Donald Trump prepared to make a “major statement”.A US official told Reuters Baghdadi was targeted in the overnight raid but was unable to say whether the operation was successful.A commander of one of the militant factions in the northwestern Syrian province of Idlib said Baghdadi was believed to have been killed in a raid after midnight on Saturday involving helicopters, warplanes and a ground clash in the village of Brisha near the Turkish border.Two Iraqi security sources and two Iranian officials said they had received confirmation from inside Syria that Baghdadi had been killed.“Iran was informed about Baghdadi’s death by Syrian officials who got it from the field,” one of the officials said.Newsweek, which first reported the news, said it had been told by a US Army official briefed on the raid that Baghdadi was dead. It said the operation was carried out by special operations forces after receiving “actionable intelligence”.The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.A White House spokesman said late on Saturday Mr Trump would make a “major statement” on Sunday.The president gave an indication that something was afoot earlier on Saturday night when he tweeted without explanation, “Something very big has just happened!”Mr Trump has faced heavy criticism from both Republicans and Democrats alike for his US troop withdrawal from northeastern Syria, which permitted Turkey to attack America’s Kurdish allies.Many critics of his Syria pullout have expressed worries that it would lead Islamic State, also known as Isis, to regain strength and pose a threat to US interests. For days, US officials had feared Islamic State would seek to capitalise on the upheaval in Syria. But they also saw a potential opportunity, in which Islamic State leaders might break from more secretive routines to communicate with operatives, potentially creating a chance for the United States and its allies to detect them.Baghdadi was long thought to hiding somewhere along the Iraq-Syria border. He has led the group since 2010, when it was still an underground al-Qaeda offshoot in Iraq.On September 16th, Islamic State’s media network issued a 30-minute audio message purporting to come from Baghdadi, in which he said operations were taking place daily and called on supporters to free women jailed in camps in Iraq and Syria over their alleged links to his group.In the audio message, Baghdadi also said the United States and its proxies had been defeated in Iraq and Afghanistan, and that the United States had been “dragged” into Mali and Niger.At the height of its power Islamic State ruled over millions of people in territory running from northern Syria through towns and villages along the Tigris and Euphrates valleys to the outskirts of the Iraqi capital Baghdad.But the fall in 2017 of Mosul and Raqqa, its strongholds in Iraq and Syria respectively, stripped Baghdadi, an Iraqi, of the trappings of a caliph and turned him into a fugitive thought to be moving along the desert border between Iraq and Syria.US air strikes killed most of his top lieutenants, and before Islamic State published a video message of Baghdadi in April there had been conflicting reports over whether he was alive.Despite losing its last significant territory, Islamic State is believed to have sleeper cells around the world, and some fighters operate from the shadows in Syria’s desert and Iraq’s cities. – Reuters"},{"url":null,"title":"baghdadis appearance shows may no longer beislamic states caliph","story":"The last time Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi appeared on camera was the summer of 2014, when from the pulpit of a mosque in Mosul he declared himself “caliph” of the first modern-day caliphate.His fiefdom, known as the Islamic State, would cover huge swathes of Iraq and Syria and more than 8 million people.In the intervening years he has released only a handful of audio statements, but on Monday he appeared for the first time on video.The timing of the release - which is a huge risk for the reclusive leader to take - is interesting.With no caliphate to rule over since the fall of the last of Isil’s territory last month, his role had become unclear.Baghdadi’s absence had earned him some criticism from...To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

The company received a further 3,000 complaints in the first half of this year.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Responsible lending is much needed in these difficult times for the UK economy.”David Fisher, chief executive of Cash Euro Net’s parent company Enova International, blamed the FOS for QuickQuid’s collapse.“Over the past year and a half, we have experienced a challenging and uncertain regulatory environment in the UK, despite the fact that the FCA reviewed and approved our business practices and affordability criteria in 2015,” he said.“The FOS has continued to move the goalposts with its complaints handling decisions, in effect setting ever-changing de facto policies that in many instances was inconsistent with FCA guidelines.”People who have outstanding loans with QuickQuid are advised to continue making repayments as normal.“If you miss any repayments you could be hit by fees and additional charges, and it could also harm your credit rating,” said Caroline Siarkiewicz, acting chief executive at the Money and Pensions Service.“Eleven and a half million adults have less than £100 in savings and investments so lots of people face cash-flow problems which can make quick, short-term credit feel like the only option.\u0026nbsp“If you know you need a specific amount of money for a short while there may be more affordable alternatives out there, so it’s a good idea to shop around before you borrow.”The Money Advice Service website has a guide on alternatives to payday loans, and you can also contact a free helpline on 0800 138 7777Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The message was clear - without new financing WeWork would run out of money within weeks.“Do you still believe in the company?” Neumann, who had stepped down as chief executive but was still WeWork\u0027s chairman, asked a room of JPMorgan bankers on the 42nd floor of their midtown Manhattan headquarters on 6 October, the sources said.The JPMorgan bankers, led by asset and wealth management chief executive Mary Erdoes and debt capital markets head Jim Casey, told Neumann and other WeWork directors they would back the company, and were confident they could raise the money. But they would not underwrite the deal on the spot, as one board member requested.With questions swirling around WeWork\u0027s chances of survival in the wake of its failed IPO, the bankers told Neumann they needed some time to sound out investors first, according to the sources.Created with Sketch.Tech giants to be hit by new tax in France Show all 7Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Amazon reported revenue of $232 billion worldwide in 2018Google\u0027s parent company reported revenue of $136 billion worldwide in 2018Apple reported revenue of $265 billion worldwide in 2018Facebook reported revenue of $55 billion worldwide in 2018Microsoft reported revenue of $110 billion worldwide in 2018Cisco reported revenue of $49 billion worldwide in 2018Criteo reported revenue of $2.3 billion worldwide in 2018Amazon reported revenue of $232 billion worldwide in 2018Google\u0027s parent company reported revenue of $136 billion worldwide in 2018Apple reported revenue of $265 billion worldwide in 2018Facebook reported revenue of $55 billion worldwide in 2018Microsoft reported revenue of $110 billion worldwide in 2018Cisco reported revenue of $49 billion worldwide in 2018Criteo reported revenue of $2.3 billion worldwide in 2018A few days later, an alternative rescue plan began to emerge from WeWork\u0027s largest shareholder, Japan\u0027s SoftBank.Both were far from perfect. But given its dire straits, WeWork was fortunate to have a choice.This account of how WeWork\u0027s financial rescue came together over the past three weeks is based on interviews with eight people with knowledge of the negotiations. They requested anonymity to discuss the confidential deliberations.WeWork, SoftBank and JPMorgan declined to comment for this story.Requests for an interview with Neumann were also declined.SoftBank offered $9.5bn\u0026nbspto WeWork, including new debt and recommitted equity, as well as a tender offer to partly cash out Neumann and other shareholders.In addition to providing more funds than JPMorgan, the SoftBank deal resolved what some WeWork directors privately referred to as the company\u0027s “corporate governance problem” - Neumann\u0027s controlling grip.SoftBank\u0027s deal would strip Neumann\u0027s voting power and remove him from the board. Neumann was blamed by other WeWork investors such as Benchmark Capital and China\u0027s Hony Capital, for the company\u0027s precipitous decline, some of the people said.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Others had only one vote for every share.WeWork staff outraged at former CEO’s payout while they face job cutsIt was clear to SoftBank, as well as to a special board committee formed to consider the financing plans, that Neumann relinquishing control would come with a price tag, three of the people said.In meetings in New York between Neumann and SoftBank Chief Operating Officer Marcelo Claure, the contours of a side deal came together. SoftBank would provide a $500 million credit line to refinance Neumann\u0027s personal borrowings made against WeWork\u0027s stock, as long as he used proceeds from cashing out up to $970m of his shares to repay SoftBank for that loan first.SoftBank\u0027s latest offer valued the company at as little as $5.9bn based on the repricing of warrants it was already committed to exercise, according to Bernstein research, a far cry from the $47 billion it had assigned to WeWork in January.Neumann\u0027s special pay-off did not stop there. He negotiated with SoftBank a four-year non-compete agreement with a $185 million “consulting fee” in return for stepping down from WeWork\u0027s board. He would now only get to observe board proceedings instead of participating.WeWork\u0027s special board committee members expressed concern that Neumann\u0027s bailout would cause outrage among many WeWork employees whose stock options had a much higher strike price than the valuation in SoftBank\u0027s tender offer, some of the people said.The committee declined to comment for this article.SoftBank\u0027s offer to buy up to $3bn of WeWork stock from employees and existing shareholders would value the company at about $8 billion, higher than the new valuation based on the warrants.Neumann attempted to push up the valuation of the tender offer in his negotiations with SoftBank, one of the people said.SoftBank stood firm. Anticipating criticism from its own shareholders for possibly throwing good money after bad, it wasn\u0027t prepared to pay more.Most WeWork directors wanted Neumann off the board, and many minority shareholders, which the special committee was formed to represent, wanted to cash out, the people said.Goldman Sachs profit hit by losses on investments in WeWork and UberWeWork\u0027s nosee is proof Adam Neumann can\u0027t walk on waterAs WeWork embraces big business, will it lose its cool?JPMorgan had not pursued raising additional money for shareholders, in part because WeWork only tasked the bank with delivering $5 billion of debt financing.When the bank submitted the debt package on Monday, only private equity firm Starwood Capital Group, run by real estate mogul Barry Sternlicht, had committed to join JPMorgan in sharing the financing burden.JPMorgan agreed to provide the rest and transfer the money by Thursday. But the deal also included a condition, known as a covenant, that would trigger a debt default if SoftBank did not make good on $1.5 billion that it had already committed to provide when warrants came due next April, the people said.JPMorgan wanted to ensure SoftBank would honour its financial commitment, which would lessen the risk for investors holding debt that would one day need to be repaid.But SoftBank told WeWork\u0027s board that it would not pay the $1.5bn if its financing offer was rejected, two of the people added.The problem from SoftBank\u0027s perspective was that those warrants were based on January\u0027s $47bn valuation of WeWork. It wanted to change the pricing radically to reflect WeWork\u0027s dramatic fall in value.JPMorgan dealmakers, on the other hand, believed WeWork\u0027s contract with SoftBank prevented the telecommunications and technology giant from reneging on that earlier commitment, other people familiar with the matter said.In the end, the risk that SoftBank wouldn\u0027t fulfill its commitment if the JPMorgan financing package was chosen helped swing the special committee\u0027s deliberations in favor of SoftBank\u0027s offer, they added.SoftBank had made WeWork an offer it had to accept.On Tuesday, SoftBank unveiled a deal that increased its ownership of WeWork to 80 per cent\u0026nbspfrom 30 per cent, but sought to avoid having to consolidate WeWork\u0027s liabilities on its balance sheet by not taking full control of the expanded board. SoftBank will only have 5 of the 10 seats.But unless SoftBank can turn WeWork around quickly, it could be a pyrrhic victory.WeWork has burned through almost $2.5bn\u0026nbspof cash since the end of June, and Claure will have to cut costs quickly, including slashing thousands of jobs and helping the company to find a way to get out of expensive leases. Otherwise, the new cash injection may not last long enough to stabilise the business.As predicted, Claure is also facing some staff anger over the size of Neumann\u0027s payout. He told employees on Wednesday that it was the “price” that had to be paid to get rid of Neumann\u0027s voting rights. Otherwise, he said, “Adam could do whatever he wanted.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

In fact, that’s how the story started until I decided to take a totally different turn, and I am exceptionally pleased that I did. I like writing about people finding themselves in mildly unusual situations.”Aciman explained: “An adolescent girl and adolescent boy presented a situation that was quite ordinary. But an adolescent drawn to someone of his same sex presented all manner of psychological hurdles, and that is what I love to write about.”\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.25 books that should have never been made into films Show all 26Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Dune was never going to be an easy book to turn into a two-hour action movie – and David Lynch’s attempt is proof that it should be best left alone. The director\u0027s adaptation is a nonsensical, deeply convoluted disaster that wastes an enjoyably oddball cast. It\u0027s the only one of Lynch\u0027s films the director has publicly disowned. Still, hopes are high that next year’s version from Arrival director Denis Villeneuve, starring Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya, will somehow be better.  326 The Bonfire of the Vanities (1990)Fresh off the success of bestselling novel The Bonfire of the Vanities, Warner Bros bought the rights from Tom Wolfe for a staggering $750,000. Tom Hanks and Melanie Griffiths were both (mis)cast in the lead roles after director Brian De Palma\u0027s preferred choices turned him down. The filmmaker himself struggled to spin the 1990 production\u0027s many plates amid reports of rising on-set troubles that were all witnessed and documented in Julie Salmon\u0027s follow-up book, The Devil\u0027s Candy.1991 gangster film Billy Bathgate, which stars Dustin Hoffman and Nicole Kidman, did no justice to EL Doctorow\u0027s beloved 1989 novel. With the efforts of Oscar-winning Kramer vs Kramer director Robert Benton and a script by Tom Stoppard, the film had all the ingredients to become as good as The Godfather, Scarface, and Goodfellas. Instead, it was a hollow adaptation, largely because all the magic was lost with the absence of the central character\u0027s narration – a huge reason behind the novel\u0027s success.The Scarlet Letter (1995) is ranked as one of the worst book adaptations ever made and for good reason. Described by DH Lawrence as “a perfect work of the American imagination, the book was handed a Hollywood makeover that found itself the brunt of ridicule after flopping at the box office. Director Roland Joffé strayed so far from Nathaniel Hawthorne\u0027s pages that what should have been an enticing romance became an extremely throwaway erotic drama.  To be fair, few would be able to turn L Ron Hubbard’s allegedly Scientology-inspired Battlefield Earth (2000) into something decent. This John Travolta-with-dreadlocks epic has since gone down in “Worst Movies Ever” infamy, effectively ending Travolta’s mainstream movie career and destroying Barry Pepper’s before it even started.  Louis de Bernières\u0027s Captain Corelli\u0027s Mandolin was one of the biggest literary successes of the 1990s, but the 2001 film version – from the same British company that made Notting Hill – lost all traces of the novel\u0027s heart and soul. The dialogue is disastrous and lead stars Nicolas Cage (Captain Corelli) and Penélope Cruz (Pelagia) lack any chemistry. It may look pretty, but this adaptation was a complete mistake.  The beauty of HG Wells’s 1895 science fiction novella The Time Machine was lost amid all the CGI in this insipid 2002 adaptation, which was directed by Wells\u0027s great-grandson, Simon. Everything featured, including Guy Pearce\u0027s lead performance, is wooden apart from the copper time travel contraption at the heart of the story.There have been just as many disappointing Stephen King adaptations as there have been successful ones, but Dreamcatcher sits at the bottom of that list. The talent was present (Damian Lewis! Morgan Freeman! Timothy Olyphant!), but the end product never once correlates to anything at all decent. The film\u0027s late-stage swerve into monster movie territory is nothing short of dreadful.Before he took on the role of 007, Daniel Craig starred in this adaptation of Ian McEwan’s novel about people whose lives become entangled after witnessing a deadly accident. While Craig’s performance as college lecturer Joe, along with Rhys Ifans as Jed – the man who becomes obsessed with him – are convincing, the film allows little time for character development and suffers because of it.Nick Hornby adaptations don’t inherently need to be set in the UK (the John Cusack-starring High Fidelity, if you like that sort of thing, is something of a classic, after all), but they do need to translate the fussy, infuriating male neuroses of his novels. The Perfect Catch is the 2005 US adaptation of Hornby’s Fever Pitch, released a decade after Colin Firth starred in his own British adaptation, and transforms the source material into a more throwaway and uninteresting big-city romcom. Drew Barrymore, in a \u0027girlfriend’ role significantly beefed up in comparison to Hornby’s novel, is great, but watching her try and source chemistry with a shrill and unappealing Jimmy Fallon (in one of his rare, pre-talk show acting roles) is harrowing.The Da Vinci Code is a stinker of the highest order. Its sequels, Angels \u0026amp Demons (2009) and Inferno (2016), are also awful films, but the reason the initial Dan Brown adaptation ranks as the worst is because the others wouldn\u0027t have existed had this one not been so successful.20th Century Fox clearly wanted Eragon to be their answer to Harry Potter, but the terrible reviews stopped that plan dead in its tracks. Eragon is the worst kind of fantasy adaptation – one where all of the source materials\u0027 sense of fantastical vibrancy disappears during its translation to the big screen.1426 Running with Scissors (2006)Augusten Burroughs’s Running with Scissors consistently walks a dangerous tightrope between manic farce and adolescent horror tale. Ryan Murphy’s adaptation, released in 2006, collapses beneath such a task. You can see why Murphy, for his feature film debut, would be attracted to a tale of neurotic family dysfunction and sexual awakening as they are themes that crop up in many of his TV shows (Glee, American Horror Story, etc). But this adaptation is a tonal misfire from start to finish, despite the best efforts of an all-star cast that includes Annette Bening, Gwyneth Paltrow, Evan Rachel Wood and Brian Cox. It’s no wonder this sunk without a trace. In another case of Hollywood throwing money at something in the belief that will be enough, Philip Pullman’s superb His Dark Materials trilogy – or rather, the first book Northern Lights – was condensed into an agonising mess of CGI and hammy acting in 2007\u0027s The Golden Compass. Much of the blame went to the fact that Hollywood, where God is thanked above anyone else at the Oscars, would likely be uncomfortable handling material that was so critical of the Catholic church. It also suffered by trying to condense an overwhelming amount of information into the opening few scenes. A forthcoming BBC adaptation starring James McAvoy and Lin-Manuel Miranda looks far more promising.Where to start with this disaster of a film? Audrey Niffenegger’s The Time Traveller\u0027s Wife is beautifully and convincingly written, but there\u0027s nothing convincing about its adaptation. Producers thought casting two major Hollywood stars was a good idea, but Rachel McAdams and Eric Bana had zero chemistry. Cloud Atlas (2012) is by no means a disaster, but it\u0027s meandering plot lines, sketchy pacing and often questionable acting (Hanks has never been dodgier) do David Mitchell\u0027s sprawling, inventive novel a disservice. Still, it\u0027s an enjoyable Wachowskis romp that features Hugh Grant as a cannibal tribesman, so it has that going for it.Fans of The Hobbit did not expect the novel, so short and sweet and set in such a familiar and adored world, to be messed up by The Lord of the Rings maestro Peter Jackson – but that’s exactly what happened. While the trilogy of Hobbit films were a box-office success, they came under fire from critics for stretching the book\u0027s material too thin. Third outing, The Battle of Five Armies, was the worst received of all three.  The film adaptation of the profoundly moving and dark tale The Book Thief, which follows a young girl in Nazi Germany, is tonally off from the first scene. The glossy cinematography and excessively sentimental score jar with its grim subject matter and the performances verge on caricature. It doesn\u0027t help that all of the English dialogue is spoken with a German accent.No adaptation of The Great Gatsby,  F Scott Fitzgerald’s most famous work, has managed to capture the excess, glamour and underlying sleaze of the roaring Twenties. Baz Luhrmann\u0027s 2013 version was fun and arguably the best at revealing the insecurities of (a brilliant) Leonardo DiCaprio’s Gatsby. However, the flashiness of the production stripped away all of Fitzgerald’s delicate story-telling.Disgraced producer Harvey Weinstein’s fingerprints are all over this messy adaptation of Young Adult novel The Giver (2014), which attempts to fuse a sincere, thoughtful allegory with a Twilight-style love story backed up by action fresh from The Hunger Games  and a Taylor Swift cameo. By attempting to appeal to every single teenager all at once, though, The Giver loses sight of its fascinating dystopian premise and gives its eccentric cast (among them Jeff Bridges, Meryl Streep, Alexander Skarsgård and Katie Holmes) very little to do.  John Niven\u0027s Kill Your Friends is a blistering, debauched exploration into the life of a cocaine-sniffing record label agent. It passes by in the blink of an eye, which can\u0027t be said for its adaptation. The film, released in 2015, tries so hard to nail what Niven achieves so fluidly and it shows – the result is nothing short of embarrassing with the clean-cut Nicholas Hoult failing to convince as the sociopathic Steven Stelfox.2326 The Girl on the Train (2016)Although it will always exist in the shadow of Gillian Flynn’s ingenious thriller Gone Girl, The Girl on the Train is an undeniably pacy and intelligent novel. But it was completely let down by this US film adaptation. The 2016 release, starring Emily Blunt, is cheesy and lacking in nuance – and criminally takes the story away from its original gritty London setting, plonking the characters down in glossy New York for no apparent reason. The 2016 adaptation of Me Before You, starring Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin, was brutally panned by critics for being emotionally manipulative. Its bad acting and problematic premise didn\u0027t help, either. Clarke\u0027s performance as the paid companion to Claflin’s quadriplegic was in particular criticised for being offensively exaggerated.  While not the same calibre of flop as Dreamcatcher, The Dark Tower is a fine example of a botched attempt at adapting one of Stephen King\u0027s finest works. With Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey in the lead roles as the heroic and villainous characters caught in a fated tussle, it should have soared – but a rush job such as Nikolaj Arcel\u0027s 2017 film is no way to treat such an expansive piece of work. Despite magnetic performances from Saoirse Ronan and Billy Howle, this adaptation of Ian McEwan\u0027s On Chesil Beach was weighed down by a turgid script and clumsy old-age make-up. The finished product is worlds away from the McEwan adaptation that Ronan previously starred in –\u0026nbspthe Oscar-winning drama Atonement (2007).Dune was never going to be an easy book to turn into a two-hour action movie – and David Lynch’s attempt is proof that it should be best left alone.

Much of the blame went to the fact that Hollywood, where God is thanked above anyone else at the Oscars, would likely be uncomfortable handling material that was so critical of the Catholic church. It also suffered by trying to condense an overwhelming amount of information into the opening few scenes. A forthcoming BBC adaptation starring James McAvoy and Lin-Manuel Miranda looks far more promising.Where to start with this disaster of a film? Audrey Niffenegger’s The Time Traveller\u0027s Wife is beautifully and convincingly written, but there\u0027s nothing convincing about its adaptation. Producers thought casting two major Hollywood stars was a good idea, but Rachel McAdams and Eric Bana had zero chemistry. Cloud Atlas (2012) is by no means a disaster, but it\u0027s meandering plot lines, sketchy pacing and often questionable acting (Hanks has never been dodgier) do David Mitchell\u0027s sprawling, inventive novel a disservice. Still, it\u0027s an enjoyable Wachowskis romp that features Hugh Grant as a cannibal tribesman, so it has that going for it.Fans of The Hobbit did not expect the novel, so short and sweet and set in such a familiar and adored world, to be messed up by The Lord of the Rings maestro Peter Jackson – but that’s exactly what happened. While the trilogy of Hobbit films were a box-office success, they came under fire from critics for stretching the book\u0027s material too thin. Third outing, The Battle of Five Armies, was the worst received of all three.  The film adaptation of the profoundly moving and dark tale The Book Thief, which follows a young girl in Nazi Germany, is tonally off from the first scene. The glossy cinematography and excessively sentimental score jar with its grim subject matter and the performances verge on caricature. It doesn\u0027t help that all of the English dialogue is spoken with a German accent.No adaptation of The Great Gatsby,  F Scott Fitzgerald’s most famous work, has managed to capture the excess, glamour and underlying sleaze of the roaring Twenties. Baz Luhrmann\u0027s 2013 version was fun and arguably the best at revealing the insecurities of (a brilliant) Leonardo DiCaprio’s Gatsby. However, the flashiness of the production stripped away all of Fitzgerald’s delicate story-telling.Disgraced producer Harvey Weinstein’s fingerprints are all over this messy adaptation of Young Adult novel The Giver (2014), which attempts to fuse a sincere, thoughtful allegory with a Twilight-style love story backed up by action fresh from The Hunger Games  and a Taylor Swift cameo. By attempting to appeal to every single teenager all at once, though, The Giver loses sight of its fascinating dystopian premise and gives its eccentric cast (among them Jeff Bridges, Meryl Streep, Alexander Skarsgård and Katie Holmes) very little to do.  John Niven\u0027s Kill Your Friends is a blistering, debauched exploration into the life of a cocaine-sniffing record label agent. It passes by in the blink of an eye, which can\u0027t be said for its adaptation. The film, released in 2015, tries so hard to nail what Niven achieves so fluidly and it shows – the result is nothing short of embarrassing with the clean-cut Nicholas Hoult failing to convince as the sociopathic Steven Stelfox.2326 The Girl on the Train (2016)Although it will always exist in the shadow of Gillian Flynn’s ingenious thriller Gone Girl, The Girl on the Train is an undeniably pacy and intelligent novel. But it was completely let down by this US film adaptation. The 2016 release, starring Emily Blunt, is cheesy and lacking in nuance – and criminally takes the story away from its original gritty London setting, plonking the characters down in glossy New York for no apparent reason. The 2016 adaptation of Me Before You, starring Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin, was brutally panned by critics for being emotionally manipulative. Its bad acting and problematic premise didn\u0027t help, either. Clarke\u0027s performance as the paid companion to Claflin’s quadriplegic was in particular criticised for being offensively exaggerated.  While not the same calibre of flop as Dreamcatcher, The Dark Tower is a fine example of a botched attempt at adapting one of Stephen King\u0027s finest works. With Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey in the lead roles as the heroic and villainous characters caught in a fated tussle, it should have soared – but a rush job such as Nikolaj Arcel\u0027s 2017 film is no way to treat such an expansive piece of work. Despite magnetic performances from Saoirse Ronan and Billy Howle, this adaptation of Ian McEwan\u0027s On Chesil Beach was weighed down by a turgid script and clumsy old-age make-up. The finished product is worlds away from the McEwan adaptation that Ronan previously starred in –\u0026nbspthe Oscar-winning drama Atonement (2007).The author also commented on the debate in Hollywood about whether straight actors should play gay roles.

By drilling those holes, the rover is able to analyse the material inside,\u0026nbspturning them into powder and dropping them into a portable lab it carries around inside its belly.Created with Sketch.Best Nasa pictures of the month Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The eye of Hurricane Dorian as captured  by Nasa astronaut Nick Hague from onboard the International Space Station (ISS) on 3 September The River Nile and its delta captured at night from the ISS on 2 SeptemberThe galaxy Messier 81, located in the northern constellation of Ursa Major, as seen by Nasa\u0027s Spitzer Space TelescopeThe flight path Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft is seen in this long exposure photograph as it launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberDanielson Crater, an impact crater in the Arabia region of Mars, as captured by Nasa\u0027s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft A team rehearses landing and crew extraction from Boeing\u0027s CST-100 Starliner, which will be used to carry humans to the International Space Station at the White Sands Missile Range outside Las Cruces, New MexicoBound for the International Space Station, the Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberHurricane Dorian as seen from the ISS on 2 SeptemberA string of tropical cyclones streams across Earth\u0027s northern hemisphere in this picture taken from the ISS on 4 SeptemberThe city of New York as seen from the ISS on 11 SeptemberThe eye of Hurricane Dorian as captured  by Nasa astronaut Nick Hague from onboard the International Space Station (ISS) on 3 September The River Nile and its delta captured at night from the ISS on 2 SeptemberThe galaxy Messier 81, located in the northern constellation of Ursa Major, as seen by Nasa\u0027s Spitzer Space TelescopeThe flight path Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft is seen in this long exposure photograph as it launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberDanielson Crater, an impact crater in the Arabia region of Mars, as captured by Nasa\u0027s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft A team rehearses landing and crew extraction from Boeing\u0027s CST-100 Starliner, which will be used to carry humans to the International Space Station at the White Sands Missile Range outside Las Cruces, New MexicoBound for the International Space Station, the Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberHurricane Dorian as seen from the ISS on 2 SeptemberA string of tropical cyclones streams across Earth\u0027s northern hemisphere in this picture taken from the ISS on 4 SeptemberThe city of New York as seen from the ISS on 11 SeptemberThe picture also shows just how far the Curiosity rover has come.

The new experiment saw it use the nine of the cups that are intended for wet chemistry experiments, however, which can be used to look for the carbon-based molecules that form the building blocks of life.That data can then be sent back down to Earth to allow scientists to pick through them and learn about the ancient history of Mars – and whatever life might have called it home.Since there are so few of those cups, researchers only use them when they are sure the possible findings will be important enough. That meant that the rover undertook only the second ever of experiments last month, despite having been on the planet since 2012.We\u0027ve been eager to find an area that would be compelling enough to do wet chemistry, said SAM Principal Investigator Paul\u0026nbspMahaffy\u0026nbspof NASA\u0027s Goddard Space Flight\u0026nbspCenter\u0026nbspin Greenbelt, Maryland. Now that we\u0027re in the clay-bearing unit, we\u0027ve finally got it.Scientists won\u0027t release the full results of the tests until next year, since the data is extremely complex and takes time to interpret.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The company received a further 3,000 complaints in the first half of this year.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Responsible lending is much needed in these difficult times for the UK economy.”David Fisher, chief executive of Cash Euro Net’s parent company Enova International, blamed the FOS for QuickQuid’s collapse.“Over the past year and a half, we have experienced a challenging and uncertain regulatory environment in the UK, despite the fact that the FCA reviewed and approved our business practices and affordability criteria in 2015,” he said.“The FOS has continued to move the goalposts with its complaints handling decisions, in effect setting ever-changing de facto policies that in many instances was inconsistent with FCA guidelines.”People who have outstanding loans with QuickQuid are advised to continue making repayments as normal.“If you miss any repayments you could be hit by fees and additional charges, and it could also harm your credit rating,” said Caroline Siarkiewicz, acting chief executive at the Money and Pensions Service.“Eleven and a half million adults have less than £100 in savings and investments so lots of people face cash-flow problems which can make quick, short-term credit feel like the only option.\u0026nbsp“If you know you need a specific amount of money for a short while there may be more affordable alternatives out there, so it’s a good idea to shop around before you borrow.”The Money Advice Service website has a guide on alternatives to payday loans, and you can also contact a free helpline on 0800 138 7777Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The Nun.\u0026nbspThese are just a few of the\u0026nbsphorror films\u0026nbspwhose production was allegedly plagued with strange occurrences.These accounts from cast, directors and crew members – which include incidents that occurred after the film\u0027s release – may have no truth to them, but\u0026nbspsomething odd is afoot with a lot of the cases.From mysterious on-set fires to tragic deaths\u0026nbspand terrifying cases of suspected paranormal activity, we\u0027ve compiled 17 examples of films that were supposedly hit by curses.Scroll through the below gallery to see them for yourself.Created with Sketch.17 scary films that were supposedly cursed Show all 17Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Rosemary\u0027s Baby producer William Castle was convinced Roman Polanski\u0027s 1968 chiller was cursed. After its release, he was hospitalised with kidney stones and, after experiencing hallucinations during his near-death experience, claimed to have seen the film\u0027s lead character approaching him with a knife. The Exorcist star Ellen Burstyn detailed a terrifying incident in which a fire burned the majority of the 1973 horror film\u0027s set to the ground. Despite it destroying the interiors depicting the MacNeil family\u0027s home, it somehow left the bedroom of the possessed Regan (Linda Blair) inexplicably untouched.The Omen was plagued by a lot of terrible incidents:  James Brolin claimed it was a ghostly presence that pushed him into appearing in The Amityville Horror he was thinking about the role when an item of clothing fell off a hanger in his bedroom, startling him. Ryan Reynolds, the lead star of the 2005 remake, would later claim to have woken up at 3.15am – otherwise known as the witching hour – every morning without rhyme or reason.Child star Oliver Robbins claimed he nearly died after being choked by the arms of the evil puppet featured in 1982 film Poltergeist. A few years after the film was released, young actor Heather O\u0027Rourke died from cardiac arrest and septic shock caused by a misdiagnosed intestinal stenosis. She was 12.Tragedy hit the Twilight Zone movie when director John Landis – who fell out with co-director Steven Spielberg due to unsafely cutting too many corners during production –\u0026nbsppushed ahead with a stunt despite windy conditions. When a helicopter flew out of control, it came crashing down right onto the precise position where actor Vic Morrow and two child stars, Myca Dinh Le, seven, and Renee Shin-Yi Chen, six, were killed by the whirring blades and falling debris. The incident, which saw Landis acquitted of manslaughter charges, led to greater regulations in on-set safety.You always felt like someone was going to die on this set, actor Laura Harrington said about Stephen King\u0027s Maximum Overdrive. The cursed film saw near-death experiences for cameramen and stuntmen as well as a hurricane, which hit the set during production. Camera assistant Silvia Giulietti would later say: Every day, we had security because the movie was a very dangerous movie.  Okay, Ghost may not be scary, but one of the biggest Hollywood urban legends goes that Poltergeist child star Heather O\u0027Rourke haunted the 1990 film\u0027s set. Crew members claimed to have continually heard the footsteps of an unseen figure as well as a child laughing. The film was shot on the same sound stage where O\u0027Rourke had filmed scenes as a child actor.917 The Exorcism of Emily Rose (2005)The Exorcism of Emily Rose\u0027s lead star Jennifer Carpenter says she was haunted by a ghost that seemed to have a taste for the musical. She told Dread Central that, while she was working on the 2005 film, a radio would continually turn on by itself whenever she got home.The watery death of Samara in The Ring made a freak incident that happened during production on the film\u0027s sequel even stranger: the entire set flooded. Lead star Naomi Watts also claims that she felt odd vibrations on set that she couldn\u0027t explain.It was Insidious\u0027s hospital set where strange occurrences seemed to go down. While numerous members of the film\u0027s cast and crew complained about feeling unwell whenever they stepped foot onto set, there were also claims that a buzzer from an unoccupied floor of the building would continually go off. What was causing it remains unknown.A lot of the cast and crew associated with The Innkeepers experienced paranormal activity in the form of lights switching on and off for no reason. Doors would swing open and shut, frightening those who were present. Cast members even received phone calls that, when they answered, would have nobody on the other end. The hotel where the film was shot, the Yankee Peddler Inn in Connecticut, is known to be a hotspot for ghost hunters.Jeffrey Dean Morgan, who starred in 2012 horror film The Possession, didn\u0027t believe in ghosts before filming began, but walked away convinced they are real. According to the film\u0027s stars, odd occurrences plagued the set, which included the explosion of light bulbs and cold breezes following them around. The possessed box at the heart of the film was later destroyed in a storage facility fire.Vera Farmiga, who played real-life paranormal investigator Lorraine Warren in The Conjuring, was so uneasy about making the film that she left the script outside her house. Despite this, one morning she woke up to find three slashes on her laptop screen. 1517 Return to Babylon (2013)Silent film Return to Babylon is said to have captured demonic activity on film. Director Alex Monty Canawati used an old-school camera with black-and-white film that he mysteriously found in a bag, but when he watched back what he\u0027d caught on camera, the lead actors\u0027s faces had morphed into demonic-looking creatures.Annabelle\u0027s director, John R Leonetti, claimed to have seen three fingers drawn through dust on set multiple times– terrifying, because the demonic doll at the heart of the film has three fingers. Annabelle isn\u0027t the only Conjuring spin-off that seems to have been haunted. Corin Hardy, who directed The Nun, says he saw two men in a room he was filming in at a castle in Romania. After completing the take, he turned to the men – assuming them to be members of the crew –\u0026nbspbut they were gone. Chillingly, they would have had to pass him to leave the room.Rosemary\u0027s Baby producer William Castle was convinced Roman Polanski\u0027s 1968 chiller was cursed.

That tradition was strong throughout much of Britain and continental Europe, and parts of western and southern Asia.On the whole, with relatively few exceptions, river deities tended to be female.There are literally thousands of rivers in Europe and Asia associated with known and named ancient deities – including Sequana (the Seine), Sionann (the Shannon), Verbeia (the Wharf), Durius (the Douro in Portugal), Alpheus (River Alfeios in Greece), Tiberinus (the Tiber in Italy), and Ganga (the Ganges in India).Sequana – the goddess of the River SeineIn dozens of cases the mythological narrative, revealing a river’s ine status, has survived across the millennia.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In aggregate, the artefacts weighed 45 kilos and represented around 300 originally complete objects.The excavation also revealed three other pits – containing hundreds of fragments of broken pottery (potentially general refuse – or even the debris from small-scale ceremonial feasting).Significantly, two other hoards of metalwork are known from the area, discovered just a few miles away back in the 1950s and the 1960s.The precise location and nature of the site itself (at the end of a promontory and immediately adjacent to and facing directly onto one of the Thames Valley’s largest wetlands) suggests a potential ritual or ceremonial function, rather than a purely commercial one.Intriguingly, the circular building’s entranceway faces north, which is not the norm for ordinary residential roundhouses.19th-century Indian artist Raja Ravi Varma portrays the goddess Ganga descending from heaven to form the River Ganges on EarthHowever, in most other cases of marshland-related metalwork deposits, the prehistoric rituals involved placing bronze artefacts in (or throwing them into) rivers and swamps, rather than merely burying them immediately adjacent to a wetland.Although a prehistoric commercial function cannot be completely ruled out, it is conceivable that the artefacts may have been held in storage within the complex, awaiting eventual ritual deposition in the adjacent swamp. Indeed, it is possible that burying it within a sacred enclosure would have been seen as giving the items sacred status, if the intention was to later deposit them in the adjacent marsh.However, the bronzes were all deposited in the pits at virtually the same time – but at the very end of the lifetime of the complex. It is therefore also possible that they were interred as an act of ritual closure – marking the sanctified decommissioning of this probably sacred site overlooking the Thames-side marshes.If indeed the complex was a ritual or ceremonial centre involved in the veneration of water spirits – or of a river deity –\u0026nbspit will raise the question as to the potential identity of a prehistoric Thames god or goddess.Although there are at least half a dozen Roman and Romano Celtic temples (all dating from at least 900 years after the Rainham complex), none of them give any clue as to what the name of such an ancient Thames deity might have been.Since at least the 18th century, Old Father Thames has been a popular literary and artistic motif – but he is probably a romantic early modern invention.18th century sculpture of Old Father Thames – but the river’s real ancient deity was probably a goddess (Juan Gutiérrez Andrés (CC BY-SA 3.0))Any truly ancient Thames deity would almost certainly have been female (like other British, Irish and French examples).Certainly, votive offerings have been deposited in the Thames for the past 5,500 years. The oldest known name for London’s river is the Tamessa (Tamesis in Latin).Bronze Age Britons lived with 1m-long worms in their kidneysHowever, that name was almost certainly originally pre-Celtic – and potentially even pre-Indo-European. It seems to be linked with an Old European word meaning ‘to flow’.So it can potentially just be translated as “the flowing one”\u0026nbsp– ie\u0026nbspsimply “The River”. Sadly, its more specific original name (if it ever had one) is lost, submerged at some point far back in the stream of time.Commenting on the discovery of the Rainham Bronze Age metalwork, Roy Stephenson, historic environment lead\u0026nbspat the Museum of London, said: “It’s incredibly rare to have uncovered a hoard of this size on one site”.Duncan Wilson, chief executive of Historic England, said: “This extraordinary discovery adds immensely to our understanding of Bronze Age life.”The bronzes will go on display for the first time as the focal point of a major exhibition at the Museum of London Docklands in April 2020.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Many more, he simply approached them in communal areas over cafe breakfasts, perhaps, or pints and pool tables.He always had the same question: can I take your picture?“People looked at me like I was a lunatic,” he says today. “Like ‘What do you want photos of this s***hole for?’ But I don’t know. To me, these places are beautiful, they need documenting. The people here, they get forgotten by those in power and by gentrification. But the community, it is still strong.”The results of his unusual mission is a collection of photos entitled Utopia London Council Estates, exclusively showcased\u0026nbspin The Independent.They capture the people and the built environment of everywhere from Robin Hood Gardens in Poplar to Thamesmead in Bexley, from the now demolished Heygate\u0026nbspestate\u0026nbspin Walworth, to tragic Grenfell Tower in Kensington.“As a kid growing up in Turin I was fascinated by the culture that came from the English working classes, especially bands like Oasis and The Stone Roses,” says the 31-year-old, who moved on to Rome earlier this year. “So when I came here in 2011, I suppose I gravitated towards those sort of places.

The message was clear - without new financing WeWork would run out of money within weeks.“Do you still believe in the company?” Neumann, who had stepped down as chief executive but was still WeWork\u0027s chairman, asked a room of JPMorgan bankers on the 42nd floor of their midtown Manhattan headquarters on 6 October, the sources said.The JPMorgan bankers, led by asset and wealth management chief executive Mary Erdoes and debt capital markets head Jim Casey, told Neumann and other WeWork directors they would back the company, and were confident they could raise the money. But they would not underwrite the deal on the spot, as one board member requested.With questions swirling around WeWork\u0027s chances of survival in the wake of its failed IPO, the bankers told Neumann they needed some time to sound out investors first, according to the sources.Created with Sketch.Tech giants to be hit by new tax in France Show all 7Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Amazon reported revenue of $232 billion worldwide in 2018Google\u0027s parent company reported revenue of $136 billion worldwide in 2018Apple reported revenue of $265 billion worldwide in 2018Facebook reported revenue of $55 billion worldwide in 2018Microsoft reported revenue of $110 billion worldwide in 2018Cisco reported revenue of $49 billion worldwide in 2018Criteo reported revenue of $2.3 billion worldwide in 2018Amazon reported revenue of $232 billion worldwide in 2018Google\u0027s parent company reported revenue of $136 billion worldwide in 2018Apple reported revenue of $265 billion worldwide in 2018Facebook reported revenue of $55 billion worldwide in 2018Microsoft reported revenue of $110 billion worldwide in 2018Cisco reported revenue of $49 billion worldwide in 2018Criteo reported revenue of $2.3 billion worldwide in 2018A few days later, an alternative rescue plan began to emerge from WeWork\u0027s largest shareholder, Japan\u0027s SoftBank.Both were far from perfect. But given its dire straits, WeWork was fortunate to have a choice.This account of how WeWork\u0027s financial rescue came together over the past three weeks is based on interviews with eight people with knowledge of the negotiations. They requested anonymity to discuss the confidential deliberations.WeWork, SoftBank and JPMorgan declined to comment for this story.Requests for an interview with Neumann were also declined.SoftBank offered $9.5bn\u0026nbspto WeWork, including new debt and recommitted equity, as well as a tender offer to partly cash out Neumann and other shareholders.In addition to providing more funds than JPMorgan, the SoftBank deal resolved what some WeWork directors privately referred to as the company\u0027s “corporate governance problem” - Neumann\u0027s controlling grip.SoftBank\u0027s deal would strip Neumann\u0027s voting power and remove him from the board. Neumann was blamed by other WeWork investors such as Benchmark Capital and China\u0027s Hony Capital, for the company\u0027s precipitous decline, some of the people said.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailHis erratic management style, combined with WeWork\u0027s lack of a clear path to profitability, alienated potential IPO investors.The problem was that Neumann could still wield power over the company even after he quit as chief executive\u0026nbspon 24 September because, as WeWork\u0027s founder, each of his shares had 10 voting rights. Others had only one vote for every share.WeWork staff outraged at former CEO’s payout while they face job cutsIt was clear to SoftBank, as well as to a special board committee formed to consider the financing plans, that Neumann relinquishing control would come with a price tag, three of the people said.In meetings in New York between Neumann and SoftBank Chief Operating Officer Marcelo Claure, the contours of a side deal came together. SoftBank would provide a $500 million credit line to refinance Neumann\u0027s personal borrowings made against WeWork\u0027s stock, as long as he used proceeds from cashing out up to $970m of his shares to repay SoftBank for that loan first.SoftBank\u0027s latest offer valued the company at as little as $5.9bn based on the repricing of warrants it was already committed to exercise, according to Bernstein research, a far cry from the $47 billion it had assigned to WeWork in January.Neumann\u0027s special pay-off did not stop there. He negotiated with SoftBank a four-year non-compete agreement with a $185 million “consulting fee” in return for stepping down from WeWork\u0027s board. He would now only get to observe board proceedings instead of participating.WeWork\u0027s special board committee members expressed concern that Neumann\u0027s bailout would cause outrage among many WeWork employees whose stock options had a much higher strike price than the valuation in SoftBank\u0027s tender offer, some of the people said.The committee declined to comment for this article.SoftBank\u0027s offer to buy up to $3bn of WeWork stock from employees and existing shareholders would value the company at about $8 billion, higher than the new valuation based on the warrants.Neumann attempted to push up the valuation of the tender offer in his negotiations with SoftBank, one of the people said.SoftBank stood firm. Anticipating criticism from its own shareholders for possibly throwing good money after bad, it wasn\u0027t prepared to pay more.Most WeWork directors wanted Neumann off the board, and many minority shareholders, which the special committee was formed to represent, wanted to cash out, the people said.Goldman Sachs profit hit by losses on investments in WeWork and UberWeWork\u0027s nosee is proof Adam Neumann can\u0027t walk on waterAs WeWork embraces big business, will it lose its cool?JPMorgan had not pursued raising additional money for shareholders, in part because WeWork only tasked the bank with delivering $5 billion of debt financing.When the bank submitted the debt package on Monday, only private equity firm Starwood Capital Group, run by real estate mogul Barry Sternlicht, had committed to join JPMorgan in sharing the financing burden.JPMorgan agreed to provide the rest and transfer the money by Thursday. But the deal also included a condition, known as a covenant, that would trigger a debt default if SoftBank did not make good on $1.5 billion that it had already committed to provide when warrants came due next April, the people said.JPMorgan wanted to ensure SoftBank would honour its financial commitment, which would lessen the risk for investors holding debt that would one day need to be repaid.But SoftBank told WeWork\u0027s board that it would not pay the $1.5bn if its financing offer was rejected, two of the people added.The problem from SoftBank\u0027s perspective was that those warrants were based on January\u0027s $47bn valuation of WeWork. It wanted to change the pricing radically to reflect WeWork\u0027s dramatic fall in value.JPMorgan dealmakers, on the other hand, believed WeWork\u0027s contract with SoftBank prevented the telecommunications and technology giant from reneging on that earlier commitment, other people familiar with the matter said.In the end, the risk that SoftBank wouldn\u0027t fulfill its commitment if the JPMorgan financing package was chosen helped swing the special committee\u0027s deliberations in favor of SoftBank\u0027s offer, they added.SoftBank had made WeWork an offer it had to accept.On Tuesday, SoftBank unveiled a deal that increased its ownership of WeWork to 80 per cent\u0026nbspfrom 30 per cent, but sought to avoid having to consolidate WeWork\u0027s liabilities on its balance sheet by not taking full control of the expanded board. SoftBank will only have 5 of the 10 seats.But unless SoftBank can turn WeWork around quickly, it could be a pyrrhic victory.WeWork has burned through almost $2.5bn\u0026nbspof cash since the end of June, and Claure will have to cut costs quickly, including slashing thousands of jobs and helping the company to find a way to get out of expensive leases. Otherwise, the new cash injection may not last long enough to stabilise the business.As predicted, Claure is also facing some staff anger over the size of Neumann\u0027s payout. He told employees on Wednesday that it was the “price” that had to be paid to get rid of Neumann\u0027s voting rights. Otherwise, he said, “Adam could do whatever he wanted.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Despite occupying such an important place in science fiction, as well as being the subject of feverish research by scientists, they are yet to be confirmed.But if they do exist, astronomers have proposed a way that we might be able to see them.Researchers hope that they might be able to spot a wormhole around the supermassive black hole at the middle of our Milky Way galaxy, which is known as Sagittarius A*. There is no specific reason to think the black hole has one – but researchers think that the extreme and turbulent gravitational conditions of a supermassive black hole should be a good place to find one.Created with Sketch.Best Nasa pictures of the month Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The eye of Hurricane Dorian as captured  by Nasa astronaut Nick Hague from onboard the International Space Station (ISS) on 3 September The River Nile and its delta captured at night from the ISS on 2 SeptemberThe galaxy Messier 81, located in the northern constellation of Ursa Major, as seen by Nasa\u0027s Spitzer Space TelescopeThe flight path Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft is seen in this long exposure photograph as it launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberDanielson Crater, an impact crater in the Arabia region of Mars, as captured by Nasa\u0027s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft A team rehearses landing and crew extraction from Boeing\u0027s CST-100 Starliner, which will be used to carry humans to the International Space Station at the White Sands Missile Range outside Las Cruces, New MexicoBound for the International Space Station, the Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberHurricane Dorian as seen from the ISS on 2 SeptemberA string of tropical cyclones streams across Earth\u0027s northern hemisphere in this picture taken from the ISS on 4 SeptemberThe city of New York as seen from the ISS on 11 SeptemberThe eye of Hurricane Dorian as captured  by Nasa astronaut Nick Hague from onboard the International Space Station (ISS) on 3 September The River Nile and its delta captured at night from the ISS on 2 SeptemberThe galaxy Messier 81, located in the northern constellation of Ursa Major, as seen by Nasa\u0027s Spitzer Space TelescopeThe flight path Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft is seen in this long exposure photograph as it launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberDanielson Crater, an impact crater in the Arabia region of Mars, as captured by Nasa\u0027s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft A team rehearses landing and crew extraction from Boeing\u0027s CST-100 Starliner, which will be used to carry humans to the International Space Station at the White Sands Missile Range outside Las Cruces, New MexicoBound for the International Space Station, the Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberHurricane Dorian as seen from the ISS on 2 SeptemberA string of tropical cyclones streams across Earth\u0027s northern hemisphere in this picture taken from the ISS on 4 SeptemberThe city of New York as seen from the ISS on 11 SeptemberIf there is one lurking at the heart of our galaxy, the stars in our galaxy should be influenced by the gravity of stars at the other end of the wormhole, the researchers suggest. That should make it possible to see one, if indirectly, by looking for the slight deviations in the orbits of the nearby stars.Supermassive black hole exploded in Milky Way, scientists findIf you have two stars, one on each side of the wormhole, the star on our side should feel the gravitational influence of the star that\u0027s on the other side. The gravitational flux will go through the wormhole, said\u0026nbspDejan Stojkovic, cosmologist and professor of physics in the University at Buffalo College of Arts and Sciences. So if you map the expected orbit of a star around Sagittarius A*, you should see deviations from that orbit if there is a wormhole there with a star on the other side.Sadly, even if there is a wormhole relatively nearby it will not be possible to travel through it and find yourself elsewhere in the universe, scientists say.Even if a wormhole is traversable, people and spaceships most likely aren\u0027t going to be passing through, said Dr Stojkovic. Realistically, you would need a source of negative energy to keep the wormhole open, and we don\u0027t know how to do that. To create a huge wormhole that\u0027s stable, you need some magic.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Meghan is struggling with le as a new motherand the global attention that comes with joining the “The Firm”. And Harry wants to protect her.But their latest complaints seemed poorly timed and worryingly self-indulgent. How  can you describe the royal couple seeing impoverished young African girls learning to box so they can fight off sexual predators, then using air time to address their First World problems with the media The same media, I might add, that was praising Meghan’s obvious intelligence and charm and had hitherto featured glowing reports from their first official overseas tour together.Prince William is reportedly “worried” about his brother’s state of mind, and after watching the documentary Harry  Meghan: An African Journey, one could only agree and conclude that we’re seeing a man teetering on the edge.The rampant paranoia, the relentless victim narrative and a tendency towards the dramatic are all perhaps signs that Harry does indeed need to take a break from public le before he unravels even further.But during that respite, he must surely seek specialist help and ask himself this: Is his obvious angst really just down to the media occasionally writing inconvenient truths about his we’s fractured family and questioning the couple’s obvious hypocrisy at using private jets while preaching about climate change OR is it the result of unresolved issues surrounding his mother Diana’s untimely death  My money’s on the latter, not least because Harry’s escalating rhetoric around the “safety of my family” rang alarm bells with me.As a child, my husband witnessed the accidental death of his -month- old brother and was put in the ambulance with his screaming mother. When he was , his -year- old father died suddenly at home during an afternoon nap.Both were deeply traumatic events that, by the time we met in , he thought he’d dealt with. But, in late , the birth of our daughter triggered a delayed response and he became riven with anxiety that something might happen to her.He developed the now resolved habit of what psychiatrist’s might refer to as “catastrophising” where, in his mind, a cut finger would escalate to potential sepsis and, like  Harry, “the safety of my ­family”  was an oft repeated mantra to try to  quash rational debate.Put simply, he felt a loss of ­control over what happened to his brother and father, which then manested itself in a disproportionately dramatic reaction to even the simplest of le’s problems and an inability to see past them.So I can only wonder whether the birth of his son Archie has triggered the same powerful reaction in Harry, who admits he thought he was out of the woods with his mental health, “but suddenly it all came back.” It would certainly explain his tears at the recent WellChild Awards, where his speech centred on his and Meghan’s feelings since having achild rather than focusing on the stories of those being celebrated.And it was “the safety of my family” he used to explain the use of private jets when, just a few days later, William and Kate — the future King and Queen of Britain — quietly boarded a commercial flight to Scotland with their kids and the dference in attitudes was there for all to see.Both William and Harry suffered the untimely loss of their mother and — wrongly, to my mind — faced the intolerable pressure of having to walk behind her coffin while the world looked on.BUT as William has clearly learned toaround the trauma and get on with his le in a mature and rational way, Harry still seems troubled, angry and prone to irrational outbursts.“I will not be bullied into playing a game that killed my mum,” he declared to interviewer and friend Tom Bradby.The tragic sequence of events that led to the death of his mother were going to the Paris Ritz with an international playboy, deciding to leave the safety of their hotel suite at midnight when they knew there were motorbike paps outside, unwittingly getting into a car driven by someone well over the drink-drive limit and not wearing a seatbelt.So yes, the paparazzi followed the carand, in an ideal world, they wouldn’t have.But a French inquiry cleared the bikes of involvement in the crash and, in the real world, anyone famous knows thatyou don’t want to be “papped” you live your le accordingly by maintaining a low profile and avoiding celebrity hang-outs.The Cambridges know that ­living a quiet, unremarkable le is the greatest antidote to unwanted media attention but also accept that the trade-off for the privilege le of being royal is that, ­occasionally, there will be “off message” stories and opinions they don’t like.On the South Africa tour, tetchy Prince Harry behaved like an entitled elite when he chastised Sky’s invited royal correspondent Rhiannon Mills for asking him a perfectly anodyne question about his visit.Later, while reporting from William and Kate’s hugely successful tour of Pakistan, Rhiannon praised the Cambridges for their regular and friendly interactions with the media.She observes that they clearly understand that official duty for Queen and country come first.“Compare it with the tone of the end of Prince Harry and Meghan’s tour a few weeks ago and you couldn’t have a bigger contrast,” she adds. “Harry had made it all about them by releasing a statement announcing legal action against The Mail on Sunday and criticising the Press.”EQUALLY, it’s worth noting that, like Meghan, Kate also had to adapt to royal le and, despite being mum to three young children, has never publicly complained about her lot.Probably because she understands that there are millions of people in the country with far worse problems and without the support network or finances to cushion the blow.That’s a rational outlook but, right now, Harry is clearly locked in a victim narrative where the nasty Press hunted his mother to her death and even the mildest criticism of him or his we is taken as “bullying” behaviour that threatens their very existence.I feel sympathy for him, but only he can change that self-pitying narrative, with his we’s support. Unfortunately, unlike Kate, Meghan doesn’t have a close-knit family around her and, judging by what she said in the same ­documentary, may be enabling rather than ­calming his paranoia.She said her British friends had warned her off marrying Harry because “the British tabloids will destroy your le.” Really  Or did they rightly just advise that the Press attention would be several notches higher than she’d been used to  Particularly as she has a rather off- message family Certainly not the poor man at Wimbledon who got ticked off by “Meghan’s ­people” for trying to take a photo of her when he was actually taking a selfie.No, it’s definitely time for a ­period of rest and, ­hopefully, reflection.  And , at the end of it, they decide to step away from royal le and live as private citizens, then we wish them nothing but the best.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That is totally understandable. But there is a risk to attempting it before delivering Brexit as he promised.There is a danger too, of course, that Remainers will kill his deal in the next fortnight via fatal amendments. Most Labour “moderates” in Leave seats cannot be trusted to back it, however much they hope to pull the wool over their constituents’ eyes.But the PM can then go to the polls promising that a Tory majority will reverse their tricks and finalise his deal.As it stands, Labour must agree to any election. And it is truly jaw-dropping to watch them running away, having screamed for so long for the chance to replace the dastardly Tories.With their ratings in freefall and in mortal fear of Boris’s popularity, they concoct ever more ludicrous excuses to dodge a reckoning. It is shredding the last remnants of their credibility.The public wants an election, by  per cent to . Labour cannot hide from it.They are stricken, ided and handicapped by the most unpopular political leader in UK history — but they will be seen too as snivelling cowards who put their party before their country.For the moment, though, Boris’s best bet is as his slogan says: to get Brexit done.IT is a scandal that the fracking revolution was strangled at birth.The Whitehall report saying it is “years behind schedule” doesn’t nearly cover the failure.Shale gas could power Britain cheaply for a generation, lower bills and create thousands of jobs. It would be far more eco-friendly than burning coal.But the Tories lost the PR war against a green social media campaign which terried the public using debunked and out-of-date US scare stories. Most people know little of fracking except that they are meant to despise and fear it.The Cameron Government could have pushed back hard. Instead it buckled and hit fracking firms with regulations making exploration all but impossible.What a calamitous missed opportunity.IT is impossible to imagine the terrying ordeal of the  migrants who died in a refrigerated truck.And we recoil at the evil and greed of the traffickers who have profited from this appalling tragedy.The only comfort is that there is every chance, from the details already known, that they will be brought to justice.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They want No Deal “taken off the table”. No one is fooled. Labour fear Boris, and Corbyn is toxic.Boris cannot govern this Remainer-dominated Parliament with no majority against an opposition so extreme and so utterly without principle.Labour blocks his Brexit deal. It blocks No Deal. It tries to block all Government legislation. It cannot block an election too.It will be a monstrous abdication of responsibility motivated by naked cowardice. Not that the Lib Dems or SNP are any better.These Remainer clowns have brought our democracy to its knees. Most of Britain is ashamed of them.OFCOM’S report into the BBC makes grim reading for a corporation in rapid decline.It is fast losing young viewers to Netflix, YouTube and Amazon.

But Johnson admitted the EU was inclined to offer an extension to the end of January and that Emmanuel Macron was fighting a lonely battle against it.Earlier in the day, the Elysée told No the French President was too isolated on the issue to veto a longer extension.In a sign of how much he is relying on Macron, Johnson then pleadingly recited the opening line of the carol “Oh come, oh come Emmanuel” to ministers.One of No’s hopes is that EU leaders will see the Opposition refusing both a general election and to pass the withdrawal agreement as is and come round to Macron’s way of thinking: That there is little point in offering this country a three-month extension as ­Parliament will just waste the time.One No source predicts that the sight of the opposition blocking an election will “push the EU towards either the Macron position or a very long extension”.In a sign that Johnson’s gambit is having some success, the EU is waiting until Parliament has voted on an election before deciding whatof extension to offer.If this doesn’t work, the Government hopes it can shame Labour into having an election.The Chief Whip told those present that they would “make Labour look like right d***s”they didn’t vote for an election.But not everyone is convinced this will work.One of those present tells me thatthey were a Labour MP, they would “rather look like a d*** than lose their seat”.I understand, though, No intends to bring multiple votes to try to force an election. One Cabinet minister who has discussed this strategy with Johnson tells me: “Every time , it advertises that they are not prepared to support Brexit or have an election.“It reinforces the sense that he is the only person trying to get things done.”Johnson himself has told allies thatLabour rejects his offer to pass the withdrawal agreement and have an election, then it will be an “effective demonstration” that this Parliament won’t — and can’t — break the current deadlock.Proving this Parliament can’t break the deadlock is one thing. Actually breaking it is quite another.One of those present on Thursday tells me Johnson seemed genuinely angry at Labour’s refusal to give him an election and “betrayed a sense he’s cornered”.Something must happen before January , though.If it doesn’t, the threat of No Deal will be back on the table.Andthe UK has wasted this extension, European patience may snap and they might not offer another one.One senior Cabinet minister tells me “there will be an attempt to use an SOto put the Withdrawal Agreement Bill before the House”. This would involve the rebel group around Oliver Letwin trying to bring the deal back to Parliament so that the Commons could vote on it. But it is far from clear whether this approach could work.Another possibility is the Opposition bringing down the Government. If they did this, they would have to agree on an alternative prime minister or end up in a general election.British politics looks more deadlocked than ever today. Johnson’s hope is that pressure from voters will eventually break this deadlock and sweep away the obstacles to him passing his Brexit deal.But he will almost certainly have to put up with a delay both to Brexit and the election before he can get his way.NO one at political Cabinet spoke against the idea of a December election. But privately, several ministers have grave doubts about the wisdom of this strategy.One frets: “Who jumps out of bed on a cold December morning to vote for the Government ”There is a view that the Government could have used getting the Commons to approve its deal in broad terms as a spur for pressing on with the ­legislation, bringing a new timetable to the Commons after MPs rejected its initial offer of three days’ debate. One complains that the election idea is “a massive distraction”.“Why aren’t we using the momentum of getting a second reading ” they ask.On the backbenches there are also concerns. One senior backbencher tells me: “We’ll vote for an election with great reluctance.”He worries that “being seen to try not very hard to get the bill through” undercuts the new Tory message that they are the deal party.The other great worry is that while the public mood is with Boris Johnson now, that could change. One minister warns it is a huge risk to have a “winter election at a very febrile time”, adding: “We’ve no idea what public opinion will be on polling day.”IF Boris Johnson gets his way and there’s a general election this year, what happens to those Tories who lost the whip for voting for the Benn Act At Thursday’s gathering, Nicky Morgan argued that the party needed “clarity” on what would happen to those who had lost the whip but had voted with the Government against the Letwin amendment and for the Brexit deal and the accelerated timetable for passing it.Boris Johnson has previously been adamant that he would not allow any of the  to stand as Tory candidates at the next election. But I am told he made sympathetic noises in response to Morgan’s point.Inside Boris Johnson’s circle, there’s the beginnings of a sht in attitude. There is a feeling that those who have consistently voted with the Government in recent weeks are worth bringing back in.With a deal secured, the issue that led to their rebellion has been addressed.At the same time, several of these MPs would be better placed to hold their seat for the Tories than any other candidate.AT political Cabinet on Thursday, Boris Johnson pointed at the Northern Powerhouse Minister Jake Berry and said “Kwasi”, a reference to Kwasi Kwarteng the Energy Minister.Cabinet ministers were baffled at how the PM confused the two.They don’t look at all alike.After Berry deadpanned, “An easy mistake to make”, the room fell about laughing.A Budget would offer the Tories a chance to outline some of their more popular economic policies and highlight plans to boost infrastructure.If the Opposition voted it down, it would make the case for the election Boris Johnson so desperately wants.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

When the nation voted on whether or not to leave the EU, it was boiled down to the simplest possible question and answer: Yes or No.So the die was cast and we voted to split with the EU. But that’s the thing about orce.Between the time you say you want one, and the time you actually get your decree nisi there is a whole lot of pain as the time is filled with blame, retribution and name-calling.Because of the lack of clarity from the vote on what it meant to leave, no one thought about the most important aspects, the red lines, of how Britain should leave the EU.It didn’t need a clairvoyant to predict that lots of those dferent Brexit visions would be fundamentally incompatible.We can’t stay in the customs union and have complete control of immigration.We can’t have no hard border on the island of Ireland the Good Friday Agreement and also leave the single market. I could go on.The point is that the nation answered Yes or No to something that — it turns out — our politicians have decided to interpret in multiple ways.And that has been the fundamental problem.Because MPs have been unable to compromise in order to find a deal that pleases them enough for it to be passed. And the public despair.Politics only s effectively when a party has a clear majority to get their legislation through government. And this one doesn’t.It’s no surprise that neither party has a clear majority while they are being led by the more extreme and dogmatic elements.I was in the House of Lords and the House of Commons on Wednesday and the contrast in atmosphere between the two is stark.Politicians in the Commons don’t listen or pay each other any respect.And the amount of average front bench MPs on both sides is shameful. No wonder we have stalemate.There is an unbridgeable gulf between Leavers and Remainers, and an inability among politicians to compromise.We’ve either got to leave with No Deal or we have to revoke Article  altogether.There is nothing in between, no room for compromise or pragmatism. As a result, we are paralysed. So the answer has to be to have a general election.Usually it’s politicians who tell us what to do for the good of the country, but now we need to tell the politicians what to do.Because only with a majority government can we put an end to the Brexit misery.Although who relishes the prospect of voting on a dark December night  Least of all Jeremy Corbyn, the only Opposition leader in history who has refused the offer of an election more than once.It’s no wonder when you look at the polls. He’s unelectable, but still using his position to block Brexit and stop us from getting on with it.Until there is an election we remain in this terrible limbo. I voted Remain but, like most people, now I just want it over with.Politicians must stop using Brexit for their own political aims.If they don’t soon come up with a solution, the risk is that people are increasingly likely to vote for extreme options in a bid to make it stop.And that is a scary prospect.WHEN it comes to le choices I am a big believer in the live and let live school of thought.Andpeople choose to have cosmetic surgery because it makes them feel better, that’s their choice.But in the latest photos of Lauren Goodger her flawless complexion and insanely pillowy pout are so extreme I didn’t realise it was her.Which, to me, raises the question of why anyone would want to render themselves completely unrecogniseable IT is ironic that one of the most important causes of our time – climate change – is being eclipsed by the behaviour of the very people professing to be addressing the issue.Following last week’s debacle with the protestor on the Tube at Canning Town, this week a jobless Extinction Rebellion protester who spray-painted a war memorial has been ordered by a judge to pay £ as punishment for “senseless vandalism”.The volunteer tree-planter, Joseph O’Malley, wrote the word “mother” on the ft tall bronze sculpture in Whitehall last November, Westminster Magistrates’ Court heard.And protestors who act like this wonder why we have no sympathy for them.Meanwhile, this year’s ongoing Extinction Rebellion protests have so far cost the taxpayer £million, it emerged this week.Sure, their argument would be that the cost to the taxpayer will ultimately be a lot more than thatwe do nothing about climate change.But these tactics and statistics make me seethe with anger.I, like most of us, have to go to work so people like O’Malley can choose instead to spend their time damaging a memorial dedicated to heroes who sacriced their lives so that, ironically, yobs like him can enjoy freedom.In my view a fine is not enough. His benefits should be stopped and he should be jailed for such a disgraceful and disrespectful act.Make no mistake, stopping climate change is essential for all of our futures.But these tactics are not only distracting and damaging to that cause they are actively counter productive.But put together with another story this week showing that the number of children aged between eight and  with anorexia has doubled , it is a good reminder that we should all keep an eye on our children’s phone use.ANYONE  catch Nigella Lawson’s ultimately down to earth confession that she followed up an evening of fine dining at Noble Rot, a snazzy award-winning restaurant in London, by eating a bag of pickled onion Monster Munch in bed.You’ve got to love the fact that after eating oysters, black pudding and venison Nigella has a Monster Munch nightcap.I am fully supportive. It’s just that, well, in bed  I can think only of the crumbs.SO sorry to hear about Amanda Holden’s bad luck breaking her leg on holiday at half-term.Buther cloud has a silver lining it is surely the fact that there are not that many people who could manage to look quite so glamorous with a leg that’s broken in two places.THIS week it was announced that jail sentences for terrorists will be increased.The Sentencing Council will propose changes to its guidelines after Parliament passed a new anti-terror law earlier this year which allowed for longer terms of imprisonment.Under the moves, the “starting point” for judges when jailing someone for “encouragement of terrorism” will double to ten years in the worst cases.But isn’t there something wrong with the fact that laws to delay Brexit get passed in hours, yet laws like this take months GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A student flat in Newcastle was among the first to discover the golden opportunity.One of the lads there who cashed in - a -year-old business student - said: “The Welcome code was designed as a one-time introductory offer, but the brother of a flatmate got in touch to say he’d entered it a second time and it worked again.“Obviously we were quick to try it ourselves and couldn’t believe that no matter how many times we put it in it always worked.“It was only available on a single purchase so you could get a fiver off anything, which didn’t mean muchyou wanted expensive stuff - but we’re students, we just want anything we can get.“We started looking for useful stuff that was a fiver or under and discovered there was loads that we could get that would be really handy - and also some pretty rubbish things we got just for the hell of it.“We’ll never need to buy toiletries, cheap novels, highlighter pens, folders or batteries again during our whole university career and well beyond.“It became an addictive game which we called: ‘What can you possibly buy for under a fiver’ and we were pretty inventive.“We found some packs of six bottles of beer for £., which meant we were getting them for £ a pack, which was a big moment.“We were up until am ordering and ordering because we figured that at some stage any minute Amazon would twig what was happening and pull the plug - but they didn’t.“The following day the porter in our halls of residence looked completely shell-shocked when parcels started to arrive in massive numbers and never stopped arriving all day.“When we got to lectures on the Wednesday morning we discovered the offer still worked so we carried on ordering stuff off our phones all day.“It was around that time that we discovered other unis all over the country had figured it out as well. At first people were being a bit coy about it and sending texts just saying ‘Welcome ’“And then it started to blow up on social media, people saying they’d bought  uni books for nothing and some were even saying a personal thanks to Jeff Bezos for messing up so bad.“It must have cost Amazon hundreds of thousands of pounds and it was only discovered on Thursday evening, but by that time everyone had gone crazy.“I started sending stuff home to my mum as we didn’t have room for any more in the flat. Obviously it meant a lot of packaging lying around but to be honest our flat wasn’t all that tidy anyway.“When the code went down on Thursday night we were gutted. My mate came to my room and said ‘Welcome is over!“I’m pretty sure Jeff Bezos can afford it, he’s worth  billion so it won’t affect the bottom line too much and Amazon can be certain they’ll always have a special place in our hearts.”Another student, Ryan from Nottingham Trent University, said: “I mostly used the code to bulk buy food, stationary, art supplies, charging cables and cleaning supplies.I saved £ on  items. Students were purchasing anything they could find. The most common things were crisps, protein bars and chocolates.The glitch is thought to have been operating since October  until Amazon realised what was happening on Thursday when it stopped working.Students took to Twitter to express their disappointment.

NO ONE has yet been prosecuted over the catalogue of ­failings which led to the disaster.A police investigation is ­ongoing and there is a separate public inquiry led by retired Appeal Court judge Sir Martin Moore-Bick.Police said in March that ­criminal charges would not be considered until the second and final phase of the public inquiry has finished — which could take up to two years.But survivors of the blaze have now called for the findings of phase one, due to be announced on Wednesday, to be used to help bring those responsible to book.Karim Mussilhy, who lost his uncle in the fire and is vice chair of the bereaved families and survivors group, Grenfell United, said: “This report won’t bring our loved ones back, but it could save others.“It is so important those responsible are held to account. There will have to be ­prosecutions.”But, more than  months since the blaze on June , , people are wonderingthey will ever get justice.Karim, , said: “There are so many questions. Why did the fire spread so fast  Why has the fire brigade still not done evacuation training for high-rise buildings “There are still huge numbers of tower blocks with the same cladding and not enough is being done to improve social housing.“Grenfell Tower was not safe to live in. But the police investigation is separate to the report and we have yet to see a ­person face prosecution for how it was built.“Our message to Boris Johnson is please make sure this never happens again.”In addition to the  deaths,  people were injured in the Grenfell Tower disaster. A total of  escaped the blaze.Despite great aid efforts to look after survivors, many have been left in dire ­situations.We found that while  families have moved into new homes, eight are still in temporary accommodation and one is living in a hotel.Wheelchair-bound Mariko Toyoshima-Lewis, , and her three children were placed in a new home without disability access. Another former resident said she is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.Helen Gebremeskel, , took legal action against the council after she and her daughter Lulya, , were placed in a block of flats with lts. She said: “We cannot live in a block after what we went through.”Thankfully, Helen and her daughter are now in a West London flat after asking housing chiefs for a more suitable home.The council made £million from selling property in the five years before the tragedy — but cut spending at the same time.They even saved £, by using cheaper, more combustible cladding that made the tower block light up like a candle. Yet since the blaze some of those in charge have been busy rewarding themselves financially.Freedom of Information requests have revealed that  council leaders received a total of £, in bonuses last year — an average of £, per person. And  staff working in housing received £, in bonuses — £, per employee on average.This was a huge rise on the £, paid out in bonuses the year before the fire. Campaign group Justice for Grenfell said council members should “hang their heads in shame” over the “vulgar” sums.Nearly £million has been spent on hotels for the survivors — that’s five times the equivalent cost in today’s money of building the s tower block.In total,  bed-and-breakfasts and hostels have been used for ­temporary accommodation. The council has spent more than £million buying  homes for survivors.But a new building chosen to house families in Kensington has been deemed a fire risk itself.In August inspectors said the Hortensia Road block, a mile from Grenfell, has “errors” including “no evidence” cladding had been inspected. The public inquiry’s report on the fire has been  months in the making.The first phase of its conclusions out this week is expected to address why firefighters ordered Grenfell residents to stay in flats when an inferno was raging.It will also examine why  call-centre workers told tenants to stay in flats even when they said smoke or fire was in their homes. Jessica Urbano Ramirez, , died in the tower after being told by call operators to stay put and await rescue.Her aunt, Sandra Ruiz, has called on inquiry chairman Sir Martin not to hold back. She said: “The report had better be hard-hitting. “She trusted that person on the end of the phone was going to get her out.”The report should also give answers on whether the building was “non- compliant” given that it was wrapped in dangerous cladding and there was a lack of fire prevention measures such as sprinklers.This will form a key part of whether iniduals will be prosecuted. In July the Government’s safety  demanded that similar high-pressure laminate  be stripped from  buildings across the UK to make sure the disaster is not repeated, but progress has been slow.The families of  victims and  survivors are taking legal action against US firms Arconic, which manufactured the cladding, Celotex, which made the insulation, and Whirlpool, which owns Hotpoint, the make of fridge that is thought to have started the blaze.But their lawyers have claimed in court papers that Arconic has failed to produce key documents related to Grenfell’s refurbishment.An Arconic spokesman told The Sun: “What the claimants’ lawyers have said in their recent filings is not correct. Arconic is providing information in the US lawsuit.”For Grenfell United spokesman Karim, there are many questions from the report that need answers.He said: “There were so many failings. Even when the ‘stay put’ directive was lted  responders did not call ­people back to tell them to get out.“The Tenant Management Organisation and the council did not have an up-to-date list of tenants so the fire brigade had little idea who might be inside.”“We hope those giving evidence accept this and understand what their duty is. Grenfell can never happen again. If it does, the inquiry will have failed.“At the council, we believe our duty is to the truth only. Whatever it takes and ­whatever the consequences.”Ross, , said: “I feel like I have been left at the very bottom. Many times I have attempted or considered suicide.”On the night of the ­tragedy, he left Grenfell Tower at midnight. When he ed, it was ablaze.His dad Steve Power, , and their three pet dogs died in the inferno. Steve had been told to stay in their flat.Describing the aftermath, Bobby said: “I didn’t eat anything and I didn’t sleep during that first  hours.“For more than  years my dad had been telling them how dangerous the tower was. He was continually ignored.”Mariko’s wheelchair would not fit into the bathroom and she had to use facilities in a separate hotel.The family’s most recent home was temporary accommodation in Ladbroke Grove, West London, which was not fully adapted for a disabled person.Mariko, who has a spinal problem, has split with her husband.She said: “The council don’t care about human ­dignity. I want people to know what is going on.”On the night of the fire, she told her family to leave first so she would not slow them down.Mariko said: “I kept smiling at my children. I didn’t want them to panic.”“I told them, ‘Mummy is coming later’.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

By denying us a vote on his deal HE is now the one blocking Brexit.The  Labour manesto on which I was re-elected was clear: “Labour accepts the referendum result”.It promised we would “seek to unite the country around a Brexit deal that works for every community in Britain”.I repeated these words countless times in my constituency, a former mining area of Nottinghamshire that suffered under Conservative governments.I told them Labour would respect the  per cent of them who voted to leave, but that we would never stop fighting for a Brexit that brought them closer to prosperity not further away from it.This could be our last chance to keep that promise. That is why I voted with the Government on Tuesday.I did so not because I like Boris Johnson’s deal, but because I don’t like it and I want the chance to change it.This version of Brexit is flawed. It weakens workplace rights, consumer rights and environmental protections.It doesn’t include a customs union, which would be good for workers and businesses.This is not about supporting the Tories and their miserable agenda. It is about my role as an MP in opposition.I agree with John McDonnell, who said earlier this week: “By amending the Withdrawal Agreement Bill . . . MPs have an opportunity to reject the  choice between Boris Johnson’s bad deal and No Deal, and instead support an agreement that works for everyone.”I have signed Tory MP Ken Clarke’s amendment to stay in the customs union, safeguarding our economy and the many businesses that would sufferwe leave it. I want to make sure that working people are protected.I want to ensure that Brexit doesn’t give the Tories a chance to attack workers’ rights, as they have been doing for a decade.If we can’t get those changes, I won’t vote for the Bill at the final stage. In , I launched Labour’s Remain campaign alongside Jeremy Corbyn.I travelled the country making the case for the EU as the best way to guarantee workers rights, economic stability and environmental protections, among other things.But we lost that campaign. AndI stand for anything, I stand for respecting the voices and interests of working class people, who overwhelmingly voted to leave the EU.Some  per cent of those who voted to leave say that politicians don’t listen to people like them. It is these people I came into politics to give a voice to.I can’t ignore them on the major issue of our time. I know Labour colleagues who voted against the Government this week are also deeply committed to those voters.These decisions are not easy for any of us. There is an appetite for compromise in the country which is not reflected in Parliament.Earlier this year, I invited both passionate Leavers and Remainers in my constituency to meet. The debate was lively, but there was none of the shouting and jeering we see in Parliament.The majority of Remainers said they were willing to respect the result and Leavers still wanted to leave — but with a deal, not without one.If voters can compromise, why can’t politicians  I didn’t come into Parliament to protest, but to deal with the world as it is, and make it a bit better.However I can, I want to tell my constituents that I did everything I could to get the Brexit nearly  per cent of them voted for, while protecting jobs and rights in the process.Shortly after the referendum I was at a bus stop in my constituency. I was chatting to a woman and the conversation turned to Brexit. Having voting to leave the EU, she asked: “Do you think it will actually happen ”I didn’t hesitate to say, “Of course! We are a democracy and that’s how people voted.” I never thought that three-and-a-half years later we would still be arguing.If Boris Johnson really wants to deliver Brexit he has to do the one thing he’s so far failed to do — and that’s compromise. This General Election will be about so much more than Brexit.It is a chance for us to create a country where power, wealth and opportunity are in the hands of the many and not the privileged few and I will be giving my all to bring that about.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The archbishop said Mr Johnson had come to symbolise a climate in which Britain had become consumed by an abusive and binary approach to political decisions, and where those with opposing views treated each other as total enemies. In an era in which social media had made it extraordinarily dangerous to use careless comments, and in which hate speech was on the rise, Mr Welby called for political leaders to take more care with their language. Although he said his criticisms were not confined to Mr Johnson and his Government, the Archbishop made it clear he considered the prime minister partly to blame for the fact society had become quite broken.    I think we have become addicted to an abusive and binary approach to political decisions: aposItaposs either this or youaposre my total enemyapos, Mr Welby told the paper. There have been inflammatory words used on all sides, in parliament and outside - apostraitorapos, aposfascistapos, all kinds of really bad things have been said at the highest level in politics. Mr Welby said he was shocked by Mr Johnsonaposs recent dismissal of concerns extreme language could encourage death threats against politicians as humbug. And he added political leaders could no longer behave the same way as Mr Johnsonaposs hero, Winston Churchill. Churchill was well known for his somewhat inflammatory putdowns in parliament, the archbishop said. But this is happening at a time when we have social media, which amplies things. In a time of deep uncertainty, a much smaller amount of petrol is a much more dangerous thing than it was in a time when people were secure.

Mr Hammond, who lost the whip, when he voted against no deal, quoted Boris Johnson who previously said splitting Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK was not something any British Prime Minister could agree to.Mr Johnson repeatedly rejected any such arrangement - including as recently as September .But his new arrangement, which scrapsthe Irish backstop,has imposed a border down the Irish sea angering the Toriesapos DUP allies.Boris Johnson finally agreed a Brexit deal with the EU on  October , though it still needs approval by MPs and is now on ice. The -page list of amendments keeps a transition period up to  December  and the £bn orce bill. But it scraps the Irish backstop, an insurance policy designed at preventing a hard border between Northern Ireland the Republic. In the backstopaposs place would effectively be apostwo bordersapos in a hybrid system:Northern Ireland and Britain would share a legal customs territory - technically forcing customs checks on goods crossing the -mile border with the Republic. But in practice, to avoid checks at the border, the checks will instead happen when goods reach Northern Ireland on the island of Ireland. Critics say this puts a customs border across the Irish Sea - more of this below.  Northern Ireland and the Republic would share some EU single market rules - forcing checks on manufactured and agricultural products crossing the Irish Sea.The Northern Ireland Assembly - known as Stormont - will get a vote every four years on whether to let EU law continue. But this vote could be passed by a simple majority - denying the DUP a veto on staying under EU laws long-term. Meanwhile commitments on workersapos rights are deprioritised - moved to the non-legally-binding Political Declaration for agreement later.

The Prime Minister used an article in the Sunday papers to accuse MPs of holding the country hostage by refusing a general election. He is looking to pile pressure on MPs on Monday to give him the two-thirds backing he needs to secure an election on December . But the Lib Dems and SNP , in a move that bypasses Labouraposs indecision, are to reportedly set to offer the Conservative Party leader an even easier route to an election - requiring just a simple majority in the Commons. But, crucially, the Lib Dems and SNP want the election to be held on December  - three days before Mr Johnsonaposs proposed date. If the European Union gives the UK a Brexit delay until January , as requested in Mr Johnsonaposs letter to Brussels last week, then the pro-Remain parties are prepared to give the PM the opportunity to have an election on new terms. Ian Blackford, the SNPaposs Westminster leader, confirmed he had co-signed a letter with Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson to European Council president Donald Tusk in which they sought an extension until January  at the earliest so that the risk of a devastating no-deal Brexit could be removed. He added: If that meaningful extension is secured we will then work together to bring forward an election this year - but on Parliamentaposs terms, not on the Prime Ministeraposs.    According to The Observer, the partiesapos MPs have drawn up a bill that would allow Mr Johnson to secure a December election with a simple majority of MPs, by-passing the need for two-thirds support. The draft law would grant an election on December  - three days before the PMaposs proposed date and, crucially, when more students are still at university to cast their votes in Remain-supporting target swing seats. The move indicates a split between opposition leaders on whether to go for a December campaign, with Labour putting off their decision on how to vote on Monday. Leader Jeremy Corbyn said he wanted to wait until EU ambassadors had finalised their decision, expected on Monday or Tuesday, over theof an extension for Article  . Mr Corbyn, speaking on a campaign visit to Motherwell, North Lanarkshire on Saturday, said: We will be very happy to fight an election once all vestiges of a no-deal exit from the EU have been taken off the table. But the Government reiterated it had no intention of ruling out a clf-edge orce, with Business Minister Kwasi Kwarteng telling BBC Radio aposs Today programme: No-deal canapost be taken off the table. The PM ramped up the rhetoric on Sunday as he looks to encourage MPs to grant him a trip to the polls when Parliament s on Monday. He wants an election on December  but requires two-thirds of MPs -  out of  - to back the move under the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act.

But it was during a routine visit to a London school one Friday afternoon back in June  that his le changed irrevocably. He was outside showing pupils an armoured personnel carrier , when the school bus reversed into the car park and didn’t see him. Within seconds, John, now , was crushed between the bus and the troop carrier. ‘I couldn’t breathe,’ he says. ‘It happened so quickly, I was in shock, I fell to the ground and all I could see was the double wheels at the back of the bus – I knew I had to get out of the way becausethe bus reversed again it would kill me.’ Despite multiple injuries – a shattered pelvis and hip and broken leg – John managed to crawl five to six metres on his elbows to get out of the way of the wheels. An ambulance arrived and John was rushed to Whittington Hospital in London.    ‘My first thought was, “Will I be able to walk again ”’ he recalls. ‘None of the doctors could answer that. My bones were broken in so many places that an operation wasn’t possible.apos aposI had to remain in traction while my bones rebuilt themselves.’ John’s injuries were so severe, the doctors couldn’t operate until six months later. He had  operations in total and it was two years before he could walk again. Shortly after he was discharged from hospital, he received a visit from an old friend, Anna. They had met in the Cadet Forces – she had heard about the accident and wanted to check he was OK.   ‘John was still on crutches at the time,’ says Anna, . ‘He was in quite a good place, focusing on getting better.apos aposBut I realised he wasn’t going to cope when he offered me a glass of water, I took one sip and it was full of washing-up liquid – he hadn’t been able to rinse it properly.’    John was off work for  months after the accident, then ed to work in a part-time office role on a Zimmer frame. He was living on his own and didn’t have any carers, so Anna started helping out with things like cooking meals and washing up. ‘We had the same interests, we were company for each other and got on really well,’ she says. ‘We’d sit for hours and hours chatting.’ As the months went on, they fell in love. They married in , between having their two children – Kieran, now , and Summer, now nine.  Although John improved physically and was awarded compensation, he couldn’t get over the trauma of what had happened.  The bus driver was convicted with nine points on his licence and kept his job, whereas John couldn’t go back to work for two years and changed career twice due to stress.  ‘My mind was still on edge,’ he says. ‘I was scared of large vehicles and the sound of a reverse beeping noise – I would have flashbacks and sometimes be sick.’ He was also terried of crowds and didn’t want to leave home. ‘Before the accident, I was out of the house all the time,’ he says. ‘I loved working with young people, I loved working in sport and outdoors.apos aposBut because of my injuries, I couldn’t handle the physicality of going for long walks any more.’ John volunteered with St John Ambulance and spent five years in the ambulance service as an emergency care assistant, but the irregular hours only increased his anxiety. ‘My sht would often overrun and I’d be late getting home to Anna and the kids, and that shot me to pieces,’ he says.  ‘I would be massively stressed at work all day in case I didn’t finish on time, andI finished late I’d take it out on the controllers and blame them.apos apos It was too much – I couldn’t live with the pressure.apos ‘I also had a real problem with anyone who had a job and, in my opinion, wasn’t doing it properly.apos aposIf a supermarket didn’t have a particular loaf of bread on the shelf, I’d start arguing with the managermy mobile phone didn’t work orthe internet went down for  minutes, I’d have large verbal arguments with the customer services agent.apos aposI felt people should be held accountable for their actions.’ Anna recalls being in a shop where the special offer had been put on the wrong shelf. ‘We then proceeded to spend an hour and a half in the store complaining to the manager that it was misleading because we’d bought the wrong bottle of squash,’ she says. ‘The squash was only about £ – I think that was the point where I said to John, “You need to go and find help.”’  Concerned, Anna encouraged John to get support and he had  weeks of therapy. His behaviour was put down to the fact he felt so let down by le, and the fact the bus driver had not been held accountable, so John wanted everybody  to be held accountable for their actions. Although it helped him understand his behaviour, it didn’t provide a cure. ‘I never really asked for help,’ he says. ‘I always justied my actions and my argument and therefore I didn’t feel like there was anything wrong.’ The family left London and moved to the countryside in North Devon in an attempt to live a quieter le. But when Anna started working longer hours, John’s anxiety got worse. ‘It was wonderful to be out of the city, but any time Anna was away from home, I started to get really anxious –. I couldn’t relax,’ he says. ‘My mind would run all over the place.apos aposI’d be so stressed by the time she came home, it got to the point where Anna didn’t want to go out because she didn’t want to see me upset.apos  aposOur relationship started to break down – I was making her le hell.’ As the years rolled on, John’s mental health deteriorated. He suffered from depression, began to self-harm and had suicidal thoughts. ‘I felt like I was letting everybody down,’ he says. ‘It was beginning to take over my le, but I didn’t know what to do.apos ‘I tried to hide it from the kids, but they became aware of it over time.apos aposBoth children now have anxiety and have spoken about not being sure how Dad is.apos aposThey are much more understanding after reading a book called Why Is Dad So Mad  – a story about a military dad with PTSD written especially for kids.’ John had counselling and ious types of therapy and was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder , but none of the treatment seemed to help.  Then last year, at a Combat Stress hospital , he was introduced to the therapeutic power of animals and a doctor told him a puppy might help with his anxiety. ‘I’d never thought of it as a mechanism for coping before,’ he says. ‘We already had a family dog, a crossbreed called Bolt, but he was old and set in his ways.apos aposThe doctor explained puppies can help manage stress and focus the mind.’ In May , they enlisted the help of a four-legged companion – a black Labrador pup called Gibson. ‘After just a few weeks, I could feel myself improving,’ explains John. ‘If I was feeling anxious, he would jump up on the sofa and sit on my chest and I found that really reassuring and comforting.apos aposIt doesn’t matter where I am, he’ll pin me down, hold me tight and it’s really helped with my anxiety.apos aposWe go out and play frisbee and I now look forward to going out for walks, whereas before I would always make excuses to stay in the house, which would make me feel worse – to say he’s changed my le is an understatement.’ "},{"url":null,"title":"airbnb horror shrieking family wake","story":"NewsAirBnb horror as shrieking family wake to find wasps crawling all over themThe family of Suzy Cross from Manchester experienced the stuff of nightmares at the London flatShareCommentsByAmy Sharpe:,  OCT NewsSuzy and husband Stephen \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe mum of missing chef Claudia Lawrence hit out tonight at the “peanuts” budget to probe suspect Christopher Halliwell. Police have only £, to investigate the double killer’s possible links to the murder of a number of ­women, including that of Claudia, . Karen Edwards, , whose daughter Becky was one of two women ­slaughtered by cab driver Halliwell, said: “It’s an insult to the memory of those who are still waiting for loved ones to come home.” And Joan Lawrence, , whose ­missing daughter Claudia is one of the potential victims, said: “There are so many other people and crimes that Halliwell has been linked to. “It’s impossible for the force to carry out a proper review with such a small amount of money.” Halliwell, , is serving le for killing sex worker Becky, , and Sian O’Callaghan, , who was going home from a nightclub in Swindon, Wilts, when he abducted and murdered her.    The ex-CID chief who caught him – played by Martin Freeman in this month’s hit ITV drama A Confession – fears Halliwell could be one of Britain’s worst serial killers. He has been linked to at least  other murdered or missing women. His stomach-churning secret trophy store of  items of women’s clothing indicated he may have raped and­ murdered many more. But Wiltshire Police have allocated only £, to a cold-case review codenamed Operation Major. The existence of the taskforce and the funding, led by Det Supt Jeremy Carter, was ­uncovered by the Sunday People using the Freedom of Information Act. But the force refuse to saythey have made any ­arrests or taken a single statement since launching the review in . The £, has been branded “peanuts” by a retired detective who led a review into ­murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler’s case.    And mums Karen and Joan, who have forged a strong bond, are united in their condemnation of the small amount. Karen said: “You will never, ever, ever get closure butthe police response was adequate then at least some loved ones could put them to rest. “To put £, into the investigation is despicable. “Halliwell will ­never confess ­anything. He wants to have an element of mystery and will never disclose anything.” “But there will be loads of evidence and I am adamant that Halliwell is a serial killer, one of the worst in history. “It just makes me sick. They should be doing more to help the loved ones of his victims so they can give them the burial they should have.” And Joan said: “How could they possibly put in such a small amount  “If there are so many other victims how far can this go   “It’s an insignicant figure. Victims’ families want peace and they’ll never get it with this level of investment. “There’s law in this country but ­unfortunately not a lot of justice.” Ex-Detective Superintendent Steve Fulcher, who put Halliwell behind bars, said Claudia’s disappearance “fits Halliwell’s pattern of behaviour” of abducting women walking alone late at night or early in the morning. Only two of Halliwell’s ­“trophy” items have ever been ­identied. One was a cardigan worn by Becky, who disappeared in Swindon in  and a high-heeled boot that Sian was wearing before she was abducted in . Halliwell is feared to have killed up to  more women including Claudia, mum-of-four Linda Razzell who the killer was said to be obsessed with after doing building work at her home, and ­university ­graduate Melanie Hall, who disappeared in  after leaving a nightclub in Bath. Halliwell could be linked to further unsolved murders including those of Julie Finley, Carol Clark, Jackie Waines and Yvonne Fitt. Becky’s mum Karen has carried out her own investigations, and in  discovered a possible link between Halliwell and Claudia Lawrence.  Her enquiries uncovered a witness who claimed Halliwell had been seen talking to Claudia through a taxi ­window before she vanished in York in March . Halliwell’s dad lived in Huddersfield, an hour from Claudia’s home, giving him a link to the Yorkshire area. Karen said at the time: “The description of Claudia’s [alleged] murderer is identical to [Christopher Halliwell] – a left-handed smoker, ft -ins, with slightly receding hair and a skinny build. Claudia was askinghe had change so she could ring her dad from a call box.” Officers at Wiltshire Police initially refused to say how much they were spending on the cold case review. They claimed the information would “further perpetuate the distress of the family, friends and those who knew Becky and Sian”. But after the Sunday People ­appealed against the decision, cops admitted the dedicated fund was no more than £,. Retired police chief Kevin Moore, who led a review into the hunt for -year-old Milly Dowler’s killer Levi Bellfield, , said: “In policing terms this figure is ­peanuts.” Mr Moore revealed he once spent £, on a forensic dig linked to Scottish serial killer Peter Tobin.  The ex-Chief Superintendent of Sussex Police said: “£, will not go very far at all. What it says to me is that this is simply an ­appeasement exercise ­because the force are under pressure and Halliwell’s crimes won’t go away. “They need to be seen to be doing something. “Butyou consider the costs of forensics, especially on the  items of clothing they discovered, this is a drop in the ocean.” Halliwell murdered Sian O’Callaghan just two minutes after she got into his cab in Swindon on March , . She had been brutally beaten and stabbed. Having guided cops to the remote spot where he had dumped her body, Halliwell suddenly ­confessed: “I’m a sick f***er. I need help. Do you want ­another one ” The fiend then revealed where cops could find Becky’s body – who police did not even know was missing. Catching a double killer led to Det Supt Fulcher being hailed a hero by the families and twice ­nominated for the Queen’s Police Medal. But his decision to break police guidelines and drive Halliwell to where he thought Sian might be found alive, instead of taking him to the police ­station for a formal interview, cost him his job. Halliwell was convicted in  of murdering Becky and given a whole le sentence. Det Supt Jeremy Carter, of Wiltshire Police, said: “The figure of £, does not cover any of the salaries of those working on this case but relates purely to specialist work such as forensic digs and searches, and specic expert advice. “Officers working on this case carry out a vast amount of work as part of their daily duties which would not be ­captured in this figure. “The force continue to maintain dedicated staff who work on this job.” POTENTIAL VICTIMS OF CHRISTOPHER HALLIWELL CLAUDIA LAWRENCE  Chef Claudia Lawrence, , disappeared between the night of March  and morning of March   in York. A witness later said he saw Christopher Halliwell talking to Claudia through a taxi window. Halliwell’s absent father once lived “a few streets” from where she was last seen and it is possible he knew the historic city. SALLY ANN JOHN  Sex worker Sally Ann John, , vanished in September  near Christopher Halliwell’s Swindon home. Despite continuous appeals, she has never been found. She allegedly sent a postcard shortly after she disappeared - but police later ruled this as a fake. SANDRA BREWIN Sandra Brewin disappeared from her parents’ home in  aged  just months after she became pen-friends with a man in prison in Oxfordshire. LINDA RAZZELL  MUM-of-four Linda Razzell, , disappeared from Swindon in . Her husband Glyn was convicted of her killing but continues to protest his innocence. Halliwell was said to be obsessed with Linda four years before her murder after doing building work on their home in Swindon. VERA HOLLAND  Vera Holland’s partially clothed body was found on a tip in Berkshire in November . The -year-old had been strangled, dumped among rubbish and her body set on fire. Cold case cops later confirmed they were working to seeChristopher Halliwell could be responsible. TINA PRYER  University of Bath cleaner Tina Pryer, , has not been seen since she vanished on April , , when she got into a taxi near her home town of Trowbridge, Wilts. THI HAI NGUYEN  Vietnamese immigrant Thi Hai Nguyen, , has not been seen since she went missing from her temporary home in June . She had only been in the town for a matter of weeks and her disappearance was not widely publicised or appealed for as it was thought at the time that she may have simply moved on to a dferent city or travelled back home. JULIE FINLEY  Julie Finley, , vanished from the centre of Liverpool on August , , and was found strangled a day later in Rainford, Lancs. Halliwell is said to have lived just four miles from the field where Julie’s naked body was dumped. CAROL CLARK  Carol Clark, , was snatched from the Bristol red light district in March  and dumped in a canal at ­Sharpness, Glos. Pathologists believed she had either suffered a heavy blow to the neck or been strangled. Halliwell lived  miles away at the time and was a narrowboat enthusiast with a good knowledge of the canals. JACKIE WAINES  Jackie Waines was a -year-old mum-of-three who was abducted from Bristol’s red light district and murdered in . Her body was dumped on a bridlepath at Frampton Cotterell, Glos. She was stabbed repeatedly. Halliwell was at the time living  miles away in Highworth, north of Swindon, Wilts. YVONNE FITT  A mother who had worked as a prostitute in Leeds, Yvonne last seen on January , , in Bradford –  miles away from Halliwell’s dad’s home in Huddersfield. Her murdered body was discovered in a shallow grave outside Otley, West Yorkshire. MELANIE HALL  University graduate Melanie Hall, , disappeared in  after leaving a nightclub in Bath, Somerset. Her remains were found off an M slipway  years later.

The Windsors are nothingnot sticklers for official protocol but that hasnapost stopped ious royal brides and grooms going their own way now and again. For example, women tying the knot usually borrow tiaras from the Queenaposs vault for their big day. But a few brides have broken this tradition and have chosen for their own headpieces, including Princess Diana when she married Charles in . Here are some other royal traditions that have been smashed by newlyweds. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle    The American actress married Dianaaposs second son at St Georgeaposs Chapel in Windsor Castle on May , last year. Unlike his grandfather Prince Phillip and brother William, the Duke of Sussex decided to wear a wedding ring when he married Meghan. Harry further broke with tradition after selecting a platinum wedding ring rather the usual Welsh gold that has been selected in the past. Meghan - owing to her family situation - also walked herself down the aisle at, something unheard of at previous weddings. Diana Spencer and Prince Charles    Charles and Lady Di tied the knot on July ,  at St Paulaposs Cathedral. It was the first time a Prince of Wales had married in more than  years, and attracted a huge television audience from around the world. In many ways it was the most traditional royal wedding you can imagine - except for one word. Diana started a new tradition of her own when she chose to remove aposobeyapos in her marriage vows. Some  years later  Kate Middleton chose to do exactly the same thing when she married Dianaaposs eldest son. Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank  The coupleaposs wedding had one major change from protocol  when Princess Beatrice became the maid of honour for the occasion  - an unusual role for a royal of her status. Beatrice is technically ahead of her sister in the line of succession and this would typically prevent her from taking up the such an honour. Such a long-standing rule prevented Kate from being Pippa Middletonaposs maid of honour in  but an exception was made in the case of Beatrice due to the pairaposs similar rank.  Kate Middleton and Prince William   The future King and Queen of England got hitched at Westminster Abbey on April , . Millions tuned in live to watch the monumental day eight years ago but it dfered from other memorable royal weddings in one way. Most royal brides are whisked way on their honeymoon the day of their wedding. For example, the Queen and Prince Phillip spent their wedding night in Broadlands, Hampshire. But Prince William and Kate instead spent the night in Buckingham Place and only embarked on their honeymoon to the Seychelles ten days later.

Bobby said: “We always joked Ciara wears the trousers in the relationship, so it made sense for her to wear them at the wedding.  “Ciara said she wouldn’t be walking down the aisle for me, so I walked down the aisle for her. So we decided to do everything backwards.I took her family name. It was so relaxed and everyone had a great laugh. There were a few gobsmacked faces.” Ciara said the idea kicked off when they visited the wedding venue and she joked that he should walk down the aisle instead of her. “We decided it would be so funny. Me and Bobby can be a bit wacky and we thoughtwe did it, it would really break the ice and give everyone good form at the start of the day. “We wrote the ceremony as well.” They kept their plans a secret from nearly all the guests until the big day.    The bridesmaids knew they would be wearing tuxedos, but the groomsmen had no idea they’d be in frocks. Bobby, , said: “I wouldn’t let them try the outfits on before in case they backed out, but on the day, they loved it. They cried tears of bemusement when they saw the dresses. “We were all in hysterics. I was a size  and they were all s. “Ciara and the girls had no problem buying their tuxes, but we had a lot of trouble. “A lot of places didn’t want me to try stuff on. The bridal places we tried were reluctant, so I ended up buying online.” Ciara, , added: “The bridesmaids were fine with the suits – girls can look really good in suits. “But my brother was one of Bobby’s groomsmen and he kept texting me, ‘when are we getting our suits ’. I had to say, ‘you aren’t getting one’. “Because they are all hairy and tattooed, it was funnier.”  Bobby, an HR executive from Swansea, South Wales, even persuaded his dad Linton to walk him down the aisle. “When I told my dad what we were doing he shook his head, looked at the ground and said, ‘What are you like ’ “He didn’t give me a pep talk – just said, ‘let’s get this done’. Bobby admitted he was a bag of nerves before his appearance in front of their  guests in Belfast last month.  “When the door opened, everyone there erupted in applause and laughter. It really carried me down the aisle,” he said. The couple wrote most of their own vows – and exchanged balls and chains, as well as rings.  Bobby said: “Although the service was quite funny and shocking – we weren’t doing it to make a mockery of marriage. “It was a big thing for both of us, all the words in the service were so personal.” The couple hooked up three years ago – despite a cringe-making first meeting. Bobby was on holiday in Barcelona when he and a mate popped into a pub, where he spotted Ciara serving behind the bar. Assuming she was Spanish and couldn’t understand English, he started telling his friend how much he fancied her.  “I thought she was a sexy Spanish girl, with beautul eyes, with a proper naughty glint in them,” he said. “I was chatting to my mate saying, ‘oh, she’s stunning’ and it turned out she was Irish and understood everything I was saying.” Bobby and his pal had only gone into the bar for one drink, but he ended up staying there all day and he and Ciara shared a kiss later that night. “I fell in love with her the moment she opened her mouth. She’s got the most savage personality,” he said. Ciara said Bobby’s infectious laugh was the main source of attraction. She said: “We just clicked straight away, we laughed so much. “To meet a partner you can laugh with all the time – I’ve never been with a guy before who’d wear a dress for me. He just doesn’t care.” "},{"url":null,"title":"hotel managers witty reply after","story":"NewsHotel managers witty reply after  star TripAdvisor complaint about no daylight at pmThe reviewer, a tourist from Denmark, said the blinds at the Imperial Hotel in Cork City, Ireland, did not allow any daylight in their room - but they didnt arrive until after dark and left earlyShareCommentsByCormac OSheaLorraine King:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT NewsThe guest complained about the Imperial Hotel in Cork\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

She was a student at the University of St Andrewaposs in Scotland with Prince William, and was good friends with her husband-to-be for years before they finally got together. While Wills skipped Freshersapos Week - a university tradition of welcoming new students with a week of nights out and partying - Kate fully embraced it. In her book Kate: The Future Queen, royal expert Katie Nicholl claims Kate had hectic week of partying, meeting her aposuniversity parents - older pupils who were in charge of looking after freshers - finding her way around town and settling into her residence hall. Kate Middleton before she was royal - from nights out to amazing holidays   Kate soon found her way around and was often seen relaxing in the common room, curled up in an armchair, a cup of tea in hand, either reading newspaper articles her father rather touchingly mailed to her of getting to knew her fellow hall mates. When William finally did arrive the following week, there was obviously a lot of excitement. He moved into the flat above Kateaposs and it didnapost take him long to notice the stunning brunette - probably because of the nickname she was given by her peers. According to Katie, she had been dubbed aposBeautul Kateapos by the end of Freshersapos Week.    She writes: She was initially more reserved than many of the other young women, but her natural beauty was apparent. Tanned from a recent holiday in Barbados with her parents, fit from regular early morning run or swim, and dressed in her comfortable Hennes jeans, fitted sweater and signature cowboy boots, she radiated an outer freshness and an inner confidence. Wills reportedly worked up the courage to ask her to join him and his friends for breakfast one day and they quickly became close friends. Unsurprisingly, lots of the male students were very interested in Kate and she had countless offers of dates.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA British company has been accused of scamming the vulnerable families of autistic kids by flogging them a “ludicrous” quack therapy of expensive silica-rich water.  Silica Waters, run by husband and we team Rex Garratt and Wendy Latham, claims its product has “beneficial effects”. Prices for the ACILIS bottles – sourced from a Malaysian rainforest – range from £. for six to £ for a large crate. PR guru and co-director Garratt told the People he sends autism support groups “free introductory samples” and parents of autistic kids “get a  per cent discount”. But two university professors have rubbished claims there is scientic support for therapeutic benefits for autism sufferers.   And a mother with two autistic children who the company approached via Twitter branded its operation “horrible”.Outraged Emma Dalmayne, who runs the Autistic Inclusive Meets support group, said: “The idea that water can cure autism is ludicrous. I’ve done lots of research into the science surrounding autism. “But other parents could have been taken advantage of, which is horrible. Many are vulnerable and all they want to do is protect their kids. Some are surviving on benefits caring for their children.” The Silica Waters website says it has “anecdotal testimonials” from parents who say the water has been of “signicant benefit”. The site also flags up research which claims a link between autism and high levels of aluminium in the brain, and suggests the water can reduce aluminium levels in the body. The blurb also suggests other health benefits of drinking silica-rich water regularly include helping MS.  But a People probe revealed that the scientist who wrote the papers the company relies upon is controversial academic Professor Chris Exley, who works at Keele University, Staffordshire. A GoFundMe page to raise funds for Prof Exley was banned amid claims it was promoting “misinformation about vaccines”.  He claimed in a scientic journal that tiny amounts of aluminium in jabs like the MMR are linked to autism. And he was once funded by the Children’s Medical Research Council, linked to the notorious US anti-vaxx lobby. The university has distanced itself from his findings, saying in June it “emphatically supports the NHS policy of vaccination”.  But Silica Waters is now pushing his theory that aluminium, found in everyday items such as tea and deodorants, can cause major neurological issues. When approached by the People, Garratt said: “We keep getting wonderful messages saying, ‘please keep this water flowing because it’s made such a dference to our child’.”   He confirmed he originally pledged  per cent of profits to Exley’s research – but the academic asked him to stop after he gave an initial £ to Keele University. He said: “It came to the professor’s attention it could be suggested he had a vested interest in the product.”  There is no suggestion Exley personally profited from cash given to his projects by Silica Waters. But Garratt is still asking for research donations to Exley’s research on the website. He said: “We are on good terms and share his research developments with our customers to keep them up to speed.”  Silica Waters, which operates as a trading name of Garratt’s PR firm, Link Us, sent an unsolicited message to Emma’s autism support group.  A rep said: “Lots of parents of autistic children tell us how our water has such positive effects on their children. Please note we also send free introductory samples to support groups.” When -year-old Emma, mum to Damien, , and Skylar, seven, asked them to explain how the water Emma, from Plumstead, South London, then said: “We have so many families that would benefit. Have you had any children cured of all symptoms of autism ” And she says the rep replied: “Many parents, some from other support groups, find improvements and write to us about this. Yes.”  Garratt and Latham denied telling parents their water could cure autism when we quizzed them.  Garratt, who worked in PR for the Malaysian tourist board, said: “The word yes would be taken out of contextit was suggested that reply was, ‘yes, this cures symptoms of autism’. We’d never say that because we have close relationships with many parents and they’d be happy to share with you that under no circumstances would we ever suggest this water can cure autism.” Latham added: “We are super-careful and don’t make unsubstantiated claims. We say many people have told us it helps them.” But askedshe personally thought the water could cure autism, she said: “I’ve got an open mind and so has Rex.”  Garratt, , from Hove, East Sussex, cites Exley’s research extensively. His site states: “Prof Exley’s research has shown a hypothesis linking aluminium accumulation in the body and neurological conditions, and revealed ... silica water removes aluminium from the body. Silica is also known to help promote softer skin, shinier hair and supple joints.” But small print stresses: “The link between aluminium neurotoxicity and neurological conditions remains a hypothesis.” Exley – pictured with Garratt in , holding a bottle of his water – last night insisted he had “no connection” to Silica Waters. He said: “We’ve shownyou drink anything rich in silicon it removes aluminium from your body. If other people interpret that to mean aluminium is the cause of autism and removing it could help, that’s their interpretation. “Silica Waters contacted us at Keele to offer  percent of profits, to fund research. My university turned that down. We received one donation for £-odd.” Exley said the crowdfunding was set up by a third party without his knowledge, adding: “Keele does not allow crowdfunding projects.” And responding to criticism from fellow academics, he said: “Name me an academic who is qualied in any way to criticise what we have done.” aposNo evidence for irresponsible claimsapos "},{"url":null,"title":"uk weather forecast sub zero","story":"NewsUK weather forecast: Sub-zero temperatures to blast Britain with widespread frostBritons will be able to enjoy a bit of sun today before the weather turns windy and showery as soon as Monday, the Met Office saysShareCommentsByTfany Lo:,  OCT NewsWidespread frost will sweep the country \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

Despite buying them aposripe and readyapos they remain hard as stone for what seems a letime before turning soft, brown and unappealing the moment your back is turned. A crafty mum has shared her very simple process for ensuring her family have perfect avocados all year round. The founder of the popular Facebook page aposSlow Cooker Recipes  Tipsapos revealed she found a way to freeze sliced avocados fresh out of the skin, making them easy to use in meals and sandwiches.    This is a little trick Iaposve been doing with avocado, she explains. I heard that you can buy it frozen, but was never able to find it anywhere. So I thought, aposwhy not freeze it myself apos. It works amazingly well. She says you can stop the fruit browning in the freezer but onlyyou follow her instructions, as reported by the Daily Mail. After buying a fresh avocado, cut it in half, take the pit out and slice it or cut it into chunks. Lay it all out on a tray lined with parchment paper and freeze. Remove the frozen slices after one day and put them all into one bag and throw them back in the freezer.    Freezing them separately first prevents the pieces of fruit from sticking together and allows you to use it one slice at a time. Genius. The mum says they stay green and she throws them in smoothies or lets them thaw and has them in sandwiches. Other people who had never considered freezing avocados are loving her trick. I had no idea it froze, one wrote. I hate wasting the left over avocado as no one  eats it in my house.

What I’ve seen since coming back is the mentality of the club changing.”And Butcher is calling on the fans to turn out in their numbers tomorrow as the Tangerines look to maintain their perfect home record on the back of three away defeats.And that kind of form, performing at two ends of the spectrum is something he and the rest of the squad are keen to put right.Butcher added: “All I can say to the fans is they need to get behind us still and they’re going to be our driving force to get us to where we need to be.“We need to make sure we’re not performing at two extremes.“We’ve been really extreme this season, going back and forth with results. The - derby win and - against Morton and then going away and losing two on the spin, you never see that coming but, ultimately, it’s about theof the season.“There’s a long way to go yet.

He was sent on as sub with  minutes left as Aberdeen trailed the Hoops -.However, after only eight minutes Cosgrove received a red card for a high challenge which chopped down Celtic captain Scott Brown.After that, many were quick to write off the -year-old.But since then he’s proved them wrong, netting  goals last season and bagging  in  games so far this term, meaning he heads into today#s game as the player Celtic are most wary of.Reflecting on Cosgrove’s debut and his journey to this point, Pittodrie gaffer McInnes said: “Looking back at that day I actually thought he was a bit unlucky.“He was just so pumped up and I don’t think there was any malice in what he did, he was just a bit over-eager.“That was a sobering moment and that was probably the moment when he had reached the bottom and he had to come up from there.“My god how he has come from there, and it’s a brilliant story for big Sam.“It’s only going to get better for him and I take confidence from his confidence and how he’s been.“For me he’s come such a long way in a short space of time and that’s % down to him.”Prior to his debut red card, McInnes says he saw glimpses of what Cosgrove could offer.He hailed the frontman for making the critics change their minds.McInnes added: “As bizarre as it sounds in the very little time he was on that day, I thought he caused them one or two problems.“To start with he was giving us what we wanted. We got the ball into the box a few times because he was holding the ball up and getting us up the pitch.“We saw a wee hint of what we were going to get, but the red card mars all of that and criticism comes because of that.“Sam was aware of that and that people were judging him too early. For a young player that’s not always easy to deal with.“If people are making their mind up that he’s no good it’s tough and I think it was unfair.“He’s actually managed to change people’s assessment of him since then.”McInnes has witnessed at close quarters the transformation in Cosgrove.As well as the goalscoring exploits on the pitch, the Dons boss has seen the hard work put in off the park from Cosgrove to make himself a better player.With his contract at Pittodrie running until the summer of , McInnes also believes there is more to come from the striker in an Aberdeen shirt.He said: “You very rarely see that in a young player or a young person now having that confidence. But he has grabbed his opportunity and worked so hard.“You look at his body shape now and he’s night and day from what he was when he turned up at the club.“He carries himself like a No , he carries himself like a guy with the goal ratio he has.“And I do feel there is still more to come from Sam.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/10/5db1d339442a18.51269345-406x564.jpg ","title":"adopt a pet xxx xxx and xxxxx are looking for a new home can you help 2","story":"Are you looking to get a new pet  Why not adopt one of these adorable pets from Mrs Murray’s Cat and Dog Home.Vulcan likes to be the boss and will need a strong experienced owner who will not let him always get his own way.He can be very excitable around people but can also be temperamental and will growl or snap when being told off.He is not suitable to be rehomed around children or other animals.

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee.

Two men were paid to accompany Patrick the Fool on his journey from England to provide entertainment for the King and his guests while residing at Tarbert.Also recorded is a figure for #making a suit for the King at Tarbert#.  Bruce visited Tarbert on many occasions. His final visit was in the year of his death.Tarbert is believed to have been one of the earliest Royal Burghs in Argyll. An early reference as such was made in . It is also said to have had one of the earliest paved streets in Scotland.King James IV also had a close connection with Tarbert. The addition of the #keep# to the castle, part of which still stands today, was constructed at his direction. Whilst this work was underway, James summoned parliament to meet him here to discuss matters local to the area. This meeting took place on July  .Over the years, many travellers of note have passed this way and commented on Tarbert and its scenic surroundings.In  Thomas Pennant arrived by sea at East Loch Tarbert and described the scenery as #picturesque#.CGS Teighnmouthpassed through the Kyles of Bute in  and commented that #it offers no scenery worthy of notice#. He continued to note that #the romantic little harbour of East Loch Tarbert – with the overhanging keep of its ruined castle # form a scene singularly picturesque#.

Similarly, Visit Scotland is reported as having raised no objection as well as closing all its tourist offices in Cowal, Mid Argyll and Kintyre in the past year.With the recent decline in the Loch Fyne fishing industry, Tarbert is increasingly dependent on tourism to provide employment.Other issues include the sterilisation of ground under the proposed line of overhead wiring.

Her partner Rebecca Taylor read music as an organ scholar at Lincoln College, Oxford before attending the Royal Academy of Music where she was a Junior Fellow and completed the MA in Piano Accompaniment.The audience were introduced to the pair with an intense piece by Mozart about burning letters and it certainly woke us up. We moved onto Schubert’s #Du Bist Die Ruh# which was beautully controlled by both singer and pianist.This was contrasted with Shubert’s angsty #Gretchen am Spinnrade# and I commend Rebecca Taylor for playing the right hand part with ease. The journey then moved through Schumann and into Brahms where the audience murmured in agreement at the rollercoaster of emotions before us.As we reached Wolf the themes took a darker turn in a short but intense piece about crying tears of blood. Swtly moving onto Strauss and Mahler the audience were given songs of simple love, a sing off between a cuckoo and a nightingale and a man in great pain which reigned the audience in with a spiritual lull.The second half opened with a stunning rendition of Faure’s #Apres Un Reve#. Through Debussy’s impressionist piece, Rinaldo Hahn’s Operatic journey and into Du Parc comforting his love with a dream like harp created by the piano.The duo then gave us a contemporary piece by Joseph Horowitz which comprised of snippets from the monologues of Shakespeare’s Lady Macbeth and the music tracks her descent into madness.

Ordinary because she was searching for the same thing as many of us: love, understanding and purpose.But the journey was stormy for Mary as she speaks of the hell she had to go through to find them.Mary was born in Yorkshire in a decaying northern town to a dysal family in . At three years old she witnessed her father beating her mother as she clung to her baby brother believing they were going to die.At the age of seven she moved with her family to her parentrsquos home town in north west England. But the nightmare of abuse continued for a decade.Growing up in a culture of misogynistic oppression and irrational hate, Mary escaped to Wales to work in a sea-side hotel where she became ldquoenlightened by coastal beauty.In the years that followed she trained as a nurse and worked in some of the most prestigious hospitals across England.But the storm was set toin Maryrsquos le. Following a disastrous marriage she was haunted by the demons of her past. Despite embarking on a journey of healing and hope, years later she was rocked by her fatherrsquos suicide, a second failed marriage, and a near death episode following the insertion of surgical mesh, regarded by some as the biggest health scandal since Thalidomide.Through the darkness of her le, Mary discovered her inner courage and faith, combined with her love of nature, books and music, she began to glimpses of light and hope.She said: ldquoI felt compelled to write my memoirs which describe my personal journey of self discovery, falling in love with nature, animals, beauty and God. It is a heartfelt odyssey of survival.ldquoMy book attempts to expressively and reflectively trace the stories of my le. In order to survive and thrive after abuse and loss, personal meaning must be made of what has been suffered.ldquoThe style of this book provides an aid to the grieving process as well as challenge social stigma and discrimination associated with mental health problems.Mary felt compelled to write her story over  years ago. ldquoI wanted to reach out and share my story of survival from a childhood littered with abuse and neglect.However, her story was far from its ending and the years that followed provided further tales of survival.The unknown author began penning her memoirs three years ago and her manuscript was accepted by Arrow Gate Publishing without an agent or publicist.Although Maryrsquos memoirs are harrowing at times, they are also full of hope.

Set in the Western Indian Territory just after the turn of the th century, the spirited rivalry between the local farmers and cowboys provides the backdrop for a love story between Curly, a handsome cowboy, and Laurey, a beautul farm girl.But the road to true love is a bumpy one, especially as sinister farm-hand Jud Fry has his sights set on Laurey, and hersquoll do whatever it takes to get her.But Laurey isnrsquot the only girl in Oklahoma with cowboy troubles. Her ditzy friend Ado Annie just loves it when a fella talks purty to her! Shersquos taken up with the Peddler man who doesnrsquot want her.Meanwhile cowboy Will Parker desperately wants the irrepressible Annie to be his bride. But for him its lsquoall of nothinrsquo.

First up was Curlyhis rival Jud Fryand Andrew Carnes .Itrsquos Finrsquos first show with KIYT and hersquos looking forward to playing the lovelorn cowboy. ldquoI was hoping to play Curly, hersquos a kind guy with a big heart.

They are a great group of people.Oliver is playing Ado Anniersquos protective father Andrew Carnes, who doesnrsquot want cowboy Will Parker to marry his daughter.ldquoHe is a bold character and fatherly figure, said Oliver. ldquoIrsquom working on the accent, itrsquos going pretty well.And the most feared character is Jud Fry, played by Nathan Pirie. I have to say, he didnrsquot strike me as the typical villain. That was until I saw him in action during rehearsal!ldquoIrsquove always wanted to be an actor and be the bad guy, he said. ldquoI have to put on quite a low voice for my character. Hersquos a dark person. Irsquom looking forward to the wedding scene when I have a fight with Curly.This yearrsquos leading lady is Neve Scott, who last year made her debut performance with KIYT as the con-woman Lily St Regis in Annie.Neve played the ditsy, whiney floozy, but this year will grace this stage as the head-strong farm girl Laurey, who secretly loves Curly.She said: ldquoThis role is the complete opposite to the character I played last year which is great. I have some fantastic solos and I have been working on expanding my vocals to hit the powerful notes. I love having to put on an accent and Irsquove been working hard to perfect it. The whole cast are great and I canrsquot wait to perform with them.Angela Grant is new to KIYT and has landed the role of the feisty Aunt Eller. ldquoI watched the film but I really started to like my character when we began rehearsing. Itrsquos my first acting role and Irsquom enjoying being part of a musical theatre group. When all the cast get together for scenes therersquos a great atmosphere.I caught up with George Brydon who is saddling up to play cowboy Will Parker. ldquoI feel very excited to play Will because hersquos a happy-go-lucky sort of guy with some sick moves, and Irsquom looking forward to learning the two-step. Irsquom loving being in Oklahoma. Itrsquos a great show with classic songs.Unfortunately I didnrsquot get the chance to catch all the cast ndash perhaps Ado Annie was too busy to peel herself away from the smooth-talking cowboys!I did, however, sneak a peek at the auction scene being rehearsed.

further improvements are required across much of the local authorityambitious savings plans and satisfaction ratings are to be met.Audit Scotland carried out a major review into Scottish Borders Council between January and May.As well as interviewing councillors and senior officers, auditors sat in on meetings, reviewed documents and files, and held meetings with trade union representatives.While the resulting -page report card highlights an improving picture since the previous audit in , bosses have been told to communicate better and form better relationships with partners, such as NHS Borders.The report also highlights required improvements in some departments and the need for elected councillors to be better equipped for the tough decisions they face.Graham Sharp, chair of the Accounts Commission, told us: ldquoThe continued progress Scottish Borders Council has made to transform services is encouraging.\"Now it must focus on several critical areas including tackling underperforming services, ensuring councillors have the right training to enable them to fulfil their responsibilities and getting to grips with both staff and community engagement.Across the  performance indicators used in the Best Value Assurance Report, Scottish Borders Council was found to be below average in more than half.While education and social work are doing well, other aspects of the local authority arent quite making the grade.A lack of investment in creating employment and boosting tourism was criticised, as was the low amount of contracts awarded to local companies and the fall in the number of bills settled within  days.The deteriorating condition of local authority buildings was also highlighted.Problems since the outsourcing of IT services to multinational firm CGI - a -year contract worth pound million - were also raised by auditors.While the report identies the delays and issues which plagued customer access of the councils online services, auditors said it was too soon to gauge the impact of iPads taking over more traditional teaching methods in Borders schools from this year.And the methodology of farming out senior staff, such as the Executive Director for Commercial Activity spending four days of his week as managing director of the failed SB Cares, and the Executive Director for Strategic Partnerships seconded to the South of Scotland Enterprise Agency three days each week, was also questioned.The report stated: \"While this is a positive and innovative approach aimed at realising the councils wider ambitions, it must continue to ensure that there is sufficient capacity to deliver local services.\"But, perhaps, coming in for the most criticism was the current culture of secrecy and the need for better communication and engagement with staff, councillors and the public.The report stated: \"The council should be more effective in evaluating, managing and reporting its performance, bringing greater clarity on where and how its services need to improve.\"It also needs to get better at the reporting of performance - both in terms of information considered by members and in reporting to the public.\"Budgeting at the local authority, though, was applauded by auditors.And, during extremely dficult economic times, the managing to maintain its usable reserves in case of emergencies was also identied.Although Audit Scotland identied further development was needed for the ambitious Fit for  mid-term savings plan, which aims to trim pound. million from budgets by , the report is complimentary of cost cutting to date.The report stated: \"The council has a good record of achieving savings and has reflected the impact of demographic change on demands for services and pay increases for staff, in its financial plans.\"However, in common with all other councils, the financial outlook remains a signicant challenge.\"Council chief executive Tracey Logan welcomed the detailed analysis of her local authority.And she admitted many of the problems in the Audit Scotland report are already being tackled.She told us: \"We will take on board Audit Scotlandrsquos feedback and recommendations, many of which we had already identied ourselves and are taking action on, and continue to drive forward transformational change across all our services through our Fit for  programme.,params: .pushldquoFor example, we are already actively working with NHS Borders to improve joint working, and we also recognise that we need to do more to respond to the Community Empowerment Act in order to encourage and enable people to play their part more easily in their communities.ldquoA key priority for us going forward will be to improve our performance monitoring and measurement to demonstrate on a regular basis that the councilrsquos services are continuing to meet best value and identy quickly areas where further improvements are needed.\"Looking after our most vulnerable people and giving our children the best start in le are key priorities for the council and we are justiably proud of our track record across these areas.ldquoHowever, the report recognises

Council will be asked rethink its controversial playparks proposals, following two petitions that were signed by over a thousand concerned residents.In May , the council agreed plans to consult on the possible closure of  small playparks it says are underused and falling into disrepair.Instead, the council plans to spend poundm over the next decade on six large playparks, three skateparks and four fitness shelters.However, following a backlash from residents in Hawick and Kelso, two petitions have been handed into the local authority objecting to the plans.Nine Kelso playparks are at risk of closure: High Croft Meadow Court Orchard Park Rosewood Gardens Springwood Rise Spylaw Park Sydenham Court Woodside Gardens and the Kelso petition has attracted  signatures.Ten playparks are at risk in Hawick: Bowden Road Burnfoot School Hawick Green Hislop Gardens Leaburn Drive Mayfield Millers Knowe Waverley Walk Wellington Court and Wilson Drive and the Hawick petition has attracted  signatures.Those petitions were presented to the councilrsquos audit and scrutiny committee today, October , so it could hear from the lead petitioners and decide how to respond.Appearing before the committee, Kirsty Wichary, lead petitioner for Kelso, told councillors: ldquoWhat do we want our towns to look like in the future  Financial constraints aside, do we not look to have a beautul Borders, with outdoor spaces for all to enjoy ldquoHow did we get to this point, where there is no money for these parks  Investing in new technology for education is to be applauded, butparents had a choice, which would they choose ldquoTechnology isnrsquot helping our children to lead healthy, well-rounded lives. The stress of being a youngster in the st century is enormous.ldquoWe should be investing in more play areas and green spaces instead of taking them away.ldquoThe thought of removing these playparks seems a very backwards step, a step towards a cultural desert and a future for our youngsters with more weight problems, more mental health issues and future generations unable to communicate effectively, even within their own peer groups.ldquoDo you really want to be remembered as the council who handed out iPads but took away the parks Hawickrsquos lead petitioner, Greg Dalgliesh, owner of the townrsquos Think Fitness  Less gym in Hawick, was unable to attend the meeting due to a family bereavement, soHawick and Hermitage councillor Watson McAteer presented his petition on his behalf.He told the committee: ldquo mainly local residents, parents and family members in Hawick have chosen to exercise their right to object to a proposal that would see  playparks across the Scottish Borders, including  in Hawick, the largest town in the Borders, effectively close as a result of a disinvestment of financial support from this council.ldquoThe vast majority of these people and the many who support this action through other means are stakeholders in Scottish Borders Council. They live here, they are required to pay their council tax and, consequently, they have a right to determine how that money should be spent.ldquoI quote from the petition: lsquowe believe in this instance lsquobigger and better facilitiesrsquo should not be justication to remove the smaller playparks that are situated in the ious housing estates in Hawick and the Borders.ldquolsquoIt is very clear from the comments associated with this petition and via social media these smaller parks are still well used and have been described as a safe place to play and exercise on the doorstep of many homes.ldquo lsquoNot everyone can access the likes of Wilton Lodge Park on a regular basis, and children with additional needs also find these areas too busy and noisyrsquo.Councillors discussed a number of possible actions including sending the playpark proposals back out to the public for further consultation and gauging the opinion of community councils in affected areas.In the end, councillors voted to support sending a motion to the next full council meeting, scheduled for Thursdayasking it to reconsider giving authority to officers to determine which playparks can be closed.That motion was proposed by Tweeddale East councillor Heather Anderson and seconded by Selkirkshire councillor Elaine Thornton-Nicol.A counter motion, proposed by East Berwickshire councillor Jim Fullarton and seconded by Jedburghrsquos Scott Hamilton, was also put forward, but it lost out to Ms Anderson and Ms Thornton-Nicolrsquos suggestionby five votes to three.Speaking after the meeting, Ms Wichary said: ldquoIrsquom very happy that itrsquos going to have to go back to the council to be reconsidered.ldquoIrsquom assuming, hopefully, that our petitions in both Kelso and Hawick have given them a lot of food for thought and that we wonrsquot see the closure of all the parks that were mentioned.ldquoItrsquos very clear that there are cost implications, but Irsquom quite confident that there will be some sort of compromise made.Mr McAteer added: ldquoI am delighted that the majority of the councilrsquos audit and scrutiny committee have supported the Hawick petition designed to stop the council closing a number of our playparks.ldquoTheir decision will now resulted in this matter being referred to a full meeting of Scottish Borders council where elected members

And a reminder that Im not getting any younger as I try to grow old gracefully.JCCs, now a septuagenarian, style has remained a constant.His image of the suit, shagpile black hair and sunglasses remain intact. His social realism poetic constructs seem relevant today as they did during his inception, extrapolated initially from the often nihilism and tales of social decay that earmarked punk mark one.Poetry is often a barometer of an epoch or epochs. Combining observation and the written word. JCC has become a master of mind imagery, social commentary, surrealism, and semantics and above all story telling. We get it because it resonates with us.It is us or we know someone who it references. Sometimes dystopian, often hilarious and never dull. Add the heavy Salfordian brogue the chemistry set is complete.The performance was slightly peculiar to what I was expecting.Maybe my expectations were misguided or unrealistic. There were some long periods of stand-up comedy that laboured at times.It was only when \"Johnny\" ed to his natural home of poetry recital that he got back on track. Though his joke about Billy Bragg being in crisis because he hadnt released an album in two weeks, I found amusing.But when he got back to the poetry it was a reminder why most people were here.Most poems were from the back catalogue and instantly recognisable. A greatest hit set list.JCC proceeded with Hire Car and the sharply expletive named Get Back on Drugs You Fat F***.Well it was an adult show after all.Common language for common poetry. And it never did Billy Connelly any harm. The poem insinuating it was easier to lose weight being on drugs.Beasley Street, arguably his most well-known poem received one of the best reactions of the night. Imbued with the description of a rock bottom street, a dreg of society and where everything that could go wrong did in this street. A caricature of a threadbare existentialism. Mainly bought on by social and economic deprivation.And then a natural supersession in the form of an epilogue Beasley Street Bouled recital, as the street had now changed into middle class suburbia.Next up Ive Fallen in Love with My We. A reference to marriage, the vows and marital bliss. Tongue in cheek of course.The \"bloody song\" Evidently Chickentown, was greeted with widespread applause. More nihilistic scorn and deprecation of a town, that is in a state of dys.Funny how we tend to laugh at the misfortune of others. But we do.Twat was another poem that represented consistency in tonights performance. A crowd pleaser for all times. Twat being the ultimate character assassination and castout. Bringing sporadic fits of laughter within the audience.The closing recital I Wanna Be Yours, famously adopted by The Arctic Monkeys for one of their songs, represented a slight U-turn in the writing of JCC. More linked to a character who wishes to show an undying love for someone . The positives of the human condition. Did I detect some optimism!The MacArts performance had poetry that mixes modernity with the historical. Comedic in value.When we laugh, we are laughing at ourselves. With him, not at him.

That race took place over the course of last weekend.The series featured five rounds at dferent venues, and each race was set up like a car rally, with untimed uphill transition stages leading to ious timed downhill sections, the results of which were amalgamated into an overall race time. The stages ied massively in , from as little as  seconds to an absolute behemoth we endured at Laggan in April which took us  minutes to ride! The topography and trail surface dfered wildly from venue to venue but also from stage to stage, and the taped trails we raced down last weekend at Fort William epitomised this eclectic set-up.Stage  was the easiest and least technical track we have raced on all year, an entirely man-made sprint through flowing banked corners coated in compacted quarry dust. Of course you had to be careful you didn`t push too hard, it is all too easy to wreck a race run by hitting the deck on an easy stage. We assumed that the organisers were trying to lull us into a  sense of security with stage #and we were so right!Stage  started halfway down the legendary World Cup track , channelling riders through some savage rock gardens before cutting off to the right along a lung-busting fireroad before descending into another sculpted hardpack track which then erted down a horrendously muddy, freshly cut chute that was littered with roots big enough to swallow a bike wheel whole. Even walking down it was impossible.A big transition ride towards Torlundy took us to the top of stage , which was the famous Blue Crane trail running into Ridgeline. Both of these tracks are black-graded on a good day, but there is a huge dference between trying to ride these ‘for fun’ and then trying to race on them once  people have spent a whole Saturday skidding them to bits in the tipping rain! A lot of people fell foul of this stage, but we survived and we absolutely loved it.Stage  was a dferent animal altogether. We had tackled it fairly early on practice day and hadn`t had any issues with it, but the swarm of maniacs who had ridden it in the rain since our earlier visit had turned it into an absolute swamp and the ruts were so deep that I found it almost impossible to negotiate with my limited skills. Dave telling me afterwards that he had romped it didn`t help my mood one bit!The last  stages were so high up the mountain that we needed a trip on the gondola to get to them. The black graded Top Chief track is a fearsome animal that follows the best twisty bedrock line around the hill before plummeting several hundred feet straight down off it into the tree line below, where it once again becomes sanitised into a flowing, twisty and utterly hilarious serpent of a trail that had riders drting and whooping all the way to the carpark. The organisers had cleverly split the Top Chief track into two stages, as there is a long section of perched wooden boardwalk high up on the mountain that is great fun to ride but would be far too dangerous to race on. Stage  was therefore very short -taking most riders about  seconds to ride- while stage  was a  minute monster. What a way to finish a season!So how did we do David was fastest of the three of us, as he has been all season. He finished in a time of  minutes,  seconds. He races in the Senior category , so it is a tough school littered with sponsored riders and crazy kids. He finished th in seniors on the day, and th overall out of an entry of  riders. Having failed to finish the race at Laggan earlier in the year due to a mechanical breakdown, David has been constantly playing catch-up but he still managed to finish in a brilliant nd place overall in the seniors category for the season.Alex has ridden consistently all year and has managed to tread the fine line between wrecking and ruling perfectly at every round. He had one of his very few crashes on the last stage at Fort William which cost him a few seconds, but he still ed a very respectable time of : to finish nd in the Masters category. The Masters section almost always attracts the largest entry and it is full of well-heeled chargers on very expensive steeds, so for Alex to finish in th place in that championshipin his first full season is a highly respectable result.I have continually been either on par or just slower than Alex on nearly every stage of the year, and nothing changed here. I knowI`ve kept within a few seconds of him I have done just fine, and I managed my ride to achieve this perfectly right up until the last stage where a cruel puncture right on top of the hill put paid to any chances of a good result to finish the year. With  top s already in the bag for the season though , I managed to hold onto th place in the Grand Veteran`s championship which was some consolation for a day that finished with me feeling, well, a bit deflated.Competing in this series has been a brilliant experience for us. We have had some hilarious times racing our bikes through some of Scotland`s very best scenery, and we have loved camping out of the back of vans. The organisers at No Fuss Events have done an outstanding job of setting up a professionally run race series in some dficult locations and have always managed to tread the right side of a precarious line, providing us with stages that have been just barely on the rideable side of ridiculous!David Muirhead leads Alex Dickson down the rocky Top Chief track during Saturday#s practice.

A high-energy showing in Paisley saw the McFadyens-sponsored side run out convincing winners.With the match going ahead at the Kibble’s grass park despite the heavy rain overnight and during the week leading up to the game, the surface was in surprisingly good condition, allowing the Pupils to get into their attacking flow early on.Up against a home side not lacking in height and physical stature, the Pupils had to be ready to contend with some lofted early balls from back to front by the hosts, whose game plan seemed to be to get the ball to their forwards as quickly as possible, but the Pupils# defence of Fraser Wylie, Ross Souden, Ryan McConnachie and Stuart Crossan, stood up to the task well.The Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils quick passing and inidual pace and skill in the final third caused the hosts problems early on, and Ryan Gilchrist and Gregor McFadyen, and both had almost identical attempts to score, but snatched at their shots at the vital moment.However, the Kintyre Park side would not be denied for long, and scored after  minutes through a sharp passing move that released Gregor McFayden, who buried an arrowed shot from the edge of the box to continue his excellent goalscoring form.Then, the visitors made it - after  minutes, when an enterprising move out of defence found right-back Crossan, whose ball through to Johnny McCormick allowed the right winger to cut inside onto his left foot and release a thunderous first-time drive into roof of the net for a great goal, his second of the season.After seeing their deficit doubled, Carlton for their part put their Kintyre visitors under a bit of pressure from several corners and free kicks, but the Pupils’ defensive discipline continued to win over.Into the second half, the Pupils made it - when Donald McCallum scored another great goal, in a move started by Liam Renton, whose in-swinging corner was cleared to the edge of the penalty box where the ex-Dumbarton man McCallum made space to drive a deflected shot into the top corner of the net.At this point in the match, all three subs were used, with Ellis Robertson and Michael McKinlay replacing the excellent deep-lying midfield pairing of Ryan Gilchrist and Liam Renton, and Ross Brown entering in the fray in a direct swap with winger McCormick.The youngster Brown quickly got involved to create the Pupils# fourth goal, outpacing the Carlton full-back to draw out the last defender and square the ball across for Scott Souden to cheekily chip the ball over the home keeper into the net.The rampant Pupils completed the scoring in the th minute after hesitation between a Carlton defender and his keeper allowed McFadyen to nip in, touch the ball round the keeper to score a simple but well-earned second goal, for his brace on the day, and his fourth of the season.At the other end, the Pupils were determined to get their second consecutive clean sheet in league action, and while young keeper Alistair Ferguson spilled a deflected free kick in the latter stages, he bravely ed at the feet of the striker to smother his effort. The Pupils management noted how Ferguson’s kicking and distribution was first-class throughout the match.A Pupils spokesman said: ‘It was a great team effort, with our attacking players working together to cause problems all game. At the back, we defended high balls and direct play really well.’The Pupils are in league action again tomorrowwhen they welcome Argyll rivals Lochgilphead Red Star. Kick off is pm, with Kintyre Park the expected venue.The Pupils’ Liam Renton on the ball with Ryan Gilchrist looking on at Saturday#s match in Paisley.

George reminisced: ‘It was announced at a Town Council meeting that the Royal couple was scheduled to visit. It was all to be top secret, but that didn’t happen. The next morning the #secret# was ulged in a queue in one of the town’s shops and the news was out.’With a smile that showed how fond these memories are to him, George continued: ‘The Royal Yacht Britannia was anchored out in the loch and a small boat brought the Queen and Prince Philip to the quay where my father was delegated to catch and secure the rope. They were then driven to the Town Hall and there was a huge crowd present.‘Campbeltown Gaelic Choir, conducted by Mr M G McCallum who was also a councillor, had a lovely surprise for the Royal visitors. Prince Charles had just been made Prince of Wales, so the choir sang ‘God Bless the Prince of Wales’. This was very well received, and the Queen said that she had not heard it before.’George and Mrs McMillan were present at a reception given by the Town Council in the Town Hall. George remembers that he shook hands with the Queen and spoke with the Duke of Edinburgh. He said: ‘Only those invited could speak to the Queen, but the Duke moved among the gathering and spoke to some of the councillors. I was a coal miner at Machrihanish at that time and he asked me and some other miners about our work.’He continued: ‘The food and drinks were served on silver trays by waiters in tails and bow-ties. Afterwards, when the couple was taken on a tour of the town, the heavens opened and oh how it rained and rained.’A town councillor from May  to its disbanding in , and then a councillor on the District Council and the Strathclyde Regional Council, George was to meet the Queen and other members of the Royal Family on other occasions.

But the firm has been dealt a major blow after its bid for a Government contract to buy the electricity produced by the windfarm failed. And the decision has brought angryreaction from the local community, who opposed the substation plans in the first place but were overruled by the Scottish Government.Scottish Ministers called in the substation plans after ruling the project to be of ldquonational importance last year, taking the decision out of the hands of East Lothian Council, the planning authority.Despite local representations opposing the substation, Scottish Ministers gave it the go-ahead in February amid claims it was necessary to move quickly to meet the deadline for the UK Government funding.But the UK Government announced its grants late last month and ICOL was not included in the list of successful projects, leaving the firm to rethink its future.East Lothian MSP Iain Gray said it appeared Scottish Ministersrsquo decision to ldquoride roughshod over local feeling ldquomight all have been for nothing.The former power station site was bought by the council last year and the local authority is marketing the land for economic development.However, the council was forced to reach an agreement with ICOL over a section of the site after the Scottish Government gave the substation the go-ahead.Mr Gray said: ldquoThe immediacy of the UK Government funding decision was the Scottish Governmentrsquos justication for riding roughshod over local decision-making and calling in the substation application in the first place.ldquoI opposed that decision to call in the application as unnecessary and anti-democratic and made the case for it being left in the hands of local people and their representatives.ldquoHowever, having put the local community through such uncertainty, it now appears that the Ministerrsquos heavy-handed interference in the sitersquos future might all have been for nothing. Guy Madgwick, CEO of Red Rock Power, which owns Inch Cape, said:ldquoWe are naturally very disappointed that our Inch Cape Offshore Wind Farm project has not secured a CfD award.ldquoThe development is a culmination of over  years of hard work and signicant investment and could play an important role in both achieving the countryrsquos green energy targets and supporting economic growth.ldquoWe will now liaise closely with our supply chain to consider how best to move forward with the project, and hope to share an update as soon as possible.Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, which is pushing for a ferry and cruise terminal to be investigated for the site, said the decision raised questions about Scottish Ministersrsquo decision to call in the application.He said: ldquoThis is a very worrying announcement and puts a large question mark overRed Rockrsquos planned substation at Preston Links.ldquoAt the planning enquiry last year, Red Rock placed considerable emphasis on securing a funding subsidy from the UK Government and this decision also brings into question the wisdom of the Scottish Government calling in their planning application and bypassing the local democratic planning process.East Lothian Council said it had held talks with ICOL regarding the site following the announcement and further meetings would be arranged.A spokesperson said: ldquoWe understand [Inch Cape] are considering all options to allow the project to progress.ldquoWe will hold a meeting with them in the near future to discuss a way forward."},{"url":null,"title":"long-awaited-port-seton-sports-hall-works-last","story":"The new facility will be part of the Port Seton Centre on the area currently used as the childrenrsquos play area it will allow the community hub to offer a wider array of activities, including indoor basketball, badminton, tennis, football and gymnastics.Some of the existing outdoor play equipment is being removed from the area to facilitate the building works, though this will be relocated to a new play area where within the park, along with the installation of some new play equipment.Tom Reid, head of infrastructure with East Lothian Council, said: ldquoWe are all very excited about the construction of the new sports hall, which will be an excellent new facility for the people of Cockenzie and Port Seton, complementing existing activity areas within the Port Seton Centre.ldquoWe do appreciate that there will need to be an element of disruption associated with the construction work, particularly as the new extension requires to be sited where the current childrenrsquos play park is located.ldquoWe expect to relocate elements of the existing play equipment where possible to the new area and this will be installed to coincide with the arrival of other play equipment in the coming months.ldquoWe recognise this means that there will be a temporary reduction in the amount of play equipment available within the park and we are grateful for the patience and understanding of park users at this time.

It was a wild autumn day and the wind was whipping up foamy waves which crashed against the shore. It wasnrsquot summer warm but neither was it cold. The wind had a strange mildness in its touch.His grandson was in the joy of the moment, finding shells, climbing rocks and throwing stones into the sea. His grandfather watched, wishing he too could join in the fun. But age had crept up on him. His joints tweaked with pain every time he tried to behave like his younger self, making him very cautious. So he found a rock on which to sit and watched over his grandson as he explored.His thoughts were taken away from the beach and he began to think of his we. She had dearly loved their grandson but sadly she was only an image in a photograph for her grandson now. He was too young when she died to have any real memories of her. It was at moments like this that he missed her most, for she loved the beach. And at night, of course, for he was still unused to sleeping alone after  years of sharing the night with the woman he loved. It didnrsquot seem right, men were supposed to be outlived by women, not left behind like this.Suddenly, his attention was caught by the sight of his grandson wading into the sea, still wearing his shoes and socks.ldquoNo lad, yoursquoll...Too late, he was jumping in the waves, splashing and laughing. His granddad rose from his rock and walked over to him.ldquoCome on granddad, jump the waves with me, he called out, his face beaming with joy. The boyrsquos shoes were now completely soaked, as were the lower part of his trousers. The old man knew he would be in trouble with his daughter for allowing this to happen. Common sense told him to get annoyed and tell his grandson to come out immediately andto the car.ldquoI donrsquot think your mum will ever trust me again to look after you, he said.Another wave rolled in and the young lad screamed with delight and jumped over it.ldquoCome on granddad!The old man reckoned that the boyrsquos shoes were already soaked and a few more minutes in the sea wouldnrsquot make things any worse. He couldnrsquot bend down properly to take his own shoes off, but he waded into the sea anyway. He kept himself steady with his walking stick in one hand, and took the hand of his grandson with the other.They stood together and watched as a wave rolled in. The boy yelled with delight as he jumped over it, holding fast onto his granddadrsquos hand, who made his walking stick jump over it.ldquoAgain granddad, again, the young lad called out, laughing. Wave after wave came in and they faced them together.ldquoWe need to go now and get dry and warm up, said his granddad after a while.ldquoJust one more, please!And so they had one more wave jump together and headed for the car, both equally soaked. When they arrived at the car, their shoes and trouser bottoms were coated in sand, like breaded haddock.The boyrsquos mother was waiting in the car.She looked at their shoes and trousers. ldquoDad, what on earth have you been doing  His shoes are soaking and so are yours! I donrsquot believe it, what were you thinking  And now my car will be full of sand.ldquoI was thinking of your mum, he said. ldquoShe loved the beach and jumping the waves when we were young, and so did you when you were wee.ldquoYes, but not with our shoes on! said his daughter angrily, peeling off a sock from her son and pointing to his sodden shoes.ldquoLook at your shoes, dad, yoursquore not a child, you should know better.ldquoIt was so fun, mum, said her son, asto explain the state they were in.When they got back to the house, the granddad went to a cupboard and took out a box.

They are jumping the waves together.ldquoLike us.ldquoYes, except your mum fell over and got her clothes wet.The old manrsquos daughter smiled. ldquoI remember that day so well, she said, ldquoit was so funny, didnrsquot mum fall and get her clothes wet as well ldquoShe did, said her dad.ldquoIrsquom sorry about the shoes, he said, ldquobut I wanted the memory of today to be of fun, not of being told off because of the state of the clothes.

What is it I always do riddles when I tell stories. I think of riddles and stories as close cousins which support each other.A good brain-teasing riddle is usually fun, and children in particular love the challenge of solving a riddle, as well as making their own ones up.Irsquom often greeted with pleas for ldquoTim, tell us one more riddle when I enter a school, and Irsquom often challenged to solve a riddle made up by one of the children.They are an ancient form of learning and entertainment.The first discovered written riddles are close to , years old. They were written in Cuneorm, the writing of the ancient Sumerians.A shortened and simplied version of one of these earliest riddles is: ldquoA house you enter blind, but come out with sight. What kind of house is it  The answer is a school, although some may raise an eyebrow at this answer.Perhaps the most famous riddle from antiquity is the Riddle of the Sphinx to Oedipus, recorded in ancient Greek around the fth century BC: ldquoWhat is the creature that walks on four legs in the morning, two legs at noon, and three legs in the evening The answer is a human being. When a baby we crawl on four legs, as an adult we walk on two legs, in old age we need a third leg .With my now continuous painful knee, this riddle has particular relevance for me, although Irsquom stubbornly resisting the stick!I use riddles as ice breakers in storytelling sessions and as an engagement technique because they quickly hook an audiencersquos attention since they are, by their nature, interactive.But they are also great fun to use with the children in your family.I use them to help distract and calm my younger ones when they are fractious. I use them in the morning when the kids are getting ready for school so they concentrate on them while they are getting ready.We make the riddles about the things we can see and the things we are doing, for example: ldquoTherersquos a big one and a wee one and three in between, we are two families of five, we are all going to nursery, but we are usually not seen. Who are we  The answer, of course, is my sonrsquos toes!For younger kids, itrsquos important to repeat riddles they already know the answer to. It helps them learn the riddle and how wordplay works. It also teaches them the rhythm of how they are told.My four-year-old is getting pretty good at this, although the answers to his own made-up riddles donrsquot always make sense.That doesnrsquot matter at this stage, whatrsquos important is hersquos developing an understanding of how they work and it encourages him to look for things to make riddles about.His nearly six-year-old sister likes to challenge him too.Her riddle ldquoI am short when I sit, I am long when I jump, what am I  had me thinking for some time before I got the answer: a frog.To make a riddle, think of the answer first. Then work the riddle up to the answer. It involves thinking about all the dferent qualities, uses of and parts of the answer and how they can be twisted or described dferently.For example, a shoe has a tongue but canrsquot talk, a clock has a face and hands but no body, a river has a bed but doesnrsquot sleep.Once introduced to riddle-making, children can get really engaged with it. A group of seven-eight-year-olds in a P class challenged me last week with a riddle they had made up themselves: ldquoI have a brain full of teacherrsquos knowledge, I crash without moving, I freeze while staying warm, what am I  The answer is a computer.Some riddles rhyme and it can be an extra challenge to think of a rhyming riddle, but they donrsquot have to rhyme.It really is a fun and rewarding activity to make a regular habit in the car, dinner table, on a walk or even a bedtime riddle.To help you out, there are literally thousands of examples of riddles in books, on the internet, in history, films and ones you hear. But the best ones will be those made up yourself, and the more you do it, the better at it you will become.And the benefits of riddling regularly with your family can be signicant, especially for children. It can promote critical thinking, encourage the observation of the world around us, help language development and can be a powerful bonding process with your child.

It is felt at the moment that the draft in its entirety is not acceptable until this letter is lodged and any concerns we have are taken on board.ldquoNot everybody understood everything that was involved in the draft plan but time was needed to make sure not only all the community councillors were more familiar with the draft plan but we had heard from HBCP and Haddington residents.ldquoIt was felt in the past that at community council meetings not enough time had been dedicated to it, hence the reason why Tuesday night happened.When the controversial proposals were revealed, the local authority confirmed it was ldquoexploring additional options for sustainable travel improvements in and around Haddington town centre.The new lsquoedge of centrersquo car park, dubbed a park and stride or a park and ride, would encourage people to walk or be bussed from Whittingehame Drive back into the town centre.No location has been confirmed for any new car park, although there have been concerns raised as to how it would impact upon community events such as Nungate Gala and the townrsquos fireworks.The long-stay car park at the townrsquos Tesco store, which is used by many people working in the town centre, could also become a short-stay car park.Joanna Gibson, HBCP chairwoman, outlined the grouprsquos feelings about the proposed scheme before non-community councillors were asked to leave the meeting ndash a decision that, according to East Lothian Council, was entirely down to the community council.A number of businesses feared they would not be able to operate through a y construction period. There were also worries that businesses would be forced to close and, with none moving in, it would result in a poorer High Street.Mrs Gibson said: ldquoWe do not think that this design has enough merit to counter the huge disruption of even phase one of the plan.ldquoThere were at least three plans at the initial consultations, why were none of the others considered  Perhaps within these plans we might have found a non-disruptive way to actually improve the town centre.ldquoThe shared space for events we believe will rarely be used as there does not seem to be any motivation or intentions, to our knowledge, to appoint someone to manage this.ldquoWe already have excellent event space outside the Corn Exchange offering indoor and outdoor event space and at Whittingehame Drive, and round the River Tyne where very successful community events are held.ldquoWe believe that parking is an important factor in retaining businesswe are to compete with the [proposed] new retail park [at Gateside] and survive and prosper.ldquoThis has also been the conclusion of many high street and town centre survival papers and studies worldwide.A council spokesman said: ldquoWe are continuing to develop proposals to improve the attractiveness, ality and accessibility of the town in support of the community and local businesses. This includes improved pedestrian and cycle access, as well as exploring additional options for sustainable travel improvements in and around Haddington town centre.ldquoOur priorities are to protect and enhance the local environment while supporting the local economy.

The night is dark and dismal. Irsquom standing on the outskirts of nowhere. On my own.No, not quite alone.I have the howling wind and crooked trees for company. And the wind gossips its terrible secrets to those trees, and the trees reply by shaking their palsied, arthritic branches in merriment. In front of me looms Provan Hall. The th century building in Easterhousersquos Auchinlea Park has a reputation for being one of the most haunted houses in Scotland.Irsquove arranged to meet a gang of ghost hunters here, though not a ghost hunter do I see. Rattling the tall gates that block my entrance to the driveway, I shout in a voice I wish sounded bolder: ldquoHello  Anybody there The wind answers with an exalted whoop. Nobody  does. With quivering fingers I tap out a message on my mobile phone to Julia Girdwood, my principal contact in the ghost hunter community.ldquoHi Julia. Irsquom at Provan Hall. There doesnrsquot seem to be anyone aroundhellipA few moments later I receive a text back. ldquoLorne. The eventrsquos tomorrow night.Oops.Chapter : In Which More Discoveries Are Made, Hideous And OtherwiseYoikes!Itrsquos a few minutes to midnight, the following evening. Irsquom crouching in the dark on the top floor of Provan Hall, when David, the professional medium standing next to me, says in a matter-of-fact voice: ldquoTherersquos a crawler coming up the stairs.A w-w-what !I glance over at the stairs. With only the dim glow from Davidrsquos torch, I make out shadows and nothing more. But David, being a medium, claims to be in possession of special powers. Ghosts are visible to him, he says, and they often tell him their tragic stories. He sometimes glimpses demons, too. Theyrsquore less sympathetic entities, as yoursquod imagine. The thing climbing the stairs towards us would appear to be of their ilk.Since I canrsquot see it, Irsquom understandably curious to know what this crawler looks like. Does it slither on flailing tentacles, or scuttle on a multitude of twitching legs ldquoIt looks sort of like Gollum, claries David, referring to the malicious creature from Lord of the Rings.David works with a group called Scottish Ghost Nights which organises a iety of spooky events throughout the country. They hold seances and late-night vigils in castles, derelict goals and stately homes.For tonightrsquos proceedings, the creepy quotient should be high, for itrsquos only a few days before Halloween, and Provan Hall has a distinctive ambience. Imagine yoursquore Hansel or Gretel, trudging through the tangled forest of your worst nightmares, when you stumble upon a sturdy, ancient house where a sweet old pensioner lives. And ndash oh joy! ndash her cooking potrsquos on the boil. Must be something yummy for dinnerhellipProvan Hall has a similar occult energy to that old pensionerrsquos gaff, though itrsquos built of sullen stone, not candy.Itrsquos a squatting toad of a house. Bathed in the clear autumn moonlight, its walls are bone-bland, pockmarked and bled of lustre, like the powdered face of a diseased French aristocrat awaiting Madame Guillotine.And Irsquom hunkered down inside that house, along with my new chum, David, another medium called Natasha, plus an assortment of ghost hunters and ghoul groupies, who paid to be here tonight, desperate to be scared witless.Therersquos twenty of us in total. Mostly women, with the occasional fear-loving fellow thrown into the mix.As the night progresses, Natasha also glimpses a demon, which she describes as looking like a ldquobarbequed monkey with not very nice eyes.David chimes in, too. ldquoItrsquos a shape-shter, he says. ldquoAnd it can climb the walls.Regrettably, once again I fail to glimpse this demon. Though being partial to anything barbequed, I do start to feel rather peckish.Luckily the ghost hunters have brought along scrummy cakes in Tupperware boxes, and we all have a hearty munch during a well-earned break. To be honest, Irsquom not really feeling the creeping sense of unease I experienced the night before, when I arrived early and alone.Itrsquos hard to get a satisfying shiver snaking down your spine when yoursquore in the company of a bunch of good-natured, cheerful ghost hunters. Wersquore all having a grand old time of it, you see, and thatrsquos a bit of a problem.A gaggle of giggling girls are on one side of me. Hen-night happy, hen-night hysterical. Also, many paying guests are wearing woolly hats topped with pom-poms. I mean, come on, guys! Would Jack Nicholson have been half as terrying in The Shininghersquod swapped his axe and manic grin for a pom-pom hat Yvonne, one of the ghost hunters, explains that therersquos nothing wrong with boisterous energy when searching for otherworldly entities. High spirits can persuade other types of spirits to make contact.Like most of the professionals here tonight, Yvonne declines to allow me to use her surname in print. She doesnrsquot want daylight acquaintances knowing her night time occupation.For all that, shersquos an earthy sort, with nothing remotely mysterious or ethereal about her personality.ldquoShout out to the spiritsyou want, she tells me. ldquoDonrsquot worry about sounding like a bit of a tool.Another ghost hunter, Eva, agrees. ldquoThink of tonight like a party, she says. ldquoYoursquove got to be single and ready to mingle. If you just stand in a corner, quiet and shy, the spirits wonrsquot be energised enough to make contact.Chapter : Of Witches, Maidens And Dastardly MonksSo our group does its best to encourage ghosts, ghoulies and other ghastlies to get in touch. Wersquore asked to briskly rub our hands together, to build up energy in the room. We also shout out questions to the invisible spirits surrounding us.ldquoWe are your friends, says David. ldquoWe have as much to learn from you, as you do from us.Little rubber balls are placed on the floor. Theyrsquore called kitten balls, rather incongruously, and when they are moved, they strobe flashing lights, like s disco balls.Shouting out questions, we encourage the spirits to answer us by shting these little balls.Occasionally a flash of light does spark through the darkness, indicating the balls are on the go. Conclusive evidence ghosts exist  Irsquom not convinced. Most likely itrsquos evidence wersquore standing in a drafty old house with rickety floorboards, where rubber balls are apt to wobble.We try a iety of other gizmos and gadgets to get in touch with the other side.An Ouija board. No luck.Then a contraption that emits strange screeches and crackles. Voices from the other side or radio interference Once again, Irsquom not persuaded.A red light is used to illuminate the faces of ious members of our group. If those faces morph into something dferent, it means a spirit is standing in front of that person. And, yes, faces do change. Sort of. Though only because the light teases shadows from the contours of noses, foreheads and mouths.The two spiritualists in our group spot more uncanny happenings. Ghosts of small children brush past, telling tales of a drowning in a pond. A hanged man swings from a banister. A pentagram on the kitchen flagstones marks the spot where a witch once worshipped. Nearby a wretched maiden was groped by a gang of dastardly monks.I glimpse none of this, however. Only the mediums see all.Julia Girdwood, whorsquos in charge of the evening, tells me events arenrsquot always dramatic, scary or opinion-shting when it comes to believingin ghosts.ldquoWe donrsquot fake anything, she says. ldquoWhich means the nights y. People sometimes come away a bit disappointed when things are quiet. Or they have a genuine uncanny experience.Speaking of which, did I come to believe, at nightrsquos end, that Provan Hall is haunted Irsquom afraid that, although I enjoyed the evening , I left forming a conclusion familiar to many a courthouse jury.

Despite the objection of the Democratic Unionist Partyand anti-abortion crusaders, it was ruled that from midnight it would be legal to have an abortion in Northern Ireland, as in the Republic of Ireland, as in the rest of the UK.With the passage of this legislation, women in the first  weeks of pregnancy who wish to have a termination will no longer have to skulk out of the country, or purchase online pills, rendering them open to prosecution should these make them so unwell they require medical attention.After next April, following an interim period during which access to services on the mainland will be freely available, the situation in Northern Ireland will change radically. Those who are pregnant as a result of incest or rape those who know their foetus has an incurable disease that will allow them little quality of le for as long as they survive those who have been told they must go full term, even though the baby has died, will finally be given a degree of dignity and comfort. At last, they will be able to end a pregnancy of their own volition, in their homeland, without stigma and with the full support of the medical professionals who tend to them.It is a not a subject for wild rejoicing, as was evident in the sombre response of campaigners on learning the law had been passed. The mood was more of relief than jubilation. Nobody can feel joy at the idea of a pregnancy that, for whatever reason, is better ended.But it is possible to feel gratitude that an old and crippling injustice, a hangover of a puritanical stranglehold on womenrsquos lives, has been overturned. As of now, Northern Irish women are entitled to decide on their own welfare and that of their unborn child. It is a right that is not only legal but ethical.That these new laws are among the most liberal in Europe is remarkable, given the strength and tenacity of opposition to this issue. It must exacerbate the fury of the anti-abortion camp to watch the political mothership in London impose its will with such vigour.That this has happened under a Conservative government with which the DUP was in partnership, is an added grievance. As is the fact that even the Republic of Ireland, once a by-word for religious conservatism, last year voted to allow terminations . This volte face was salt in the wound for pro-lers and pro-choice activists alike.The measure of how historic this landmark will prove can be gauged by the opening of the padlock on the Assemblyrsquos gates. Sinn Fein did not turn up, but Arlene Forster, leader of the DUP, announced that, despite this act, her party would explore ldquoevery possible legal option to prevent the provision of abortion services within their borders.A fuming zealot was less restrained: ldquoin todayrsquos world the most dangerous place to be is actually in the womb of a woman. There could hardly be a more calculated insult to womankind, but the depth of this manrsquos misogyny highlights the intensity of prejudice and oppression with which the pro-choice lobby has had to contend.This momentous step is good news for the United Kingdom, as is impending legislation to allow same-sex marriage from next January. All this is positive. Yet it is a sad day for the Union that both decisions, which will have far-reaching social implications, are not the work of Irish politicians but of Westminster.Since the Assembly collapsed in January , its day to day business has been handled by civil servants. You might argue they are doing such a good job they are enabling Sinn Fein and the DUP to maintain their stand-off. That not even the murder of the journalist Lyra McKee could encourage these parties to put aside their quarrel indicates the bitterness and ision at the heart of Irish politics.Yet while the Assembly has been lying all these months in an induced coma, London has not been idle. Those on the pro-choice side of the debate might have mixed feelings, since their argument has been vindicated thanks to action by the English. Time was when anything that came out of Westminster was regarded in certain quarters as toxic. How ironic, then, that the Assemblyrsquos denizens have allowed their internal wrangling, their myopia and obstinacy, to allow an often loathed overlord to step into their shoes and usher voters into a more compassionate age.That must be galling for everyone. Then again, perhaps not. When Stormont reconvened for the space of roughly an hour, squabbling made any hope of constitutional challenge impossible. It was hardly edying. Rather than acting as a reminder that the Assemblyrsquos members have the power to settle the countryrsquos affairs without interference from outside, it was instead a shambles, a pantomime whose script had been lted straight from the myth of Pandorarsquos Box.I would not be surprised , following this, some are wonderingthey should dispense with the Assembly altogether, since they are better served by panjandrums across the sea. Others, meanwhile, will be looking south towards the Republic, anticipating the time when old isions are lted, and all of Ireland is united peacefully once more.What lies between now and that day, should it ever arrive, will be turbulent, to say the least. For the meantime, it is paradox enough that it has taken Westminster to unlock the chains in which Northern Irelandrsquos women have been shackled. The symbolic signicance of this long overdue act should give the refusniks at Stormont pause for thought."},{"url":null,"title":"female-detectives-uncovering-scottish-arts-lost-women","story":"THAT Newhaven fishwe, the one with the tanned arms resting on her empty creel, head bent away aspreoccupied by something, until recently was one of the many women in the National Galleries of Scotland collections whose inidual lives we really knew little of.Mara Barth, project learning officer, scatters a collection of early photographs across a table and tells me that all these women are unknown. Itrsquos a feature not just of these images, but of many paintings and photographs of women in the National Galleries of Scotlandrsquos historic collections, and in many art collections across the world.Sometimes the only title these subjects get is ldquounknown woman, or \"four unknown women\". Sometimes it is ldquowe of, or ldquodaughter of. One sits on a motorbike. ldquoWe know a little bit about her, because we got curious and we liked her motorbike. We found out where this motorbike was registered, and it was in Morningside and we know that this was a type of bike designed for ladies.ldquoThere are a lot of female sitters in the collection, says Barth, ldquobut we often donrsquot know a lot about the sitters. This event is around exploring not just women artists but women sitters in the collection and specically around the Scottish collection. Wersquove drawn images from the early photography collection that are of unknown women. Nothing is known about any of these women. Or course in the early photography there is quite a lot of unknown men as well as women. This is a nice way to highlight some of the everyday women of Scotland. Early photographs were where we see them the most.Some of these anonymous women are at the centre of an event at the National Galleries Of Scotland titled, Where Are The Women  Itrsquos an interesting title, for, actually,you walk around any of our galleries, you do see plenty of women. There are nudes, classical goddesses, queens, ladies in their fine hats and gowns. But what feels absent too often is a sense of who some of these women really are. Thatrsquos particularly so when the women are working class.One of the inspirations behind this evening event is feminist author Sara Sheridanrsquos Where Are The Women : A Guide To An Imagined Scotland, which created a new map of the country, in which many of the statues of men that populate our streets were replaced by those to women or the roads renamed to memorialise women not men.ldquoIrsquom interested in the memorialisation of women, says Sheridan, who will speak at the National Galleries event, \"and when I wrote my book to remap Scotland, I discovered amazing things about our foremothers. We need to normalise womenrsquos achievement, we need to normalise womenrsquos voices and we need to normalise womenrsquos bodies as well. My book is one creative take on that.Sheridan acknowledges that in the National Galleries of Scotland the problem is not a blanket absence of women of the sort we see among the statues in our streets. Images of the female sex are plenty, though, in the historic collection, the vast majority of them are created by men. One of the problems is, though, she says, that these women are edited. An example she gives of this is the Victorian nudes.ldquoWhen we do see them theyrsquore not real people, theyrsquore statues. There is no body hair or anything like that and they all had these mad hairstyles. They were meant to look like statues and statues donrsquot have hair. The Victorians were inspired by statues from Greece and were painting women to look like that.She believes this editing of women is still relevant now. ldquoI founded Reek, a perfume company where when you wear the perfume you form a memorial to the women it commemorates. I want to talk about the way womenrsquos bodies are represented because thatrsquos something we care about at Reek. We donrsquot retouch images. We get a lot of complaints on Facebook becauseyou put up a lot of skin and nudes itrsquos taken down, and of course perfume photography is all about skin and nudes.The National Galleries of Scotland event is another take on the kind of memorialising of women that Sheridan does. It also reflects a kind of righting of a wrong, an attempt to uncover more ndash for instance more about that Newhaven fishwe, taken in .The image is iconic. Itrsquos one of which the early th century philosopher, Walter Benjamin, wrote, ldquoShe has something that canrsquot be silenced, something that fills you with an unruly desire to know what her name was, the woman that was alive there. The early th century philosopher happened to be looking at a copy of the photograph that had no name attached. Frequently the image was published, nameless, with other titles like ldquoNewhaven beauty or even ldquoNewhaven Madonna. Yet we do know the name of this young woman. its creators, Hill  Adamson, the first Scottish photography studio, did publish it, and, in the past few years, armed with that piece of information, the researcher and photographer Caroline Douglas has made it her mission to discover and understand this working-class woman, ElizabethHall, to bring her story to light.ldquoI really just wanted to build up a picture of Elizabeth Johnstone Hallrsquos le. There has been a lot of scholarship on Hill  Adamson, but it really struck me that there hadnrsquot been a great deal written about the iniduals, the unknown subjects, who sat for them. So my approach has really been from a dferent vantage point, the study of the history of photography from the perspective of the sitter, and very much so in this case, a working class sitter. I really think our understanding of the emergence of photography as a discipline changes when we begin to write these unknown figures into the history of the medium.These are some of the worldrsquos earliest photographic subjects, which is extraordinary in itself. And also they represent one of the first photo documentary series ever made. You have these living breathing subjects. And yet we still donrsquot know all that much about them.What do we now know  ldquoTherersquos a wedding band there on her finger, she says. ldquoShe was born Johnstone. And she married Daniel Hall and in the Scots tradition she kept both her maiden name and her married name. She was married but didnrsquot have any children. Sadly she died in relative poverty, though at quite an old age ndash in , the same year as Victoria died. They died within days of one another.One of the things she doesnrsquot know for sure is what awareness the subjects in these photos would have had of the circulation of the images. She also very much doubts that she would have been given a copy of the image, or invited on the occasions when they were exhibited. ldquoIn my research Ive learned that many of these iniduals werent literate. In the census records Ive been consulting, bold strokes or black marks where someone has been unable to sign their name.But one of the most fascinating things about her research into Johnstone Hall, is that it took a more personal twist when Douglasrsquos mother noticed a tweet about her research. She sent her a message, saying, ldquoCaroline, you know wersquove got both Johnston Halls and Listons [the name of a male subject in the photographs] in the family.ldquoIn my pursuit of trying to understand women in early photography, Irsquom finding Irsquom perhaps related to both the fishermen and women in the picture, she says.Douglas has an interest not just in the sitters ndash but also in the processes of early photography and the women who might have been involved in that. One thing she has been exploring is that there was a female technician on the Hill  Adamson project. There was also, she found, much further back, an Edinburgh woman who was key to developing some of the chemical processes that would lead to early photography. ldquoElizabeth Fulhame was doing chemistry experiments in Edinburgh in s, fty years before the founding fathers are deemed to have invented photography. And yet her work forms part of the bedrock of the invention of the medium. In the foreword of her book Fulhame writes, lsquoCensure is perhaps inevitable for some are so ignorant that they grow sullen and silent and are chilled with horror at the sight of anything that bears the semblance of learning ndash and should the spectre appear in the shape of a woman the pangs which she suffers are truly dismal.\"Itrsquos not an uncommon feeling, that desire expressed by Walter Benjamin to know more about the person featured in a portrait. Itrsquos one many visitors appear to feel around a popular painting in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery, Daniel Macneersquos A Lady In Grey.Gallery attendants have said they frequently are asked questions about this painting, long known to be a portrait of the artistrsquos daughter, Isabella Wiseman. ldquoYou look at her, says Freya Spoor, a curator at the National Galleries of Scotland, ldquoand want to know more. Yoursquore intrigued by her immediately. And she has a wonderful intimacy because they were father and daughter and I think they were very close. I think they had a similar sense of humour. Interested to uncover more, Spoor started looking into the object files and found that they also have two photographs of Isabella Wiseman donated by the descendants. ldquoOne has her in a similar post to Lady in Grey. She was an elderly lady at that point, sitting with her hands clapped in front of her.The photographs were given to the gallery by a descendent called Dr Ruth Wazzell, and she discovered that the family also had an archive at the National Library of Scotland. ldquoI was able to go and look at that. Lovely anecdotal information on her ndash about going to all the Royal Academy shows, going to the theatre. I think she had quite a keen sense of humour. You sort of felt like you were getting more of a personal picture of what Isabella was like.The Where Are The Women  event, while it does have a focus on sitters, is also about asking where women are in all areas of art production, and that includes the artists themselves. Spoor notes that there are gaps where they shouldnrsquot be. The reasons why womenrsquos works are missing are hugely ied. Artworks by Frances Maconald McNair, for instance are far fewer than they might be, because her husband, Herbert McNair, burned much of her studio work on her death. ldquoIt is a curious Victorian phenomenon to deal with grief, or it could be reputation-saving. But it happened quite regularly.Also doing a talk at one of the events are The History Girls, Rachael Purse and Karen Mailley-Watt. Their focus is ldquofriendship portraits, the paintings female artists have done of each other. She observes that when it comes to finding women in history, whether in written sources or art, where you have to look is in ldquothe gaps.ldquoWomen are often not mentioned at all, unless you look. For instanceyou look at the Chronicles of Charlemagnersquos rule some of his wives arenrsquot even mentioned by name but the children are mentioned so you have to guess who they are or where they are from by the mention of their children. You have to play detective because for a lot of history women are regarded as irrelevant so their names arenrsquot used a lot. Up until s, women became a legal nonentity upon marriage. Officially she didnrsquot exist. She wasnrsquot dead legally, but she wasnrsquot alive, she was just like an extra limb of her husband.Purse also notes that the lack of womenrsquos art prior to the th century is partly a reflection of the role they were expected to take in families. ldquoAs soon as they became pregnant or got married they were no longer able to practice art, and those that were able to do it up to that point were dependent on parents allowing them to do so and that generally meant only middle class people. The art that is produced by these women is just kept by the family usually. It doesnrsquot get sold and seen and written about by critics and collected by museums. Itrsquos in peoplersquos housesldquoWhat I find upsetting, she adds, ldquois that so many of these womenrsquos periods as artists are cut short by getting married or by a family, maybe theyrsquore unmarried but a father gets ill and theyrsquore the only unmarried daughter left so they have to stop then look after the household and their father. Itrsquos really sad when you see the abrupt stop.\"Frequently those artists who have risen to the kind of prominence that has seen their work in historical collections have not had children. One of these is Flora Macdonald Reid, an artist that Freya Spoor has recently researched. ldquoHer brother, Spoor says, ldquowas John Robertson Reid and her sister Lizzie was also an artist. She travelled extensively across Europe: France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and she incorporated exciting aspects which were reshaping art, rural naturalism. She was looking at rural people who were within the local area, real local flavour and presenting them in a really honest way. The muddy boots, the weather-beaten face.Macdonald Reid never married. ldquoI think, says Spoor, ldquothat was so she could focus on her art entirely. She dedicated her le to her artwork. She exhibited widely and in places where her work would have been seen on a par with men. She could command similar prices to her male counterparts.Of course, some very noteworthy female artists did have children and made motherhood the subject of some of their work. In Romance, Cecile Walton, produced a post-birth self-portrait, in which she depicts herself partially undressed, in a pose reminiscent of Manetrsquos Olympia. She holds up her baby and peers as it. Her older child plays at her feet.As Spoor puts it, ldquoItrsquos quite inquiring of motherhood generally. I think she was quite perplexed by this new child and what the future held for her. Itrsquos very honest in that way and itrsquos extremely relevant for themes today. She was mirroring other artistic tropes so you could say like Manetrsquos Olympia and further back to Titianrsquos Venus of Urbino. Itrsquos extremely honest and frank and I think it was considered quite shocking at the time.\"The Where Are The Women  event is part of a process of uncovering, of bringing women into the light. Researchers are gradually revealing that the female artist was not quite the rare beast that is often made out ndash but that unearthing her takes hard work.

Business groups describe a real toll on the confidence of smaller entrepreneurs.Mike Cherry, the chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, this week warned his members had ldquobeen left hamstrung by uncertainty for the past three years.One of the big worries for businesses is whether they can get labour, including seasonal workers, from the EU.But the four million or so citizens of other European nations living in the UK have reason to be stressed.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon symbolically again told them they were welcome in Scotland. But Brexit has delivered a dferent message ndash one that has added to the stress.Those in favour of Brexit insisted we were supposed to take back control. Instead, for people like Mr McCallum and so many others, there is just an overwhelming sense that even before any deadline runs out, we have lost it.The United Kingdom yesterday lurched into yet another Brexit extension, the date of which is still to be decided, into yet another period of aching political, economic and constitutional uncertainty.For some this was just the prolonged death rattle of the British Union state, a last agony. For others, it was more like a dficult and protracted delivery for a new sovereignty outside the European Union, a rebirth. But forget the destination.It is the pain of the journey that is hurting, the mental pain. Why  Because people are telling us they canrsquot control what is happening. And because they simply donrsquot know what is happening.There is more: all of this angst and anxiety, this discord and dispute, this stress and strain, looks set to last right through the holiday season. As the nights turn darker quicker and the cold seeps in, there is talk of a December General Election, of politics over the turkey and trimmings.The wry jokes have started as coping mechanisms click in. Merry Brexmas, say some, and a happy No EU year  As is so often the case when we donrsquot feel right in ourselves, it is our friends who notice. And not just the bad gags. First, foreign observers have used the language of mental health to describe the Brexit process itself.ldquoBritain had gone mad, said the New York Times in the summer. ldquoThe cult of Brexit has driven the Tory party to go mad, said Internazionale in Italy. Aghast commentary does nothing to calm British nerves.Neither, say mental health experts, do headlines that stigmatise illness. Some outside are really starting to worry about us.Take Brian Hughes, of the National University of Ireland in Galway.ldquoWhile we may in Ireland laugh at the UK, it is very stressful for the people in the UK, the psychologist told the .ldquoIt has realconsequences for peoplersquos wellbeing and mental health. There are multiple major concerns you would have for a nation like the UK and its population.Anti-depressant prescriptions shot up  per cent in the month after the big Brexit vote. They are supposed to go down in the summer months.We are less than a week from the latest Brexit deadline. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he would ldquodie in a ditch rather than stay in the EU beyond Halloween.And yet it looks like October  will pass and we will still be in the worldrsquos biggest and most successful trading bloc.Back in March, days out from a previous deadline, the Mental Health Foundation issued research showing Brexit had made % of people in Scotland feel powerless.Another % were angry, another % worried. Nearly one in five of us are highly stressed, according to the poll. Toni Giugliano, the foundationrsquos policy manager, said: ldquoFeelings of powerlessness or worry are linked to a higher risk of mental health problems. They may also exacerbate existing dficulties.ldquoWe know, from other examples worldwide, that an unstable political environment can potentially affect peoplersquos mental health.ldquoThe number of people who said they felt high levels of stress or problems sleeping is also a concern.Mr Giugliano was speaking in March. Six months on he added that little had changed, but underlined the stress was not being dispersed equally. Some of us are more affected than others: EU migrants or people in businesses that trade with the EU, or for projects that get funding from the EU.German-born Professor Tanja Bueltmann, of Northumbria University, studies migration and also campaigns for citizensrsquo rights.She said: ldquoFor EU citizens, Brexit is not a threat of something that might happen in the future: it has been their everyday le for over , days, no end in sight. There is a real human cost to living in limbo for such an extended period, with growing tangible evidence documenting the impact of this uncertainty.ldquoIn particular, the mental health of EU citizens is affected, impacts ranging from anxiety to depression and panic attacks.ldquoEspecially worrying, however, is the growing number of accounts that reveal EU citizens holding suicidal thoughts. This is the result too of many EU citizens finding themselves in a real crisis of identity and belonging. This was bound to happen: how are they meant to come to terms with the fact the place they consider their home chose to implement a system that forces them to apply to stay [rather than an automatic system as was promised] ldquoWhatever happens next, the impact Brexit has had on EU citizens has already been signicant and is likely to have longer-term negative consequences for their mental health and wellbeing.In Europe there are also British citizens who were bracing themselves again for the prospect of a no-deal Brexit as soon as next week.This summer a study found three out of four British parliamentarians were suffering from poor mental health stress and depression. One of its authors, Dan Poulter, a Tory MP who still works as an NHS psychiatrist, stressed the work was lonely.Speaking in July, he added: ldquoMPs are potentially at greater risk of developing mental health problems because of the nature of their work and because they work in a high-stress environment where there are many brickbats and not many bouquets.Brexit has not made things easier. An MP was murdered by an extremist during the EU campaign. Crowds of often aggressive campaigners have gathered outside Parliament.Abuse on social media is re. A huge poll this week found a majority of voters think violence towards MPs is a price worth paying to get the Brexit outcome they want.Even the research team behind the survey, at Edinburgh and Cardf universities, said they found the findings ldquogenuinely shocking.Hannah Bardell is one of the MPs who have spoken frankly about looking after themselves as Brexit eats into their ability to do normal politics.She said: ldquoThat job, which I love and which I signed up for ndash and for all the stress that comes with it ndash has had quite a profound impact on my mental health.An MP since , Ms Bardell catalogued the stresses being forced on politicians.ldquoThe dysal system at Westminster the relentless wall-to-wall nonsense of Brexit not being able to do our job the way we should be because Brexit is taking up so much energy. All of that is having an impact on people and parliamentarians of all parties.So far studies have focused on adults but the pain is rubbing off on their children. The Mental Health Foundation has advice: donrsquot bottle it up. ldquoHave an honest discussion with them, be truthful, give them facts, and allow plenty of time for questions, it says. ldquoRemember that small doses of real time news are helpful, but overexposure is not."},{"url":null,"title":"history-scottish-football-100-objects","story":"WITHIN minutes of visiting the Scottish Football Museum at Hampden, I sensed something was missing.

McLean was trying to protect his manager Alex Smith, whose side were struggling and on a desperate run of form. The fans wanted blood, and McLean was the scapegoat. Few chants cut to the bone more effectively than the dreaded three-word killer, \"sack the board\". When the frustration got too much, McLean punched Barnes. He immediately apologised and stood down. McLean was a coach who almost took a provincial side to European glory.

Levein, Gordon Strachan and currently Steve Clarke all seem to be intelligent guys with too much time to think about the game between International games.TRAFFIC CONETraffic cones have become something of a familiar mot in the cultural fabric of Glasgow. They are seldom used to help with traffic. They are used as hats for statues, goalposts and as a weapon. While at work with Partick Thistle, Chic Charnley was insulted by two neds and a devil dog. The neds he could take but the devil dog crossed the line. Being a professional, he invited them to come back once training was finished, to take up the offer of a square-go. They did.

Aggie quickly realised how it worked and in articles started to sound imbued by the spirit of Muhammad Ali meets Liam Gallagher. All from a milk jug.

But a milk jug though JINKY JOHNSTONErsquoS OARYou would expect a player with such balance, poise, and trickery would be quite the nautical whiz. The fact Jimmy Johnstone was steamboats and without oarlocks didnrsquot help. The inclusion of this infamous tale is more than just high jinks at sea, or to be more geographically specic, the Firth of Clyde. Forget the Coast Guard having to be called, being forced to face a baying press pack by Scotland manager Willie Ormond and then playing out of your skin against England a few days later. This story works on a bigger level. Here were ordinary men, flawed men, who did incredible things. But, despite their fame, they were still men of the people, they walked and lived among us. They werenrsquot like Ronaldo, Neymar or Messi, who are locked away and cosseted from scrutiny for fear of it being bad for PR.

It would be churlish to miss out on any of the build-up. Alex Ferguson had won the old First Division and was heading for the Premier League. Airdrie applauded them on the park. We decided to stand behind the side St Mirren were attacking, as this would improve our chances of seeing ourselves on TV. Just to make sure we would be spotted, we turned our Parkas inside out and there we were, bright and orange. Le was simpler, and happier then.

I wanted to be part of a belief body that was more open-minded and collaborative.Up until now there has been no Agnostic organisation in the UK, though according to a  Eurostat Eurobarometer survey around  percent of people in the UK are agnostic and  percent atheist. Meanwhile, even amongst non-believers itrsquos not necessarily true that they have no belief in anything spiritual or supernatural. A Humanist Society of Scotland study found that  percent of Scots did not believe in le after death and  percent do not believe in angels. However, The Understanding Unbelief project at the University of Kent, this year published research into atheists and agnostics, which showed that amongst these groups most people had some sort of belief in the supernatural. Doubt, meanwhile, is not uncommon. Even the famous atheist, Richard Dawkins, once said that he was only \". out of seven\" sure of his atheist belief.Tibbitt considers most of the celebrant work she has done since  as having been about offering an \"agnostic choice\" to families and couples. She had begun to feel strongly that there should be an official place for families to go to have this kind of open minded and person-centred ceremony. Among the ceremonies that spurred her was when she was asked to be celebrant for the funeral of a friendrsquos husband who was dying of cancer. Malcolm Stewart, who had been diagnosed with appendiceal cancer several years previously, had been given only weeks to live. In his final days, Tibbitt spent many hours talking with him about his beliefs and what he would like his funeral to be.ldquoIt was just such an eye-opener. He was dying. He was facing his own mortality and actually he didnrsquot really know what he believed. It was a mixed bag of a few dferent things and there wasnrsquot anywhere for him to go. I think itrsquos important that therersquos somewhere that you can go. You know some of his beliefs were a bit contradictory. He thought there might be an afterle. He said, I hope there is. But he said, Irsquom also liking the idea of reincarnation. We all of us have these myriad complex beliefs. That doesnrsquot mean we donrsquot take comfort from themtheyrsquore contradictory or not written up in some book. What Tibbitt was struck by was the need for someone to listen non-judgmentally and acknowledge the persons beliefs.Gabe Stewart, Malcolmrsquos widow, recalls that her husband had ldquoa very wide set of interest and beliefs and feelings. ldquoWe wanted a service that would reflect that. He was a baptised Christian, went to a church of England boarding school. He islike so many people in society today in the West, who consider themselves spiritual but not religious. So he had an interest in some aspects of Hinduism, some aspects of Buddhism and we were looking for the kind of funeral that would reflect the kind of man he was. It was not, she observes, that they chose an agnostic funeral. ldquoItrsquos just that what we wanted happens to be an agnostic funeral.The team at Agnostic Scotland have also already conducted agnostic funerals, naming ceremonies, vow renewals and weddings, including one naming ceremony that \"incorporated a lot of Native American ritual, shamanism, very holistic, beautul\". They plan on offering orce ceremonies, retirements, adoption ceremonies, pet funerals - in fact, almost any le transition or moment that people might want to celebrate. They also want to run community connection gatherings, in which, as Linda Keys put it people are brought together through things \"like nature or the arts that might inspire all\".Might agnosticism in these toxic times be something we might want to cultivate a bit more in all areas of society and le  Richard Holloway, the former Episcopalian Bishop of Edinburgh who has long been open about his agnosticism, his religious doubt, describes himself as ldquoa practising but unbelieving Christian.ldquoMy own take, he says, ldquois that there is much we cannot absolutely know, and therefore a kind of reverent agnosticism is probably the most honest position. Itrsquos the kindest position, because it doesnrsquot prompt you to persecute other people. And we need that in politics as well. A friend of mine who was a reconciliation worker in situations of conflict used to say you donrsquot understand the other side until you can make their argument as good or better than they can. Only when yoursquore able to do that can you be in a position to do an honest but kindly opposition. And wersquore so fractured at the moment that we donrsquot do that.What he thinks we need to cultivate is a ldquoreverent openness towards each other. ldquoBe argumentative ndash because Scots are intrinsically argumentative ndash but in an open, generous kind of way. Somehow thatrsquos at a discount at the moment, and thatrsquos partly to do with all the social media stuff that gives us a way of hating anonymously. A lot of people sneer at each other. Social media seems to be a colossal bear pit of ugliness and hate. The world is now so interconnected that therersquos no separation. You canrsquot shut your door and get away from things. We could do ourselves in as a bloody specieswersquore not careful.The story of Agnostic Scotland says a great deal about the dogmatic nature of our culture, particularly here in Scotland. For, it has come into existence as an answer to a particular problem. The biggest humanist organisation in Scotland is essentially atheist and doesnt allow religious content in their ceremonies. Tibbitt trained with the Humanist Society Scotland, she recalls, thinking they were going to be non-dogmatic. But, in the process of doing her training, she realised that, ldquoIn Scotland ndash though it isnrsquot the same in England - the main humanist societies are mostly atheist so they are dogmatic. You canrsquot have certain things in the ceremonies. You cant have hymns.One of the more high-profile figures in the humanist movement in Scotland has been Tim Maguire. Maguire recently left to, to join Celebrate People, an organisation that describes themselves as ldquospiritual humanists, and which is happy with the inclusion of religious content. Gerrie Douglas-Scott, one of the co-founders of the organisation says that often people will say that they ldquoare a spiritual but not a religious person.Maguire acknowledges that he too is agnostic. I thinkwersquore honest none of us know anything, andwe have any humility we should all be agnostic. Atheism strikes me as unsupportable because itrsquos a certainty about something you cannot know about. For me it doesnrsquot matter. How you behave is much more important than what you believe.He is concerned by the fact that ldquothe largest Humanist organisation in Scotland is one that is resolutely atheist. The Humanist Society of Scotland , remains the largest single provider of religion or belief-based marriages, having overtaken the Church of Scotland in , and, on its website advises that religious content is not generally included in its ceremonies. ldquoThatrsquos not right, he says. ldquoIt certainly isnrsquot humanism as I recognise it.Maguire recalls having participated in a long-running internal debate in the HSS, in which he argued that people should be allowed to have religious content in their ceremonies as they do in England and Wales. On one occasion, he says, he asked Richard Holloway, why he thought there was this dference in humanist culture between Scotland and England. ldquoHe came up with a theory that it was because every new belief forms in opposition to the dominant belief of its time and place, so when humanism takes root in England itrsquos forming in opposition to the Anglican church, which is very nice and nobody would ever question you on your dogma. Itrsquos accepting and warm and fuzzy. Humanism in Scotland forms in opposition to Calvinism and Scots Catholicism.Holloway observes that the reason humanism has been so successful is because it has provided something we are missing. ldquoIt seems to me, he says, ldquowhat the humanists are doing is inventing the consolations of religion without the supernatural side of it. Which s quite interesting. The belief side of religion is less important than a lot of people think ndash itrsquos the christenings, itrsquos the funerals, itrsquos the weddings, itrsquos the marking of tragedy. The churches down in Essex today are all open so people can go and just be quiet as a result of these trafficked victims. Itrsquos deep in human nature, and I think that a lot of people who give up religion miss it, not so much missing God as missing the structures of consolation that are there for them at times of incurable need like that.It is, possible, of course to work as an independent celebrant, not attached to any belief body, but, as Tibbitt points out, when it comes to legal ceremonies like weddings, there is no legal recognition, which means that the couples then have to redo the paperwork One of the books that inspired her approach is was Alain De Bottonrsquos Religion For Atheists. ldquoHis book, she describes, ldquois not negative about religion. Itrsquos positive about religion. But itrsquos basically saying for those non-religious people, those people who donrsquot really know what they believe, religion has brought a lot of wonderful things and what we need in our society is a non-dogmatic alternative to religion that offers the same things. I think thatrsquos what the Humanists have been trying to do but itrsquos ended up being dogmatic. We wanted to try to create something that was non-dogmatic, collaborative, open-minded and still brings people together.Agnostic Scotlandrsquos Linda Keys considers that many peoplersquos beliefs are now quite nuanced, ldquopartly because they have so much information from dferent belief systems that itrsquos really hard to put it in a precise little box. She adds, ldquoIt seems asin politics we are becoming increasingly polar, but I think therersquos something around identity where wersquore starting to recognise that wersquore all on a spectrum. To me, belief can sit within that range of things where therersquos a spectrum, and also where we can be fluid.Agnosticism is something we might want to cultivate more in politics too. As Richard Holloway puts it, ldquoAgnosticism in religion is about the big ultimate question, is there a supernatural reality called God  I think that even in politics while itrsquos more empirical and down to earth and measurable, yoursquore still not sure what the particular outcome of a policy will be. Because there are always unintended consequences, which is why we have stumbled our way in democracy to this idea of loyal opposition that every policy must be loyally challenged from the other side. Otherwise you end up with strong-armed dictatorships that go only one way. And I think that agnosticism is a healthy part of democratic politics.For more information see www.agnosticscotland.org"},{"url":null,"title":"13-days-shook-world","story":"President John F Kennedy has warned that breaching the embargo will provoke nuclear war. And today, October , another U- has been shot down over Cuba and the pilot, Major Rudolph Anderson, killed.It was the culmination of the most dangerous phase of the Cold War, with Russian president Nikita Khruschev testing Kennedy, not even two years since winning the election against Richard Nixon, with the young JFK determined not to quail.The episodic drama really began with the Cuban Revolution in  when the corrupt Batista regime was overthrown by Fidel Castro, his brother Raul, Che Guea and the small band of men who landed from the ship Granma and swept up support as they went, before arriving triumphantly in Havana.Raul was a committed communist, Fidel not quite so, the US government would have no truck with the revolutionaries so they looked to Moscow for aid and support.:Trevor Royle on a Cold War thriller with Soviet soulKhruschev, for his part, was looking for a way to equal the United States massive superiority in long-range missile capability.\"Why not throw a hedgehog in Uncle Sams pants \" he said to foreign minister Rodion Malinovsky.He later told his defence council: The Americans had surrounded our country with military bases and threatened us with nuclear weapons, and now they would learn just what it feels like to have enemy missiles pointing at you.The decision was taken to build the bases in Cuba but the plan, rather naively, relied on US intelligence not detecting them, so that Kennedy would be presented with a fait accompli, and that the president, when he learned of the sheaf of missiles pointed at the US and able to strike most parts of it, he would not order their obliteration.On October  the  days that shook the world began. A U- spy plane piloted by Major Richard Heyser took hundreds of photographs which revealed the newly-built installations in the Cuban countryside.For days to come Heyser was consumed with worry that history would record him as the man who started the nuclear war.A day later CIA analysts detected launchers, transport trucks and missiles capable of striking targets across the United States.On October , defence secretary Robert McNamara, presented Kennedy with three options ndash diplomacy, talks with Khruschev Castro, or an air attack to destroy the sites which will inevitably kill hundreds of Soviet personnel and trigger a Soviet counter-attack, likely to be in Berlin, or a naval quarantine - hes careful to call it that because a blockade is an act of war ndash to buy time to negotiate a missile withdrawal. Kennedy opts for the third and sends in the ships.:From Mars to Dundee: The prison ship that shaped generationsOn Monday, October , Kennedy began a dramatic, -minute speech to the US public, and the world, reveals incontrovertible evidence of the missile threat and announced that the US would prevent ships carrying weapons reaching Cuba, as well as demanding Russia withdraw the missiles.Along with this the US Ambassador to Cuba was delivering a message to Khruschev ndash there was no hot line then ndash about the determination of the United States and the hope that the two countries not be plunged into a war \"which could only result in catastrophic consequences to the whole world, including the aggressor.A day later Khruschev writes to JFK rebuffing the demand, insisting the missiles are only defensive ones. Kennedy immediately responds by telling the Soviet leader that he started the crisis.Ambassador to the UN Adlai Stevenson explains it all to the Security Council as US warships move into place, shadowed by Soviet nuclear submarines. The  Soviet freighters pause in the water.On October  Khruschev sends an angry letter to JFK accusing him of threatening the USSR. \"You are no longer appealing to reason but threatening us.\"The following day  of the Soviet ships turn back, but the Bucharest continues with two US warships preparing to intercept it, which would almost certainly have led to war.Kennedy allows the ship through because it has been established that it carries no weaponry.On Friday, October  Castro sends a letter to the Soviet president urging him to launch a nuclear first strike, instead, a day later, Khruschev writes to JFK urging him to work with him to de-escalate the crisis so that it did not \"doom the world to the catastrophe of thermonuclear war\".The following day, on this day in , the U- plane was shot down over Cuba and nuclear war seemed to be, once more, the likely outcome.However Kennedy, stepping back, reckoned, quite rightly, that Khruschev had not authorised it.JFKs brother Robert, then US Attorney General and part of the inner Ex-Comm team gathered in Washington, told Soviet ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin, \"You have drawn first blood ... . [T]he president had decided against advice ... not to respond militarily to that attack, but he [Dobrynin] should know thatanother plane was shot at, ... we would take out all the SAMs and anti-aircraft ... . And that would almost surely be followed by an invasion.\"But rather than precipitating the war, the incident had a salutary effect on both leaders who realised that the crisis was spiralling dangerously out of control.Khruschev sent another letter to JFK demanding that in any deal there is a quid pro quo, with the US withdrawing missiles from Turkey. RFK, in his meeting with Dobrynin, tells the ambassador that the US was already planning to withdraw them, but would not say publicly.Face was saved on both sides.On October , in an open message to Kennedy on Moscow Radio, Khruschev announced that an agreement had been reached and all Soviet missiles in Cuba would be dismantled and shipped back to Russia.JFK reciprocated by promising that the US would not invade Cuba, while secretly agreeing to take out the threatening Turkish missiles.The missiles were removed from Cuba by the end of  and a year later the US ones were withdrawn from Turkey and hot line between the US and USSR was set up to prevent a similar crisis occurring.And the nuclear clock ed to five minutes to midnight."},{"url":null,"title":"Iain MacWhirter  Jeremy Corbyn   s indecision is only making things worse by prolonging this Brexit purgatory","story":"IN the last two years wersquove gone from a government with a small majority, Theresa Mayrsquos, to a government with no majority, then to a minority government and finally to no government at all.At least, thatrsquos how it was looking on Friday when Number  threatened to ldquogo on strike this weekLabour continue to block a General Election.Boris Johnson has rolled back from that improbable industrial action, but he was only stating the obvious: we donrsquot have a ing government in Westminster.With a majority of minus  it is impossible for this administration to get its legislation through Parliament.People say we have a zombie parliament, but itrsquos the government that should be pushing up the daisies.For Europeans, used to proportional voting, having no government is quite normal, for periods at least.Belgium, appropriately enough since its capital is Brussels, had no government for nearly two years after an inconclusive election in .

While witch trials took place across Europe, here they reached a level of savagery seen nowhere . Across Europe, around , people were executed as witches. In the s, Scotland had a population of just ,. Here, an estimated  people, mostly women, were tortured and executed by the Kirk and state for witchcraft. Only  people are believed to have been executed for witchcraft in England. In England, witches were hanged. In Scotland, victims were strangled and burned at the stake. During the witch trials the atmosphere in Scotland was tyrannical. People lived in fear and oppression. Whorsquod be accused next The witch hunts were like a virus. Once they started, they spread. Most of the victims were outsiders in some way. They might have been the local eccentric, perhaps they had some mental or physical disability, many were disagreeable people whorsquod annoyed or wished ill on their neighbours, some were healers and lsquowise womenrsquo seen as having unearthly powers, and some victims genuinely believed they were witches. Others were targeted as their accuser had something to gain from their death - money, land, goods. Often, under torture, one accused person would accuse others - and those people would in turn be arrested and tortured and name names. Soon cells were filled with innocents.Lily Seafield, an expert in the lsquoGreat Scottish Witch Huntsrsquo and the author of the book Scottish Witches, says: ldquoIn Europe as a whole, and Scotland in particular, there was a time when fear and hatred of magic and its practitioners reached such a fever pitch that hundreds of men and women were hunted down and made to suffer terribly for alleged crimes of witchcraft. During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the skies over many Scottish towns frequently clouded over with smoke from the fires that sent these people to their deaths.The key, Seafield says, to understanding the witch-hunts is simple: we have to remember that almost everyone in Europe believed in witchcraft at the time, rich or poor, educated or illiterate. Science was in its infancy. Religion dominated every aspect of le. When crops failed, a child unexpectedly died, a ship sank, or illness hit a village, people sought answers. Often, the best explanation seemed black magic. Andmagic was to blame, then witches must be at work. All you had to do to stop misfortune was find and kill the witches.Seafield says: ldquoAlthough similar scenarios were being acted out in other countries in Europe at around the same time, Scotlandrsquos reaction to the perceived threat of witchcraft was particularly severe, and notably much more severe than that of its immediate neighbour England. Some have argued that it was a manestation of the Presbyterian Churchrsquos need to establish its authority over the people in the Post-Reformation period, and of the power struggle between Church and State. Some have linked witch-hatred with anti-Catholic sentiments prevalent at the time. Others have argued the case for misogyny, or gentry versus peasant class.What really turbo-charged the witch-hunts in Scotland, however, was the king. Nowhere  in Europe had a monarch so rabid in their hatred of witches. King James VI of Scotland gave the royal seal of approval to acts that would be today categorised as crimes against humanity.THE NORTH BERWICK WITCH TRIALSIMAGINEtoday there was an international plot uncovered to murder the head of state, their family and inner circle. The security crackdown would be harsh, innocents would get caught up in the dragnet, and the crisis would reshape how we police ourselves.The North Berwick Witch Trials were triggered by the uncovering of a plot - albeit imaginary - which by th century standards must have appeared like September , and King James VI was the target. The story begins in  when the future we of James, Anne of Denmark, was to be brought across the North Sea to Scotland. Storms prevented the crossing, however, and the Danish authorities blamed witchcraft. Arrests were made and two women burned as witches. James travelled to Denmark and brought his we back, but storms sunk one ship carrying wedding gts. The witches, it seemed, hadnrsquot been defeated.Then news came to Edinburgh in  that a coven of witches in Tranent were plotting against the king. The panic around the Tranent coven began with a local healer called Geillis Duncan, who was also a servant. Her master feared thatshe could heal, she could also kill. She was arrested.A witch-pricker investigated Duncanrsquos body for the Devilrsquos Mark - a blemish which would neither bleed nor hurt when pricked with a needle. It was believed that witches made a pact with Satan in person, renounced their baptismal name, and were given a new name by the Devil who then kissed them on the body leaving his mark.Duncanrsquos mark was found on her neck. She confessed under torture to being a witch and began naming names. Torture included thumbscrews - or pilliwinks in Scotland - and the iron boot, or bootikin, which crushed the feet. Fingernails were pulled out or had pins driven under them, legs were crushed, victims were strung up and whipped. Family members were tortured in front of the accused. Most broke within hours.One of those named by Duncan was Agnes Sampson. She was brought before King James - who considered himself an expert in witchcraft - and tortured until she confessed. On Halloween , Sampson said, she and the other witches sailed in sieves to North Berwick where they met Satan and were ordered to kill the King. Often, the more absurd the claims were the more they were believed in witch trials.Unusually for witch trials, the North Berwick case saw members of the gentry accused, as rivals used the panic to settle scores and improve their position. One upper class Scot caught up in the accusations was Barbara Napier. Like many, shersquod once used the services of witch - usually for warding off evil, or love spells. That was enough to seal her fate.Agnes Sampson and Geillis Duncan named Francis Stewart, Earl of Bothwell, as the ringleader. The North Berwick witch trials ran for two years and at least  were arrested for witchcraft and treason. Stewart was eventually acquitted, many others were burned at the stake.The North Berwick case was a sensation, and would influence all future witch trials in Scotland. Shakespeare was inspired to create the witches in Macbeth. Later, Robert Burns drew on the case for Tam OrsquoShanter. King James would go on to write the book Daemonologie - a textbook for future witch-finders. The trials live on it modern culture. The series Outlander features a witch called Geillis Duncan.THE FISHWIFE OF EDINBURGHThe case of Agnes Finnie, an Edinburgh fish trader, is the archetypal Scottish witch trial. Finnie was a poor woman and a nasty piece of work. No-one liked her. If you crossed her, shersquod wish you dead to your face. Over the years, at least half a dozen people she cursed fell ill. One lost the power of speech, one broke a leg, one was paralysed, and one died. People began to refer to her as a witch. In the s, being called a witch was enough to put your le in danger. Soon rumours and gossip became fact, and the authorities were informed. Finnie was taken to the tollbooth in  and held as a witch. She was burned at the stake on Castle Hill.ISOBEL GOWDIEIt seems Isobel Gowdie really did believe she was a witch - though she was probably also a mentally ill attention-seeker. She was arrested in  and taken to the Kirk at Auldearn for interrogation. No torture was necessary as she openly told an elaborate story of witchcraft.Lily Seafield, author of Scottish Witches, says most experts ldquoare willing to accept that Gowdie did believe herself to be a practising witch, and that there were others who shared her beliefs and with her took part in activities that were intentionally maleficent. It also seems clear that whether or not any of the grouprsquos activities did in fact result in harm to their intended victims, or were merely coincidental with misfortunes that befell these people, Gowdie and her fellow witches believed that their magic was effective.Gowdie confessed to having sex with the Devil, turning horses into straw, meeting the Queen of Fairyland, stealing milk from cattle, and plotting to harm children using wax images, like voodoo dolls.She named the  members of her coven, and revealed their lsquowitch namesrsquo, including Margaret Wilson who the Devil called lsquoPickle Nearest the Windrsquo. She told how witches used lsquoelf arrowsrsquo to kill. Modern archaeologists later discovered that lsquoelf arrowsrsquo were actually arrow heads used by neolithic people which were dug up by medieval farmers tilling their land.Gowdie revealed spells for changing into a cat, spoiling crops and killing people. One killing spell involved a bag filled with toad guts, nail clippings and a harersquos liver. More than  people were incriminated.Therersquos no record of Gowdiersquos execution - but thatrsquos not unusual. In  per cent of cases the records are missing. However, most experts believe she was burned at Nairn.THE WITCHES OF POLLOKSHAWSOne Scottish case was the prototype for the Salem witch trials - and it happened in Pollokshaws in what is now Glasgow.Local aristocrat Sir George Maxwell, a well-known witch-hunter, fell ill in . Doctors were unable to help him. A friend of his young daughters, called Janet Douglas, claimed a woman named Janet Mathie had made a wax image of Maxwell and stuck pins in it. The figurine was found and Mathie arrested.Janet Douglas then accused Mathiersquos son, John Stewart, of the same crime. Again, the doll was found, and Stewart was arrested. His -year-old sister, Annabel, was also arrested. She broke under interrogation and began naming names. She also claimed to have slept with Satan. Soon six people were in custody, including a woman of  called Margaret Jackson.Due to Annabelrsquos young age, the court only jailed her. The five others were burned at the stake.Janet Douglas became that rare thing - a female witch-finder. She would go on to hunt down five witches in Dumbarton and more in Stirling. Many now think it was Janet who planted the wax dolls in order to frame those she accused. Her motives remain unknown. Money, fame, attention  What we do know is that she eventually fell foul of the law herself for reasons that are unclear, and was whipped in Edinburgh and then banished from the kingdom.THE PAISLEY WITCHESChristian Shaw was the -year-old daughter of the Laird of Bargarran. In  she fell ill. Doctors in Glasgow examined her, but she deteriorated, apparently coughing up hair, feathers, sticks and bones. She accused a number of poor women in the neighbourhood of cursing her. Once a highlander called at the Lairdrsquos home seeking shelter and Christian accused him of witchcraft. In all six people were held. The authorities demanded each accused touch Christian. When they laid hands on her, the girl went into convulsions.Soon defendants were admitting to consorting with the Devil. More names were named, and more arrests made. By the time of the trial,  people were accused. Charges included the murder of babies, drowning two men in a ferry accident, and killing a minister with fever.Christian exhibited signs of severe mental or behavioural problems. She would laugh, scream, be violent and abusive, have conversations with thin air, and slip into a trancelike state. Two accused died in jail before the trial could start. Seven were finally taken to court and all strangled and burned.Christian Shaw recovered, and would go on to become the founder of the Bargarran sewing thread company.THE LAST WITCHESBy the early s, the witch craze was ending, but there was one last panic in the village of Pittenweem in the East Neuk of Fe. In , a local blacksmith got on the wrong side of a bad tempered woman called Beatrix Lang. She cursed him and he fell ill with paralysis and fitting. He accused both Lang and another woman, Janet Cornfoot, of witchcraft.The minister, Patrick Cowper, led the interrogations. He tortured Lang and denied her sleep for five full days. Inevitably, she confessed and named others. When she recovered, however, she retracted her confession saying it had been extracted under torture. For her troubles, she was tortured again and locked in a dungeon for five months.The authorities in Edinburgh - now more enlightened at the dawn of the th century - eventually ordered Lang released. A mob hounded her from Pittenweem when she ed from prison.Lang was the lucky one. One man caught up in the allegations died in custody from maltreatment. Janet Cornfoot was also released but on herto Pittenweem she was rearrested by Rev Cowper who personally flogged her. She later escaped but was caught by a lynch mob. Cornfoot was strung up on a rope between a ship and the harbour and stoned. Half-dead, she was cut down. As she lay dying on the beach, the mob placed a door on Cornfoot and piled boulders on top, crushing her to death.The last witch executed in Scotland was Janet Horne in  in Dornoch. She was senile, and her daughter had deformed feet and hands. Neighbours accused Horne of shoeing her daughter like a horse and riding on her to meet the Devil. Both mother and daughter were sentenced to death. The daughter escaped, but Horne was stripped naked, smeared in tar, paraded through the town in a barrel and set alight.Nine years after Hornersquos death, the witchcraft laws were repealed as Scotland embraced the Age of Enlightenment.PART TWO NEXT WEEK: THE TRUTH ABOUTSCOTLANDrsquoS MYTHS AND LEGENDS"},{"url":null,"title":"snp-urges-opposition-parties-work-together-get-general-election","story":"Ian Blackford said the SNP will block attempts by the Government to seek an election under the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act for a December  poll, which requires a two-thirds majority of MPs to pass.The party is working with the Liberal Democrats to bring forward a one-line bill which would circumvent the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act and set the date on an early election to December .The plan was branded a ldquogimmick by Conservative Party chairman James Cleverly and a ldquostunt by both Culture Secretary Nicky Morgan and shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth.:Ian Blackford says Scottish independence vote has to happen next yearMr Blackford said the SNP will ldquonot be bullied into backing an election on the Prime Ministerrsquos terms and urged Labour to back the plan for a December  vote.He added: ldquoSNP MPs will reject Boris Johnsonrsquos election motion on Monday which seeks to first allow him to force through his devastating Brexit deal and take the UK out of the EU.

These bus services are described as “commercial”.Local authorities such as Aberdeenshire Council have a duty to identy travel needs within their area which are not otherwise met, and secure what public transport is appropriate taking into account the funds available. These bus services are described as “supported”.In addition to funding fixed route bus services, the council supports community transport, for example dial-a-bus and voluntary car schemes operated by the voluntary sector, provides door-to-door dial-a-bus services and also provides a TaxiCard Scheme which offers a discount on taxi fares, usually £ per journey, for older and disabled residents.Chair of the council’s Infrastructure Services Committee, Councillor Peter Argyle, said: “It was agreed earlier this year that the network should be reassessed by means of a ‘clean-sheet’ approach, in order to identy a more sustainable network in the longer term that will more effectively cater for otherwise unmet travel needs, assist in addressing patronage decline and provide better value for money.“I would encourage all those who currently use bus services or may require them in the future to complete this quick survey which will provide vital information for our wider consultation.”Vice-chair Councillor John Cox added: “In addition to getting the views of residents, our survey is being issued to a wide range of organisations including community councils, rural partnerships, schools and social care facilities.“That feedback will assist us in developing cost-effective, fit-for-purpose services for Aberdeenshire communities in the years to come.”data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.fraserburghherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Here are  of the strangest UK parking laws to be aware of to ensure you avoid being fined by authorities\"   of the strangest UK parking laws viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"FRAS | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"FRAS | Article Teaser\"Further information on the council’s strategy and associated current policies for the support of passenger transport including local bus services, can be found in the Passenger Transport Strategy https:www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk media  passengertransportstrategy.pdfThe questionnaire will be available online from Monday, October  to Monday, December  at https:www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk roads-and-travel public-transport policies-strategies-and-contracts Printed copies being available in local libraries, Aberdeenshire Council offices, Ellon Park  Ride, and Peterhead Interchange, with effect from November ."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"October ,  at : amNHS Orkney#s chief executive has acknowledged that there is room for improvement when it comes to waiting times for specialist dental treatment in the county.

The new agreement has been criticised by commentators for undermining the links between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.Speaking in the house yesterday, Mr Carmichael asked: “The creation of a customs border down the Irish Sea and the necessary declarations as a consequence of that is something about which Ruth Davidson and the former Secretary of State for Scotland warned last year.#They said then, and it’s true now, that it will undermine the Union. Why is the Secretary of State disregarding his Rt Hon Friend’s advice ”Responding in the house, the secretary of state said: “This is a deal that protects the border, this was a key priority for me as Secretary of State. It protects the peace process. The economy of Northern Ireland, I think, will benefit from this deal . . . and I would work over the implementation period to minimise any problems for Northern Ireland businesses in exporting and selling into Great Britain.”Responding after the exchange, Mr Carmichael said: “The Secretary of State’s response was muddled and confused. It shows once again that the Conservative Party is now so fixated with Brexit that it is blind to the damage that they risk doing to the constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom. The lack of concern shown by the Government about this issue is deeply concerning.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This scheme will include looking at prehistoric seafaring and what the Isles were like thousands of years ago, what travel would have been like between the isles with very dferent sea levels. Shipwrecks will also be considered — uncovering more information about wrecks around the isles, looking at any that might still be unrecorded and sharing anecdotes and stories passed down through families and between friends. One aspect of the project will look at maritime cultural landscapes and how sea links and industries have shaped the character of each isle. Maritime art will also be explored in more detail in each island including the possibility of creating an art exhibition or trail that is inspired by the maritime nature of the isles.   Andy Golightly, programme manager for the North Isles Landscape Partnership said: “If people get involved in this project as well as the opportunity to find out more about maritime history and perhaps add to the existing research there will be the chance to learn new and interesting skills including surveying, mapping and even expanding their creative and artistic abilities too”     Natalia Bain from Wessex Archaeology added: “We have arranged a series of information events across isles so people can find out more about the project, the opportunities for involvement and what they would like to research.” Information sessions about the project will be held throughout next week. This includes events at Sanday Community School on Monday, October  Westray Junior High on Tuesday, October  St Ann#s Community Room in Papa Westray on Wednesday, October  Eday Heritage Centre on Thursday, October  North Ronaldsay Community Centre on Friday, November  and at the Boathouse in Shapinsay on Saturday, November .Dates in Stronsay and Rousay, Eglisay and Wyre are to be confirmed.For further information, you can contact the North Isles Landscape Partnership Scheme via its Facebook Page.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

So what better time to test the health of this -year-old Edinburgh institution I begin my journey outside number one Princes Street. The Balmoral stands sentry at the east end and looks as good as ever but I’m on the wrong side of the tracks and across the road the problems begin.Things start well with the Apple Store, a shining example of the need to create a shopping experience to counteract Amazon but a couple of doors down come the phone shops and the first empty site. Outside discarded fast-food detritus blows in the breeze.: The best views in Britain  Edinburgh’s Royal club to become luxury destination: Poundland issue ‘vote of confidence’ for future of Edinburgh’s ailing Princes StreetHeading west is the first great reminder of past Princes Street. At street level only a few inscriptions evoke memories of the old RW Forsyth department store but look up and architectural brilliance is everywhere.A few steps further brings a tartan tat store – all of which promote what no Scot wants Scotland to be. Then the first of the modern blocks on Princes Street. Dull, al and uninviting.Brutalist architectureBut hang on, next it’s Jenners. The window posters may scream  per cent off but it remains the grande dame of Princes Street. Sadly, nowadays its main purpose seems to be as somewhere to get out of the rain.Back outside and past another couple of phone shops and the giant Marks and Spencer, the old BHS site is being redeveloped into a Premier Inn with ground-floor retailanyone is brave enough to take it on.Next comes the New Club and some shoe shops, this brutalist central block a proper carbuncle on the face of Princes Street. I pause at the door of World of Sweets, a retail celebration of our obesity crisis but carry on to the last surviving example of Princes Street as it once was. Except it’s gone. The Hector Russell kiltshop preserved much of the original  Princes Street but a coffee chain has now taken over the building. I’m too disappointed to look inside.Instead I cross Hanover Street and pass the boarded-up Royal Overseas League, some of the giant stores about to relocate to the St James and what will soon be Poundland. Then the curious site of three phone shops in a row, all flogging the same technology and the same deliberately confusing tarfs. Then it’s the end of the road,  Princes Street, currently taking shape as a £m Johnnie Walker Whisky Experience. I stop and look back.It wasn’t as bad as I’d expected and the street is still busy but the worst is yet to come when the big department stores close, as close they will in the next few years.The solution for Princes Street has to be dferent. We are so fixated with the state of the shops we forget the view. With vibrant street-level cafes and housing above, Princes Street can have a future as much as a past but onlyEdinburgh City Council accepts the responsibility and grasps the opportunity.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"new musical recalls orkney s part in canada s fur trade","story":"They were the islanders who travelled in their drovesfrom Orkney to the frozen extremes of Canada in the th and th century in the hope of making a living from the fur trade.They would go on to make up more than three quarters of the workforce for the Hudson’s Bay Company as it expanded and its empire grew ever more profitable.Now the Orcadians who helped forge the success of what is still the oldest company in North America are to be honoured in a new musical show created by a modern-day islander.The Orcadians of Hudson’s Bay will be unveiled by musician and composer Graham Rorie at the annual Celtic Connections music festival in Glasgow in January.His project will be launched at the Mitchell Theatre to coincide with the th anniversary of the formation of the company after two French explorers – Pierre-Esprit Radisson and Médard Chouart Des Groseilliers – discovered a wealth of furin areas accessible via the great inland sea of Hudson Bay. After failing to win enough support in France or America for plans to establish a trading post, the pair met and gained the backing of Prince Rupert, cousin of King Charles II. A group of London businessmen established the Hudson’s Bay Company in May  under a Royal Charter authorised by the monarch. Vast numbers of Orcadians were recruited for the Hudson’s Bay Company from its earliest days as the port of Stromness was the last stop before ships which had left England crossed the Atlantic.The Orcadians, who were used to living and working in a harsh climate, were offered five-year contracts to relocate to Canada.They have been credited with playing critical roles in the success of the company, either working in forts and trading posts, or hunting in the wild. The company went on to enjoy a monopoly on trade across three million square miles of Canada, where it had had the power to establish and enforce laws, erect forts and maintain ships of war.The Celtic Connections show on  January is expected to recall how the Scottish islanders taught the native Cree and Inuit fiddle tunes and dances from their homeland. Rorie, a graduate of the traditional music course at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland in Glasgow, said: “I have an immense amount of pride in coming from Orkney and find its history and connections fascinating.“Wherever you go in the world there is someone who has been to or knows someone connected to the islands. “Workers for the Hudson’s Bay Company started heading across from Orkney in  and continued until the last ship passed through Orkney in the mid s . By  Orcadians made up two thirds of the work force, with  of  staff coming from Orkney. Many Orcadians who made money for themselves came back and invested it in the local community. But a lot of them settled there, often marrying local people.”Rorie’s Celtic Connections commission has allowed him tocreate a group drawn from some of his favourite musicians from the Scottish trad scene, including Orcadian fiddler Kristan Harvey, along with Pàdruig Morrison, Rory Matheson, Signy Jakobsdottir and James Lindsay.The Québécois quintet Le Vent du Nord,who are headlining their own Celtic Connections show at the Royal Concert Hall, will also be special Canadian guests in The Orcadians of Hudson’s Bay.Rorie, a fiddle and mandolin player, added: “The show is a collection of completely new compositions I’ve written for a small house band. Each tune is connected to a figure or story that has inspired me from my research.“When I was speaking to Donald Shawabout the show he suggested getting the band Le Vent du Nord involved. They will join us on some of the tracks to give a crossover sound between Scotland and Canada. It’s a huge honour to be writing for them and the selection of some of my favourite Scottish musicians.“The Celtic Connections show will be the premiere of the project. My plan is to take it round on some more gigs over the year and eventually make an album. “Having a show at the festival will hopefully set the ball rolling to do a lot more with it.”©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"poll scottish independence voters switching to support the union","story":"The Progress Scotland survey found  per cent of voters ldquocompletely support Scotland staying part of the UK, compared with  per cent who ldquocompletely support Scotland becoming independent.Read more: Poll: Nicola Sturgeonrsquos push for election out of step with ScotsThe Survation poll was commissioned by Progress Scotland, headed by former SNP Westminster leader Angus Robertson, and surveyed , Scots at the start of the month.It sought answers on a spectrum of - to identy strength of opinion on the issue, with  marking ldquocomplete support for staying in the UK, while  ldquocomplete support for independence.A narrow majoritywere more supportive of the Union, with  per cent in the middle and  per cent more supportive of independence.

It does not make economic sense to withdraw our markets in the EU, for the sake of other markets within the USA. It is not only this, but the tax payer will foot the bill for negotiating trade with the USA, where, as mentioned, it will be under the USA#s control, terms and conditions. The tax payer will also foot the bill for any trade deal arrangement where the USA will benefit immensely with a # forced to take it or leave it # scenario for the UK citizen.

The proposal was supported by the two SNP councillors in the Barra and South Uist Ward and the five SNP councillors from Lewis and Harris.”In his statement, Councillor MacMillan also accused Labour Highlands and Islands MSP Rhoda Grant of calling for a government inquiry into the issue as a means of “taking the focus” off of comhairle convenor Councillor Norman A MacDonald # whom he described as a “Labour party colleague” to Rhoda Grant # and who has voted, according to Councillor MacMillan, to back the Uist dental plan.Councillor MacMillan added: “Rhoda Grant#s proposal for an inquiry is a politically motivated ersionary tactic designed to prevent the truth about Labour Party councillors voting to close the medical provision at Uist Hospital.“Rhoda Grant should instead call for the Western Isles NHS to start telling the truth, to publish the voting record of the [Integration Joint Board]meeting and explain the real reason for centralising the dental provision into the Uist Hospital which is to close the Operating Theatre and Resuscitation Room to remove the surgical capacity from the hospital.”Responding to the claims, Norman A MacDonald stated that he wasn#t present at the last IJB meeting, and said that “assurances had been given” that the relocation of the dental service in Uist would have “no detrimental impact on the Uist and Barra hospital whatsoever.The convenor added: “After the original vote at the IJB on this matter resulted in a split vote, from then on it was up to the chief executives to decide what would take place.“I have no idea what kind of influence Councillor MacMillan might think I have, as both Uist and Barra hospital and the Western Isles Hospital hospital are solely the responsibility of the health board and it is not for councillors to make any decisions on their future.“I have never discussed in any shape or form either the dental service in Uist or her call for an inquiry with Rhoda Grant.“As to the colour of my politics, Councillor MacMillan#s claims are equally questionable. I have registered for the last fteen years as an independent councillor.”Mrs Grant said: “Councillor MacMillan#s assertion would be laughable were it not such a serious issue in question.“I have, from the outset in , listened to the concerns being raised by constituents, by the Uist Locality Planning Group, by the Association of Community Councils, by a stakeholder event held in Lochboisdale, and by all local elected members serving when this proposal to centralise dental services was first aired.“I have repeatedly made representation to the IJB, to NHS Western Isles, to the comhairle, to the previous Health Secretary, and to the First Minister.“Health boards and local authorities throughout Scotland are having to make incredibly dficult decisions to fit with the reducing budgets they are being given and perhaps Councillor MacMillan, instead of throwing meaningless insults around, would do better focusing on bringing this to the attention of his colleagues in the Scottish Government, opposing jobs and services being taken out of local communities.“This is an appalling decision, which flies in the face of local democracy, and constituents in Uist deserve to have their concerns heard, and heeded.”Officially, it was something called the Integration Joint Board that made the announcement at the end of last month: all roads will soon lead to Balivanich. But the IJB began le as a creature of the big boys it is staffed by officials from both public agencies. Is its independence nominal  It#s hard to be sure.Whatever the limits of its power, it is a useful fig leaf to hide behind. The barrage of flak directed at this rotten decision to centralise a vital health service can be dodged by the likes of NHS Western Isles chief executive Gordon Jamieson. The plan to close three dental surgeries came from the IJB. At least that#s how it was sold to the public.Before too long, everyone in the Uists will have to go to hospital in Balivanichthey need a filling or a tooth extracted. So much for the “professional concerns” comhairle chief executive Malcolm Burr has supposedly spent that last six months mulling over. At the end of September, he fell into line. Unanimity was required in order to proceed, and he delivered it.One particular paragraph from the IJB decision paper is worth quoting in full: “Given his familiarity with the subject matter, the chief executive of NHS Western Isles was able to come to an early view about the best arrangements for the provision of dental services in Uist but the chief executive of the comhairle, having no previous experience of these services, required more time to familiarise himself with the detail.”This admission is revealing. Completely out of his depth, it took Mr Burr six months to swot up on the intricacies of closing three dental surgeries before wielding the axe. In doing so, he perhaps exposed the limits of integrating health and social care, which is the IJB#s raison d#etre. Put simply, it should not be the responsibility of someone with no background in health care to make a decision like this. The IJB say there will be an “outreach” service aimed primarily at South Uist and Eriskay, the latter  miles away from Balivanich along single-track roads. What this pledge means, in dental terms, is still to be decided. Perhaps teeth can be extracted safely in the back of a van.If the fruits of integration — a much-hyped national paradigm — are vandalism on this scale, then we suggest a rethink is in order. The hybrid organisations driving the agenda don#t seem to be accountable to anyone, least of all the voters.Speaking of which, we are glad to see that Western Isles MSP Alasdair Allan has had a quiet word with Public Health Minister Joe Fitzpatrick about referring the matter to the Scottish Government. Ultimately, it is Health Secretary Jeane Freeman who has the power to stop this. Hopefully, she#ll use it before Stornoway wrecks a system that has worked well for decades."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MOD-GLW-19-GOLD-MEDAL-1.jpg","title":"both of this years gold medals are won by glasgow","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineAfter  years living in the city, Claire and family were due to move back to her native Ness in Lewis on Monday.The -year-old teacher had previously won the Traditional Gold when the mòd was in Stornoway in .

He said: “With the Hallowe’en break upon us, there still unfortunately remains the threat from large volumes of often illegal fireworks in the countryside.  “These illegal fireworks, and especially the loud banger types, still pose a considerable threat to farm livestock. “In my capacity as Constituency MLA, I have welcomed any past seizures in by the police of any amounts of illegal fireworks which could have caused injury not just to others but also to the users. “I appeal to the community thatthey have any knowledge of these types of attacks to give the information as soon as possible to the police so that these people can be brought before the courts and face the due process of the law. “I also appeal to parents to ensure they know that their children are doing. Attacks on live stock are an open attack on the farmer’s livelihood and assets.  “And it’s not just farm animals which have suffered under the threat of the so-called Banger Menace.  “As a community, we have a moral duty to assist the police and the courts in eradicating the threats to le and physical attacks from these Hallowe’en Hoods.  “These socially sick iniduals often get their kicks by intimidating the more vulnerable in our society. As a community, we cannot afford to wait until a flock or herd is burned alive before taking action to help the forces of law and order stamp out the Banger Menace. “As a community, we must not be flippant about the threat of fire dangers to barns and bales, especially with the high costs of replacement fodder for the upcoming winter,” said Assemblyman Swann.

Is it a bird  Is it a plane  No, it’s a hawk-shaped kite designed to scare away seagulls and other sky-borne nuisances. Graciously circling overhead like birds of prey on the hunt, two faux hawks are simply attached to a line and pole, which is mounted to the roof of the fast food restaurant, rising and falling with every change in the wind. Passers-by could be forgiven for being startled when the kite is whipped into action by a gentle breeze that helps keep the seagulls at bay . Historically, seagulls have lived near the sea or sometimes beside rivers and reservoirs, but they have increasingly been found in inland towns and cities where they are often viewed as pests by the urban population.The problem is made worse by the fact that the main culprit is the herring gull – one of the largest and most aggressive members of the gull family on the island of Ireland.One reason for the growth in the number of gulls is the relative safety for the birds of perches atop man-made structures, where gulls commonly build their nests out of the reach of predators.Another reasons that gulls have moved inland is the abundant supply of food waste, which helps sustain them. No surprise, then, that they might flock to supermarkets, shops and food outlets like McDonald’s.While retailers, local government authorities, and restaurants have been keen to limit the birds’ access to food waste by using lidded bins and encouraging proper disposal, the urban gull perseveres. The daring and intelligent birds have been known to swoop down on humans to snatch food from their hands – an obvious danger when you’re trying to eat a Big Mac. While the law makes it illegal to recklessly injure or kill any gull or damage or destroy an active nest or its contents, it does, in the interest of health and safety, make allowances for certain control measures, and there are few more clever – or more humane – than the kite hawk. The urban gulls have been the subject of human concern leading, in some cases, to lethal methods of control. However, given that they are a red-list threatened species, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds questions the use of lethal control as a means of dealing with the issue.A less aggressive method of control – like that employed by McDonald’s at Westwoods – is just one solution that may help our co-habitation. At the very least, your McNuggets are somewhat safer."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"welsh fm%e2%80%88calls for bridge building at belfast","story":"THE First Minister of Wales Mark Drakeford AM was in Belfast on Friday when he appealed for bridge-building across the Irish Sea despite the headwinds of Brexit.The Welsh premier made the appeal at the gala banquet of the Belfast International Homecoming in City Hall.He also said he was envious of the strong global Irish American networks – which were represented at the three day Homecoming event which showcased the best of Belfast to the Irish diaspora.Mr Drakeford praised the “well organised diaspora” of Ireland and Scotland for promoting their country’s “practical interests around the globe”, but called for better self-organisation to protect Welsh interests in the context of Brexit.“There are Welsh people, too, around the world,” he said.“They are just as passionate about their identity and the home from which they have sprung – but they don’t yet operate in that organised way we see in this room.“For us, that means we have to work harder – and harder still in the headwinds of Brexit – to sustain our profile and our unique identity on the international stage. Since I became First Minister, in December last year, we have an International Relations Minister in our Cabinet – an idea completely unthinkeable at the start of devolution. We have a highly regarded International Strategy, which is being discussed and debated across Wales.”Mr Drakeford stressed the importance of forging links between people on “dferent sides of the Irish Sea”, particularly those from “Celtic nations”.“Amongst us all are links of language, of history, of culture, of economic identity and, in many instances of progressive political outlook,” he said.“We all share the presence of a powerful neighbour, with a global and dominant language and a well-developed sense of its own signicance. In the Brexit context – and beyond it too – we have had the best results, I believe, when we have been able to work together, in an informal Celtic alliance, to provide a more powerful counterweight to hard line leave propositions than we could have mobilised working on our own.“And in the dficult days ahead, I think the effort to identy common interests, to act with a sense of solidarity in their pursuit, and to create outcomes which work for us all – that effort will be needed as never before.”"},{"url":null,"title":"arlene foster accuses uups steve aiken of handing seats to sinn fein after ruling out electoral pacts","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I said so at the time.“Because you can’t use the threat of violence to achieve something.“And that unfortunately now has set a precedent where people from loyalism are looking at that, and they’re saying ‘hold on a second, he used that in that particular way, so now we’re going to use that’.“That’s wrong. That is not the way forward.”Ms Foster said loyalist concerns about the Brexit deal were understandable.“I am not dismissing, and I want to be very clear on this, fears and concerns of the loyalist community, or indeed unionist middle class people, or anybody in unionism at the moment, because actually unionism and loyalism are all at one relation to this deal – they are rejecting it,” she said.“So instead of talking about loyalist violence in relation to that, let’s deal with those fears.“And let’s deal with those concerns in a way that addresses them.“And the way to do that, of course, is to try and deal with those issues aroundconsent and the concerns that we have around customs.”In response to Ms Foster’s remarks, a spokesman for the Taoiseach said: “The Irish Government is a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement.“Protecting peace on the island of Ireland has and always will be our overriding objective.“It should be clear to everyone that Brexit itself has disturbed the political equilibrium in Northern Ireland.“It’s the main reason why the Irish Government was against it.“We have never wanted any new borders neither North-South nor in the Irish Sea.“Unfortunately, leaving the EU customs union and single market requires that checks must now happen somewhere.”"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland public goes wild for bears and wolves roaming free at sanctuary in donegal","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

They were kept in a concrete cell with iron bars and their feet had never touched the earth, nor had they ever been able to enjoy a swim, which is something bears in their natural habitat love,\" he said.\"We brought these three bears, who are all from the one family, here and it was a sight to behold when we released them into the habitat we created for them here.\"They took tentative steps onto the earth two weeks ago and on Thursday the large male took a swim and went into the water for the first time ever.\"It was actually quite emotional because he went out of his depth and panicked, but his natural instincts soon kicked in.\"Mr McLaughlin, whose day job is a solicitor, hopes to add to Wild Irelands collection.However, he still believes the sight of wild animals roaming the land, as happened in a bygone age, is unlikely to happen any time soon.He said: \"The animals we have are all rescued animals and we hope to bring other rescued animals here, but they would have to remain in this sanctuary because it just is not possible to reintroduce them to their natural habitat.\"If we want to reintroduce them we would have to link up all of our national parks with corridors of forest and wilderness - they would need that level of space to roam, but I think realistically we are hundreds of years away from that,\" Mr McLaughlin addedWild Ireland is now open to the public with all entrance fees going to the running costs of the sanctuary."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37391119.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/road%20closed.jpg","title":"northern ireland traffic alerts latest updates","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The walk, which is flat and suitable for all abilities, will be Up the Line from Coshowen along the river and back. A spokesperson for Older People North West, said: :Come along and walk with us at your own pace. A bus will be leaving from Malvern House on Chapel Road at .pm. Ring    you would like to travel with us to Coshowen. Booking is essential as there is a limit of  on the bus. Feel free to join us directly at Coshowen, on the Foyle Road, where we will meet up at .pm. Let us know by phone or by email:development@olderpeoplenorthwest.orgthat you will be coming so that the group knows whom to expect. googletag.cmd.push “What we learned on the first walk was that people enjoy being outdoors. For some it is great motivation to walk with a group, for others it provides confidence in walking on greenways and lonelier paths because they have company. “This is the start of a good habit and a great way to get up and out, particularly on these darker evenings. We hope to get through the winter and build relationships through walking, talking and the cup of tea afterwards in Malvern House. We are learning that strangers are only the friends that you haven’t met.”    If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

These sides are no strangers to each other and it is a game that features two of the outstanding underage teams in the country over the past few years having clashed with each other in the last two All Ireland Feacuteile finals, Burren winning the  Feile and Magherafelt gaining revenge in the final of the  Feacuteile. Both teams are no strangers to the Paul McGirr tournament either with Burren’s latest visit being last year where they were defeated narrowly in the semi final by Lavey, they have fonder memories of the tournament however from  when they won it with a team from which many of the players have already progressed onto their senior team which won last year’s Down title. googletag.cmd.push This season Burren’s success has continued having blitzed their way through the Down league and championship culminating in a - to - victory over Bredagh in the championship final. With  of their starting team from last year’s Paul McGirr campaign there is no doubt that Burren are the team to beat this year. James Kelly, Patrick McCarthy and Ryan Magill backbone a talented defence, Odhran Murdock and Conlin Bradley will be looking to dominate proceedings in midfield while up front James Duggan, Zach Murdock and Eoin Loughran are all noted score getters. However their talisman Niall Toner is the man the Derry champions will really have to look out for, his displays in the tournament last year were breathtaking to say the least and there is no doubt he will have a major bearing on the contest. Lead coach Neil Coulter feels his preparations have been hindered somewhat but is looking forward to the occasion ‘Burren are delighted to be once again representing Down in this year’s Paul McGirr Ulster Tournament, preparations have been tough going as  of our players were involved with the minor’s in last Sunday’s championship final replay so getting them together this past few weeks hasn’t been easy, however we are really looking forward to Saturday’s game against Magherafelt, it is a repeat of the Feacuteile finals and will be a really tough battle.’ Magherafelt are a club that’s riding on a crest of a wave at the minute with this week being one of the most memorable in the south Derry club’s history, adding the Derry U title to their historic senior victory last weekend. Wednesday evenings - to - victory over a fancied Lavey in wet and windy conditions was met with great euphoria and Enda Qunn’s men will be looking to take that momentum into Saturday’s fixture. They won’t have had much time to recover but they are a side laced with quality, Luke McCann and Eoin McEvoy the fulcrum of a solid defence with McCann likely being given the unenviable task of keeping tabs on Toner. Cormac Bateson and Dan Higgins form a very solid midfield partnership and up front they have their own talisman in Daragh Wade who was part of last season’s Derry minor . This game has the potential to be one of the best in the long history of the Paul McGirr tournament and no doubt both clubs will bring a huge support with them for the fixture. It is an intriguing match up with both sides being used to success and being very familiar with each other. Magherafelt will definitely not be ring rusty but may feel the effects of their draining battle with Lavey on Wednesday night. The hurt of having lost out to Lavey in last years semi final should give Burren that bit of an extra incentive and this could well tip the scales in their favour, either way whoever emerges from the tie will be favourites to annex the  Paul McGirr title.

We must’ve had a least a  minute phone-call with him saying ‘you’re doing nets’ and me saying ‘no’ but sure look where I am at now and I’m happy about it,” the imposing Magherafelt custodian utters with a smile. “I’ll take it.”For the last two weeks, Barry Gillis worked intently with Lynch ahead of the biggest day in the clubs history for  years.He kicked ball through the eye of a needle almost and made himself impassable when an Ethan Doherty goal would’ve opened a four point lead in the first-half.As well as that, his handling was impeccable as stray, wind-assisted balls dropped in on top of him in the second-half.How does a young player deal with pressure “You expect the pressure, that’s what comes from being in nets. If somebody outfield drops the ball, somebody  picks it up. If I drop the ball, it’s a goal. You saw it yourself a few games ago . I have played in a few big games but nothing like this. In the big games, you know what to expect.”At one point in the second-half he took off on a foray into the midfield zone. It’s impossible to clip his wings all the time.“You play with a bit of freedom as well. I get to go on wee runs but they don’t want too many of them. You’re the th man and whenever everyone  is wrecked out the pitch, you are fresh and get to go.”Lynch comes into the senior setup with a contingent of their U winning team and they have fitted like a glove.There is a buzz in the camp and their celebrations, with their tops off, in a local hostelry after their win over Coleraine only galvanised them.“They have been off ever since,” Lynch joked.The togetherness has been fostered by the management team.“It is a great squad to be part of,” he adds. “Cush, Baggio , QBand Tomare very involved. They are close together.”There is another attraction in the senior camp for Lynch. The chance to play alongside those he looked up to.“Danny , Chief – I grew up beside Jared and grew up watching him and that’s what you want to be, now I have the chance to play beside him.“Joe Keenan retired four years ago, took two years out and now he is back flying fit and came on there today. It’s great to get a chance to play with the boys you looked up to.”The Rossa ‘keeper jersey is in safe hands. googletag.cmd.push   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Sean O’Connor moved on to Armstrong to shut down his threat, while Marty Donaghy’s influence waned after he sustained an arm injury.In contrast, Foreglen only grew in confidence as time ticked on, with Mark McCormick and Kevin O’Connor clinical from the dead ball, while Ciaran McFeely made a huge impact off the bench. googletag.cmd.push BREATHLESSClaudy made two changes to their listed team, with Callum McElhinney in at full-back for Cory Armstrong – tasked with picking up Kevin O’Connor – while Conall White was in for the injured Shane McGahon, acting as the sweeper alongside Stephen Farren and pushing Paddy Hargan into midfield on Mark McCormick alongside Eoin McGahon.Caolaacuten and Cahir O’Connor were the men inside for Foreglen, watched by Fionain Smyth and Jamie Brown respectively, and it allowed Kevin to pull out and create the space with his movement.Conor Johnston squared up to Kevy Dunne, but also acted as the plug in the centre of defence alongside McGahon to stop Oisin Duffy’s runs from deep – with Marty Donaghy pulling out onto the ’ to add his experience.Shea Kerrigan started as the lone man inside, with Cathal O’Hara doing the marking, but Claudy rotated the play – with Aaron Kerrigan and ‘Nugget’ both moving in there at dferent times.With the wind in their favour, the men in blue opened the scoring with two minutes gone, with Marty Donaghy spraying a crossfield pass to younger brother Aaron, and he had time and space inside the ’ to turn inside and chip a right-footed effort over the bar. Aaron Kerrigan doubled the advantage on four minutes with a well-struck free off the ground from the right sideline after Paddy Hargan was fouled.It was the tried and trusted who got Foreglen on the board seconds later when a quick burst of pace through the middle saw Oisin Duffy feed Kevin O’Connor, and he turned away from Callum McElhinney before pointing.A patient O’Brien’s move was ended with a Conal White interception, and it sent the Mitchel’s away. Marty Donaghy took possession on his own ’ and ran all the way into the Foreglen half before palming off the attentions of Eoghan Duffy and sending over a fantastic score – - to -.Pauric Morahan was next to show his pace as he evaded Stephen Farren and Aaron Donaghy down the right before finding Caolan O’Connor, but his attempt from  metres was controversially waved wide.Foreglen were enjoying a period of pressure after a slow start, and they reduced the gap to one on  minutes when a Morahan free was worked into the corner, and Cahir O’Connor turned away from Jamie Brown before fisting over from the angle, with the goal on.Aaron Kerrigan took his tally to two in the th minute when Paddy Hargan recovered after an initial fumble to get the ball through to the forward ahead of McCormick – who wanted the foul in midfield – but Kerrigan advanced on goal and chipped it beautully over the bar while off balance.Oisin Duffy’s runs from deep were being thwarted well early on, but he was stopped illegally by a heavy hit from Stephen Farren on the quarter hour mark. Barry Cassidy played the advantage and Liam O’Hara picked out Kevin O’Connor for the score – - to -.The game was levelled for the first time on  minutes when O’Connor won a soft free off Hargan on the  metre line, and the experienced forward dusted himself down to split the sticks.Claudy regained the lead three minutes later however, when Armstrong took a pass from Marty Donaghy and, despite having his arm pulled, managed to spin around and send one over from  metres off the left – - to -.He followed it up with a free after Eoin McGahon claimed the kick-out and Aaron Donaghy’s initial effort was well blocked down by James O’Kane before Armstrong was fouled, and converted.Another soft free in the Claudy defence after Fionain Smyth had initially won the turnover allowed O’Connor to take his tally to - and make it - to - on the board.Kevin then had the ball in the net after an initial Caolan O’Connor shot came back off the post, but it was ruled out as Cassidy had blown for a free. Mark McCormick slotted it over the top and, once again, it was a level playing field.Foreglen then took the lead for the first time in the final minute of normal time when patient play ended with McCormick fisting over the top for John Duffy in space, and he popped it over from  metres – issuing a cry into the ear of McGahon in celebration.The lead lasted just  seconds though as Hargan was fouled at the other end and the impressive Armstrong was on target with the free from the right.He was the man in form for Claudy, and he grabbed his fourth in added time when he latched on to a brilliant Aaron Kerrigan pass and sent it over off his weaker right foot to give the Mitchel’s the slimmest of leads at the break. Half-time:Claudy -Foreglen -  Pauric Morahan was moved into the half forward line at the start of the second-half on Blaine Carlin, with Sean O’Connor on Oran Armstrong.A pull from Jamie Brown on the shirt of Cahir O’Connor after he beat him for pace down the right allowed Mark McCormick to level things again within two minutes of the restart.The first manic moment came on  minutes when Marty Donaghy rode a heavy hit to feed Aaron, and his shot was batted down by Tiarnan Burke on the line and gathered in by John Duffy to prevent Conall White having an easy finish to the net.The Mitchel’s edged ahead again on  minutes and no surprise it was off the boot of Armstrong who curled a free off the ground and just over the bar, despite the efforts of McCormick on the line – - to -, but Claudy’s last.An Eoghan Duffy score after James O’Kane won the break from a Reilly kick-out came before Hargan struck the outside of the post after a fine Claudy move that started with some excellent skill from substitute Jamie Donaghy.Ciaran McFeely was also enjoying an influence off the bench, and he picked a pass in midfield to Kevin O’Connor who took a high tackle from McElhinney and opened his second-half account from the free after  minutes – - to - to Foreglen.The O’Brien’s stretched their lead to two for the first time in the game with  minutes left, when Caolan O’Connor was hacked down by Hargan but managed to get it away to Kevin for the point.The gap was three on  minutes when Aaron Kerrigan hesitated at one end and sent the ball wide, and from the kick-out Ciaran McFeely won the break and immediately looked for Kevin O’Connor. He found Liam O’Hara off the shoulder who chipped over the bar from ten metres – - to -.Foreglen’s dominance continued heading into added time as Eoghan Duffy found acres of space on the  metre line to stick it over the bar, followed by a super McCormick free from the right sideline.It was the midfielder who got the last score of the final with another free to signal wild celebrations from the green and gold.

Ref: Barry Cassidy .  MAN OF THE MATCHEoghan Duffy – Foreglen were resilient as a team in the first-half, but in the second they came to le – and a lot of it was down to Eoghan Duffy. He was everywhere, first to the ball, powerful on the run, and scored two super points. TURNING POINTChanges – When both teams needed to switch it up and break the cycle, it was Foreglen’s bench that proved the dference. Ciaran McFeely entered the fray after  minutes and took control in midfield to assert the Foreglen dominance. SCORE OF THE GAMEDonaghy point – It was only the one score for Marty Donaghy on the day, but it was typically brilliant. He took the ball inside his own half, ran the guts of  metres and then fired over on the spin, despite being under a lot of pressure.

Foreglen got the first score and once they get a lead, they are hard to peg back.“We will go away and scratch our heads and wonder how it got away from us but it is what it is. At the end of the day, Foreglen is a good side and congratulations to them.”When Oran Armstrong’s free escaped the clutches of Mark McCormick to give Claudy a th minute lead, - to - it proved to be their last score of the game.“We just couldn’t get it over the bar,” McGonigle expressed of how they slipped out of the game and pointed to the injury sustained by captain Marty Donaghy.“If it hadn’t have been Marty Donaghy, he would probably have been taken off. We kept him on thinking, he might get a snf of a goal but it didn’t really click today for us. We didn’t get them ball in well enough and the full-forward line just wasn’t able to get the scores we needed. You need the wee breaks, we didn’t get them today and that’s the way it goes.”McGonigle also gave credit to how Foreglen managed the game.“They suck the le out of you and once they get a lead, they are hard to get the ball off. They keep it tight and are good at killing out games. We knew thatthey got a lead, they’d be hard to claw back.”After winning the league, they will begin  in the top flight.“We will go away and lick our wounds but we’ll be back for senior football and we’ll give it a rattle. At the end of the day, this team is pretty young. Take Marty out of that, there is a really good core of young players there and that’s what we’ll be building on. Hopefully in the first ision, we will be able to give a good account of ourselves.”Speaking to the County Derry Post earlier in the season, former Derry forward Donaghy hinted that this season would be his last in the blue and white.“I can’t see him playing again,” McGonigle feels.  “It is hard for him. He has a lot of knocks and he has been hobbling about for half the season. “I’d say that’s Martynow but hopefully not, we could be doing with him for a few more years yet.We’ll see. Maybe a couple of months away from it is the best thing for him and see how he feels in January or February.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Or perhaps he just couldn’t quite believe what he was seeing.“We were talking about doing it for the parish during a meeting on Saturday and there was a video of near enough everybody in the community wishing us well and wishing everybody good luck – whether it was brothers, sisters, friends, mums, dads, children, everyone was on it,” Duffy told the County Derry Post. “It’s not about us, it’s not about the players, it’s everybody in the community and in the club house we celebrate it together. “Winning championships is great, I love it, but I only love it because it brings everybody together, the whole community, and that’s what it’s all about.” googletag.cmd.push RUB OF THE GREENIn a game that was so nip and tuck in the first half, with Foreglen leading for less than a minute and down a point at the break, Duffy said they believed in their plan all the way, with the underdogs tag only adding incentive.“To be honest I found it a bit bizarre how strong of favourites Claudy were against us.

I saw halfway through the second half as well that Marty Donaghy was holding his arm, so it was probably a big loss to Claudy offensively when he wasn’t firing on all cylinders with the injury. “Again, you get the rub of the green some days.

Co-written withRTEacutebroadcasterJoe DuffyChildrenof the Troubles tells the story of  children aged  and under who died in the conflict between  and .Based on original interviews with almost  families, as well as extensive archival research it has an account about each victim and how they died.Mr Duffy had the idea for Children of the Troubles when he was working on his  book Children of the Rising and on hearing aboutFreya, who is Northern corespondent for the , asked her to get on board.It was a much bigger project than I think either of us realised, she admittedThere was so much research and so many interviews in the last year in particular.The pair painstakingly scoured newspapers and contacted victim supportgroups to help compile the book.You do wonder of there are any children we havent heard of, said MsMcClements.There may well be others whose deaths werent made public.That is why we did a lot of public appeals too through newspapers like the Derry News, asking families to come forward.Tragically, some of the children in the book have no surviving relatives.We have children in the book and there are some families that we werent bale to get in contact with.Some didnt have any survivingfamily and it was really sad as no one was able to speak on their behalf.There were also some families who didnt wish to speak, but they all wished us well with the book.For some of the families it was the first time they had spoken publicly about their loved one.We were very mindful that we were asking people about probably the worst thing that could ever happen to someone, continuedFreya.It was still very painful for them to revisit it.People said that we would be bringing things up for the families, but they said that was completely untrue because this is something they think about every single day.As a journalist I would always say its not about me, its about the families but you wouldnt be humanyou werent affected.There was one mother in particular, who I wont name, and we were just hugging each other.Joe andFreyaset out to show people who these children were.We very deliberately always started with something about the child, she explained.Sometimes there is a tendency in journalism to talk about the incident rather than the inidual.So we talked about the boy who wanted to be a priest or who loved playing outside.We made it something about them.You feel you get to know the children as people.What they liked to do, what they wanted to be when they grew up.The resulting book pays tribute to these young lives andFreyasays she is proud of what they have achieved.As a journalist I write a lot of things and then they are in tomorrows paper and then they are gone.But this feels a lot more permanent.All those children should still have been alive today and I would like to think people will come away with a sense of that.Even bringing the families togetherfor the launch felt signicant.The publication of the book has also led to talk of a permanent memorial for child victims of the Troubles.I would be led by the families in that, saidFreya.If it was something they thought they would like to see then I would be delighted for them.One of the things that Joe and I felt was remarkable was that there wasnt even a complete list of all the children that had died, and now they are talking about remembering them and I think that is very signicant.Its fantastic that conversation has got going. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Having attended the meeting, Councillor Bateson voiced his concerns with the current play provisions, particularly in Larchfield, Kilrea and urged for much needed improvements. He said: “Outdoor play areas must be attractive, safe and welcoming for all children. The current facilities on offer within these areas have been noted in recent reports by Causeway Coast and Glens Council for much needed improvements and maintenance. Some of these play parks such as Larchfield, have been left in a serious state of disrepair. googletag.cmd.push This has been raised to me by a number of local residents. I have voiced their concerns and made the case that the current facilities are unacceptable.

In , O’Kane had fallen  feet from the masthead of a ship in Belfast docks. He sustained multiple injuries, primarily to the spine and hips. Despite six months’ treatment in hospital, his mobility was restricted and he could barely walk. At the beginning of , doctors advised him that only by amputating his right leg could his le be spared. “I would rather die with two legs than live with one,” he said. He refused the operation, deciding to seek a cure in Lourdes. “I knew thatI reached Lourdes I would be made fit and well,” he remarked.Immediately after his arrival, he noticed an improvement in his mobility. “I thought I felt slightly better,” he said. The following day – a Sunday – he felt even stronger. “I walked from my bed to the dressing table on Sunday morning – the first time I had walked unaided from the date of the accident,” he reflected. On that day, he also walked to the grotto. He did so without using his stick. He brought it with him, however, but only to discard it. After adding his stick to the pile of crutches – and having offered thanks to Our Lady – he then walked away unaided. “The pilgrims who saw him on the outward journey are astonished at his present condition,” one news report commented.O’Kane’s we was overjoyed to see her husband on his . She had gone to the railway station to meet him. “I was looking into the carriage windows to see where he was and help him out and get his bags,” Mrs. O’Kane remarked. “When he went away he was on sticks, and could only walk with dficulty. “Imagine my feelings when I saw a smiling man walking fit and well towards me. I could hardly believe it was my husband. “I could hardly keep from crying with joy.” Not long after his , O’Kane said: “I hope to visit Lourdes next Easter, in thanksgiving to Our Lady of Lourdes, andpossible each succeeding year.” He was also clear about where, and to whom, his gratitude was due – “Lourdes and the intervention of Our Lady.” Co-author Keane has published  books, including eight No. bestsellers, among them “The Little Flower: St. Theacuteregravese of Lisieux and Padre Pio: Irish Encounters with the Saint.” Una O’Hagan is a number one bestselling author and former newsreader with Radio Telefiacutes Eacuteireann.

Last season Academy vied with Limavady and Clogher Valley for top spot in the league all year so Limavady expected a dficult encounter.Limavady got off to a bright start which resulted in Ben Riley scoring from a fine inidual effort when he broke clear from the half way line to touch down under the posts Luke Faulkner converted. For most of the first half the game was tightly fought until the th minute when Stewart Roddy ran in a score following good work from Luke Montgomery. Luke Faulkner again converted. Just before half time Limavady scored two further tries which effectively killed the game off. Following a good break from Peter Wilson at scrum half Ben Riley was on his shoulder to take the try scoring pass. The bonus point try came when captain Jody McMurray spotted that the home defence had gone to sleep when he coolly strolled in under the posts. Luke again converted to take the half time score to . in Limavady’s favour.The second half continued in much the same vein. Limavady scored first when Peter Wilson broke from the ten metre line to outpace the home defence and score in the corner. Luke Faulkner, in excellent form with the boot this year, once again stepped up with the conversion.Academy managed to hit back with a try of their own, however it was only a matter of time until Limavady would score again. Gavin Martin, now playing in the out half position, managed to make a break and fed Stewart Roddy for his second try of the game. Try number seven came as a result of a long clearance kick from Luke Faulkner which was brilliantly chased down by Stewart Roddy. Putting pressure on Academy’s last line of defence Roddy managed to secure ball and fed inside to Stuart Morrow following up in support. Jody McMurray converted.The only other score was a late consolation effort by Academy when they again crossed in the corner.To top off an excellent day Limavady nds also won convincingly . with tries from Jason Kerr , JamieMillar , Aaron Reilly , John Purcell, Jack Elliott, and Harry McAleese. Harry converted nine of these ten tries.No fixtures for either side next week. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Last season Academy vied with Limavady and Clogher Valley for top spot in the league all year so Limavady expected a dficult encounter.Limavady got off to a bright start which resulted in Ben Riley scoring from a fine inidual effort when he broke clear from the half way line to touch down under the posts Luke Faulkner converted. For most of the first half the game was tightly fought until the th minute when Stewart Roddy ran in a score following good work from Luke Montgomery. Luke Faulkner again converted. Just before half time Limavady scored two further tries which effectively killed the game off. Following a good break from Peter Wilson at scrum half Ben Riley was on his shoulder to take the try scoring pass. The bonus point try came when captain Jody McMurray spotted that the home defence had gone to sleep when he coolly strolled in under the posts. Luke again converted to take the half time score to . in Limavady’s favour.The second half continued in much the same vein. Limavady scored first when Peter Wilson broke from the ten metre line to outpace the home defence and score in the corner. Luke Faulkner, in excellent form with the boot this year, once again stepped up with the conversion.Academy managed to hit back with a try of their own, however it was only a matter of time until Limavady would score again. Gavin Martin, now playing in the out half position, managed to make a break and fed Stewart Roddy for his second try of the game. Try number seven came as a result of a long clearance kick from Luke Faulkner which was brilliantly chased down by Stewart Roddy. Putting pressure on Academy’s last line of defence Roddy managed to secure ball and fed inside to Stuart Morrow following up in support. Jody McMurray converted.The only other score was a late consolation effort by Academy when they again crossed in the corner.To top off an excellent day Limavady nds also won convincingly . with tries from Jason Kerr , JamieMillar , Aaron Reilly , John Purcell, Jack Elliott, and Harry McAleese. Harry converted nine of these ten tries.No fixtures for either side next week. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Sean Bell started the ball rolling for the Downpatrick side with a great opening point.

She insists that she intends to deliver the authentic voice of moderate, progressive Irish nationalism in a place where it needs to be heard.And she has vowed to be a hard working Peer, lobbying and building alliances with other peers and parties across the chamber that will bring benefit to people in Northern Ireland.And while the former MP regrets no longer being a member of the SDLP, she said her political views have not altered and will reflect the partyrsquos central social democratic messages focused on the needs of people and the principles of equality, fairness and social justice for all in the House of Lords.With her new title now confirmed, Baroness Ritchie described Downpatrick as a ldquohistoric place on the island of Ireland, where St Patrick began and ended his ministry.ldquoThe town is a place of immense heritage and has a longstanding history. It is uniquely associated on the island with the patron saint and is also associated with the Normans and the Vikings, she continued.ldquoDownpatrick is also place of inclusion and a shared society. The area was one of the first to share power at local government level and in the days of the old Urban Council, it had responsibility for allocating housing and did so very much on the basis of need.The Baroness said the Downpatrick area was very much at the vanguard of political inclusion in terms of ensuring that people belonged, explaining that she plans to use her new title to promote the town.Her House of Lords induction takes place on November  with her formal introduction taking place the following day when she will be introduced by her two sponsors on the floor of the chamber.Baroness Ritchiersquos sponsors will be former Northern Ireland Secretary of State, Lord Paul Murphy and Baroness Angela Smith, who is the shadow leader of the Lords.She is also former NIO minister who was responsible for the the health, economy and environment portfolios during her time at Stormont.Lord Murphy was also Minister of State and led the British Government in the talks process that led to the Good Friday Agreement.Baroness Ritchie continued: ldquoI have picked my two sponsors on the basis that while I am going into the House of Lords as non-aligned and independent, my two sponsors understand the mechanics of the Good Friday Agreement and understand inclusion and power-sharing.ldquoMy maiden speech will hopefully take place sometime before the end of the year, although that could be subject to changea general election is called.Looking to the future, the Baroness said she has been using the past few weeks to get briefed on key issues which are important to her, including Brexit and its impact on the agri-food economy and local economy.ldquoTo me, there is no such thing as a good Brexit. The best deal for me is one where we will remain in the EU. What we have been presented with is one that is a bita curatersquos egg in many ways. There will ne no hard border which means no economic border and no veto in terms of the Assembly. Having said that, I am going to have to examine the Brexit deal in greater depth, she continued.ldquoThere are other issues that I want to focus on including the contaminated bloods issue, tourism VAT and what can be done to help our economy and ensure that we can grow and develop. The vaginal mess issue is something I have been associated with as is the importance of the Co Down fishing industry.Baroness Ritchie said while she does not have constituents, she will be speaking in a general Northern Ireland-wide context.ldquoI will be highlighting the importance of reflecting our political ersity and respect for political dference, ensuring that our institutions are up and running and that they respect the relationships between Ireland and Britain and Northern Ireland and the South.

The three of them were regularly checking the weather in the last few weeks leading up to race day as the temperatures were well up in the high s.Far too hot to be running a marathon, but thankfully in the final week it took a dramaticdown to nine degrees. Flying over on Friday with no time to waste, it was straight to the hotel and then immediately to the Expo to pick up their race numbers and buy some of the many race souvenirs that were on sale.In the Expo there was a wall of fame for all the runners who had completed the six majors. Murlough ACrsquos very own Paula McKibbin and Ann McAlarneyrsquos names were spotted on the wall for all to see.There was no time to get over the six-hours jet lag as they were all up at five in the morning and headed downtown to the start of the km friendship run.This was a bit of fun and involved a quick lap of the city centre finishing in Grant park. The rest of the day was spent in true MAC style with a boat cruise along the Chicago river before dinner in an Italian restaurant.The evening got better as needing a taxi for six people to take them back to the hotel, they managed to acquire the use of a party limousine at a very good rate.Another early start on Sunday as the marathon began at .am in the neighbouring Grant Park. Thankfully, it was only a  minute walk from the hotel. Theyrsquod only just made it into the corrals and the race started.A field of , runners, heading off north through the city, with defending champion Mo Farah expected to retain his title.As the route wound through the city it passed through many dferent districts, all with a party atmosphere and lined with people cheering and screaming encouragement.The noise during a major marathon in the USA is beyond belief, the bands playing, spectators lsquohigh fivingrsquo and the streets lined with people three or four thick is an experience like no other. We passed through the Mexican Quarter with bands playing and guys dancing, wearing sombreros and then on to Chinatownrsquo with the streets lined with drummers.It was then onto the Gay Quarter with drag queens performing on stage. It was a celebration for both runners and spectators.As with all marathons, the last five miles were a real test of mental determination as fatigue kicked in and Carol, unfortunately, was suffering from a knee injury that she picked up during training which ed at mile .They all pushed on with Hugh crossing the line first and recording a new personal best by one and a half minutes. Orla was next home followed by Charisse who recorded a huge personal best of  minutes.Carol was next home and managed to finish in a respectable time as she battled through the final  miles with knee problems. As the runners walked down the street after finishing they were greeted by four lines of local school kids applauding and congratulating all the runners. After the kids there were long tables either side of the street where one of the local sponsors, which happened to be a brewery, handing out free beer. Then onto the next table where they were given food and water.It makes you wonder what is not to like about this marathon  In the ladiesrsquo race a new world record was set as Brigid Kosgei beat Paula Radclfersquos record of  years. Ironically, as Carol finished her race and walked down to collect her medal she was presented with it from no other than Paula herself.It was back to the hotel to get ready for dinner that evening. As Hugh and Charisse walked back they talked about getting a pint of milk each for recovery.As the shop was a ten-minute walk away, Charisse said that even though she knew it would be a bit more expensive she was happy to buy milk for them both in the hotel bar.Being content with the two half pints that the bar served it was only when the bill was produced that they both discovered that they must have drunk the most expensive two glasses of milk ever, with a bill of  dollars. Anything to save tired feet.That evening they continued in MAC style, celebrating with a meal on Cindyrsquos roof top restaurant followed by a few beers in Buddy Guyrsquos Blues bar where we were treated in style with a table in the VIP area. The le of a Murlough AC member is indeed a good one and already planning has begun for the next Major.Meanwhile, the week before, Kieran McShane made the long trek to Australia to complete in the Melbourne Marathon.The race began with an early am start along Batman Avenue in the glorious sunshine. This was Kieranrsquos first big run in over three months due to injuries, so took him a lot longer to finish, but he says it just meant he had more time to take in the lovely views of Melbourne.It was an amazing race from start to finish taking in all the iconic places around Melbourne such as St Paulrsquos Cathedral, Flinders Street, Botanic Gardens and the Shrine of Remembrance.Followed by a lap around the GP circuit then up and down St Kildarsquos beach along the promenade. The finish line was held inside the Melbourne Cricket Ground where the runners had to complete a lap inside the stadium in front of the roaring crowd as they crossed the line in an amazing atmosphere..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/23rd October 2019 Relive.jpg","title":"Relive the glory days as Down swept all before them to lift Sam Maguire  ","story":"THE countdown is on for a night of nostalgia with the Down  All-Ireland legends when they descend on Loughinisland GAC this Saturday where they will look back at their historic journey which is part of sporting folklore.However, the night will be tinged with sadness after the sudden passing of the former Down and Bryansford star Eamonn Burns, , who won two All-Ireland titles in  and rsquo and managed the county for a three-year spell which ended when he stepped down last year.During that tenure he led his Down team to the  Ulster SFC final with wins over neighbours Armagh and Monaghan.The highlight of Eamonnrsquos career, undoubtedly, was his two points which helped edge out Meath in , including a point which put the Mourne side into a lead they would not relinquish, finishing with a - to - victory.There will be a special tribute on the night to show Eamonnrsquos valuable contribution to Downrsquos glory years.The celebration is to mark the th anniversary of the sidersquos historic win over Dublin in Croke Park during a poignant year for those in the village and surrounding areas.A large contingent of the  Down squad will be in attendance, including captain DJ Kane, lsquoMayobridge Flyerrsquo Mickey Linden, James McCartan, Ross Carr, Downpatrick pair Conor Deegan and Barry Breen, Castlewellanrsquos Gregory McCartan and Ciaran McCabe, Bryansfordrsquos Brian Burns, Carryduff goalkeeper Neil Collins, and, of course, Loughinislandrsquos Gary Mason and Gerard Colgan, plus many more.Compere for the night will be TV and radio personality Frank Mitchell.

Letter to the editorAs Ben Lowry asserted in his column ‘Middle England chose Brexit over NI fully in UK,’ October , Boris Johnson’s loyalty is first and foremost to the Conservative party and its English electorate. It was always going to be the case and therein lies the harsh lesson for unionism to learn . It is imperative that unionists consolidate and ensure that maintaining the Union remains in our own hands. That is the battle line drawn for the next election when unionists bite the bullet andthe maximum number of MPs possible to hold firm for the unionist cause .We have been here before with shyster prime ministers and survived. This time we now know in advance where we all stand in terms of having our unionism undermined. What unionism requires are cool heads, sharp minds and positive leadership as never before . Solidarity tied into a unity of defence and purpose in upholding the integrity of the Union and reasserting our right to self determination is the number one unionist priority.David McNarry, Comber©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"people","story":" getRequiredClientIdforjpiconsole.log requiredClientIdcatch]EV.Core.updateUserProfile]EV.Core.updateUserProfile....... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast News Letter and agreeing to JPIMedia Ltd#s Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive any of the following newsletters from Belfast News Letter, via email Daily news, news features and service updates\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". ss+s+  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+]]]]]]]]]]]]]] initInArticleOnlySiteText, initArticleSiteText, isInArticleOnlyTemplateReady. s isArticleTemplateReady. s addCustomTextToSiteTemplate addSiteName.html  People   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business Subscribe#jp #login-widget #login-flip.flip RegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News People Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Politics Business Education Health Opinion Read This News Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Politics Business Education Health Opinion Read This Sport Football Rugby Union Motorcycling More Sport Sport Opinion Whats On Arts  Entertainment Things To Do Nightle Lestyle Retro Cars Homes Must Read           People      Carrickrsquos Gin Palace inSessions finalA cracking young band with a strong Carrickfergus influence are aiming to be Northern Ireland#s newest music sensation.

He made clear that his party will not stand aside for the DUP in any constituency.In an interview with the News Letter yesterday, Mr Aiken also set out a series of areas in which he will change the party, but stressed that he would not do away with the party’s conscience votes for members in areas such as abortion.The former commander of a Royal Navy nuclear submarine said that he wanted “to get the Ulster Unionist Party to a position where it can represent...solid British values”..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button He said that st century liberal Britain is “a very attractive place to be” and that is one of the reasons why so many people from the island of Ireland who go to Britain for university like it and stay.The Ballyclare man said: “That in many ways is quite absent in Northern Ireland at the moment amongst a particular grouping actually what we need to do in Northern Ireland is get that sense of Manchester, Liverpool, whatever it is, and use that to secure the Union”.However, he was scathing about the DUP, particularly in relation to its record at Stormont and the mess of the Brexit negotiations.Two years ago, the UUP insisted that it had not entered a formal pact with the DUP but made what it described as a “unilateral decision” not to stand in North Belfast and instead backed the DUP.\u2028The DUP indid not stand in Fermanagh and South Tyrone, backing the UUP.In the General Election before that, in , the party was open about the fact that it had struck a deal with the DUP not to challenge each other in certain seats.However, when askedthe UUP would stand aside for the DUP in some seats, Mr Aiken bluntly and emphatically told this newspaper: “No. We’re not standing aside. We’re going to fight all  constituencies.”Askedhe would regret his decision to run  candidatesit was to cost someone like Nigel Dodds his seat, Mr Aiken said: “Nigel Dodds and the DUP made it very clear, time and time again, that they don’t need Ulster Unionist support and we didn’t put a border down the Irish Sea Nigel Dodds needs to answer that question.”\u2028Mr Dodds, the DUP’s Westminster leader and one of its most capable figures, is its most electorally vulnerable MP.In , even with the UUP standing aside, Sinn Fein was just , votes behind the DUP deputy leader.The last time when the UUP stood in the constituency was two years ago when in the Assembly election Robert Foster, a low-profile candidate, polled , votes.Arlene Foster: Leo Varadkar set a precedent for loyalists with talk of violence Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"However, since then the UUP’s vote has fallen across Northern Ireland and Westminster elections traditionally invovle tactical voting for one of the candidates who is capable of winning, so the UUP’s vote would likely be much lower than that in the forthcoming election.\u2028The Sinn Fein candidate, John Finucane, is Belfast’s Lord Mayor and has signicantly raised his profile since last standing against Mr Dodds.Mr Aiken is still new to politics, having first been elected to any political post when he entered the Assembly as an MLA just three-and-a-half years ago. The South Antrim MLA’s decision not to pursue even a limited pact will not be welcomed by some UUP members and supporters but indicates that he is prepared to take risks in attempting to turn around what has appeared to be the unending decline of the UUP over the last two decades.The UUP supported Remain in the EU referendum – although its members were ided –but then adopted the stance that it accepted the will of voters to leave the EU and the result must be implemented.Mr Aiken, however, said that the way in which the UK chooses to leave must not involve any fresh checks in the Irish Sea or at the Irish border, which “in effect means something much closer to the Customs Union”.He said that at present Brexiteers in Northern Ireland faced a poor choice – either a deal which is not really Brexit for Northern Ireland, or keeping the UK together at the expense of their desire for the whole UK to leave the EU.Referring to the DUP’s recent U-turn to back a regulatory border in the Irish Sea, Mr Aiken said: “I cannot understand for the le of me – and I know we joke about ‘jot and tittle’ and Arlene and [DUP chief executive] Timmy Johnston not being all over the detail – but how did we ever get in a situation where the DUP, the supposed supporters of the Union, have been one of the biggest detractors from it and through the agreement to put a border down the Irish Sea have created a place apart  That is extraordinary.”Mr Aiken, who made clear that he was pragmatically in favour of the EU rather than being enthusiastic about Brussels, said that the UUP needed to provide an alternative because “at the momentyou are voting unionist...the only thing you’re in essence supporting is Brexit”Mr Aiken said that the UUP would either back a form of Brexit which did not damage the Union, or,that is not possible, then remaining in the EU in order to preserve the Union.try catch  TrendingLATEST | Police arrest second N.I. manin connection with  dead people discovered in lorry container in connection with  dead people discovered in lorry container\"Essex lorry deaths: PSNI search two NI addresses after  bodies foundNI braces itself for storm battering and theres a big chill on the way tooDavid McNarry: PM disgracefully humiliated Dodds.

This compares to five per cent of the population in , when  per cent of adults smoked.However, there has also been an increase in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape.:The National Survey for Wales shows that, in ,  per cent of e-cigarettes users also smoked cigarettes. This fell to  per cent in  .Across the UK the number of vapers who are ex-smokers reached . per cent in  with the main reason given for using e-cigarettes being to help them quit.Of those surveyed by ASH Wales,  per cent of e-cigarette users cited health as their main reason for vaping.Suzanne Cass, chief executive of ASH Wales said: ldquoThe rise in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape in Wales shows that many smokers are using e-cigarettes to quit.ldquoIndeed, when coupled with behavioural support e-cigarettes have been shown to be one of the most effective ways to give up smoking, enabling thousands of smokers in Wales to break a habit that destroys lives.ldquoHowever, with more than double the amount of people in Wales smoking compared to vaping, we still face a major challenge when it comes to changing peoplersquos behaviour and de-normalising what has become an entrenched habit in many of our most deprived communities.Despite the increase in the number of people vaping, the survey also revealed perceptions of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes have worsened.Now almost a third of people in Wales believe e-cigarettes are equally or more harmful than tobacco cigarettes.Suzanne Cass said: ldquoThere is work to be done when it comes to raising awareness of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes and addressing concerns about the safety of vaping.Since the survey was carried out, reports of a possible link between e-cigarette use and deaths from lung disease in America have led some medical experts to warn of the dangers of vaping.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention many of those vapers affected had used products with liquids containing cannabinoid products.E-cigarettes are regulated in the UK in line with a set of European-wide rules by the medicines regulator, the MHRA. The MHRA also monitors adverse reactions through its yellow card system, which to date has not identied serious respiratory problems similar to that found in the US.Meanwhile vapers in the UK are urged by ASH to only ever purchase e-cigarettes from reputable suppliers. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We were a mix of young people, parents and other concerned citizens of Penarth, and met outside Grfin Books.ldquoWe joined the young people who have been striking from school. In a year this movement has grown from Greta Thunberg by herself to millions worldwide.ldquoThe evidence on climate change is clear. Our actions through burning fossil fuels and demands for continued economic growth cause global warming and climate change. People are already suffering and nature, upon which we all depend, is collapsing. Governments need to be honest about this and act upon the crisis.ldquoWe were over the moon with the response from Penarth residents, who walked with us or cheered us on, the day really gave us hope that the message is seeping in and change can happen. Myself and others had been feeling quite down because climate change is scary, we are worried about our childrenrsquos futures. Lets hope this walk leads to more local action on climate change.The young people on the march also spoke about their concerns.ldquoI went on strike because people cut down rainforests just to be able to eat meat, said seven-year-old Mylo Kitchiner. ldquoIf we keep cutting down trees we wonrsquot have oxygen to breath. I want the government to stop people cutting down trees.

Any proposals would be subject to full consultation, meaning all interested parties would have an opportunity to share their views before any decision is made.ldquoShould proposals progress, they would also be subject to separate planning consultation.ldquoThis would include consideration of highways and traffic concerns. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We have had nine spaces taken away, which means  cars will be battling for spaces.ldquoWe understand the need to reduce cars and danger in the area but the way itrsquos been done will lead to reductions in house prices and make parking dficult for current residents.

A former head of two other schools in Gwent, he is clearly proud of his school and all they have accomplished.ldquoItrsquos a wonderful school and everyone here has worked so hard to make it that way, he said. ldquoBut it does face challenges.Like other head teachers in Penarth, Mr Rees had signed the open letter to the Welsh Government calling for fairer funding for Vale schools earlier this year. He had discussed coming in to the school on weekends to clean the toilets himself to help balance budgets. But he is firmly optimistic.ldquoBetween kind donations and fundraising efforts from our PTA, renting out the school hall, and younger members of staff taking on some extra burdens we are just about able to balance our budgets, he said. ldquoTo be honest, next year might start looking grim, but wersquore keeping our heads high.ldquoWith that said, wersquove been working hard on incorporating new initiatives and the new curriculum, we have a great crop of pupils and staff morale is high. We are very positive here.ldquoItrsquos also our th anniversary this year, so we have loads of ex-staff and pupils coming through the doors to say hello, a celebratory PTA barbecue and more planned.Taking a tour around the school, this positivity is reflected in students and staff alike. Children seem genuinely excited to learn, smiling, waving and saying hello to Mr Rees.Evenlode Primary School itself has an interesting history.It was opened in  as the first open plan primary school in South East Wales.The population of the school has risen dramatically over the last  years, from  on roll in  to the present .The building itself, a maze of classrooms and corridors plastered in colours, has also changed to accommodate more pupils.Much of the semi-open plan design has disappeared, making way for more conventional classrooms.The school benefits from having a superb site with two playgrounds as well as a large playing field, a designated play area for Reception children, a wildle area, open access to the local tennis club facilities, a newly constructed lsquooutside classroomrsquo and adventure trail.One of the first stops was a hall used by its lsquoSaplingsrsquo Out of School Care, the pre and after-school club for children.Saplings provides childcare for around  children from all year groups, providing breakfast in the morning and looking after children from .am to pm when needed.There, the children can access a wide range of activities, switched up on a regular basis.These have included cooking, gardening, art, crafts, sporting activities, outdoor play and plenty more.A couple of pupils, part of the Saplings, are called through. They happily talk about their favourite part of the clubs. One says arts and crafts another, going outside and playing sport four more say the food.Saplings isnrsquot the only place the students can indulge in a little food.Pupils have set up a fruit tuck shop in the school yard, a group endeavour that students control all aspects of - from placing orders for snacks, selecting the products, handling finances and, of course, selling to their friends.A small group of budding merchants were excited to show me their wares, selling oranges and bananas at break time.There was plenty more to do outside, as well.Mr Rees himself taught fire-making lessons in their fire pit, while the school also made use of rope courses, and a newly refurbished gazebo.Bike racks could be found at the front and back of the site, with students encouraged to cycle to school.Sport is very high on the schoolrsquos agenda.ldquoWe have kids from the school representing us in cricket, rugby and tennis at a county level, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore also fielding regular football, rugby and netball teams, and we are pushing plenty of other outdoor activities - like our new ropes and outdoor assault course.ldquoWersquore lucky to have parents in this area who are incredibly supportive of sports, and we have some shining examples of sporting prowess in our children.ldquoWe think itrsquos a very important part of being a rounded and healthy inidual.The school doesnrsquot just focus on sport - they aim to nurture minds and souls too.ldquoExpressive arts is a major area of focus at the moment, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore lucky enough to have a drama specialist supporting us, helping coach the children through both acting and production.ldquoWe are even working with the Welsh Government on a production of H.G. Wellrsquos The Time Machine, to be held in our school hall.The hall had been built with money raised from selling off surplus land, with a further loan from the Vale council.It is tidy, modern, and neatly decorated, with a sophisticated looking lighting system - built with help from parents.ldquoWersquore very proud of the relationship we have with parents here, said Mr Rees. ldquoThey have been enormously helpful with our budgetary concerns.Evenlode is a school with a cheerful outlook, a happy student body and a strong working relationship between staff, students and parent alike.It deserves to go far. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In the past he chaired the all-party Parliamentary group on nuisance calls and secured changes to the law to restrict cold telephone calling.ldquoThere have been a number of complaints about the increase in nuisance callers and the rise of the doorstep economy in the Vale of Glamorgan. Ahead of the clocks going back, Alun wants to provide constituents with a proven means of reducing the number of doorstep callers.Welsh Labour parliamentary candidate for the Vale, Belinda Loveluck-Edwards said: ldquoIt appears that Alun Cairns is using public money to try and block his political opponents from speaking to voters. This must be investigated.ldquoThis is a deliberate attempt to present a  equivalence between genuine political canvassing and those who would wish to scam vulnerable people.ldquoMany people will be deeply unsettled by this behaviour from Cairns at the same time as the Tories are attempting to suppress votes by making it a requirement to show ID at polling stations- a move that will disproportionately affect working class, ethnic minority and young voters.ldquoThis is not how politics should be done. In contrast, Welsh Labour is opening up politics by extending votes to  and  year olds in future Assembly elections.

However he is recognised as one of the greatest ever British rugby league players.Elizabeth lsquoBettyrsquo Campbell, also born in  in Butetown, was the first black head teacher in Wales.Following a public vote on hidden heroines Cardf Council confirmed earlier this year that a statue of Betty will be built in Cardf - the first woman to feature in our capital city.On the weekend I will be on a question and answer  about institutionalised racism in Wales, across sport, the media, politics, and the world of work.I look forward to sitting on the  with Cllr Saeed Ebrahim, lawyer Hilary Brown, and Chisomo Phiri from EYST.As more and more Black History Month events take place across Wales, I cannot help but feel a sense of pride in how far we have come as a nation.I hope that these events continue to inspire the next generation of young black leaders as we still have so much more to change.To all my constituents, to everyone across Wales, I hope you all join in with the celebrations and festivities of this historic month, attend the events, learn about those that have trailblazed for us and make this a Black History Month to remember. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It would require the removal of seven of the  ancient trees in the Conservation Area.Many of the trees had been assessed in September  as deserving of a Tree Protection Order, which would prevent them from being cut down, though the Vale council has said they are in the process of securing the protection orders.Residents say one ndash Ash Tree , crucial to development ndash has already been removed. John Lean, a resident of Kymin Terrace, said: ldquoAround a week ago, the first ash tree was sawn down. It was painted as a routine tidying up of their grounds, that it was sick, and was carried out not by the architects who made the main application, but by the warden. We do not believe there was anything wrong with that tree.ldquoAn application was made under Section  of the Planning Acts for the removal of Ash Tree , another tree not in the wood but next to the house, and the removal of a fallen tree. No notice was given to local residents the Vale council did not inspect the site before permission was given, and the first we knew of it was when we heard the chainsaws.Ash Tree  would have to be removed for any development to take place, to allow construction traffic to pass.David Burnett, a resident, said: ldquoThis creates a dangerous precedent for further development here.ldquoWhen the construction of Homeside House was permitted on appeal in , the inspector at the time made it clear that it should not impinge on the woodland. The woodland was described as lsquoinviolatersquo ndash itrsquos at least  years old. What was true then is true now. Other residents had further complaints about the proposed development, and the methodology used to carry out inspections.The large footprint of the dwelling occupies over half the site. The access road would also have to be able to take construction traffic, which residents fear would further damage the site and could limit parking.One resident described a bat survey as lsquocompletely inadequatersquo, as the resident said the survey carried out on behalf of the applicant noted observation was made on two occasions only.William and Karen Stonehouse said: ldquoThe development would involve the destruction of a valuable natural habitat without any benefit to the community whatsoever.ldquoPenarth is not short of expensive properties. It is affordable housing that is desperately needed to prevent the continuing drain of its young people who can no longer afford to buy any property here.ldquoThis proposal does nothing to address that.Joanna Masters said: ldquoI am very concerned about the proposed plan to fell the wood.ldquoI thought the world was becoming more environmentally aware, particularly regarding the value of trees, but it seems the Vale council is, in its own way, as irresponsible as Brazilrsquos Bolsonaro.A spokesman for the Vale council said: ldquoThis planning application has yet to be determined and will be considered in exactly the same way as any other, with the views of all interested parties taken into account.ldquoThat will involve reviewing all letters of representation and consultation responses on the matter. IldquoIt has been resubmitted after a previous one for a similar development was withdrawn as it failed to provide full details of the impact on nearby trees.ldquoWe are in the process of arranging Tree Preservation Orders for trees there that meet the criteria for that protection.ldquoThe council did approve an application to fell an ash tree from Homeside House as, after inspection by an officer, it was deemed to have a fungal bracket, which can structurally weaken trees to the point of breakage. That being the case, it was decided a TPO was not appropriate.The freehold for the woodland was purchased by Proxima GR Properties in  from McCarthy  Stone, who had built an unsheltered accommodation around the site.The Penarth Times has attempted to reach Proxima GR Properties for a comment. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals.

The Top  Northern Ireland Companies  dinner, with AL Goodbody, brought together some of top business chiefs making the list, to the grand backdrop of Queen’s University’s Great Hall. The event heard renewed calls for securing a deal on Brexit, and the restoration of Stormont, as we approach , days without a devolved government here. John Mulgrew, editor of Ulster Business, told those gathered: “On the precipice of Brexit, the voice of business has never been stronger or more important – further enforcing the need for a deal. Avoiding a hard exit. And retaining a strong trading relationship across the island. “But we should also take this opportunity to clearly note, that we are approaching , days since having a devolved government – up and running. “It affects you and your businesses, and it’s cited as the key reason putting off investment from overseas, and our own local companies, from making key investment decisions.” The Top  edition is an annual showcase of the leading and largest companies, located right across Northern Ireland. This year sales rose by almost %, approaching a combined figure of £bn. And for the eighth year in a row, poultry processing giant Moy Park has come in at the number one spot, with turnover of £.bn. Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said: “What the Top  companies have achieved in the past  months in what can only be described as capricious circumstances is truly remarkable – but imagine what could have been achieved had we some semblance of ‘normality’. “My hope is that we find ourselves doing so in a Northern Ireland that is embarking on a new and positive era of opportunity, rather than picking up the shattered pieces of a ‘no deal’ Brexit for many years to come.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"firms must prepare for no deal as economic forecast revised down","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland firms must prepare for a ‘no deal’ Brexit – a bank chief economist has warned – as it downgraded its forecast for the economy to .%.  Danske Bank’s Conor Lambe said there were still a number of possibilities for what might happen over the next  days, with the UK due to leave the EU on October . Possibilities included a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of Article  period or a general election. But predictions were \"incredibly dficult\", he said. \"Businesses should behave prudently and use this time to ensure they are as prepared as they can be for a worst-case scenario, no-deal Brexit, in case it occurs at the end of this month,\" he said. The .% is down from the bank’s previous forecasts, delivered in June, that growth would hit % in  and .% in . In its latest Northern Ireland Quarterly Sectoral Forecasts report, Danske Bank said that the Northern Ireland economy likely expanded in the second quarter of the year, but the rate of growth over the first half of the year remained modest. “We have revised our forecast for economic growth in Northern Ireland downwards for both  and ,” he said. “This largely reflects the modest data for the first half of the year, increased Brexit-related uncertainty and the weaker global economic environment. “Assuming that a no-deal Brexit is avoided, we expect the Northern Ireland economy to grow by .% in  and .% in , below the .% we expect UK GDP to grow by in both years. “A combination of strong wage growth and more stable inflation is likely to lead to solid growth in consumer spending, but the lack of clarity around the UK’s future relationship with the EU is expected to continue holding back business investment.” It says the information and communication, and professional, scientic  technical services sectors are expected to be the fastest growing parts of the economy over the next two years.

Ulster Business speaks to Northern Ireland managing director Ian Sheppard, and learns more about how colleagues are being empowered to play an active role in the local communities where they live and work Bank of Ireland UK sees developing its colleagues and helping customers and communities to thrive as part of its DNA, according to Ian Sheppard, managing director in Northern Ireland.From key charity partnerships, to fundraising, volunteering, sponsorship and more, Ian says the desire for Bank of Ireland UK is to make a positive impact by empowering colleagues to make a dference.“When I speak to my colleagues, I hear how really active and involved they are in their own community,” Ian says. “There are so many examples and I never cease to be amazed by their passion and commitment.An important partnership for the bank is with Alzheimer’s Society, its flagship charity for the last two years. In that time around £, has been raised in Northern Ireland, but as Ian explains it’s about more than fundraising.“We realised that not only can we help them financially, but there are resources we can share and opportunities we can offer which can help to signicantly raise the charity’s profile and raise much needed funds.”One example in which the bank has supported Alzheimer’s Society in this way is through its own long-running partnership with Ulster Rugby.“We donated our advertising and promotion activity for a televised game at the Kingspan Stadium making the charity ‘Sponsor for a Day’. This included using their logo on the back of the Ulster Rugby jerseys, taking over the pitch side boards and inviting a group of people living with dementia, their family and carers to the game – helping to get their brand message out to not only a stadium with capacity of , people but to a much wider TV audience.”Alzheimer’s Society sees some fantastic people giving their time to help others. That’s no clearer than its Side by Side programme, which Bank of Ireland UK helps to fund.The photograph on the front of this edition of the magazine taken at the Grand Opera House in Belfast features Mary Dalzell a Side by Side volunteer, alongside Hazel Whiteside, who has been living with dementia for two years.They share a love of music, theatre and cinema and the Side by Side programme, which re-connects people with dementia to their communities by doing the things they love, has not only put a smile on both their faces but has had a positive impact on their lives.There are so many people impacted by dementia and Alzheimers in our local communities, and its touching so many people’s lives, taking this as our motivation, the bank now has almost , staff trained as Dementia Friends.The bank’s ‘Give Together’ programme means staff can take one day a year to spend the time working with a charity or community organisation of their choice. “This day can involve anything from gardening work to painting a youth centre,” Ian says“Beyond Alzheimer’s Society, colleagues are helping many other organisations such as Macmillan Cancer Support, Cancer Research UK through its Relay for Le Legenderry, the Wooden Spoon children’s rugby charity, and Space NI, which offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community.” You canabout some of the good work colleagues have done further on in this feature.“We are also committed to reflecting the community by developing a erse and modern workforce – which is part-and-parcel of a progressive company,” Ian says. “It’s something that current and future employees expect in their employer. For us its part of our DNA, something that’s always been there but we are now putting a clear and visible structure around it,” Ian says.This has included being a founding member of FuSIoN – the Financial Services Inclusion Network which drives to support and promote LGBT+ professionals across the sector, becoming JAM Card members – allowing staff to knowcustomers with a communication barrier need ‘just a minute’, as well as recently being awarded the Diversity Charter Mark.“Our community involvement is something we are very clear about - something I’m passionate about and it’s an easy ask to get staff engaged. It’s very natural, and it has always been developed from the ground up,” Ian says.He believes this contributes to the huge numbers of staff doing their bit – enabling their own local communities to thrive.  ALISON MITCHELLA customer service manager for Bank of Ireland UK in Londonderry, Alison has worked for the bank for  years, but her motivation for fundraising and support for Alzheimer’s Society began in , following her mother-in-law’s diagnosis with dementia. Alison trained at her local hospital to become a dementia volunteer and learned so much she asked Alzheimer’s Society to run similar sessions in her own branch to enable staff to better assist customers with dementia.Sadly, Alison’s mother-in-law passed away in May of this year but to mark her passing and to raise vital funds in her memory, Alison took part in Alzheimer’s Society Cupcake Day. Initial plans to simply sell cupcakes within her own branch changed rapidly as colleagues from nearby branches heard of the event and wanted to support both Alison and the charity.  Faced with orders for more than  cupcakes, Alison requested a Give Together day, which is time given by the bank to both iniduals and teams to give back to their communities. Alison says: “I was in the kitchen from am to pm baking and icing but it was worth it. The event raised £, which Bank of Ireland UK matched doubling the amount raised to £,. “I could not have achieved that without the support of family, colleagues and the wider business. I was proud to raise the funds in my mother-in-law’s memory and I am proud to work for an organisation that not only values our role in the wider community but supports it too.” CHRISTINE GRAHAMChristine Graham has helped to raise funds for Cancer Research UK through the Relay for Le “Legenderry” event held in St. Columb’s Park, Londonderry.The Derry-based senior business manager for Bank of Ireland UK has personally been touched by cancer as she lost two close family members to the disease. Her young great niece was also diagnosed with a rare form of cancer in  and is now doing well, but seeing the impact a cancer diagnosis has on a family inspired Christine to get involved with the Relay for Le event.“Our event truly is ‘legenderry’,” she says. It is a -hour relay race that brings the whole community together to celebrate the lives of cancer survivors, to remember those lost to the disease, to fight back by increasing our knowledge of cancer and by raising money to fund le-saving cancer research.”In just three years the event has raised over £, for Cancer Research UK with Christine helping to raise £, in  – not only the most successful Relay for Le event in the UK this year but all funds raised in Northern Ireland stays here.  Christine values the support she has had from the bank who promote the event to the wider community and from her colleagues who enter teams.“Relay for Le is for all ages and stages, all shapes and sizes,” she says. It’s cross community and intergenerational and the atmosphere every year is electric.”Plans are already underway for Relay for Le  which promises to be another massive event. PAUL MAGEEPaul Magee, associate director of the corporate banking team, became involved with the Ulster Region Committee for Wooden Spoon, the Children’s Charity of Rugby, five years ago after he successfully completed the charity’s Four Peaks Challenge, reaching the summits of the UK and Ireland’s highest peaks. He is now an active committee member for Wooden Spoon, helping to raise funds to provide le-enhancing experiences for disadvantaged and disabled children. “All funds raised in Ulster stay in the region and benefit the children here,” Paul says. “For instance, we provided £, to the Mae Murray Foundation to buy specialist equipment for the first fully accessible beach in Ulster at Benone Strand. When we created the access to the beach, one parent was very emotional as he watched his teenage daughter in the sea for the first time. It’s those occasions where we’re responding to a need within the community that makes the effort worthwhile.”Wooden Spoon has funded numerous charity projects, most recently £, for a new multi-sensory room at Parkview Special School in Lisburn and purchasing a horse for Riding for the Disabled Association in Coleraine, a charity that enhances children’s lives every day.  With his passion for and involvement in Wooden Spoon, Paul is grateful for the support Bank of Ireland has given him in his role with the organisation, specically the corporate banking team who value his dedication to making a dference. He says: “The bank has been fantastic – I appreciate the flexibility the team offers in the lead up to events and my colleagues often attend Wooden Spoon fundraisers. I’ve also benefited from the bank’s Give Together initiative, which offers days of paid leave that employees can use for volunteering. The bank’s support has helped facilitate my commitment to Wooden Spoon, where I can really see and be a part of the impact the charity has on the local community.” SALLY IRVINEOver the last  years Sally Irvine’s coffee mornings have become a highlight in the office calendar, in turn raising more than £, for MacMillan Cancer Support and funding  days of specialist nursing care for cancer patients across Northern Ireland.Sally, a business lending and credit governance manager at Bank of Ireland UK, arranged her first Macmillan Coffee Morning in  following a colleague’s cancer diagnosis. She found herself wanting to do something to help people living with cancer and so took the plunge and decided to be a host as part of Macmillan’s biggest coffee morning fundraising event. From the outset, Sally had tremendous support from her team members and the wider business, and this has contributed to the ongoing success of the event.The bank plays a huge part in ensuring Sally can deliver the event each year by giving her support through their Give Together scheme.Sally says: “The coffee morning has become a very special occasion and a great day of fun where people from across the bank come together to have a wee cuppa and a cake and take time to catch up while raising money for a really important cause. One in two of us will face cancer at some time in our lives and I am passionate about continuing to fundraise to provide the specialist nursing care that’s so vital for those living with cancer.”Plans are already underway for this year’s Macmillan Coffee Morning and Sally is hopeful the annual fundraiser will continue to hold a special place in the office calendar. PAUL SLEVINBranch manager at Bank of Ireland UK in Newry, Paul Slevin is someone who embodies the bank’s ethos of community involvement through his role with the charity Space NI.  Space NI offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community. Through its service Home to Hospital, the organisation has helped  elderly people travel to crucial hospital appointments, while its Family Support Hub offers vital assistance to families in distress. Paul joined the charity in  and has just completed five years as chairman of the Board of Directors. He is proud that his background in finance has enabled him to support the charity through its repositioning process to ensure that its activities best serve the community.  Since Paul’s involvement with the charity began, Space NI has won the ‘One to Watch’ award at NI Social Enterprise Awards and the ‘Community Wellbeing Initiative’ at the All Ireland Pride of Place Awards. The organisation has also grown and opened a third premises in Newry and launched a range of volunteer made soy wax candles to raise crucial funds. “Bank of Ireland UK encourage all staff to give back,” Paul says. “Every manager I’ve had was very active in their community, so they were both great role models and great motivators. I think it’s really important to give our time, our expertise, and to do whatever we can to help and support the communities we live and work in.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/12312323.jpg","title":"novosco sold to global services giant for m","story":"Posted on Monday  October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland IT services firm Novosco has been bought by a German-based global industry giant for around £m, it has emerged.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: \"We’ve got a great new deal that takes back control — now Parliament should get Brexit done on Saturday so we can move on to other priorities like the cost of living, the NHS, violent crime and our environment.\" Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, said: “This agreement is a fair compromise between the EU and the UK. It is testament to the commitment and willingness of both sides to do what is best for EU and UK citizens. We now have a newly agreed Protocol that protects peace and stability on the island of Ireland and fully protects our Single Market. I hope that we can now bring this over the line and provide the certainty our citizens and businesses so deserve.” Michel Barnier, the European Commissions chief negotiator, said: “We had dficult discussions over the past days. We have managed to find solutions that fully respect the integrity of the Single Market. We created a new and legally operative solution to avoid a hard border, and protect peace and stability on the island of Ireland. It is a solution that works for the EU, for the UK and for people and businesses in Northern Ireland.” The DUP has said it could not support the deal brokered by Mr Johnson. So, what deal was agreed  A statement from the European Commission says: “In terms of regulations, Northern Ireland will remain aligned to a limited set of rules related to the EUs Single Market in order to avoid a hard border: legislation on goods, sanitary rules for veterinary controls , rules on agricultural production marketing, VAT and excise in respect of goods, and state aid rules. “In terms of customs, the EU-UK Single Customs Territory, as agreed in November , has been removed from the Protocol on Ireland   Northern Ireland, at the request of the current UK government. EU and UK negotiators have now found a new way to achieve the goal of avoiding a customs border on the island of Ireland, while at the same time ensuring Northern Ireland remains part of the UKs customs territory. This agreement fully protects the integrity of the EUs Single Market and Customs Union, and avoids any regulatory and customs checks at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. “Finally, the EU and the UK have agreed to create a new mechanism on ‘consent, which will give the Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly a decisive voice on the long-term application of relevant EU law in Northern Ireland.
