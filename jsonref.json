Among the scenes from the film that could now be frowned upon is a sequence when Aykroyd’s character ‘blacks up’ on a train and others featuring Curtis’s character Ophelia topless.But the decision to swap the genders of two of the film’s key roles for the stage show will be seen as controversial by many of the movie’s more devoted fans.One showbusiness source, who asked not to be named, said: ‘Everyone is sworn to secrecy about the project at the moment but the plan is to turn Eddie’s character into a woman and to have the character of the prostitute played by Jamie Lee Curtis become transgender. When the film was released in 1983, it was enormously successful yet now it is perceived in some quarters as racist and politically incorrect.

Labour is promising its own spending spree, and yesterday announced a new \u0027warm homes for all\u0027 pledge to install loft insulation, double glazing and \u0027green\u0027 technology in millions of homes       Matt Whittaker, deputy chief executive at the foundation, said: \u0027After an unprecedented decade of austerity, both main parties are gearing up to turn the spending taps back on.\u0027The shared commitments to ending austerity, reversing elements of it, and big infrastructure plans mean that Britain could be heading back to a 1970s-sized state, whoever wins the next election.\u0027The Tories\u0027 spending pledges include a 3.9 per cent rise in the state pension, an end to the four-year benefits freeze, with handouts rising by 1.7 per cent, a rise in the National Living Wage to £10.50 and an extra £155million for sixth forms and colleges.         It was reported yesterday that the Chancellor has privately expressed concern the manifesto will contain the most expensive set of policies in decades, slashing his room for manoeuvre to deliver tax cuts.The benefits and pensions rise alone will cost £5billion a year.Yesterday Rishi Sunak, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, denied claims by the BBC\u0027s Andrew Marr that the Tories were \u0027spending money like water\u0027.He said: \u0027I think what you\u0027ll see in our manifesto is it will be fully costed and in that you will see, as you would expect from a Conservative government, responsible economic management.\u0027In its analysis, the Resolution Foundation said that simply maintaining public service spending as a share of the economy could mean overall government spending rising to 41.3 per cent of GDP by 2023 under the Conservatives because of Mr Javid\u0027s plans for a big rise in infrastructure spending.Spending would be well above the average 37.4 per cent recorded in the two decades running up to the 2008 financial crisis, and only marginally below the 42 per cent average from 1966 to 1984.The think-tank said Labour\u0027s manifesto plans would see spending soar to 43.3 per cent of GDP.Spending in the 1970s was higher in part because more was spent on defence during the Cold War and because Britain was still paying off war debts.In addition governments used to react to recessions by boosting state spending – an idea which came to an end under Margaret Thatcher."},{"url":null,"title":"Tory election candidate says people appear Benefits Street DOWN","story":"Share this article Replying to a friend\u0027s comment, she added: \u0027My blood is boiling, these people need putting down.\u0027The Conservative Party did not appear to be moving to axe Ms O\u0027Brien from the race ahead of the December 12 General Election.In a statement, Ms O\u0027Brien said: \u0027These comments were made off the cuff, a number of years ago.\u0027However, I accept that my use of language was unacceptable and I would like to apologise for any upset I have caused.\u0027Labour\u0027s Tonia Antoniazzi won the seat in 2017 with 22,727 votes, 3,269 ahead of the Conservative candidate.Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner was critical of Ms O\u0027Brien\u0027s remarks.

Now based in Brooklyn, his images have appeared in publications such as Life, the New Yorker and the New York Times magazine.

It affects how you take pictures, how the camera is held, how you edit work, the immediacy of it. It’s a tool that has enabled me to think differently and, at times, make a picture I didn’t anticipate.”This photograph, of a goldfish won as a prize at the amusement park on Coney Island, captures a busy summer evening in 2016.

Because it offers escapism at a time of towering property pricesThe Drive curves quietly through the green of Maresfield Park, past mature trees, grass verges and tall, polite hedges that offer glimmers of the homes beyond: slate roofs, mullion windows, block-paving, gravel.Once part of a local manor house estate, the land here was requisitioned during the first world war and afterwards parcelled up and sold as separate plots. In the decades since, those plots have become architectural playgrounds of a sort, adventures in Georgian, Regency and Tudorbethan styles, updated and remodelled, with conservatories, annexes and bifold doors.It would be easy to miss Bella and Nick Honness Roe’s house. Set back from the road, it is a low-lying brick building with a carport. Built in 1963, it was designed by local architects for a sea captain who retired to this landlocked corner of East Sussex. Save for its gull-wing roof, it has few of the frills of its neighbours.The couple moved here in the autumn of 2015, shortly after the birth of their second child, leaving behind their two-bedroom flat with cantilevered stairs on the Golden Lane estate in London. “It was tiny,” says Bella. “Our living space was the size of what is now our playroom. And that was fine when we had one child. But then we were hankering after more space, and this place came up …”For Bella, a film academic, and her husband, a marketing specialist, the appeal was not so much the location, near Gatwick airport and the M25, but the excitement of the house itself. She walks me through the building, from the kitchen along the light-filled corridor that leads to the bedrooms. “It’s all the original stuff,” she says. “The design of that period was very liveable – built-in furniture and wood-panelling, built-in Formica.” They found the property via the Modern House, an estate agency that launched in 2005 and swiftly acquired a cult online following through its website, mailing list and, later, Instagram. It specialises in design-led, architecturally intriguing properties from former factories to art deco gems, modernist estates, urban spaces, loft conversions, new-builds and even partnerships with Turner prize-winning architects Assemble.The peculiar thing about the Modern House is that it has become such a colossal hit with those who could never hope to afford even the cheapest of its listings. For many, it serves not so much as an estate agency but as something we can pleasurably gawp at, in much the same way as Holly Golightly in the film Breakfast at Tiffany’s, penniless but dreaming, was wont to stare at the window displays of the luxury jewellery store and feel that “nothing very bad could happen” there.“I derive a lot of pleasure from looking at beautifully curated spaces,” says a fan of the website, Wilhemina Madeley, 30. “Although I don’t own a house myself and that continues to be a distant dream (especially in London), I often feel inspired by how spaces are transformed through colour, art and carefully selected items of furniture. More often than not, I look at the properties between £350,000 and £500,000 because I like to see what I could potentially afford in the future and how people have transformed small and challenging spaces.”The Modern House, with its homes’ ordered beauty and outlandish prices, serves as a form of escapism. How sweet life would be, we think to ourselves, if we could spend our days in such open-plan, light-filled harmony.Bella had long been on the Modern House mailing list. “I’ve always been slightly obsessed with modernist architecture,” she explains. When she first spotted the listing, it was at an emotionally charged time – shortly after the death of her mother, when Bella was four months pregnant.“We weren’t even seriously looking, and I just said: ‘Let’s just go look at this house this weekend.’ It was the sort of house I’d always loved it was geographically just about doable it was just about workable for work it wasn’t too far from London it was near a town that looked nice …” That was in April. In July, they put in an offer. “It took us a really long time to get over taking that leap,” she says. “And in the end we just realised we would never know if it was right for us unless we just did it.”There are other property sites with devoted followings – Cheap Old Houses, for instance, the Instagram celebration of largely US doer-uppers sites dedicated to French chateaus and Tuscan farmhouses, all of which offer a ersion from the drudgery of our daily existence. But what marks out the Modern House is the enduring appeal of its aesthetic and the remarkable affection in which it is held. While other estate agents are often regarded with suspicion, the Modern House is thought of by some of its fans as a friend.The Modern House London offices occupy the ground floor of St Alphege hall, a 1930s church hall in Borough, south London. Here, Matt Gibberd and his business partner, Albert Hill, employ 25 office-based staff they have more across the country. Both 41, they met at school in Dorset, where Gibberd recalls that Hill “was very much always an entrepreneurial spirit. Even in those days he was always up to something. He decided he wanted to collect obscure training shoes, so he would buy these boxfresh Nikes and store them in his cupboard.” Hill would sell the trainers to collectors in Japan. “And then his dad had a garage studio where you couldn’t get through the door because it had all of Albert’s Memphis Group furniture in it.”A few years later, when they were both journalists writing about architecture and design, Hill had what he describes as a “lightbulb moment” – realising he could apply the same approach he had taken to selling collectable trainers and furniture to selling collectable houses. “And I didn’t need to put them in my dad’s garage.” Hill’s grandfather was an interior designer, and for a time his father worked finding land for a housing association. When he was nine, the family moved somewhat abruptly from south London to Lyme Regis, to an arts and crafts house on the seafront – his parents having once told its owners to let them know if they ever felt compelled to sell. “They said that would be the only reason that they would ever leave London,” he says. “And they got the call one day. So we had to pack up our London home, our London life and all go down to Dorset.” He smiles. “That’s one of the things that informed the business – the idea that, for one house, you would change everything.”Gibberd, whose father and grandfather were both architects, had also inherited the family interest in buildings. “It sounds a bit pathetic now but aged 13 I would’ve asked my parents for a book on architecture and minimalism for Christmas,” he says. “We lived in quite a few different places, buying and selling around Islington,” he recalls. “And that’s where I also learned about the commercial side of housing. Which is a bit of a taboo subject, but is a reality and the reason why we’re able to do what we do. We always say we’re really lucky because we get to indulge in our passion, which is architecture and design, but we’ve also found a way of monetising it.”The first property they marketed was Six Pillars in Dulwich, south London. “Which is a Tecton house,” Hill says. “Grade II*.” Although it was already on the market with another agency, Hill and Gibberd called the owner and told him about their fledgling company. “He said: ‘Great, let’s do it!’” Hill recalls. “He said the other agency didn’t understand the house.”The house still took a while to sell, and not just because of the £1.3m price tag. “The thing about the pure modern movement houses, especially the early ones, is they’re museum pieces,” Hill says. “It’s always going to take quite an enlightened buyer who’s going to live in it in that slightly reverential way.“Back then, investing all of your life savings in a house that was design-led, that was such an oddity in the market, you had to have pretty strong nerves,” he adds. “That’s changed considerably. It’s partly this shift to people being interested in experiences over objects. The space in your home is where you experience most of your life. Back then, a house was more seen as a bank account or just bricks and mortar.”There has also been a shift in our approach to location. When the Modern House launched, it broke with the conventional estate agent model of serving only one geographical area. “Instead, we celebrate the house and try and attract people from beyond that area,” says Gibberd. The bulk of the Modern House’s properties are in southern England, although there is a regional spread. At any one time, its roster might range from a £95,000 chapel in Suffolk to a £10m architect-designed house in Hampstead, north London.“The lower end of the market always sells so well,” says Hill. “One of the founding principles was: it’s not about price, it really is about design, and we’ve always tried to keep as broad a price spectrum as we can.” “It’s extraordinary, the rise of interest in these homes,” says John Grindrod, author of Concretopia: A Journey Around the Rebuilding of Postwar Britain. “I think Grand Designs has had a bit to do with it, and I think it’s partly a reaction against developers’ houses of the 80s and 90s – heritage design, fake Tudor, with small rooms and small windows. Instead, these houses are open, with entire glazed walls.”It’s part of an ongoing see-saw of architectural taste, Grindrod argues, from the Tudorbethan styles of the 30s to the Scandi-modern design of the 50s, and then back to mock Tudor in the 80s. “And that see-saw, it’s kind of an argument about how we want to live. Whether it’s the shy, retiring, heritage way that’s slightly more anonymous, or these forward-looking, open, statement modern houses you can see into, which are the opposite of curtain-twitching British life. They are almost stage sets for people’s lives.”The Modern House has been “more insulated than most” to the uncertainty of Brexit, says Hill. Still, the precarious market is one factor that has led the Modern House to consider entering the rental market – offering a stepping stone, perhaps, to the design-conscious people who regularly dip into their listings, but could only dream of owning. It would also open up a new market for the company, whose greatest problem might be that, while the average length of home ownership in the UK is seven years, the Modern House rarely sees re-sales. The kind of property it features has evolved as well. “Aesthetically, there’s certainly been a shift away from lightweight structure to more heavy brick, more grounded architecture,” says Gibberd. Hill agrees: “The timber and render look has been replaced by a heavier solidity, references to classicism.” A desire for sturdiness perhaps, in a time of political and economic flux.The Modern House has moved on, too, from the aesthetic that made its name. “It went very modern movement for a while, but as soon as it feels like something has become embedded in the consciousness, that’s the time to change it,” Gibberd says. “So we thought: ‘We need to look further back now.’”Still, its mailing list remains a source of fascination, inspiration and fantasy for many. “There are lots of interiors magazines and blogs, but for people who look at our website, it’s got that extra level of it being real,” Gibberd says.

Smriti Prasadam-Halls and Robert Starling’s The Little Island sees a gaggle of geese hatch a plan to leave their farm, only for their solitary life on an island to go wrong. And in Richard David Lawman and Katie Williams’ I Want to Leave This Book, a cast of animals vote – unsuccessfully – on which sort of story they’d like to be part of.Prasadam-Halls’ modern-day fable, described by Gruffalo illustrator Axel Scheffler as “an Animal Farm for our times”, has already sold out of its first print run. A paperback edition is now being brought forward to meet demand.“In The Little Island, I’ve tried to translate the complexity of recent events into a story simple and satisfying enough for the youngest – and oldest – child to grasp and to present a conversation starter, a launchpad, to some of the more serious issues of our time,” says Prasadam-Halls, whose book opens with a quote from one  John Duck: “No goose is an island entire of itself every goose is a piece of the continent, a part of the main.”Before writing the book, she had been deeply troubled by the changes she was seeing in British society.“We’ve started to hear words being used again that we have long considered to be totally unacceptable. It has been so troubling to hear aggressive slogans and toxic language used in the highest of offices. Language has such power and when words are used as weapons they cause great damage,” she says. “So I have tried to speak a story of solidarity and friendship into that landscape.”Her setting felt “absolutely natural” for a dissection of the ide between leave and remain. “Farmyard animals lend friendliness and charm and bring unexpected humour and warmth to what might otherwise feel a heavy topic – especially as we see ourselves parodied in the story,” she says. “They also help us to feel a degree of empathy for all the characters – whichever side of the bridge they are … Animals help us get closer to the heart of the issues and feel a shared humanity.”Animals also dominate Lawman’s picture book, published by Manchester-based WatAdventure, although in more specific roles: Theresa May appears as a hamster, Boris Johnson is depicted as a highland cow and David Cameron is a pig named Percy Hogtrotter. It sees the animals debating whether they are better off staying in the book, or leaving for a better experience in another. When a majority votes to leave, they can’t agree on what genre they want to be in.Lawman says he came up with the book when he realised he couldn’t explain Brexit to his curious four-year-old daughter: “I Want to Leave This Book is the answer to my dilemma – and clearly one that parents across the UK are facing.”Both Prasadam-Halls and Lawman are clear that the books had to work on their own, as well as acting as Brexit explainers. “The other reason for using animals, of course, is for the purposes of allegory. Parents and teachers have the choice of whether they want to go deeper with the story – or not. It stands as a story in its own right,” says Prasadam-Halls.“We need to make these complex political issues as digestible as possible to ensure that younger generations truly engage and understand the wider moral backdrop of these events,” says Lawman. “But first and foremost, we wanted this book to be fun to read, even without the Brexit context.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9cec884a35c7a6e6fc1a34130126a8e70213e8e7/0_191_3979_2387/master/3979.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7da9dc9d1cda71ba5d1f77005dde3c19","title":"call for ban on uk private jets by 2025 as flight traffic soars","story":"Carbon emissions from sector shown to be equivalent to 450,000 cars each year – reportLabour is exploring plans to ban private jets from UK airports from as early as 2025 should it win the election, in the party’s latest broadside against the super-rich.After a report revealed carbon emissions from the sector equivalent to 450,000 cars each year, Andy McDonald, the shadow transport secretary, said that billionaire users of private fossil fuel aircraft were damaging the climate and the party would consider a ban.He tweeted on Monday: “The multi-millionaires \u0026amp billionaires who travel by private jet are doing profound damage to the climate, and it’s the rest of us who’ll suffer the consequences. A phase-out date for the use of fossil fuel private jets is a sensible proposal.”The warning shot came in response to a report from Common Wealth, a thinktank with close links to Jeremy Corbyn, and A Free Ride, a campaign group that called for a ban in Britain from 2025 to encourage the development of electric aircraft.McDonald said he would “examine these proposals closely and consult with industry on the introduction of a phase-out date for the use of fossil fuel private jets”.It said the global heating impact of the flights was roughly 1m tonnes of CO2 equivalent each year, the same as the annual emissions of about 450,000 typical cars on Britain’s roads. A private flight from London to New York was equivalent to driving a typical UK car non-stop for four and a half years, it said.According to the assessment, a typical private jet passenger journey within Europe emits seven times as much greenhouse gas as a flight in business class on a typical airliner, 10 times as much as flying economy class and about 150 times as much as an equivalent journey using high-speed rail.Almost half of all private jet traffic in Britain passes through five airports around London, given its status as the home to the most billionaires in Europe and one of the world’s biggest financial centres. Luton airport, roughly an hour north of the capital is the busiest, with almost 15,000 private aircraft departures in 2017, followed by Farnborough, Biggin Hill, Stansted and Northolt.Some of Britain’s richest people use private jets. Prince Harry has faced criticism for doing so for short-hop breaks while campaigning against global heating. Sir Jim Ratcliffe, the chief executive of the petrochemicals company Ineos, who is Britain’s third richest man with an £18bn fortune, has four private jets and a helicopter. Sir James Dyson, the electrical products entrepreneur and fifth richest man in Britain, owns a £55m private jet.The Common Wealth report, compiled by Leo Murray of Free Ride and Jamie Beevor of Green Gumption, an environmental consultancy, suggested most carbon-emitting private flights to and from UK airports could be handled by new electric aircraft in future.The study found that as many as four out of five private jet journeys within Europe today cover distances that could be completed by small electric aircraft currently in commercial development that would enter the market in the mid 2020s.The European Business Aviation Association, the main body representing the private jet sector, said a ban would do little to curb global heating and that a unilateral ban in Britain made little sense in an international market."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/611c54175f9d6d48c1fd20fcefd23a2dfab497ae/0_323_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f8be484e56cac24c9f04c86aef90783","title":"under the wrecking ball london families placed in housing slated for demolition","story":"Local authorities in London have moved families into council estates that are planned for demolition – and campaigners say it is affecting their mental and physical healthMorrison is one of 189 temporary accommodation residents who have been moved on to Love Lane during the last three years while Haringey council hammers out the details of the scheme with the developer, Lendlease. They have been placed there as a stop-gap as the council struggles to house the 10,000 people on its social homes waiting list, yet as temporary accommodation residents, none of them are guaranteed a home in the new scheme.“You see the brand new stadium on one side, you see the brand new station on the other, and we’re in the middle,” Morrison says. “We don’t fit in and we know they’re going to get rid of us. We’re on edge every minute.”Across London, local authorities have moved hundreds of homeless families on to council estates that are planned for demolition, where they live in limbo in deteriorating conditions. Many report that living in such uncertainty has had an impact on their mental health, citing issues such as sleep deprivation and anxiety, as well as physical health complaints connected to the poor maintenance of such estates, says Peter Elliott, a Green councillor in the Gipsy Hill ward of Lambeth. Green councillors are calling for an immediate halt to such regeneration schemes to give residents certainty, regardless of their status.“There is this gross inequality for people in temporary accommodation,” says Elliott, who lives on the Central Hill estate that has been slated for demolition since 2014. “Years from telling people their estates are getting demolished, the housing has been falling into disrepair, there are faulty electrics and lighting, walkways are treacherous and sewers are backing up. If it was anyone else those responsible would be branded rogue landlords. These are vulnerable people and councils are abusing them.”Lambeth council has 2,376 homeless households in temporary accommodation, including 156 on what it calls “regeneration estates”. Among them are Danielle Montrose-Francis and her 10-year-old son, who were moved on to the Central Hill estate in March. By this point they had been homeless for four years after the landlord of their privately rented home evicted them under section 21, which allows a landlord to evict a tenant without giving a reason. The family were unable to afford private rented accommodation in the area and became homeless, sleeping on other people’s sofas and in B\u0026ampBs.Since they moved to the Central Hill estate, they have faced a severe mouse infestation, antisocial behaviour from neighbours and holes in the door and the walls. The cramped conditions and rodents mean that Montrose-Francis has been sharing her bed with her son, who was so stressed at one point that his hair was falling out.“Since we were evicted it’s been like a nightmare that we haven’t woken up from yet,” says Montrose-Francis, who is working part time in a church while she starts her own chemical-free cleaning business. “It’s a kind of discrimination. One group gets help with housing and their needs are acknowledged, but when you are in temporary accommodation it feels like you are punished for being poor.”Lambeth council says any disrepair on these estates is not related to their use as temporary accommodation. A spokesperson said: “These properties provide low-cost local housing for homeless households who might otherwise have to be accommodated in more expensive accommodation further away. They are entitled to the same services as secure council tenants on the estates regarding issues such as repairs and complaints of antisocial behaviour.”The Green party is calling for the repair and refurbishment of council estates rather than the sale of land to private developers to build private housing. When a building is demolished, energy is used to deconstruct it and remove, process and dispose of the waste. Building a replacement requires a further commitment of energy and materials.“Councils should be maintaining the existing estates as council flats, which reduces the pressure on the housing list,” says Siân Berry, co-leader of the Green party. She wants demands for regeneration on these estates to be permanently halted. “Residents are being moved out to private rented homes or other council flats and temporary residents are being moved in, sometimes for up to a decade, so the whole system just keeps getting worse.”Morrison co-chairs a tenants’ group called Temporary Accommodation Group, which is campaigning for the 189 families in temporary accommodation on Love Lane to be given permanent social homes at social rent in Haringey. “I’m not against regeneration, but people shouldn’t be put on a demolition site on purpose,” she says.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f36b8341cc0c484197eb663efd7f474e16970e17/157_0_2843_1706/master/2843.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6b3b4eed4e5d4fc0c6e356da6c8c2010","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of silence","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘silence’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘silence’.Share your photos of what silence means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 6 November at 10am.

His meaning was clear: in a familiar, wilful and tiresome confusion of race and place, he was disoriented by the multiracial and multicultural nature of Britain’s capital.For his own peace of mind and ossified sense of nostalgia, Cleese should steer clear of Tate Britain for a while. Because next week, the artist and film-maker Steve McQueen’s Year 3 will open there – a display of school photographs from almost two-thirds of London’s primaries. There they stand: more than 3,000 photographs, showing about 76,000 children. The project’s photographers have captured the full range of the capital’s seven- and eight-year-old citizenry: from state, private, religious and special education schools, uniformed, non-uniformed, daffy grins, big ears, long braids, scuffed shoes, ironed headscarves and wild afros.In a sense, that is precisely the effect McQueen, 50, wants the exhibition to have, even if he takes visitors on a different journey from Cleese’s. “It’s a telescope and microscope situation,” he says. “You’re looking through a telescope and seeing all these people, but it’s also reflecting back on you, making you think: ‘Who am I in all of this?’ It’s exciting and dynamic. I hope the people and the powers that be are aware of that potential and reap from it. I find it very inspiring. The future is in those pictures. There’s going to be the criminal, the banker and the person who may not make it to 21. They are all there.”Getting them there was no small feat. “We spent a year and a half trying to work out how to do it,” says Clarrie Wallis, the exhibition’s curator. “Very early on it became clear that you couldn’t just do a callout to all the schools in London. There were issues like safeguarding that came into play. We had to make sure we had in place something that was robust and appropriate.”They needed the consent of every child’s parent or . Some schools had the will but not the wherewithal. As fantastic an opportunity as it was, this was one more demand on a system that was understaffed and overstretched. “Some schools felt they didn’t have the time or the capacity,” says Wallis. “A lot of them are under-resourced anyway and the arts programmes get squeezed.”So the Tate had to work out an “offer”, providing arts-based workshops with the help of A New Direction, an organisation that specialises in creative work within schools. Facilitators and photographers went into schools to do various exercises with children that related to the broader project.Every year 3 class that took part has been invited to come and see its photograph in the exhibition. Again, this is no small undertaking, involving everything from employing greeters to usher the children around, including a small tour of the Tate, to portable buildings in the car park where they can eat their lunch. “It’s an opportunity for us to champion why creativity matters,” says Wallis. “The hope is that they come, they’ll fall in love with us and want to come back again.” When the exhibition is over the schools will be given the framed photographs.There is something about the simplicity of the concept that makes the exhibition mesmerising. Row upon row of classic school photographs, all taken with the same format. The teacher in the centre, set back slightly into the class – embedded into their brood – with the teaching assistants towards the back and to the side. Where the class is larger, the front row sits on the floor cross-legged, the second row is on chairs and all the rest are standing up. “We had the photographers all stand a certain distance away, to allow for the variation in the size of classes,” explains Wallis, pointing out that while some classes could go up to 34 children, others, particularly in schools for children with special educational needs, might number eight or nine. However big or small the class, all the children are shown at roughly the same size. All were shot with natural light.The effect of this rigorous consistency in form is to draw out the difference in content. The pictures were taken wherever the school chose to accommodate them – in gyms and classrooms, under basketball nets, with backdrops of climbing bars, the Virgin Mary, blackboards and artwork. There was little retouching – chipped walls remained chipped.“I love that fact that there’s a similarity,” says McQueen. “Everyone is regimented in the same way. There’s conformity. But there’s inidualism, too. Each one is an inidual. They’re trying to make you conform. But, at the same time, there’s still that spark there, that iniduality, that questioning.”This tension, between the energy of the child at this stage of their development and the demands of the system, at this point in the process, McQueen finds particularly intriguing.“It’s this moment, when things have almost become regimented, just before they have to conform. It’s not that you lose them,” he says. “But it’s a whirlwind and they have to stand up in it. And the ones that can’t stand up often get chopped down and disregarded. And at the same time those that can also try to sustain a bit of themselves within that system. So you see the potential and possibility in these kids’ lives.”The initial idea, he says, came from his own experience of primary school, which he remembers as a time of wonder, boundless energy and fearless freedom. “It was incredible. The friends I had, and the potential, the possibilities. Playing, drawing, the kinship of friends, experimenting, getting wet in the rain. I had the chance to daydream. But then you think of what could have happened and where people I knew had gone to.”The whole thing makes for quite the rabbit hole. You start by looking at a picture, your eye drawn to the biggest smile, the tallest kid, the goofiest look or the teacher at the centre, who collectively offer a less erse demographic than the children (they are mostly women), but are varied nonetheless. You scan that class, then another, then another, thinking of how unlike your own school they are, or how similar, and before long you are reaching back to yourself at that age. To how big things were and how small your world was. Trying to remember who your teacher was, or your best friend, or your arch-enemy. Recalling the more troubled kids and wondering what happened to them. What happened to any of them. Some might be grandparents by now some could be millionaires.I have scant memories of class photo days, but I remember the sequence of events that made them unique to me and my family. The teachers would give us a letter to take home saying the photographer would be in on a certain day. I would lose it or forget it. I would generally be scruffy (that was and still is ‘“my look”), my hair a mass of tangles and knots.When the photos came back, I was always easily identifiable. I am the same age as McQueen but grew up in Stevenage in Hertfordshire and was generally the only black kid in the class. I would take the picture home and this would be the first my mum would know that a picture had been taken. She would hit the roof, pointing out how my dishevelment shamed her, sigh, and then say, “I like this one” and remark on my dimples or say I had my father’s smile. She would buy a ridiculous number to “send home” to Barbados and they would take their place along with the dresses, fabric, trousers and linen she hoarded for the same purpose and that never made the journey.For McQueen, who has two children, it is also a love letter to the city where he was born and raised. He has spent much of the last two decades in Amsterdam, but loves London. “I need this city because it’s given me so much,” he says. “It’s given me my belief system. It’s given me my viewpoint on life.”It hasn’t always loved him back. As McQueen progressed through the secondary system during the early 80s, he felt the walls closing, seeking to bury that sense of possibility under the dead weight of institutional racism. Simultaneously laughing and shaking his head, he mentions Tam Joseph’s painting UK School Report, which consists of three portraits side by side. The first, of a black youth in school blazer and tie, with a neat afro, is captioned: “Good at Sports” the second youth is funkier, slightly older with twists and an earring, and reads: “Likes music.” The last has long locks and an open shirt above the words: “Needs surveillance.” “By the time I got into high school things had definitely changed,” says McQueen.This is partly why he chose year 3. It is at seven or eight, he says, that children start to shed their solipsism and navigate the structures that shape their world. “It’s a limbo. It’s the first time these things are being introduced to them like race, class and gender. How do they grapple with that?

Photographs by David J Phillip and David GoldmanAPEverton Simpson squints at the Caribbean from his motorboat, scanning the dazzling bands of colour for hints of what lies beneath. Emerald green indicates sandy bottoms. Sapphire blue lies above seagrass meadows. And deep indigo marks coral reefs. That is where he is heading. He steers the boat to an unmarked spot he knows as the “coral nursery”. Simpson started working as a “coral gardener” two years ago as part of grassroots efforts to bring Jamaica’s coral reefs back from the brink.On the ocean floor, small coral fragments dangle from suspended ropes. Simpson and other ers tend to this underwater nursery as gardeners look after a flower bed, painstakingly plucking off snails and fireworms that feast on immature coral. When each stub grows to about the size of a human hand, Simpson collects them in his crate to inidually transplant on to a reef. Even fast-growing coral species add just a few inches a year.A few hours later, at a site called Dickie’s Reef, Simpson es again and uses bits of fishing line to tie clusters of staghorn coral on to rocky outcroppings, a temporary binding until the coral’s limestone skeleton grows and fixes itself on to the rock. The goal is to jumpstart the natural growth of a coral reef. And, so far, it is working.With fish and coral, it is a co-dependent relationship. The fish rely on the reef structure to evade danger and lay eggs, and also eat up the coral’s rivals. When too many fish disappear, the coral suffers, and vice versa.The delicate labour of the coral gardener is only one part of restoring a reef and for all its intricacy it is actually the most straightforward part. Convincing lifelong fishermen to curtail when and where they fish and controlling the surging waste dumped into the ocean are trickier endeavours.Slowly, the comeback effort is gaining momentum. “The coral are coming back, the fish are coming back,” says Stuart Sandin, a marine biologist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, California. “It’s probably some of the most vibrant coral reefs we’ve seen in Jamaica since the 1970s. When you give nature a chance, she can repair herself. It’s not too late.”Sandin is studying the health of coral reefs around the world as part of a research project called the 100 Island Challenge. His starting assumption was that the most populated islands would have the most degraded habitats, but what he found instead was that humans can be either a blessing or a curse, depending on how they manage resources.In Jamaica, more than a dozen grassroots-run coral nurseries and fish sanctuaries have sprung up in the past decade, supported by small grants from foundations, local businesses such as hotels and scuba clinics, and the Jamaican government.At White River, which is only about two years old and where Simpson works, the clearest proof of early success is the return of tropical fish that inhabit the reefs, as well as hungry pelicans, skimming the surface of the water to feed on them.Jamaica’s coral reefs were once among the world’s most celebrated, with their golden branching structures and resident brightly coloured fish drawing the attention of travellers from Christopher Columbus to Ian Fleming, who wrote most of his James Bond novels on the island’s northern coast in the 1950s and 1960s.In 1965, the country became the site of the first global research hub for coral reefs, the Discovery Bay Marine Lab, now associated with the University of the West Indies. The groundbreaking marine biologist couple Thomas and Nora Goreau completed fundamental research here, including describing the symbiotic relationship between coral and algae and pioneering the use of scuba equipment for marine studies. The same lab also provided a vantage point as the coral disappeared.Peter Gayle has been a marine biologist at Discovery Bay since 1985. From the yard outside his office, he points towards the reef crest about 300 metres (985ft) away, a thin brown line splashed with white waves. “Before 1980, Jamaica had healthy coral,” he says. Then several disasters struck.The first calamity was 1980’s Hurricane Allen, one of the most powerful cyclones in recorded history. “Its 40ft waves crashed against the shore and basically chewed up the reef,” Gayle says. Coral can grow back after natural disasters but only when given a chance to recover, which it never got.“There was a tipping point in the 1980s, when it switched from being a coral-dominated system to being an algae-dominated system,” Gayle says. “Scientists call it a ‘phase shift’.”That seemed like the end of the story until an unlikely alliance started to tip the ecosystem back in the other direction, with help from residents such as Simpson and his fellow fisherman Lipton Bailey.The fishing community of White River revolves around a small boat-docking area about a quarter of a mile from where the river flows into the Caribbean Sea. One early morning, as purple dawn light filters into the sky, Simpson and Bailey step on to a 28ft motorboat called the Interceptor.Both men have lived and fished their whole lives in the community. Recently, they have come to believe that they need to protect the coral reefs that attract tropical fish, while setting limits on fishing to ensure the sea is not emptied too quickly.In the White River area, the solution was to create a protected area, a “fish sanctuary”, for immature fish to grow and reach reproductive age before they are caught.Two years ago, the fishermen joined with local businesses, including hotel owners, to form a marine association and negotiate the boundaries for a no-fishing zone stretching two miles along the coast. A simple line in the water is hardly a deterrent however, to make the boundary meaningful, it must be enforced. Today, the local fishermen, including Simpson and Bailey, take turns patrolling the boundary in the Interceptor.On this morning, the men steer the boat just outside a row of orange buoys marked “no fishing”. ‘‘We are looking for violators,” Bailey says, his eyes trained on the rocky coast. “Sometimes you find spearmen. They think they’re smart. We try to beat them at their game.”Most of the older and more established fishermen, who own boats and set out lines and wire cages, have come to accept the no-fishing zone. Besides, the risk of having their equipment confiscated is too great. But not everyone is on board. Some younger men hunt with lightweight spearguns, swimming out to sea and firing at close-range. These men, some of them poor and with few options, are the most likely trespassers.The patrols carry no weapons, so they must master the art of persuasion. “Let them understand this. It’s not a ‘you’ thing or a ‘me’ thing. This isn’t personal,” Bailey says of past encounters with violators.These are sometimes risky efforts. Two years ago, Jerlene Layne, a manager at nearby Boscobel fish sanctuary, ended up in hospital with a bruised leg after being attacked by a man she had reprimanded for fishing illegally. “He used a stick to hit my leg because I was doing my job, telling him he cannot fish in the protected area,” she says.Layne believes her work would be safer with more formal support from the police, but she is not going to stop. “Public mindsets can change,” she says. “If I back down on this, what kind of message does that send? You have to stand for something.”She has pressed charges in court against repeat trespassers, typically resulting in a fine and the confiscation of equipment.One such violator is Damian Brown, 33, who lives in a coastal neighbourhood called Stewart Town. Sitting outside on a concrete staircase near his modest home, Brown says fishing is his only option for work and he believes the sanctuary boundaries extend too far.Back at the White River docking area, Rick Walker, a 35-year-old spear fisherman, is cleaning his motorboat. He remembers the early opposition to the fish sanctuary, when many people said they were trying to stop their livelihood.Two years later, Walker, who is not involved in running the sanctuary but supports its boundary, says he can see the benefits. “It’s easier to catch snapper and barracuda,” he says. “At least my great-grandkids will get to see some fish.”When Columbus landed in Jamaica he sailed into Oracabessa Bay, which is today a 20-minute drive from the mouth of the White River. Oracabessa Bay fish sanctuary was the first of the grassroots-led efforts to revive Jamaica’s coral reefs. Its sanctuary was legally incorporated in 2010 and its approach of enlisting local fishermen as patrols became a model for other regions.“The fishermen are mostly on board and happy, that’s the distinction. That’s why it’s working,” says the sanctuary manager, Inilek Wilmot.David Murray, the head of the Oracabessa Fishers’ Association, notes that Jamaica‘s 60,000 fishermen operate without a safety net. “Fishing is like gambling, it’s a game. Sometimes you catch something, sometimes you don’t,” he says. When fish populations began to collapse two decades ago, something had to change.Murray now works as a warden in the Oracabessa sanctuary, while continuing to fish outside its boundary. He also spends time explaining the concept to neighbours.“It’s people work, it’s a process to get people to agree on a sanctuary boundary,” he says. “It’s a tough job to tell a man who’s been fishing all his life that he can’t fish here.”But once it became clear that a no-fishing zone actually helped nearby fish populations rebound, it became easier to build support. The number of fish in the sanctuary has doubled between 2011 and 2017, and the inidual fish have grown larger, nearly tripling in length on average, according to annual surveys by Jamaica’s national environment and planning agency. And that boosts catches in surrounding areas. After word got out about Oracabessa, other regions wanted advice.“We have the data to show success but even more important than data is word of mouth,” says Wilmot, who oversaw training to help start the fish sanctuary at White River.Morrow, a lifelong water sports enthusiast often seen paddle-boarding with her dog, Shadow, runs the White River Marine Association. She attends fishers’ meetings and raises small grants from the Jamaican government and other foundations to support equipment purchases and coral replanting campaigns.“We all depend on the ocean,” Morrow says, sitting in a small office decorated with nautical maps in the 70-year-old Jamaica Inn. “If we don’t have a good healthy reef and a good healthy marine environment, we will lose too much. Too much of the country relies on the sea.”This Associated Press feature was produced in partnership with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s department of science education.

So when Juventus, the Italian home of Cristiano Ronaldo and Gianluigi Buffon, invited the brand to design their 20192020 season kit, it was a dream come true. “It was amazing and crazy,” says Tanju. “They are an iconic football team and have some of my favourite players.”Palace has long graduated from Tanju’s basement still independent, it now has four stand-alone stores, concessions in Dover Street Market, and a reported turnover of £25m. it is a skate brand that sells streetwear, turning it out in weekly “drops”, responding to its customers’ appetite for newness and novelty (while also giving rise to a healthy cottage industry in the re-sale market). Its in-house style is irreverent and often pokes fun at the fashion system that it is, nevertheless, a part of, having collaborated with Ralph Lauren, Adidas, Jean-Charles de Castelbajac and Reebok. A partnership on this level – a 10-year-old skate brand and one of the oldest and greatest Serie A football teams has never taken place before. It’s both brave unexpected, yet there is an authenticity to it. Palace is unique in the way it is positioned– cool, underground and elusive, but with the oomph of brand 10 times it’s size. It is hard to imagine any other label pulling this collaboration off.The collection for Juventus includes three kits in two different colour ways, two tracksuits, a jacket, training tops, baseball caps, a beanie, a sports bag, gloves, scarves and a football (which, sadly, won’t be used in games). The on-pitch kit has Juventus’s iconic stripes fading into an eye-melting op-art black-and-white check, punctuated with the sponsor’s logos in fluorescent green. It nods to the fact that the British football fan’s style was inspired by Italian brands from the 1980s, and sits on the intersectional point for skatewear, football and leisure culture. “The design process was really working out how to make it Juventus, but with a Palace edge – a bit wonky and crazy,” says Tanju. “Our designer, Nugget, brought a lot to the table, referencing 90s football gear, beanies and bag.”The small team at Palace is closer than family, and they all love what they do, says Tanju. “I’ve known my business partner for 20 years I used to skate with him,” he says. “There’s no guy in a suit looking over our shoulders saying we can’t do something because it didn’t sell. We make things we want to make.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e52c02f01313249bce22335f7d8efacdedc4ecaf/0_36_1816_1090/master/1816.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=edd7a5d30c98522048058cbc9a9ab34c","title":"julie delpy ethan hawke how we made before sunrise trilogy sunset midnight","story":"‘Remembering that much dialogue was torture’The original script for the first film, Before Sunrise, was believe it or not kind of devoid of romance – even though Richard Linklater, the director, had based it on a woman he spent the night walking around Philadelphia with. It was a great blueprint, but it was even more cerebral and talky. He was keen to capture something very true, so wanted the two leads to be writers on the film as well – and he auditioned us about what we wanted to say. I talked about some stuff that ended up in the film, about God existing in the space between people.So Richard, Ethan and I produced the script together, though Ethan and I weren’t credited for Before Sunrise. The process was totally collaborative: all three of us had to agree on ideas for scenes. That’s how we did Before Sunset and Before Midnight, too. If one of us hated something, it wouldn’t make the film. From the start, those guys wanted the balance of a proper female voice. The writing was still going on during the shoot in Vienna for example, that’s when I wrote the scene in which my character Céline makes a mock phone call to a friend and announces she’s in love with Jesse.Remembering that much dialogue was torture – and it was even worse with the longer takes on Before Sunset, which I had suggested doing in real time. I had been going through a bit of a difficult time in the early 00s, struggling to make films as a director and I’d had some health issues. But it wasn’t directly autobiographical: like the director Krzysztof Kieślowski once told me, you take a seed of truth and make it a tree. I had thought of the ending, where I imitate Nina Simone and tell Jesse he’s going to miss his plane, for another film I’d written. I performed it for Richard and he loved it. I wasn’t sure I wanted to give it away, but I thought: this series is more important than some film of mine I might never do. These films speak to everyone, from adolescence to the end of life they’re not just about generation X. Really young people now even like Before Sunrise because they see their parents in Jesse and Céline. You see Ethan and I getting older as the series progresses. The films are really a study of time.I’d been going through a really hard time with my orce, so that summer in Paris shooting Before Sunset was extremely healing, reconnecting with Richard and Julie. She and I had done a little cameo as Jesse and Céline in Richard’s 2001 animated feature Waking Life, and we started daydreaming about how we could make another movie together.A little later, Richard turned up to a book signing I was doing in Austin and had a flash of an idea: what if Jesse had written a book about Céline, and she turned up to the signing? There’s definitely something autobiographical in that opening exchange at the bookshop about using your own life to create art – and what the value of that is. You never really find the answers, but there’s a healthy healing process that comes from asking certain questions, and I hope the film asks them of me.The third film, Before Midnight, was the hardest to make because the first two are about romantic projection. I felt it was important to do a corresponding film that was grounded in reality and the nature of love on a day-to-day basis. Could we make a film about a couple who’ve been together for years and raised kids, but still have it be romantic, without telling one lie? We weren’t sure the audience would like it – you wouldn’t want to see a sequel to Titanic with Jack and Rose fighting.The structure was very challenging, too. We wanted to do a Bergman, like Scenes from a Marriage, with a sequence that starts off as a love scene, but ends in them possibly breaking up. So writing that climactic marital row scene was one of the most difficult things I’ve ever done 30 pages, without being boring, in one single room is tough. But it works as a complete circle: the way Before Sunrise starts is this couple in their 40s fighting on the train. We realised as we filmed it: “Wow, we’ve become that couple.”So there’s something about the trilogy that feels finished to me. Every time we make one of them, the stakes get higher. We wouldn’t want to pour any water in our beer. Which isn’t to say we couldn’t revisit Jesse and Céline we muse on it sometimes. A fourth film would have to work in some way that broke the rhythm of this cycle, maybe to address mortality. But these three films have been a blessing in my life.• The Before Trilogy is out now on Criterion Collection Blu-ray."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e1ccb325aa561c2735cfb86af6cba6e100662ea9/0_6_1654_992/master/1654.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8c39464940c1349ba62f8ed0b863cc0e","title":"martin scorsese is the irishmans director becoming more radical with age","story":"His latest film could have been just another mafia movie, but his use of CGI, streaming services and his bold approach to runtime pushes cinema forwardsThe Irishman begins with Robert De Niro’s veteran mafia hitman rambling from a wheelchair in an old people’s home – the last, befuddled survivor of a forgotten era. It would be so easy to view Martin Scorsese in a similar light. First there were his cranky-old-man comments about not considering Marvel movies to be “cinema”. Now comes The Irishman itself, which on superficial inspection looks like a three-and-a-half-hour wallow in the 76-year-old film-maker’s comfort zone, and doesn’t come close to passing the Bechdel Test.If Scorsese was on Mastermind, his specialist subject would surely be “male Italian-American criminality of the late 20th century”. In theme and cast (De Niro, Pesci, Pacino, Keitel), The Irishman is of a piece with previous Scorsese works, from Mean Streets to Goodfellas to Casino – although the ages of the performers does add an elegiac note to proceedings this time.But here’s the thing: Scorsese is still one of the most radical film-makers out there. He is the old dog who’s constantly learning new tricks. Take The Irishman’s bladder-challenging running time. You could read it as another case of auteur self-indulgence, and question whether it might have been better as a miniseries (Scorsese was an early defector to the small screen, directing HBO’s Boardwalk Empire). Alternatively, you could see The Irishman as a bold experiment in stretching the conventional crime thriller into something new and interesting. In a recent interview with Sight \u0026amp Sound, Scorsese talks about “trying to tell stories in a different way”, going less by plot than “intuitive connections”, in an almost improvisatory manner. He succeeds brilliantly. It is expansive and richly detailed but solidly structured, filled with scenes that become all the more riveting for their length. The movie also pushes the envelope of CGI with its “youthification” technology. New tricks.No Hollywood studio would have made The Irishman. Ironically, what allowed Scorsese to pull it off was Netflix (much like his recent Bob Dylan film, Rolling Thunder Revue). Streaming services are often cast as “destroyers of cinema”, but Scorsese is using them to save it.What unites his anti-Marvel comments, The Irishman’s scale, and much of his career, is Scorsese’s commitment to film: making it, moving it on, helping younger directors make it (recent producer credits include Joanna Hogg’s The Souvenir and the Safdie Brothers’ Uncut Gems), preserving and restoring it (as founder and chairman of the Film Foundation), and sharing his love of it (he has made documentaries on American and Italian cinema, with a British one reportedly on the way). Rather than sitting in his wheelchair waving his stick at the screen, Scorsese is still fighting. He is the best defender the medium has ever had."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc29befbd337488e24d4198175f3ed6dc357a2dc/0_816_8015_4809/master/8015.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4bdcdcdb45bf10dfc853bd3641507706","title":"pasta mista potatoes sausage soup rachel roddy recipe","story":"A thrifty soup thick with collapsing potato, odds and ends of pasta, a crumble of sausage and parmesanA consequence of writing a book about pasta is a cupboard filled with shapes. While I try to keep it under control, taking almost weekly inventories of the tubes, wheels, horses’ teeth, devils, stars, penises and spaghetti in my head-height cupboard, it quickly reverts to a game of Tetris: many open packets, many of them ready to fall. Another consequence is that I have plenty of questions for packet designers about closure, seals, paper perforation and the apparently adjustable sticker that so often isn’t. Not that I depend on stickers any more: plastic clothes pegs are my preferred way to close packets that are not going into the jar.The pasta mista jar, which is short and tubby with a red, twist-on lid, is home to the ends of packets. While it is surely common anywhere there is pasta and a resourceful cook, pasta mista seems synonymous with Naples, where they call it pasta ammiscata or ammescata. The writer Annalisa Barbagli describes how, as recently as 50 years ago, pasta was sold loose in grocery stores, scooped from large, deep drawers with glass fronts. The remains at the bottom of these drawers, the leftovers and fragments, corners and broken bits, were all swept together. Pasta ammiscata was then given its own drawer and sold cheaply: the Neapolitan equivalent of Woolworths’ broken biscuits.Pasta mista was also assembled at home, ends rounded up like unruly children and put in one place. You want to keep an eye on the various shapes you are tipping into the jar, making sure that cooking times are similar. At the same time, the differences are part of its beauty: the twists slightly firmer than the rombo (rhombus), the almost crunchy, ruffle-edged mafaldine, which makes for a nice contrast to a soft soup.The home for pasta mista is in minestre, the extended family of soups made from vegetables, maybe a little meat and often beans, which are bolstered and further thickened with pasta and the amido (starch) that seeps from it as it cooks. Pasta mista is also the shape for any of the numerous versions of pasta e patate (pasta and potatoes). I have written about this dish twice before, which is testament to how much I like and depend on it, week in, week out. This week’s version begins as the others do, by frying aromatic vegetables in oil, then adding cubed potatoes, a bay leaf and water. The difference comes in the next steps: this is for anyone who has ever told me that a recipe would be better with meat in it, and the friend whose motto is “put a sausage in it or on it”.Like most minestra and thick soups, especially those that include pasta, this dish benefits from a rest before you eat it. Let it sit for 10 minutes or thereabouts, so it is “nè bollente, nè fredda” (neither hot nor cold), but rather somewhere in the middle, which best suits both the flavour and texture: the collapsing potato, rich crumble of sausage, various degrees of pasta and fusing cheese, and you.500g potato1 small leek6 tbsp olive oilSalt and pepperBay leaf1-2 garlic cloves, peeled1 pinch red chilli flakes200g sausage meat200g mixed pasta30g parmesan, grated30g pecorino, gratedScrub and cut the potato into 1cm cubes, and finely chop the leek, saving any scraps for stock. In a large, heavy-based pan over a medium-low heat, fry the leeks in four tablespoons of olive oil with a pinch of salt, until they are starting to soften.Add the potatoes to the pan, stirring until every cube is glistening with oil, then add the bay leaf and 1.2 litres of water. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer for 30 minutes.While the soup simmers, gently fry the garlic in a frying pan along with the red chilli and remaining two tablespoons of oil. Squeeze the sausage meat from its casing, crumble into the pan and cook until brown all over. Add the sausage to the soup.Once the sausage has cooked in the soup for 10 minutes, raise the heat so the soup boils steadily, then add the pasta and cook until al dente (you may need to add more water).Finish with the grated cheese and plenty of freshly ground black pepper."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f4b52ea7d66b49908bf249bd58db36fbf317c718/0_20_1787_1072/master/1787.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eea2f07715718943332934f34ef0068f","title":"balotelli returned to italy with hope it has been crushed again by racism","story":"The racist abuse of Mario Balotelli made for another awful day in Serie A, made worse by those who deny it is even occurring You can’t delete racism. It’s like a cigarette. You can’t stop smoking if you don’t want to, and you can’t stop racism if people don’t want to.Six years have passed since Mario Balotelli spoke those words in an interview with Sports Illustrated. He was on top of the world back then, Italy’s first-choice No 9 and fresh from a triumphant half-season at Milan. Signed from Manchester City during the January transfer window, he had scored 12 times in 13 games for the Rossoneri, carrying them to third place.The magazine’s front cover depicted him walking on water. Yet even then, back when so much seemed possible for the striker whose goals had obliterated Germany at Euro 2012, Balotelli acknowledged his powerlessness to stop football supporters in his home country from abusing him for the colour of his skin.Returning to Italy this summer, after stints away at Liverpool, Nice and Marseille, he wondered if things might have changed. “I hope with all my heart that there won’t be any repeat of the things that happened when I was last here,” he said after signing for Brescia. “I hope that Italy has taken some steps forward.”He was destined to be disappointed. The opening weeks of the Serie A season have witnessed several high-profile instances of players being racially abused, from Romelu Lukaku at Cagliari to Dalbert at Atalanta and Ronaldo Vieira during a home game for Sampdoria against Roma.On Sunday, Balotelli was the target for monkey chants during Brescia’s game away to Verona. In the 55th minute, he responded. Fighting to keep the ball in play down by the corner flag, Balotelli turned suddenly and lashed it up towards supporters in the Curva instead.Chaos ensued. The referee, Maurizio Mariani, booked Balotelli for unsportsmanlike behaviour. Balotelli threatened to walk off the pitch. Players from both teams intervened, talking Balotelli down while also informing officials of the abuse he had received. Mariani waved off the yellow card and suspended the game, instructing the stadium announcer to warn fans that it would be abandoned altogether if the chants continued.After a delay of almost five minutes, play resumed. Verona, already leading through a goal from Eddie Salcedo, extended their advantage through Matteo Pessina. Balotelli responded with a spectacular strike from the edge of the D, struck first time off his right instep into the top corner. It was not enough to rescue his team from a 2-1 defeat.An ugly afternoon only got worse after the final whistle, when the Verona manager, Ivan Juric, flatly denied that any racist abuse had taken place. “I’m not afraid to say that nothing happened,” he insisted. “There was loud whistling and mockery, but no racist chant. There was nothing. I am a Croatian and I hear ‘gypsy piece of shit’ sometimes because unfortunately that is the tendency in Italy. But today there was nothing.”What possessed him to take such a hard line, only he can know. In any case, he was wrong. Juric might not have heard the monkey chants himself, but several of his players did, and they were plainly audible on a fan-shot video that circulated on Sunday evening.This has too often been the default mode for clubs whose fans stand accused of racist chanting: to mount an aggressive defence first – often calling into question the integrity of the victim – and ascertain the facts of what happened later. Verona’s president, Maurizio Setti, supported his manager’s line, claiming his team’s supporters were simply “sarcastic, not racist”.Verona will likely be sanctioned. The independent observer sent to monitor this game heard the racist chants and included them in their official report – something that did not happen when Lukaku and Dalbert were abused, and which should allow the sporting justice greater scope for punishment.Still, there are ambiguities that make the verdict hard to predict. According to La Gazzetta dello Sport, the observer only ascribed the monkey chants to a group of about 15 fans. Balotelli was booed and whistled by many more, but here we are into murky territory. What constitutes racist abuse rather than straightforward jeering of an opponent?Regardless of the outcome, the discouraging thought is that once again nothing will change. This was a weekend when Roma’s game against Napoli was also suspended in response to territorial discrimination from the former club’s ultras. The initial warning from the stadium announcer had been roundly ignored. Only the intervention of Edin Dzeko, encouraging fans to drown out the chants with cheers, seemed to get things back on track.Balotelli’s assessment that you cannot force people not to be racist rings as true as ever. On the other hand, Italian football cannot absolve itself of responsibility. Clubs in other countries do a far more effective job of identifying iniduals who engage in racist chanting and keeping them out of the stands.This is a slow process, and even with maximum commitment could not be achieved overnight. It is hard to see how it will ever happen at clubs whose first instinct is to accuse a victim of making it up.• Defeat for Brescia meant the sack for Eugenio Corini – the manager who steered them to promotion. His team have taken one point from their past six games, but to me this still felt premature. This has been a gruelling run, including games against Juventus, Inter, Napoli and Fiorentina – none of whom beat them by more than a single goal.• Roma leapt up to third by beating Napoli in a hugely entertaining game, and Paulo Fonseca really does seem to have his team moving on a positive trajectory despite a long injury list. Nicolò Zaniolo opened the scoring with a wonderful left-foot finish – marking his fourth straight game with a goal – and even Javier Pastore is playing well now that he’s back in his preferred home at No 10. Chris Smalling once again played his part, too, with an acrobatic clearance off the line.• When is a handball not a handball? Don’t ask Matthijs De Ligt, who was not punished in the Turin derby when the ball struck his arm in almost identical pose to that in which it had done so when he gave away a penalty against Lecce. This time: no spot-kick – a contrast that only looked sharper after Juventus edged to a 1-0 victory over their city rivals, courtesy of a volley from the defender himself.• Is it time to start viewing Cagliari as serious contenders for the Champions League? They won 2-0 away to Atalanta, drawing level on points with the Bergamo club and Lazio in fourth place. The Sardinians were aided by a first-half red card to Josip Ilicic but the 23-year-old Uruguayan Christian Oliva was magnificent in midfield. His only previous start came away to Napoli, where Cagliari also won, 1-0.• Two more goals for Romelu Lukaku, who rescued Inter after they fell behind at Bologna. He has nine in Serie A already, placing him second only to Ciro Immobile – who is already on 13 for Lazio."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/069a80f48d75bd8cb2d17de8bbaf67f312fefb7a/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b58a0eb60b8fcb29622ca7927aad0812","title":"cardiff city face transfer ban payment emiliano sala nantes","story":"Cardiff face an embargo on signing players for three transfer windows if they do not pay Nantes the €6m (£5.2m) first instalment of the transfer fee for the late Emiliano Sala following Fifa’s ruling in Nantes’ favour.That part of the decision by Fifa’s players’ status committee, made on 25 September after Cardiff refused to pay Nantes the fee, was revealed under football’s world governing body’s new policy of publishing the full decisions of its committees.Fifa had released only brief details of rulings, including the one against Cardiff relating to Sala, the Argentinian striker who died when his plane crashed into the sea on 21 January, two days after Cardiff signed him.Any such transfer embargo would be immediately lifted once the amount owing is paid. Fifa explained the payment is suspended anyway if a party to a dispute appeals to the court of arbitration for sport, which Cardiff immediately said they would. A spokesman for Cardiff confirmed that the 45-day deadline is suspended pending CAS hearing the case the club have until the end of this month to submit their reasons.The committee’s ruling reveals Cardiff are seeking to hold Nantes and the former player’s agent, Willie McKay responsible for the financial loss caused by Sala’s death in the Channel. The club argue that McKay was acting on behalf of Sala on a mandate from Nantes when he commissioned the ill-fated flight. He has denied any involvement in the selection of the plane or the pilot.Nantes rejected that argument, saying McKay’s son Mark was the registered football agent with whom they dealt and that was only to negotiate the transfer with Cardiff. The flight between Cardiff and Nantes, for Sala to say his farewells at the French club, was not organised with their authority, Nantes argued.The players’ status committee decided its authority was limited to determining that the transfer had been validly concluded, according to football’s international procedures, to make Sala a registered Cardiff player hours before he died. Any claims of criminal or civil liability relating to the circumstances of his death are for courts to decide, the committee ruled."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3130a3559be1373fdc7805fd4b36b7401b0bfcc6/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d5676a696dd7ce1eff4b55e0d20b6a61","title":"premier league 10 talking points weekend football","story":"Pulisic’s long wait pays off, Rodgers helps Vardy roll back the years and Nuno the perfectionist is back on track“Perfection doesn’t exist but we are always chasing it,” Nuno Espírito Santo said after Wolves’ thoroughly deserved draw at Arsenal. It was a nice line from a manager who tends to prefer that his players’ performances do the talking. While his side were nowhere near flawless on Saturday they were certainly impressive: there is no doubt Wolves are one of the best-coached teams in the Premier League and they look back to their old selves now after an uncertain, Europa League-addled start to the campaign. They have not lost in the top flight since mid-September and a four-point haul from their visits to the Etihad and the Emirates suggests they will lift themselves into contention for this season’s European spots. Wolves do not offer a thrill a minute but few sides have their technical and tactical clarity they dominated for sizeable periods and, even without the injured defender Willy Boly, are a formidable prospect once again. Nick AmesGraham Potter’s Brighton moved into the top half of the table with Saturday’s 2-0 victory over Norwich City. Although it might seem natural to think of the 3-0 home win against Tottenham a month ago as a turning point in their season, the feeling among fans is the fortunate 3-2 victory against Everton last week was more of a watershed moment. Saturday’s Leandro Trossard-inspired victory over Norwich sent Brighton up to eighth, two places above Manchester United, to whom they travel on Sunday. The days when clubs of Brighton’s stature visited Old Trafford aiming merely for damage limitation are long gone. With their summer recruit Trossard fit, Brighton will face Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s misfiring United believing they can register a third straight win in the Premier League. Luke McLaughlinBrendan Rodgers has admitted Jamie Vardy’s renaissance at Leicester is down to a “more synchronised” approach to defending from the front. The former England striker scored his 10th Premier League goal of the season against Crystal Palace on Sunday to move one ahead of Sergio Agüero and Tammy Abraham in the race for the Golden Boot, and is scoring at a rate that would see him surpass the 24 he racked up in Leicester’s title-winning season. “He’s not having to press the whole back four,” Rodgers said. “Jamie is a guy who would run all day for you, so now he is doing shorter bursts, which he is very good at. He’s also playing more central and staying on the last man because he is such a threat. He is a really top striker for this level and he is really enjoying his football.” Leicester are six points clear of fifth-placed Arsenal, who they host on Saturday. Ed AaronsIt is not exactly an exclusive to report that VAR decisions are taking too long. The 12 minutes of added time that allowed Everton to claim an equaliser were not all down to André Gomes’s horrific injury: there was a ridiculous three-minute delay to come to a conclusion about the ball hitting Dele Alli on the arm in the home penalty area. The ball did hit Alli on the arm, the arm was over the player’s head, so why no penalty? Taking three minutes then deciding nothing was amiss strongly suggests the Stockley Park officials had differing opinions. VAR is good at seeing everything but we are still no further down the road to consistency, and three minutes is simply too long for players to stand around scratching their heads, especially if it happens two or three times a game. We keep being told the process will get slicker and speedier. But opinions and arguments, it appears, are not to be rushed. Paul WilsonSheffield United may have exciting overlapping centre-halves but they also possess the Premier League’s joint-best defence. This was their fifth clean sheet of the season and significant credit must go to John Egan, who once again excelled at the heart of that central trio. Egan was once a promising youngster at Sunderland but an awful leg injury sustained on loan at Bradford required complicated surgery and there were fears his career might be over before it had properly begun. Instead, he battled back at Gillingham and then Brentford before Chris Wilder made him his defensive cornerstone. John Lundstram, Enda Stevens and Lys Mousset rightly commanded headlines as Burnley were shredded but the outstanding Egan was a very big reason why Sean Dyche’s side barely got sight of goal. Small wonder Blades fans fretted when the player who makes United’s unique system work limped off late on. Louise TaylorHas the real Christian Pulisic arrived? The winger started slowly at Chelsea after his £58m move from Borussia Dortmund but Frank Lampard’s decision to hold him back looks inspired. Pulisic is demonstrating why his fee was so high. Having shielded the 21-year-old when he was out of the side during September, Lampard has unleashed him in recent weeks and has watched him make a stunning impact. Pulisic came on to make important contributions in last month’s wins over Ajax and Newcastle and he looks determined not to lose his place in the starting line-up, following up last week’s hat-trick against Burnley with another excellent display at Vicarage Road. Pulisic scored the decisive goal against Quique Sánchez Flores’s side and only inspired goalkeeping from Ben Foster stopped him going home with the match ball again. Now he needs to maintain his form when Ajax visit Stamford Bridge on Tuesday. Jacob Steinberg“We need to find a reason why it happened”, said Manuel Pellegrini of West Ham’s defeat by Newcastle. And their losses to Everton, and Crystal Palace, and Oxford United. Pellegrini believes his team’s loss of form can be traced back to their shock Carabao Cup defeat to the League One side but it seems he is no nearer to fixing the problem. There was a general listlessness on Saturday and a naivety in pushing high up against Newcastle’s explosive counterattack. But one other factor Pellegrini might be considering is his goalkeeper. Roberto made his second appearance for the club against Oxford and has been in goal ever since following the long-term injury to Lukasz Fabianksi. The 33-year-old did not inspire confidence against Newcastle caught in no-man’s land at a set piece for the second goal, he was too soft against Jonjo Shelvey’s free-kick for the third. Fabianski isn’t expected back until the new year now – he looks a better player with every match he misses.

Kovac took over from Jupp Heynckes in July 2018 and won the domestic double in his first season in charge. This campaign he did oversee a remarkable 7-2 win at Tottenham in October but defeats against Hoffenheim and Frankfurt and draws against Hertha Berlin, RB Leipzig and Augsburg meant Bayern fell behind in the Bundesliga.They are fourth, only four points behind the leaders Borussia Mönchengladbach but performances have been so poor the Bayern board decided to act on Sunday morning.Rangnick is the frontrunner for the job and is interested but is under contract as the head of sport and development at Red Bull. The 61-year-old has extensive experience of the Bundesliga, having been in charge of Stuttgart, Hannover, Schalke and RB Leipzig among others as well as being the sporting director for RB Leipzig and Red Bull Salzburg.Bayern discussed appointing Rangnick at the end of last season but decided to keep faith in Kovac. The situation at Bayern is complicated by the president, Uli Hoeness, stepping down on 15 November but he will still have a say in who Bayern appoint next.Arsène Wenger is another candidate, possibly taking over until the end of the season,. The former Arsenal manager is held in high regard by Bayern and speaks fluent German. Bayern are likely to look for experience after Kovac’s appointment backfired. The 48-year-old had been in charge of only one club side, Eintracht Frankfurt, before taking charge of Bayern.The Ajax manager, Erik ten Hag, is also on the shortlist having reached the Champions League semi-finals with the Dutch club since being appointed in 2017 and knows Bayern well after coaching their second team between 2013 and 2015. Bayern know they have no chance of getting the 47-year-old now but could try in January or at the end of the season.Allegri is another name interesting Bayern but they are wary of appointing a non-German speaker after Carlo Ancelotti’s difficulties in 2016-17. Allegri may still have a chance to get the job, however, as he is represented by Giovanni Branchini, who has dealt extensively with Bayern in the past and is trusted by the club.Finally, José Mourinho has been linked with the job but Hoeness, for one, does not want him at Bayern."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bbfd050b895fa3c44acfb3457bf05d85806e1997/0_276_3475_2083/master/3475.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6dc14ebc3ff44c125a47a7b2796f19ea","title":"osasuna la liga return","story":"Back in the summer, when the recently promoted Osasuna were building a squad for their return to La Liga, they sent videos to the players they were trying to persuade to join them. They didn’t have much money – only three teams have a smaller budget – and they didn’t have success to sell, either: the second ision title is the only thing they have won, and they had just done that for the first time in 58 years. But they could offer something different.When the tapes went out, sales pitches carefully edited in-house, they weren’t filled with 101 great goals, superb saves, or glorious games instead, they were packed with people. The footage wasn’t of footballers it was of fans. It was who they are.Osasuna sold El Sadar – the place that can feel like the one, last old ground left, even though, opened in 1967, it’s not that old. A ground where the main stand is so steep, so tight you feel like you’ll tumble on to the pitch below, punk is played at half-time, and where fans reach out and touch you, where they sit legs dangling over the barriers, banging the drum, flags waving, noise never letting up, team never letting up either. Where no one wins. The kind of place you’d want to play. If, that is, you’re the kind of player they’d want playing for them. And Ezequiel “Chimy” Ávila was exactly the kind of player they wanted playing for them: the striker with big thighs and an even bigger heart who the sporting director, Braulio Vázquez, introduced as “born to play for Osasuna”. First, though, he had to convince Chimy of that.Chimy was not the only footballer sent footage – Pervis Estupiñán and Facundo Roncaglia were also among the seven players signed – but he is the new signing who best represents Osasuna’s plans, the identity they were celebrating and reinforcing.“Our fans are our greatest asset we don’t have much money or the talent other teams have, but we have them: you have to make players see it’s a special place,” Braulio says. “We wanted them to know where they were coming. Here in Pamplona, players are God. We sent videos of the fans, how they’re on top of everyone, how they react, how they celebrate. And they really liked them.“We had to conquer his heart there’s an emotional element to it. I said to Chimy: ‘Imagine the whole of El Sadar chanting: Chimy! Chimy! He laughed at that: ‘I can see it already!’ He had other offers but this was the place for him. I told him: maybe at Betis, say, the fans like a nutmeg more, but here if you sprint back 50 metres, kill yourself to defend, you’re an idol. At some clubs, you might get whistled, but when he missed a sitter against Villarreal they were all: ‘Chimy! Chimy!’ And then he scores a brilliant goal.”By then, Chimy knew at his presentation, he already “knew”, the tapes did the trick. “This is a club where I feel people will love me,” he said back then, and he was right. Now, an idol in the city and in a team that have played even better than anyone imagined, he says: “When Braulio sent me the video of them celebrating promotion, it was emotional seeing the fans: that really got me. And being able to experience it for myself is lovely. That’s why I took the decision to come and I’m happy I did.” At his presentation Chimy promised: “Their style’s mine: run, crash into people, never give up,” and that starts in the stands.There is a reason that Osasuna won 17 home games in a row on their way to the second ision title last year, and didn’t lose at El Sadar all season. “I don’t think it’s an exaggeration to say there were eight games we won because of the fans,” says the striker Brandon Thomas, “that’s what this club is.” As the captain, Roberto Torres, told El País: “In that sense, I think Osasuna genuinely is a bit different. Here, unlike other places, fans support Osasuna, not Madrid or Barcelona. Tradition has been lost a bit, the essence of football: few care about the fans, when they’re what really matters. El Sadar’s always been a slightly more ‘English’ ground they used to say big teams feared coming.”Now, they do again. Barcelona drew 2-2 there and Valencia were hammered 3- 1, but this is more than just a couple of games and more than fans make a lot of noise or football team is good at home. It’s that – as the manager, Jacoba Arrasate, put it on Sunday night after their 4-2 victory against Alavés – they’re “binomial”: fans and footballers go “hand in hand” game and ground are inseparable. This team belong in this place it is this place. Arrasate understands that best: the idea was there but he’s the one who fully re‑established that relationship when he took over before last season, play constructed around the people, their personality.“From the start, he wanted to recover that traditional identity: to go for it,” says the winger Rubén GarcÌa, superb last season and this campaign. “He told everyone there has to be a communion. With every run, every tackle, the fans lift you they’re the adrenaline you need.”Osasuna play like someone has cut their brake cables, and it’s much better that way. At home, at least, they go, go, go, and then when they’ve got their breath back – even if they haven’t – they go again. They isolate opponents and chase them down, terrified. When they get the ball, it’s much the same. It’s relentless every pass played with intent, going for the throat, every move played as if it was the last, timing running out. On Sunday night a wild game finished 4-2, and the fact there were three penalties and endless stoppages for VAR – El Sadar is one of the few places to make them fun, drum rolls building to the decision – took nothing from a match one paper called “blessed madness”.Rubén García scored the first, Chimy swept in an exceptional second, first time on the bounce, and Víctor Laguardia got one back for Alavés a minute later with a finish almost as good: another half-volley, hit superbly. Torres made it 3-1 six minutes into additional time at the end of the first half and Lucas Pérez brought it back to 3-2 with another penalty, before a third from Juan Villar made it 4-2. They’d been playing 55 minutes and there had been six goals but, while there were no more, it wasn’t over. In fact, it was getting better. The afternoon had started with Rubén García forcing a save from Fernando Pacheco after 20 seconds and ended with Inigo Pérez smashing off the post in added time, just as Nacho Vidal had hammered off the bar. In the meantime, Alavés had 12 shots and Osasuna racked up 19 to go with the 30 against Valencia.“Our games are anything but dull,” Braulio says. “You’re winning 4-2 but at the end, you’ve got one full-back crossing for the other.” Osasuna are, he says, like Liverpool Arrasate is the Spanish Jurgen Klopp. “There’s a big difference, eh,” he adds swiftly, laughing, but there’s something in it. “People have fun watching us. It’s the rhythm, the speed, the intensity, we’re very vertical, it’s all very back and forth. But it’s not just that we run and put a foot in. We play, too. Rubén GarcÌa, Roberto Torres, Chimy, Fran Mérida: they can all play. The full-backs are like airplanes.”The fans, meanwhile, are like players. “This is a team that’s brave, that takes the initiative, but, bloody hell, behind it are the fans,” Arrasate says. “They make you feel almost invincible.”They almost are. There is a slight cheat, an asterisk – among their victories is last season’s forfeited match against Reus – but Arrasate has never been beaten as Osasuna manager and this was their 31st game in a row without defeat at El Sadar: four in 2017-18, 21 last year, and six this. Eibar, Barcelona, Betis, Villarreal, Valencia and Alavés have all been now none won. The run goes back 582 days, to April 2018, and it brought Osasuna up, put them three points off a Champions League place and secured 18 primera points, almost halfway to survival already: 31 is a record beating the previous best, set 61 years ago.The following morning at Tajonar, the club’s training ground, a man set off rockets. “Historic,” cheered the cover of El Diario de Navarra. “Oé oé oé oé oé oé,” ran the headline inside. El Sadar had become a “place of legend”, it said. At the end, that place rose to applaud, their work here almost done. Players stood and applauded the supporters back.“In this record, the players will appear but so will they because without the fans it would be impossible,” Arrasate said and it was no empty platitude. It was their third game in a week and fatigue had crept in, but they’d emerged from those with seven points, two more wins at home, and nine goals.“Now we’ll always be able to say we’re part of this club’s history. We’ve been talking about that in the dressing room, about how we’re all part of this, the fans especially. When they get home, they’ll talk about this too. In 20 years, they’ll be able to say: ‘I was there the day of the record, I lived those 31 games.’ It’s not chance, and that union means we enjoy it more. What we’ve done together is great.”It is. So good someone should make a video of it.• One by one, they fell. Barcelona were one up at Levante on Saturday, seemingly on course for another win, their eighth in a row 7min 39sec they were 3-1 down, heading instead for another defeat, another collapse, in tatters. Like Anfield all over again, only worse. “What are you playing at?” the cover of one Catalan daily asked, and it is quite a good question. Not just on Saturday, but almost every day. Yes, even when it goes well. “There’s not really an explanation,” Sergio Busquets said.• That left Atlético with the chance to go top, but they drew 1-1 in a really fun game at Sevilla that had a wild ending. Now, this column might be a bit of a weirdo, but it always thought that when a player makes a great save on the line and he’s not the goalkeeper, it’s a penalty. It also thought that when a player lays on the ball, traps it between his legs and doesn’t let go even while opponents boot him up his backside, it’s obstruction. Even if it is the last minute, like that has anything to do with it. But apparently not.• And so to Real Madrid. But they couldn’t beat Joel Robles – even though he couldn’t see. The Betis goalkeeper lost a contact lense, looking out one eye, but was still too good.• All of which means that Barcelona stayed top, and the table got very tasty – although it is legitimate to ask if the equality is as much about errors as excellence, if it may be as much bad news as good. It’s more fun, though. The top three are level, the top five are separated by just one point, the top seven are all within three points and the top 13 are all within five points. “The end of the two-team system,” AS’s cover said on Monday, employing a political pun that rally doesn’t translate well and actually doesn’t make much sense in Spanish either. Barcelona and Atlético, you mean?• It’s over. Beaten by Betis on Thursday, Celta were beaten again three days later – this time by Getafe. And that means the sack for Fran Escribá. Oh, and it looks like Luis Cembranos won’t continue as temporary coach at Leganés. It’s time for Javier Aguirre.• Sandro scores! And it’s a belter, too. His teammates applauded him back to the dressing room after the former Everton striker got his first goal in four seasons, three clubs and two years. “I’ve always scored goals and I will continue to,” he said afterwards, which wasn’t entirely accurate. Luckily, his shot had been."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7da79e84edf3f68c797c15b402833242edb9695e/0_0_1377_826/master/1377.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da956cfac8e3bbe802de783c51cd604d","title":"the dozen the weekends best premier league photos","story":"Referees, bicycle kicks, agony and ‘giving it back’ in this week’s roundup of the best top-flight pictures"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f306e91bfb7da16e4d29cddec9ef236d49204bb/0_176_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=db1eebf46f5591552890e50b4bb8dc49","title":"how we met he is passionate about nature","story":"Environmentalist Paul Coleman, 64, met writer Konomi Kikuchi, 53, after a tree-planting walk in Japan. They live in a home they built together in the Chilean wildernessAs a keen environmentalist, Paul Coleman has travelled the world, walking vast distances to plant trees and raise awareness about climate change. At the end of 2004, he had just finished a walk in Japan when he met Konomi Kikuchi. “I was giving a presentation that was being translated into Japanese for the audience,” he says. “I noticed she was laughing at my jokes before the translation.”Konomi, a writer, says she was inspired by the Briton’s mission to spread the message about the environment. The author of 11 books, she was keen to write about Paul and his life’s work on her blog. Shortly afterwards, Konomi’s editor read her blogpost and asked her to write a book about Paul. To celebrate its publication at the 2005 Expo in Nagoya, he planned to walk round the island of Okinawa. “I was fascinated by his character,” Konomi says. “So I asked if I could go with him on part of his trip.”They ended up spending a week together. “I discovered that he has a great sense of humour and a big heart. He is so passionate about nature and the planet. It made me rethink the way I had been living my life.”Konomi loved exploring the outdoors. By the end of the week, Paul had fallen in love with her. “I realised her whole personality was wonderful. She’s very giving and has such a loving nature. She’s the whole package.”Konomi had recently come out of a relationship and wasn’t sure if she was ready for something new. “Paul was happy to take things slowly – or just be friends if that was what I wanted. He accepted me for who I was.”This acceptance encouraged her to take the plunge and their relationship progressed quickly. In September 2005, they were married in Japan. Several months later, Paul was invited by the Earth Day movement to take part in a three-month walk around China, Korea and Japan. “The trip was designed to unite the Earth Day movements in those three countries and send a message of goodwill,” he says. “We started at the Great Wall of China in January in temperatures of –15C, which was extremely challenging for Konomi.”She says she almost gave up but Paul encouraged her to persevere. “I was carrying all my makeup and cosmetics, which was making it even harder. Eventually, he persuaded me to ditch them to make my bag lighter. I’ve never worn makeup since!”When they married, Paul had promised that they would find the “most beautiful place in the world” to live. In 2007, they bought some land in Aysén, a remote area of Patagonia in Chile. Accessible only by ferry and five hours from the nearest city, the region is surrounded by glaciers and forests. “From the first moment, I fell in love with it,” says Konomi.Over the next few years, the couple built a home from scratch. “There is no road to the house so we carried all the materials on our backs,” says Paul. “It was his idea to build the house but I had total faith in him,” says Konomi. “If he could walk round the world, he could make this happen.”To create the sustainable lifestyle they dreamed of, the couple planted more than 1,000 native trees and built terraces, greenhouses and ponds to collect rainwater. Food is sourced from their land and they get fresh water from the stream. The couple now use their expertise to support local community projects. “We are trying to create a fully sustainable local economy,” says Paul. “At the moment a lot of food is imported, so it travels for many miles. If there’s a storm and supplies are cut off it means there is no food.”They have made plenty of friends there and enjoy exploring Patagonia in their spare time. “Every day is an adventure. It’s like living in a 1,000km national park,” says Paul. “Konomi and I are together for 24 hours a day but we are best friends. We have a wonderful life.”Want to share your story?

When its jaw slowly opens, Burna Boy is revealed on its tongue.Strapped into a harness, he glides through the air from its open mouth to the tip of the stage. Microphone in hand and the crowd screaming under his feet, stretching their fingers to the sky, he moans the uplifting lyrics to the title track from his 2019 album African Giant: “Tell ’em Africa we don’t tire!”Other tracks from the album are as enchanting as his introduction. Over 19 songs he mixes Afrobeats rhythms with influences that  R\u0026ampB and reggae, a blend that is making him the genre’s first global breakout star. Accompanied by a live band and choir, the gig has the feeling of a coronation of Nigeria’s latest musical king.Killin Dem is captivating, the jittery drums and choppy vocal delivery creating mosh-pit circles like craters across the arena. When Burna Boy screams “Gbese!” during the hook, the craters collapses in on themselves, and 12,000 people vigorously jerk their shoulders to the scattergun percussion, resembling a mass synchronised swimming routine. Burna Boy has elegance, grace and charisma, a magnetic aura that follows him like a shadow he dances as if music vibrates in his bones, and gives his vocals a deep, raspy croon.Special guests add gloss to the evening and show how highly he is regarded. There is an appearance from Burna’s fellow Afrobeats titan Wizkid Dave sprints to the stage to spar over their summer anthem Location, and Stormzy marches out for a fervent delivery of Vossi Bop, exchanging a long hug with Burna. The evening ends with Ye, the song that has spearheaded Afrobeats’ global expansion, its soft, enticing drums and echoing, easy hook digestible for ears from all continents. He finds his groove amid the tender piano chords and leads the crowd into a hypnotic sermon, closing out a historic night for a true giant of African music.• At Albert Hall, Manchester, 6 November then touring the UK until 10 November."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c2ee4ebd77b02276d396b460de9d8105921c35e/0_54_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cb83ca340100fe64aeda43f60a3a6626","title":"flea red hot chili peppers interview memoir","story":"The bassist’s new autobiography lifts the lid on a difficult, violent childhood and a conflicted relationship with Anthony KiedisIn his new memoir, Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea recalls a Halloween night of genuine horror. At 13, he was trick-or-treating with friends when word spread through his neighborhood that a madman was firing a gun randomly in the street. The terrified kids scattered to find safety in their homes, but when Flea approached his parents’ house he noticed that all the front windows had been blown out and debris strewn all over the lawn. Once inside, he found his step-father, Walter, with blood smeared over his face and torso, a smoking pistol dangling by his side. “He was the lunatic they were all talking about,” Flea recalled. “It was terrifying and shameful.”And it wasn’t the first time something like that happened. “Walter would get drunk and something would trigger him and he would freak out and smash everything in the house,” Flea said. “At times, a gun would come out.”After the Halloween incident, the cops came and arrested Walter. After he went through the system and returned home, he apologized to Flea and his mom profusely. “And then,” said Flea, “the pattern would repeat.”Making sense of events like this wound up driving nearly the entire narrative of Flea’s harrowing – but, at times also, hilarious – memoir, titled Acid for the Children. It’s overwhelmingly focused on his formative years, broken by short fast-forwards to his time with the Chili Peppers. Some of the Peppers’ vignettes deal with the band’s own traumas, including Flea’s guilt over the heroin-related death of the band’s early guitarist Hillel Slovak at just 26. But the main part of the book ends with their very first live show.Not that this was Flea’s original game plan. “I thought I would just write about the band because who would be arrogant enough to think anyone would care about my childhood?” he said.But, given the amount of violence, drug use and sometimes useful adventure in his past, this clearly wasn’t just any childhood. “Eventually, I became entranced with the idea of getting under the narrative, to find out the ‘why’ of my early life,” he said.To capture the fractured nature of it, Flea ided his book into brief, blunt chapters, in the process creating a rhythm for his prose as curt and distinct as his bass playing. The first part of the story centers on impressionistic perceptions from his first four years of life in Melbourne, Australia, where he was born Michael Peter Balzary. When he was five, his father’s work necessitated the family move to Rye, a northern suburb of New York City. By the time he was seven, Flea’s parents orced and his father moved back to Australia, causing the boy to feel abandoned and unmoored. Things became even more unstable when his mother remarried to a troubled jazz musician, Walter Urban Jr (now deceased). Immediately, Walter moved the family (including Flea’s older sister, Karyn) to his parents’ house where they lived together in the basement. Though Flea paints his stepfather as an unkempt, odd and violent man, he believes his mother was drawn to his bohemian sensibility. “She had grown up in this really straight Australia, where things went by the rules of the 1950s,” he said. By contrast, “Walter did drugs and played jazz and had all kinds of ethnicities hanging out. It was a chance for her to go into New York City and liberate herself.”After a few wild years on the east coast, the family relocated to the gnarlier parts of Hollywood and, by 11, a barely supervised Flea began to smoke pot every day. The cover of the book boasts a picture of him at 12 smoking a joint. By that time, Flea had acquired his nickname, based on his fidgety nature and diminutive stature. The latter contributed to an already serious inferiority complex. From early childhood, Flea writes that he had “an undying sense that something was wrong with me, that everyone else is clued into a group consciousness from which I am excluded”.This belief, along with his unstructured home life, led him to yearn for a brotherhood of friends to serve as a surrogate family. Most of the kids he found were fellow scamps who enabled his knack for getting into scrapes, which ranged from petty theft to crashing cars. Drugs became another bond. Flea began shooting speed regularly, which didn’t help his attention deficit disorder tendencies or his emotional advancement. On the other hand, he believes he got a lot out of his experiments with hallucinogens. One chapter begins with the line “LSD was good to me”.“For someone like me, who was running crazy in the street, the drug got me to access my subconscious, to develop introspection,” he said.Flea admits he overperformed on that front, a tendency exacerbated by his desire to escape the violence at home. At the same time, his stepfather’s role as a serious musician and artist had a positive effect on him, providing a living example of the power and beauty of music. “When I saw him and his musician buddies set up in the living room to play bebop with such emotion and physicality, it changed my life forever,” he said.The combination of the muscularity of music and Flea’s wild character contributed to his later emphasis on nudity and primitivism in the Chili Peppers’ presentation. “I grew up running around naked,” said Flea. “There’s a freedom inherent in it, a rebelliousness, that I find beautiful.”The band’s eager display of their bodies gave them a homoerotic frisson from the start. But for Flea there was a serious message behind it, rooted in his past. In a chapter of the book titled Men Don’t Kiss Men he recalls how hurt he felt at the age of six when his birth father admonished him for wanting a kiss. It seeded a will in him to rebel against the restrictive nature of male identity. Early in their career, the Chili Peppers did so in a daring way by posing for the Los Angeles-based gay porn magazine In Touch. “I felt honored that they wanted us in the magazine,” Flea said. “The gay community in Los Angeles were the first ones to really embrace the Chili Peppers.”In conversation, Flea revealed that he had gay experiences of his own growing up, episodes he wrote about at length in an early version of the book. But, he wound up taking all that out. “I didn’t want it to be sensationalized,” he explained. “To me, it wasn’t a big deal. I was experimenting and it turns out, ‘hey, I’m not gay’. So, it’s not really my story.”More central to Flea’s story is his deep, and complicated, relationship with the Chili Peppers’ singer, Anthony Kiedis. In the book, he calls Anthony “the missing link I never considered”. “He was unlike anyone I had ever met,” Flea said. “Among my friends, I was the guy who was always trying to do something that would freak people out. Then I met Anthony and he matched me step for step. We got up to all kinds of crazy shit.”In the memoir, Flea expresses an undimmed awe for Anthony but he also calls him controlling. Still, he’s vague on details. Considering that Flea also writes about forever wanting Anthony’s approval, one wonders if he censored his writing to stay on the singer’s good side. Flea admits there’s something to that, but he is willing to discuss one key issue between them. “He doesn’t accept that I’m different and that things that excite me may not excite him,” Flea said. “He’s looking to be the alpha.”He also admitted that Anthony’s many years of drug abuse (which the singer wrote about in his own memoir, Scar Tissue, published in 2004) infuriated him. “It’s painful and scary and sad,” said Flea. “Because the rationale of someone who’s a drug addict is disingenuous and hollow and misguided.”He said he hasn’t read Anthony’s memoir (“I might feel hurt and I don’t want to walk into a rehearsal room feeling upset about something”). And, he said, Anthony hasn’t read his. As it happens, Flea devoted as much of his book to the band’s late guitarist Slovak, as he did to their living singer. One of the most wrenching sections finds Flea beating himself up over his handling of Slovak’s addiction. “I was so angry at him,” he said. “For a long time, I kicked myself that I didn’t know how to be there for him in a way that I could have been. It’s a hard thing.”Ultimately, Flea said, he found everything about writing the book hard. “I went through so much to get it to be honest about what shaped me,” he said. “That’s what this is about: a yearning to know who I am.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84d57ca636e655e8b698d5caa82e65fb35d82e31/0_498_2736_1642/master/2736.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c918e4960b4b1375e8526c95b6af270b","title":"no 10 blocks russia eu referendum report until after election","story":"Decision to prevent publication described as ‘jaw-dropping’ by Dominic GrieveDowning Street has effectively blocked the publication of a potentially explosive parliamentary report on the security threat that Russia poses to the UK until after the general election.The 50-page document from the intelligence and security committee examines allegations that Kremlin-sponsored activity distorted the result of the 2016 EU referendum, but has to be cleared by No 10 before it can be released.Downing Street indicated on Monday that it would not approve publication before parliament is dissolved on Tuesday evening, meaning that it cannot now appear before the election on 12 December.A No 10 spokesman declined to outline when the report would eventually be published. “There are processes reports such as this have to go through before publication, and the committee is well informed of these,” he said.The committee’s chairman, Dominic Grieve, said the decision to prevent publication before the election was “jaw-dropping” and that he could not understand on what basis it had been made.“The protocols are quite clear. If the prime minister has a good reason for preventing publication he should explain to the committee what it is, and do it within 10 days of him receiving the report. If not it should be published,” he said.A final draft of the Russian dossier, the product of 18-months work, was sent to Downing Street on 17 October and was originally intended for publication early this week. Political approval had been expected by the end of last week.It was intended to be the last step in what is conventionally a complex sign-off process. The report has already been cleared by Britain’s spy agencies, which contributed to the research.Christopher Steele, the former MI6 spy who authored a dossier about Donald Trump’s links to Moscow, also gave written evidence to the inquiry. His firm Orbis has documented Russian attempts to influence election outcomes in several European states and the 2016 US presidential election.The committee’s report is understood to examine allegations that Russian money has flowed into British politics in general and the Conservative party in particular. It also features claims that Russia launched a major influence operation in 2016 in support of Brexit.Fresh questions were also raised over the weekend by the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, about Dominic Cummings’ connections to Russia, and the levels of security vetting to which Johnson’s chief strategist has been subjected.Thornberry intervened after an official-level whistleblower raised serious concerns, asking specifically if Cummings had been asked about the purpose of his three-year period of work in post-communist Russia between 1994 and 1997 and his relationship with members of the group Conservative Friends of Russia in the early part of this decade.A No 10 source said that reports such as that of the intelligence and security committee normally took about six weeks to be cleared for publication, and there was nothing unusual about the delay. Grieve, however, disputes that and has accused No 10 of lying about the publication timescale.Opposition politicians have accused Johnson of presiding over a cover-up. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said over the weekend that the report should be published and asked what the government had to hide."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3fc1c45abbf1f489b67213250ad53b49f8b9981/0_0_3197_1919/master/3197.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a043f3127d5c10c230b262bf42e1db8d","title":"plaid cymru election could spark push for welsh independence","story":"Party leader Adam Price puts Wales breaking away from UK at centre of campaignThe leader of Plaid Cymru, Adam Price, has said the general election could signal the start of a movement towards “a new Welsh spirit of independence and optimism”.Speaking at the nationalist party’s campaign launch, Price put the idea of Wales breaking away from the UK and remaining in the EU as an independent country front and centre of the Plaid campaign.“That pencil we will all hold in a few weeks could be the start not only of a new politics but a new Wales, a new hope for all of us,” he said.Plaid’s campaign slogan is “Wales, it’s us”. Price said: “It’s us, the people of Wales, that hold the key to the nation’s future … an independent Wales.“This is the election in which Wales will begin to find its voice as a nation. It will start as a whisper, a still, small voice in the darkness, but it will end with a chorus. Speaking with one voice … Now is our time.”Plaid’s launch took place, as it did in 2017, in a hotel close to the Menai strait in north Wales. Two years ago, the then leader, Leanne Wood, focused on the idea of defending Wales from the Tories in London and the Labour-led government in Cardiff, with independence sidelined.Price took swipes at Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn, complaining Wales was suffering economically and socially because of decisions made in Westminster and Cardiff.“In calling the third election in just four years, the Westminster parties certainly have given the people the worst Christmas present ever,” he said,“A political culture that is more toxic than at any time in our history, a poisoned chalice of a choice between two ided parties led by one leader who is resolutely dishonest on Brexit and another who is sadly proven, honestly, clueless. And both of them, as we’ve seen in recent days, advised by public schoolboys who seem to see politics as some kind of pathological game.”But he emphasised the election should be not about “them” but was instead about “us”. Price argued “almighty lessons” could be learned from the Scottish National party, which had the attention and respect it deserved because of electoral successes.Price said his party’s priorities included a green jobs revolution, a new approach to care, lifting children out of poverty with universal free childcare and a new £35-a-week payment for every child in low-income families, investing in affordable homes, and tackling crime by creating a Welsh justice system, devolving policing and recruiting 1,600 police officers.He did not discuss pacts with other pro-remain parties during his speech, but in interviews given beforehand, Price said such agreements were the way to go. He insisted Plaid was the leading remain party in Wales, seeking to stop Brexit through a “final say” referendum, and wanting Wales to become an independent state in the EU.Introducing Price, the party’s Westminster leader, Liz Saville Roberts, said the times were “dangerous, confused and volatile” but also full of potential. She said the party would look to create harmony with the nearest capital – Dublin – and also with London.Saville Roberts also attempted to reach out to voters who may not be traditional Plaid supporters. “We are the party for Wales and everyone who lives there,” she said. “If Wales is in your heart, we are the party for you.”Speaking after the speech, Price said the party was having “positive discussions” about taking part in alliances with the pro-remain parties and hope to make an announcement soon.He said: “We’ve had extensive discussions, very positive discussions, over many, many weeks and months. In principle, we’re very much supportive of the idea of trying to maximise the number of MPs from pro-Remain parties that are elected from Wales and indeed, of course, there are similar discussions between the Greens and the Liberal Democrats in England.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/625fee79812c2967a3715995e278b01540501b30/104_0_570_342/master/570.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e46dac0b4f95376acd3031815b5ebde5","title":"tories back candidate francesca o brien benefits street remarks gower","story":"Work and pensions secretary says electing Francesca O’Brien a ‘matter for people of Gower’The work and pensions secretary has come under fire for backing a Tory candidate in a marginal seat who wrote on social media that people on the reality TV programme Benefits Street needed “putting down”.The Conservative party has refused calls to drop Francesca O’Brien, who is standing in a key target seat in Gower, south Wales, despite anger after her Facebook comments were exposed by the .Thérèse Coffey, the minister in charge of the country’s benefits system, said it was a “matter for the people of Gower” on whether O’Brien should be the constituency’s next MP.In posts unearthed by the  that have since been deleted, O’Brien, 32, wrote in January 2014: “Benefit Street..anyone else watching this?? Wow, these people are unreal!!!”Asked whether O’Brien should be a candidate given her comments, Coffey told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “What she said is clearly wrong, clearly wrong. I’m led to believe it was early in 2014. I don’t know Francesca at all.“She has apologised I’ve been told, that is important. And I recognise that these comments are not ones with which I would associate myself in any way.”Pressed again on whether she should be standing, Coffey added: “I think that will be a decision for the people of Gower to make the choice on who they want to be their next member of parliament.”A spokesman for the Conservatives confirmed the party was standing by O’Brien despite her comments prompting widespread outrage.The Labour party’s chair, Ian Lavery, said: “Removing a candidate who used such vile language about people on benefits should be a no-brainer.“The cuts to benefits and universal credit programme that Thérèse Coffey and her party are responsible for have forced people into poverty.“It is shameful that Boris Johnson is allowing Francesca O’Brien to stand for his party in Gower. This reveals the Conservatives’ contempt for the less well-off.”Benefits Street, which highlighted the lives of benefits claimants on a road in Birmingham, prompted controversy when it aired in 2014. The programme attracted 4 million viewers but also more than 100 complaints to regulator Ofcom of unfair, misleading and offensive portrayals of benefits claimants, alleged criminal activity and excessive bad language.After being approached by the , O’Brien – who was selected last month in an open primary – apologised for the comments which she said were “off the cuff”. She added: “These comments were made off the cuff, a number of years ago. However, I accept that my use of language was unacceptable and I would like to apologise for any upset I have caused.”Gower was won by Labour by little more than 3,000 votes at the 2017 general election and is a key marginal that the Conservatives will be targeting.

It’s about stacking items in a shopping bag.If you get full marks in parts (i), (ii) and (iii), well done. Most of the applicants who got in to Oxford did too. But on average, successful applicants did not score full marks in either of parts (iv) or (v).Can you do better than them?You need to pack several items into your shopping bag without squashing anything. The items are to be placed one on top of the other. Each item has a weight and a strength, defined as the maximum weight that can be placed above that item without it being squashed. A packing order is safe if no item in the bag is squashed, that is, if, for each item, that item’s strength is at least the combined weight of what’s placed above that item. For example, here are three items and a packing order:This packing is not safe. The bread is squashed because the weight above it, 5, is greater than its strength, 4. Swapping the apples and the bread, however, gives a safe packing.(i) Which of the other four orderings of apples, bread and carrots are safe or unsafe?(ii) Consider packing items in weight order, with the heaviest at the bottom. Show by giving an example – that is, invent some items and give them weights and strengths of your choosing – that this strategy might not produce a safe packing order, even if one exists.(iii) Consider packing items in strength order, with the strongest at the bottom. Show by giving an example – that is, invent some items and give them weights and strengths of your choosing – that this strategy might not produce a safe packing order, even if one exists.(iv) Consider we have a safe packing order in our bag. Assume that item j sits directly on item i.

Approaching the middle of his fourth decade, he is a more guarded, reflective man who makes sure every scrap of experience built up over almost 250 grands prix is exploited as, having seen off his contemporaries, he holds a new generation of wonderkids at bay.At the moment, Max Verstappen, Charles Leclerc, Alex Albon and Lando Norris can only stand back and admire the achievements of a driver, once a prodigy like them, who has propelled himself to a position alongside the most revered figures in his sport’s long history.Of all the statistics rolled out on Sunday as he celebrated his sixth world championship, the one that resonates most powerfully is his record of having won a grand prix in every one of his 13 seasons in F1. No other all-time great – not Fangio, not Senna, not Schumacher – managed that.By the time the new season starts, Hamilton will have turned 35. At that age most F1 drivers of the modern era have taken their trophies into retirement, or dropped down the grid, or drifted away to race at Le Mans or Indianapolis. Hamilton’s hunger for success and validation seems as fierce as it was when he turned up for his first grand prix and quickly proved more than a match for his new teammate, Fernando Alonso, a double world champion at the peak of his powers.The rookie from Stevenage showed himself to be a driver who raced with great passion but had prepared for the task with full attention to the science of driving and the technology of the sport. He is an emotional man and the fluctuations of his personal life have occasionally affected his performances but his devotion to the task of winning races appears, if anything, to have deepened as the years have gone by. In the aftermath of the US Grand Prix, where he secured his sixth title, his team’s technical director, James Allison, told the BBC how diligently Hamilton works with his engineers, and how astutely he now judges his effort. So if the outward brilliance of his driving has dimmed a little, the substance has increased.In his early days he gave the occasional bravura performance to rank alongside Fangio at the Nürburgring in 1957, Senna at Donington Park in 1993 and Schumacher at Budapest in 1998. His win at a wet Silverstone in 2008, constantly wiping his visor, was unforgettable. But he is now more likely to win a race through something like the canny stalking that forced Sebastian Vettel into a mistake in Montreal during June, or the phenomenal ability to make a set of old, hard tyres last until the chequered flag, as he did in Mexico City last month while also coping with damage to his car caused in a hectic opening lap. In Austin on Sunday, a week after the Mexico win, he used similar racecraft to turn fifth place on the grid into the second place that gave him the title.Only one significant statistic lies beyond his reach. Juan Manuel Fangio started 51 races, of which he won 24. Hamilton’s annual schedule features far more races than the great Argentinian had to face – more than 20, to the six or seven of the 1950s – with a much higher general level of competition. Which is not to say Hamilton is a greater driver than the man who provided the sport with its yardstick for almost half a century, simply that he faces a stronger and more consistent challenge from his rivals.In terms of race wins over those 13 seasons, he has outscored his various teammates – Alonso, Heikki Kovalainen, Jenson Button, Nico Rosberg and Valtteri Bottas – by 83 to 42. Only in 2013, when Rosberg took two victories to Hamilton’s one, has a teammate outscored him over a season. But that was the Englishman’s first year after moving to Mercedes, where the German had been ensconced for the preceding three seasons. And even in 2016, when Rosberg became the only teammate to beat Hamilton to a world championship, Lewis outscored him 109 in race wins.He is right to feel the outright dislike he provokes among some Formula One fans and other members of the public is rooted in a form of racism. Why else would the first mixed-race champion be sneered at for his jewellery, his braids and tattoos, his liking for hip-hop and catwalk fashion? Why else would he be criticised for leaving the country to avoid tax when earlier British heroes such as Jim Clark, Jackie Stewart, Damon Hill and Jenson Button did the same without incurring an ounce of disapproval? And when he talks about wanting to make his life carbon-neutral, he is accused of hypocrisy by people who take their kids a mile to school in an SUV, drive diesel trucks for a living or jet off for winter holidays in the Caribbean.Other factors may have affected his general popularity. Formula One is no longer broadcast live on free-to-air TV, while the complexity of the modern regulations makes the races hard for all but aficionados to follow. More profoundly, the climate emergency raises big questions about the future of motor sport as the gaudy symbol of a world running on fossil fuel. Over the next two or three years Hamilton may draw level with and even surpass Michael Schumacher’s record of seven world titles, and he would certainly deserve it. But he could also be the last of his kind."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/047d8cc65b6aa10df54d4130aad5ae8b3596c5a8/1164_1662_3282_1969/master/3282.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=484aa1bc16b5832b5921808d106c37c2","title":"rugbyx rugby league union o2 london","story":"The new five-a-side rugby format captured a new audience when it debuted at the O2 Arena in LondonBy Gavin Willacy for No Helmets RequiredIt wasn’t rugby union and it wasn’t rugby league. It was indoors, it was five-a-side, it was strange and it was different. But RugbyX, which made its debut in London last week, was definitely rugby. Whether it’s here to stay or not remains to be seen.It had plenty of merits. More than 16,000 spectators turned up to the O2 Arena over afternoon and evening sessions on Tuesday and most of them seemed to enjoy themselves. They may not have seen the future of rugby but they did see tremendously talented players from around the world showing off some outlandish skills, all presented in the most modern way: with a booming soundtrack, darkness, spotlights, fire-shooters, the whole works.The game itself is like a warm-up at rugby training, played across the width of a 4G pitch. “It’s similar to just a game of tip, touch rugby just with the contact,” said Ireland youngster Sean Cregan, who scored in both the semi-final and final.” The general proportions and relationship between people and space seemed about right, much better than sevens on a full-size pitch, less space than nines. Most of the law changes made it a generic, simpler game: uncontested “fed” scrums, tap restarts with the defensive line back ten metres, no kicking to touch.At it’s worst it looked like a bad basketball game: one team attacks and scores, then the other do the same. At it’s best, it was entertaining and enjoyable. Some of the best contests came in the women’s matches, which had far more arm-wrestle than many of the more clinical men’s games. The women’s teams had to work harder for tries, going through multiple phases and tackles – partly because of their less sharp skill sets.“From a coaching perspective it’s a small-sided game,” said USA coach Mike Friday. “It’s not rugby in the purest sense. The atmosphere and fast-moving nature has appeal and there’s lots of great moments within a game. I don’t know where it could sit in the rugby landscape. It’s never going to compete with sevens or 15s.”Friday suggested it was more like Masters Football or darts, and the O2’s presentation was heavily influenced by those events and the ATP Finals tennis. “It could work as a promotion tool. There’s certainly a gap in the rugby market for this kind of razzmatazz: a fun event, a fast-moving game which would appeal to the younger generation in the afternoon and the corporates and city boys in the evening. Then it’s how you attract the stars and convince coaches to release players to participate.”The players built most like basketball players fared the best. Ireland’s Cormac Izuchukwu – a tall teenager from Dublin – caught the eye throughout with five tries and some devastating runs. “It’s much tighter than sevens, so it suits guys like me,” said Izuchukwu. “I’m better when I get into contact and break out, especially when guys are cover tackling or lunging. I can step and spin out, and the players here are good at sucking in players so I get space on the other side.”Ireland, still in contention for a place at next year’s Olympics, were the surprise package. Former Munster youngster Greg O’Shea, better known for winning Love Island this summer (apparently) scored the third try in the semi-final and the second to get Ireland back into contention in the final. “Summer was great, but this is amazing,” he said – to some isolated high-pitched screams fro the crowd.Valuable skills included the ability to accelerate from an almost standing start, change direction, ideally sending three defenders heading off in the wrong direction like Benny Hill, leaving the field open. Sucking players into midfield and firing a cutout pass out wide was also key. Replacing the whole team halfway through the game, and every player after a sprint, became commonplace.The one-v-one shootouts after a draw were fun: 15 seconds to score and a point for a try or a tackle, first to three wins. It’s new and complicated enough to spoil the moment for the England women’s team: they didn’t realise they had won the final until quite a few seconds later, which was a shame.With no half time, the 10-minute games flew by, leaving us older spectators bewildered. Despite marketers telling us everything needs to be quicker and shorter, sport needs time to breathe. Football takes nearly two hours to complete with the ball only in play for about an hour – and it seems to be quite popular. I also don’t recall any player celebrate scoring a try. There were few smiles or clenched fists. They just legged it back 10 metres into the defensive line. With few one-on-one collisions there were noticeably few stoppages for injuries, either.Not many spectators would have recognised more than a handful of players. It was bizarre that there were no programmes, team sheets, announcements or even line-ups on the big screen, as if organisers wanted to keep secret who was playing.The considerable marketing budget – with adverts around London and broadcast on ITV – seemed to pay idends. With many schools on half-term, kids and women dominated the crowd in the afternoon. The atmosphere was rather different in the evening session, when groups of blokes swarmed to the O2 for a beer-fuelled rugby fix after work in the city.Folk dribbling into the arena for the evening kick-off time advertised on Twitter will have missed England men altogether. By then Swing Low had been silenced by Argentina scoring at will. They ran in 11 tries in 10 minutes, the first 10 of which were scored by 10 different players – in a 55-15 annihilation.After a high quality semi-final, the compere brought on Rob Vickerman to explain to the crowd a controversial decision which had seen Argentina beat France after the hooter. The final was rather an anti-climax as the Pumas beat Ireland 25-15 to muted applause and a mass, rushed exodus.The format would suit rugby league teams, who would only have to learn the specific tactics at the breakdown. Few attacks got as far as six phases. Just like the World Cup Nines, no one knows whether, where or when there will be another Rugby X. The promoters are talking about taking the concept around the world. They should approach Super League and the NRL. I could see five-figure crowds packing arenas in Manchester or Leeds, Sydney or Brisbane to watch pre-season or post-season events featuring the biggest club sides. Maybe that’s something Ben Ryan and the promoters should consider if Rugby X is here to stay.Follow No Helmets Required on Twitter and Facebook"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/63c7df4ecb0fb094f812a9124fe8e5972c584e80/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=83af77234ed551488a6f850cf0ff0e09","title":"share a tip on cosy places to stay in the uk in winter to win a 200 hotel voucher","story":"Towns and country can be magical in winter but to fully enjoy the atmosphere a cosy place to stay is essential.

She becomes embroiled in a deeper mystery involving her explorer uncle Asriel, his discovery of elementary particles known as Dust and possible parallel worlds that the all-controlling Magisterium wants to keep hidden. From there arise questions about the value of organised religion, the corruptibility of authority, the ambiguity of truth, what we mean by souls (embodied by the daemons all characters have, who represent their inner essences) and other such moral and theological considerations.Jack Thorne, the writer of acclaimed work from the This Is England series (with Shane Meadows) to National Treasure and most recently The Accident, is the man in charge of adapting Pullman’s magnum opus for the small screen. This series covers the first book, Northern Lights, and a second one, covering The Subtle Knife, has been commissioned. There is time and space to do them justice and the first episode, in all its steampunkish glory, gave every sign that the potential is to be realised. We begin with Lyra – a fierce, intelligent performance by 14-year-old Dafne Keen – being delivered for safekeeping to Jordan College by Lord Asriel (James McAvoy), invoking the principle of “scholastic sanctuary”. It’s a phrase that encapsulates so much of what drives the first part of the story, and is a sure sign to fans that they can relax and enjoy what’s to come.The opening episode covers the abduction of Gyptian child Billy and his people setting off up the river to find him, the master of Jordan’s attempts to poison Lord Asriel, Lyra’s discovery of Dust, her (re-) abandonment by Asriel, her acquisition of the all-important alethiometer, the arrival of Mrs Coulter (a fantastically unsettling Ruth Wilson) into her life and Lyra’s acceptance of the offer to become her assistant. She and Coulter board an airship and begin their journey to London, where her new friend promises to locate the missing Roger. Meanwhile, the Magisterium, its emissaries and its powers thrum in the background.Whatever flaws may develop as the eight episodes unfold, the show has vehemently eschewed repeating those of the dismal 2007 film, which (after much supposed studio interference) excised most of the questioning of the church and other such tricky subjects that don’t traditionally play well in the US. Despite the new series being a BBC co-production with HBO, it looks so far as though these ideas will not be compromised this time round.So much so, in fact, that there have been concerns raised that this is too dark to be suitable for children. But children will take from the material whatever they are ready for – be it insights into the convoluted heart of man, or delighted fascination at the idea of having a talking animal to accompany you wherever you go.And, just occasionally, the material will ready them for something else. That is what books – and prestige TV dramas – are for. Especially in a world where notions of fact, heresy, truth and who gets to define and censor them all need to be interrogated more urgently than most of Pullman’s young readers yet know."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a29d16944b2611f9c161c06020f9a4e88cc72084/116_0_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fddff36c9022b4d3cd57df3fd26adc05","title":"eleven year old me was very very happy you review his dark materials","story":"The long–awaited adaptation of Philip Pullman’s hit fantasy novel aired last night. But was it a magical smash – or a clunky mess? Here are your reviews• His Dark Materials review – a riveting realisation of Philip Pullman’s magicI can only recollect the books vaguely as I read them over 15 years ago, but the first episode brought back the feeling of reading them, which is the highest praise I can give. Well done to all involved – I am genuinely excited for the rest. TKStokerI can understand why Philip Pullman is so enthusiastic about this adaptation. This first episode set the scene for me, remarkably similarly to how the book did. To some who don’t know the books, this may seem a slow start but stick with it, it’s about to take off and then it won’t stop. funky_rascalI was incredibly nervous about this when they announced it, and only cautiously optimistic when the trailer aired. The books were honestly life-changing for me growing up, and after the godawful 2007 film I’d concluded the story was basically unfilmable. Looks like I was wrong! I didn’t think the first episode was perfect, but they got much more right than wrong. Dafne Keen, James McAvoy and Ruth Wilson are all superbly cast, and I thought they handled Roger’s story perfectly. nineteeneightythreeClunky expositionary dialogue can be forgiven due to the nature of the extraordinary fictional world being created, but there was some terrible acting – and as for that music … Just for once could a BBC drama allow its viewers to think for themselves? No way was this a five-star adaptation. SaintVespaluusNear perfect. I was particularly impressed with how they showed Lyra’s delivery to Oxford, Asriel’s explorations and other short, informative and well written scenes. They added background and context without too much exposition or going the whole Peter Jackson’s The Hobbit route of hours of extra historical detail. I loved the film version but this was so, so much better. I only hope that the team behind this complete the trilogy, as the greatest disappointment in the film was that the plug was pulled on the project. skausmausIf the rest of this series continues in this fashion, it could easily be the best adaptation of any book ever. PauliesonneI thought it was incredible. My only slight criticism was lots of scenes where you couldn’t see the character’s daemon – they are such an important part of the books and the choice of animal always fitting to personality, and Pullman always made a point of telling you about every character’s daemon when first introducing them. Felt a bit like the BBC were skimping on costs! But otherwise, completely brilliant and I will be so happy if it finally gets the wider audience and appreciation it deserves. OrchidaWhile I admired Pullman’s obvious intellectual clarity and breadth of vision, I did struggle to complete the books. The imaginative scope was undeniably breathtaking, but the prose I found jarringly clunky at times, the storyline sometimes overwrought. Strangely, I feel the same about this BBC production. Scrupulous detailing and high production values notwithstanding, the dialogue and delivery seems stilted and stagey, which makes the narrative experience again a bit uninvolving and less than the sum of its aspirational parts. I’ll continue to watch, but I fear that for me it will be reliving a less than exhilarating experience. styxanstanesI’ve just watched it on the iPlayer and enjoyed it thoroughly. I did try reading one of the trilogy (presumably the first) some years ago but couldn’t really get into it – this treatment, however, is excellent and I’m sure I’ll be there for the whole thing. Of course, it’s meant for children but I suppose I’ll cope, somehow, despite ‘celebrating’ my 80th birthday in January. geoff1940I was 11 when the first book came out and honestly it was life changing. Had always enjoyed reading but this was challenging and immersive – I’d never read anything like it before. It set me on a path to reading so many more interesting and varied texts and even inspired me to study English at university. I even became known at the local book shop for hounding them for the release date of the second and third books, which ended up landing me a Saturday job there when I was 15. You get the picture ... I thought tonight’s programme was just amazing and 11-year-old me was very, very happy to be transported back to Lyra’s world.

Whether it’s the clothes you wear or the way you cook, the coffee beans you grind or the bed linen you choose for your home, it’s all carefully thought out and assembled. But you don’t have to be from Paris to buy into the fantasy – just pay a visit to one of these uniquely Parisian stores next time you’re in town …For curated fashionSet up a few years ago by young designer Morgane Sézalory, who wanted to do things differently and start as an online-only fashion label with no shops, Sézane has since grown, with 1.3m followers on Instagram, but still operates in the same innovative way. There is now a lovely appartement in the heart of Paris where you can try on clothes, shoes, accessories and jewels, and a conciergerie where you can order them online. Committed to sustainable fashion, the label’s materials are all sourced, and everything is mostly made, in Europe. Delivery is ace and extra reliable. The style is effortlessly chic.An alternative to Sézane is the equally sustainable and organic fashion label, Ekyog.For bags of styleDominique Picquier is a Parisian woman with fizzing ideas and natural chic. An artist, she started drawing designs for fabric and wallpapers for others before setting up her own fabric label and shop and acquiring a small leather factory in the south of France, so she could control all the different stages of the production. The result is great quality and products that last. Her bags have thus become a must-have. My favourite is the pochette style in the mimosa pattern (from €59).For sustainable coolEco-friendly chic finds an ideal home in Paris, where some French habits have been championing sustainability for decades. Take, for instance, the Parisian love for secondhand vintage: Paris has been a leader since it created flea markets in the 1890s. And this includes furniture, jewels, paintings, ceramics and more. For a time-travelling experience, and the opportunity to pick up vintage beauties at smart prices, head towards the north of Paris, to Saint-Ouen. My favourite part is Marché Biron, but you can also pick up great one-off pieces from the other existing 15 markets. Last time there, we spotted Pete Doherty, Vanessa Paradis and Léa Seydoux.Marché Biron, 85 Rue des Rosiers, 93400 Saint-Ouen. Saturday to Monday only. marcheauxpuces-saintouenFor haute homewareA recent trend in Paris has been the conversion of former warehouses or factories into galleries and shops. Merci, standing halfway between République and Bastille, is a grand magasin whose range of products, from knitted clothes to kitchenware, bed linens and stationery, have been carefully curated by Merci’s army of scouts travelling the world for the best of independent designers. Their cafe, sheltered in their secondhand bookshop, offers a nice place for a quick rest.Paris museums’ shops can sometimes offer the ultimate stylish experience with products as carefully curated as the exhibitions. One of my favourites is the Musées des Arts Décoratifs’ boutique, near the Louvre, where you will find the latest French design in glassware, ceramics, jewels and stationery.For keen foodiesLast time you walked around Les Halles, right in the heart of Paris, you may have wondered why there were so many kitchen utensil shops. Les Halles was, as writer Émile Zola called it in the 1870s, “the belly of Paris”: a 24-hour-a-day market where all the food products of France converged to be sold to chefs and restaurants. This marvel of 1860s architecture by Victor Baltard – which has provided the setting for scenes in many novels, such as James Baldwin’s Giovanni’s Room – was demolished in 1971, but many restaurants have remained, some still open day and night, as well as those famous kitchen shops. Two, almost facing each other, at the beginning of Rue Montmartre, are worth a detour. Mora was founded in 1814, and La Bovida in 1921. Feel like a pro and step inside the two temples of cooking to discover devices you never thought existed.For coffee connoisseursYou don’t think chic applies to coffee? Head straight to Café Vernet, founded in 1880, and you’ll change your mind. The small café, recently restored to its belle époque cosiness, is a hidden gem and a shelter after an exhausting day of shopping. You’ll be able to sip your coffee from a selection of around 50 different varieties and house blends and, more importantly, you may buy it in whole beans or pre-ground. Try the Grand Pavois, created in 1921 by Auguste Vernet: not too strong, it has rose notes (8€ for 250g). Vernet is also well-known for its homemade fruits confits, candied fruits, which usually get passersby to stop in their tracks.Ready to hit the shops?

More adventurous types will take to the left bank’s Parc André Citroën, where you can float 150 metres up beneath a helium-filled balloon.Get up close with Paris’s avant gardeSurrealists may have dominated Montparnasse in the 1920s – Marcel Duchamp, Salvador Dalí and Man Ray were regulars at its salons and cafes – but Russian émigré Ossip Zadkine still hadn’t let cubism go. His tranquil studio and garden on the Rue d’Assas brim with angular, African-inspired sculptures in red wood, plaster, stone and clay. The Musée Zadkine is one of several well-preserved former artists’ studios and homes that hark back to yesteryear Paris. Just around the corner, the Musée Bourdelle is both homely atelier and sprawling art museum, while the Fondation Giacometti houses a reconstruction of his storied studio and an exhibition of some of his greatest works, including the Grande tête mince. Up in Pigalle, the cavernous top levels of the Musée National Gustave Moreau shouldn’t be missed, and the same goes for the Musée de la Vie Romantique, a quaint villa built by Dutch painter Ary Scheffer that’s now a museum dedicated to the Romantic era.Reclaim the city’s abandoned railwaysAbandoned to nature since 1934 and encircling pretty much the whole city, La Petite Ceinture railway network will probably never run again (though, some think it should). These days, the public parts of the 12-mile route – in the 12th, 13th, 15th, 16th and 20th arrondissements – make for an unexpectedly lush urban ramble. One former station in the north has been converted into urban farm and eco-friendly restaurant La Recyclerie, and another’s become Le Hasard Ludique, a multipurpose arts space that hosts everything from tango lessons to drag nights. Train stations, it seems, are Paris’s new cool: two recent openings – experimental music venue La Station Gare des Mines and jazz club La Gare – put on the city’s edgiest nights out.Duck into an old-world arcadeShould it sheet down – which, frankly, isn’t all that unlikely – the city’s hidden network of passages couverts make for the ideal atmospheric escape. You could spend days browsing these “covered passages”, with their quaint boutiques and tasteful teahouses. Snaking through the Grands Boulevards area and down towards the Louvre, the Passage des Panoramas is best for lunch, Passage Verdeau for antiques (and waxworks at the Musée Grévin), and Galerie Vivienne for high-end fashion. Don’t miss Galerie Vivienne’s gorgeous glass roof and beautiful mosaicked floors. And when you’re done, head to the Rue des Lombards for live jazz at one of the strip’s handful of legendary clubs, such as the Baiser Salé, the Duc des Lombards or SunsetSunside.Take the plunge at a scenic swimming spotYou might not be able to swim in the Seine, but you can swim on it. Moored next to the imposing Bibliothèque François Mitterrand in the south-east, the Piscine Joséphine Baker is a floating pool complete with saunas, hammams, a jacuzzi, and to-die-for Seine views, preserved in winter by a sliding glass roof. Built in the 1920s, the Butte-aux-Cailles swimming pool is another option for those looking to go for a dip in the great outdoors (there’s an indoor pool and two outdoor pools). And don’t worry about getting chilly the water is a balmy 28C.Pay tribute to the city’s illustrious deadIf you haven’t already been on a teenage pilgrimage to pay Jim Morrison and Oscar Wilde your respects, then it’s well worth spending a day trying to locate them in the 44-hectare Cimetière du Père Lachaise. Molière, Honoré de Balzac, Marcel Proust, Colette, Édith Piaf: it’s easy to stumble upon recognisable names here. Take a map, or don’t – this place lends itself to an aimless gander. Less likely to throng with tour groups are the low-key Cimetière de Montmartre (Alexandre Dumas, Edgar Degas, François Truffaut) and Cimetière de Montparnasse (Charles Baudelaire, Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir). Serge Gainsbourg is buried in the latter, but his former home by the Seine is where his fans gather en masse. For some light relief, the Deyrolle is an eccentric taxidermy museum and shop where you’ll find curiosities of a very different sort, while the Musée des Arts Forains feels like a gaudy graveyard of disused funfair rides.Discover Paris with easyJet flights from 10 different UK airports.

It has also built military infrastructure on a number of contested islands within the sea, deployed warships, and rammed fishing vessels.But the areas asserted by Beijing to belong to China are also variously claimed by Vietnam, Taiwan, Malaysia, Brunei, the Philippines and Japan.In 2016, the Philippines took its dispute to the permanent court of arbitration in The Hague, which sided with the Philippines, saying there was no legal or historical basis for China’s claim.However, China has this week said it is “ready to work” with Asean nations on a code of conduct for the South China Sea.The 10-member Asean has been mired in talks for years over a code for the waters, but the agreement, scheduled to be finalised in 2021, will lay out conduct guidelines for the sea along with mechanisms for resolving conflicts and contested claims.On Sunday, China’s premier, Li Keqiang, described the first reading of the document – a chance for all members to comment on the draft terms – as “a very important landmark”.“We stand ready to work with Asean countries building on the existing foundation and the basis to strive for new progress” on the guidelines, he said.He said China wanted to “maintain and uphold long-term peace and stability in the South China Sea”.At a time when China is seen as trying to align itself more closely with south-east Asian nations, the US is making its own overtures.O’Brien read a message from Trump inviting Asean leaders to “join me in the United States for a special summit, meeting at a time of mutual convenience in the first quarter of 2020”.But pointedly, it was O’Brien who was representing the US in Bangkok, as Asean leaders met, and then the expanded grouping of the East Asia Summit. The Trump administration has consistently downgraded the Asean multilaterals, sending the vice-president, Mike Pence, last year and O’Brien this year.But resistance from an Indian government protectionist by instinct – in particular concerned about a flood of cheap mass-produced Chinese goods hurting small businesses in its economy, and the impact of free agricultural trade on the country’s tens of millions of small-scale farmers – appears to have cruelled hopes of finalising the pact this year.Instead, the deal is likely to be completed in February next year, and may end up proceeding without India.China is keen for the RCEP to be brought into force, seeing it as a counterweight to its debilitating tariff war with the US.Australia is a not a member of Asean, but is a participant in the expanded East Asia Summit grouping. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, said Australia was an unalloyed supporter of the proposed new free trade deal.“The integration of the economy of the Indo Pacific is incredibly important for the prosperity of the region, but also its security … This is… showing a clear way forward that we see businesses in this region all dealing with each other in a much more free and open commercial environment.”Morrison met with the Chinese premier on the sidelines of the conference, and, while acknowledging significant strains in Australia’s relationship with Beijing, said he was anxious that disagreements “don’t overtake or overwhelm the rest of the relationship”.“There is an honest acknowledgement … that we are two very different countries. We are a liberal democracy. They are a Communist party state. We are not seeking to adopt their system and they are not seeking to adopt ours and so there is an honesty about understanding the differences between those two outlooks.“There was, I think, a maturity in the discussion yesterday that understood the nature of our two countries and where the benefits are by working close together on the things we agree on, understanding the areas where we have a difference of view.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a96877458e2a4397add3887536ef80179e86b7ad/0_308_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8226345ef8d6912827f44515abed32cf","title":"delhi residents engulfed in pollution blame authorities for inaction","story":"Public health emergency declared after air pollution levels go off the charts It was meant to be a ceremony to bring good health and prosperity. But the thousands of women who gathered in the waters of Delhi’s Yamuna River on the city’s most polluted day in three years, to mark the ancient Hindu festival of Chhath Puja, instead had to immerse themselves in the thick toxic waste, while inhaling air so thick with smog that it went off the pollution charts.Sunita Devi, 42, was among those who offered prayers as she stood in the toxic foam of the Yamuna, so thick and frothy from industrial and domestic pollution it made the water resemble a putrid bubble bath. The irony that this was a ritual meant to give thanks to the sun god for sustaining life on earth was not lost on her.“I stood for an hour in the water to offer prayers but it was very oily, dirty and had a bad smell,” said Devi. “According to the ritual we are supposed to bathe in the water but I could not bring myself to do it fully, though my friends took a full dip even with the smell. My legs were itching after a while and I had to go home and take a bath.”Living in the world’s most polluted city has taken a toll on almost every one of its 20 million citizens, especially since the Hindu festival of Diwali, which prompted a severe deterioration in air quality. As the air pollution levels reached catastrophic levels – almost 10 times above the healthy limit on the weekend – a public health emergency was declared and has remained in place for the past five days. The streets have emptied, schools remained closed and many did not go into work on Monday morning as the air quality index remained stubbornly in the category of “severe”.Monday also saw the temporary introduction of a scheme, which ran previously in 2016, where cars with odd and even number plates can only drive on alternate days, which authorities say will take 1.2m cars off Delhi’s roads each day. However, most in the city were highly sceptical about the plan, which will only be in place for two weeks.“They did this scheme twice before and it is pointless,” said Amit, a driver. “I am not supposed to be taking my car out today but I am just taking the back roads and short cuts to avoid the traffic officers. All the other drivers I know are doing the same. Yes pollution is a terrible problem, I have had an awful chest infection for the past two days because of it, but this temporary scheme is not going to change anything. We need real action from the government.”The sentiment was exemplified by politician Vijay Goel, senior leader of the ruling Bharatiya Janata party (BJP), who chose to defy the rules and took his car with an odd number plate out for a drive.In a city such as Delhi, where poverty and homelessness is rife and millions make their living on the sides of the roads, not all had the option of taking shelter in homes or driving cars equipped with air purifiers.At his stall selling chickpeas on the roadside of Kamla Nagar, north Delhi, Dinesh Raj said both his health and his business was suffering. “I generally earn around 400 to 500 rupees per day but after the bad pollution I have only sold three plates and it’s already lunchtime,” Raj said, rubbing his eyes which he complained were burning.“People are not coming out of their houses anymore, only those like me who cannot afford to stay indoors are here. And even though I cover it up, people are afraid to eat my food because they think the bad air is affecting it. If the government doesn’t do something to clean up the air, I am going to have to go back to my village in Bihar.”The lacklustre and uncoordinated response to the crisis from both the federal government and state governments of Delhi, and neighbouring Punjab and Haryana where the burning of the crop stubble has been a key contributor to Delhi’s thick toxic smog, has been a source of infuriation and anger for the city’s residents. Navdha Malhotra, campaigns director for Purpose, a social impact agency who run a mobilisation campaign called Help Delhi Breathe, spoke of her anger that the state governments were “all passing the buck and blaming each other while we have to live in this disgusting layer of smog.”As Delhi residents woke on the weekend to smog so brown and thick that it was impossible to see more than a few feet ahead, India’s health minister Harsh Vardhan tweeted that a good solution to offsetting its harmful impact was to eat carrots. Sunil Bharala, minister for the state of Utter Pradesh, meanwhile, defended the practice of crop burning by farmers, declaring it a “natural system”.While Delhi’s chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has been publicly candid about the problem, calling the current pollution crisis unbearable, he has also been criticised for passing the blame for the problem on to adjacent states.While firecrackers were banned and construction has been halted in Delhi since the state of emergency was declared on Friday, in reality these rules have barely been enforced. On Monday, the supreme court judges slammed all responsible authorities for failing to tackle pollution in the capital, saying that people had been “left to die”.“No one is safe even inside homes. It is atrocious,” they added.“First, as a citizen of Delhi who has lived here all my life, this is absolutely disgraceful,” said supreme court judge Indu Malhotra.“The Delhi government is very progressive in terms of policies on paper but there is zero implementation and no political will on this issue. People are angry and mobilising, particularly parents who now feel like they can’t let their children go outside, but overall civic action here is also pretty disgraceful. I have seen citizens in Delhi bursting firecrackers while wearing masks.”Malhotra condemned the Board for Control of Cricket in India (BCCI) for allowing a match against Bangladesh to go ahead in Delhi when the pollution levels were off the charts. “We should not be normalising these conditions by doing things like hosting a cricket match,” she said. “It is deathly, and when pollution gets that bad, the whole city should be shutting down. Only then will politicians take this seriously.”An indication of both the increasing obvious severity of the pollution, but also increased public awareness about its harmful impact on health, has been masks, which are now visible on the faces of people all over the streets of Delhi. In a mark of the growing public anger in some quarters, a citizens protest is also planned at Indian Gate on Tuesday evening to decry the lack of action by authorities.But for many there has been no hiding from the thick poisonous smog. Kushal Malik, a Delhi traffic police officer, had spent the past 12 hours on duty on one of city’s busiest and most polluted roads, with no choice but to inhale the fumes. “I have constant throat irritation, headache and a burning sensation in my eyes,” he said. “The government has provided us with masks but they are not effective for pollution levels this bad. It is not good enough.”Additional reporting by Kakoli Bhattacharya"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd9fd925b36f4eaece6dbfe14de1c2963bc26f5f/0_161_5458_3275/master/5458.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=469d550c214d9474bb4d21fcbaa797b4","title":"it is not hopeless chinas metoo movement finally sees legal victories","story":"Despite suspicion from authorities about grassroots activism, the courts and policymakers are starting to respond Liu Li has spent the past year fighting what many said would be a losing battle. Inspired by a flood of MeToo accounts that emerged in China, last year she brought a lawsuit against her former boss, a prominent and award-winning social worker, whom she claimed sexually harassed her four years ago.Over the course of proceedings, Liu Li, who uses an alias, saw her life scrutinised inside and outside the court. The defence argued that online posts she made about the play the Vagina Monologues suggested she was “open” to sexual advances. Friends and acquaintances, not realising Liu Li was involved, said they thought the claimant was a fame-hungry liar.But she carried on, helped by women’s advocacy groups and a lawyer. Then, on 11 July, a court in Chengdu ruled in her favour and ordered her former boss to publicly apologise. The win, while modest, is one of the first legal victories for China’s MeToo movement, which emerged last year as a dozen women publicly accused men in media, academia, the non-profit world, the tech sector and elsewhere of sexual assault and harassment.Earlier this month, another man was sentenced to six months in prison for molesting a woman and a minor on a subway in Shanghai, marking the first time someone has been criminally punished for sexual harassment on public transport in the city.“The movement really needs this right now,” said Lu Pin, a Chinese activist, based in New York.Liu Li’s case especially offers a much-needed injection of hope into a movement that has struggled recently under the weight of censorship, counter lawsuits and the detention of activists.“We were feeling our way in the dark, with no light ahead that we could see. You spend so much energy for a result that you can’t imagine,” Liu Li told local media after the court ruling. “Now, I want to tell even more people about this win. I want to tell them: this is definitely hard, but it is not hopeless.”Liu Li’s former boss, Liu Meng, said in a statement on Wechat in August last year, after Liu Li went public with her allegations, that the information online was “not true”. Calls to Liu Meng and his organisation were not returned and he did not respond to requests for comment. His lawyer has told Chinese media he plans to appeal and countersue Liu Li for defamation.In China where authorities regard grassroots activism with suspicion, the MeToo movement has frequently been censored. Authorities have shut down feminist social media accounts and banned search phrases related to MeToo while activists have been detained. Today, the movement is often referred to in Chinese as Mi Tu, or “rice bunny”, a homonym once used to get around censorship of the term.Still, authorities appear to be paying attention. Harassment and gender discrimination are illegal in China, but in December last year the country’s highest court added sexual harassment to the formal list of grounds for civil litigation, making it easier for such cases to go ahead. The government is also drafting a law on sexual harassment that will further define its meaning and require employers to better protect employees.Advocates say the movement still has a long way to go. Of at least 12 cases reported last year, according to NGOmetoo, a monitoring group, none have made meaningful progress aside from Liu Li’s.One case is that of Huahua, one of the earliest to go public with allegations against a well-known charity founder and anti-discrimination activist. In July last year, Huahua, who is also using an alias, published a letter online accusing the man of raping her during a fundraiser in Beijing in 2015 when she was a volunteer. The activist apologised and stepped down from his role as head of his charity but later told Chinese media that the sex had been consensual.Facing the prospect of a long legal battle in civil court, Huahua has decided for now not to pursue the case. Still, she has taken inspiration from Liu Li’s case. “It’s definitely a big victory. I’m very encouraged.”“The victory of Liu Li is definitely a positive influence. It must have been very difficult for her,” she said, of Liu Li.In one of the most high-profile cases of last year, a woman known by her nickname Xianzi accused a prominent CCTV host of touching and kissing her in his makeup room when she was an intern. Her case has stalled and the host, who has denied the allegations, has countersued friends who helped publish her account last year.Even Liu Li’s case is only a partial win. She did not win compensation for mental duress, as her complaint alleged – evidence, critics say, that courts still treat the impacts of sexual assault too lightly. Her former boss’s only punishment from the court is a public apology. Still, advocates say Liu’s case is one step forward and that they are encouraged by other less tangible improvements. More victims are getting help from others – forming support groups and seeking legal advice. Another former colleague of Liu Li’s is also pursuing a case against the same manager.“I used to be desperate,” added Xianzi, who said she finds younger women are becoming bolder and less ashamed to talk about cases of assault or harassment than previous generations. “Now I’ve become more optimistic.”Lillian Yang and Jiahui Huang contributed additional reporting"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4071053.1572801914!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"monitoring of climate targets unsatisfactory audit finds","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGreen Party leader Eamon Ryan:  “For all the talk, for all the plans, emissions are rising, not falling.”  Photograph: Sam BoalRollingnews.ie The State’s system for monitoring whether Ireland is meeting key climate change targets is “unsatisfactory,” an internal Department of Communications and Climate Action audit has found. The audit found a “significant number” of failings with how progress on climate targets is recorded and reported to Government and senior department officials. “The arrangements in place in relation to the monitoring and oversight of the climate change targets within the department are unsatisfactory,” the audit concluded. Completed in November 2018, the department’s audit report was released to The  under the Freedom of Information Act. Ireland is set to fall short of European Union climate targets to reduce its carbon emissions by next year, and is also on course to miss significant 2030 targets. The strict targets include cutting greenhouse gas emissions, improving energy efficiency, and increasing production of renewable energy. Failure to meet the climate targets will result in heavy fines being levied against the country. The internal audit found Minister for Climate Action Richard Bruton “is not informed on a systematic basis of performance gaps” in department policies to hit climate targets. As a result the Minister was “unable to advise Government of the need for corrective action”, the audit said. There was “no procedural arrangement” for reporting progress on emissions targets to the department management board of senior civil servants. The audit found this posed a risk decisions made by the board “may not be informed by the most recent information”.Similarly, the audit found there was “no regular arrangement” for reporting progress on renewable energy targets to the management board. The internal audit ision found while data on progress was collected, it was only provided to the board once a year. OireachtasThere was also a lack of formal reporting on overall climate change targets to Government and the Oireachtas, the audit said. The Oireachtas was only updated on Ireland’s performance towards the set targets when Mr Bruton, or the department secretary general, appeared before parliamentary committees, or in response to parliamentary questions. The audit recommended the department set up a “cohesive structure for reporting to Government, where all relevant information regarding progress on respective targets can be presented regularly”.Commenting on the audit, Green Party leader Eamon Ryan said it was “very welcome that the department is recognising its own failings”. “That is critical because what the department were doing to date has been a lot of talk, with little action. What we need is to be monitoring what’s actually happening, rather than producing white papers or plans. For all the talk, for all the plans, emissions are rising, not falling.” In June, the Government launched an ambitious plan to significantly cut emissions on a sustained basis up to 2030, which included plans for increased carbon taxes, targets to push electric vehicle sales, and widespread retrofitting of homes. A department spokeswoman said a “central focus of the new plan is the establishment of the necessary governance arrangements to monitor and oversee progress towards meeting Ireland’s climate targets”.These included setting up a climate action delivery board, quarterly reporting to government on the plan’s progress, and introducing a Cabinet committee on the environment, the spokeswoman said."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"RT\u0026Eacute staff, politicians, and fellow broadcasters express sadness at deathJoanne Doherty says she \u0026lsquokept re-living\u0026rsquo the death of Garda Robbie McCallion in her headFirst episode of The Late Late Show aired on the 5th of July, 1962 with Byrne as its hostGarda\u0026iacute continuing to question a man (27) arrested shortly after alarm raisedSurvivors of historical institutional abuse celebrate ruling as a victory in BelfastHSE concerned about \u0026lsquoabsolute confidence\u0026rsquo test being invoked for other screeningsKenneth Donohoe and Darren Murphy objected to case going before Special Criminal CourtFounder of the Argentine navy has been celebrated in his home town of FoxfordReporting body says three deaths linked to paramilitaries in last 12 monthsINMO says University Hospital Galway is worst affected by overcrowdingUnion calls for better protection for workers after Halloween anti-social behaviourGarda\u0026iacute detained the man in his 20s after child is found with multiple injuries in BallynantyIrish Muslim Peace and Integration Council chair says involvement of Defence Forces is \u0026lsquoextraordinary\u0026rsquoYellow warning is in place until 9pm for Dublin, Kildare, Louth, Wicklow and MeathDublin Airport owner told McEvaddys failure to take up offer would hurt value in future dealsIncident at S\u0026eacuteamus Woulfe\u0026rsquos Clontarf residence \u0026lsquominor\u0026rsquo although family was upsetClimate expert \u0026lsquowould not go anywhere near\u0026rsquo many of capital\u0026rsquos coastal homes when buying"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4071060.1572872842!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"a new ireland 1 000 leading people call on varadkar to lead change","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            Ireland soccer player James McClean, also a signatory.

Ms McDonald said there was no contradiction in asking republicans to vote for a unionist. Photograph: David YoungPA Wire.Sinn Féin is to stand aside in three Northern constituencies in December’s general election and has urged its voters to back other candidates who support staying in the EU in order to help defeat the pro-Brexit DUP. The party will not run candidates in East Belfast, South Belfast or North Down, with Sinn Féin suggesting voters instead support Alliance party leader Naomi Long, Claire Hanna of the SDLP, and independent unionist Lady Sylvia Hermon. “The reality is we are asking people to come out and vote for those pro-remain candidates. We believe that is the right and progressive thing to do,” Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said. Speaking to reporters in Belfast on Monday, she said the “stakes are very high” in the December 12th election. “People have a fundamental choice to make - to vote for a positive, inclusive future or to turn their backs on that and to back candidates who have been the architects of Brexit and who have acted very, very deliberately against the democratic wishes of people here in the north and more fundamentally against the economic and social interests of citizens who live here,” she said. In North Down, Lady Sylvia defeated the DUP candidate Alex Easton with a narrow majority of about 1,200 in 2017. ContradictionMs McDonald said there was no contradiction in asking republicans to vote for a unionist. “It sits very comfortably with me to ask and invite voters to thoughtfully do the right thing,” she said.“And in this case it means defying hard Brexiteers, the likes of Nigel Dodds, the likes of the DUP candidates who have very, very recklessly acted against the interests of everybody.“Whether you call yourself a unionist or a nationalist, a republican or a loyalist, we actually have many, many interests in common.”The DUP’s Emma Little-Pengelly is defending a majority of 2,000 in South Belfast, with Mr Hanna considered a strong contender to take the seat. Her party, the SDLP, has also announced that it will not stand in East Belfast, North Belfast or North Down. “Our first priority is to elect pro-remain MPs to vote against Brexit and Boris Johnson but removing pro-Brexit MPs in Belfast is also critical,” the party said. The SDLP’s withdrawal from North Belfast strengthens the position of the Sinn Féin candidate John Finucane, the Lord Mayor of Belfast, who came within 2,000 votes of the DUP’s Nigel Dodds at the last election in 2017. StrengthenThe absence of SDLP and Sinn Féin candidates in East Belfast is intended to strengthen the position of Ms Long against the sitting MP, Gavin Robinson of the DUP. The Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) said on Sunday that it will not run a candidate in North Belfast. The party’s incoming leader, Steve Aiken, had previously said the UUP would field candidates in all 18 of the North’s constituencies. In a statement, Mr Aiken said the UUP “a party that believes first and foremost in the Union” and he could not “gift” the seat to Sinn Féin. A police investigation is underway after threats were made to the UUP, allegedly by loyalist paramilitaries, over its initial refusal to form an electoral pact. The DUP has said it will continue not to contest Fermanagh and South Tyrone constituency, where Sinn Féin’s Michelle Gildernew is the MP. Tom Elliott of the UUP, who won the seat in 2015 before losing it back in 2017, has not yet confirmed if he will stand in the constituency.

Prof Peter Thorne said Ireland had been lucky to “dodge a bullet” until now during major storm events – because they have struck during low or neap tides – but it was only a matter of time until the elements combined for a devastating surge. The Maynooth University academic, who was lead author on the fifth assessment report of the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and is aged 40, said he expected a major high tide flood event in his lifetime.In the capital this would mean water from Dublin Bay surging into the Liffey while it was in full flow from the Wicklow mountains. “The combination of water trying to escape and water being pushed up into the river means it will end up moving sideways,” he said. Mr Thorne said the Liffey would “over-top into the surrounding areas” resulting in major flooding in the city centre, while areas like Clontarf and south Dublin would also be badly hit. “There would be hundreds or thousands of properties basically – residential, commercial and government properties – that would be under water for a considerable length of time, with all the implications that that has.” The cost of the clean-up, he predicted, would run into billions of euro. Some of Dublin’s most iconic landmark buildings along the quays from Dublin Port to the Guinness brewery, including Custom House and the Four Courts, would be submerged, he told The . Very lucky“In our lifetime the sea level rises are not going to accelerate much more than it is now – it will be going up a centimetre a year at most globally,” he said. “But then you have the storm surges – and we have been lucky, frankly. We’ve been very lucky over recent decades that when those storm surges have hit they have been at low tide or neap tide. “It is only a matter of time before one hits at high tide, or even worse, spring high tide. Then it will be very, very catastrophic.”Predicting the timing is like “rolling the dice”. “It could be decades, it could happen next week or it could not happen within our lifetime,” he said. “I would expect to see a major event in my lifetime. Somewhere in Ireland I would expect a major sea level combining with storm surge having a large-scale impact,” he said.“It would take months to dry out the structure of properties flooded. Some may be so damaged they would end having to be destroyed and rebuilt. But mostly it would be matter for residents relocating for six to 12 months.”He cautioned against people buying property less than 10 metres above current sea levels in the capital as well as other major urban centres built on the coast, including Cork, Galway and Waterford. “If you are thinking of buying a property clearly don’t buy one near the sea level. If you have a property already that might be at risk, thinking of how to – at low cost – mitigate that risk . . . you can’t at this point, you are kind of in the lap of the gods.” Low-lying areasMr Thorne said he “wouldn’t go anywhere near” many of the expensive coastal homes in low-lying areas of Dublin. “If I was buying property today that I wanted to eventually leave to my children I would not be buying property probably within five to 10 metres of the sea level.” Residents in Clontarf who successfully argued for the lowering of a recently built flood defence sea wall, at a cost of half a million euro to Dublin City Council, to restore their view were of a “King Canute mindset”, said Mr Thorne, who is also director of the Irish Climate Analysis and Research Units group. “For some reason these residents feel they can hold back the waters,” he said. “At a national level we need to think about what areas we want to protect and to what level we want to protect them. “Clontarf is a case in point where the government quite rightly wanted to protect the citizens, and the citizens unfortunately decided their view was more valuable than protecting their properties.” Mr Thorne added: “I don’t think people see the risk very well. We are very poor as human beings at recognising and coping with risk. This is one example of that.” Finite pot of moneyResponding to the Government’s briefing last week updating the progress of its climate action plan, he said it faced “hard and difficult choices as to which properties and areas it decides to protect and which it doesn’t”. “There is only a finite pot of money, and there is only a finite amount of properties that can be protected.” The Government will have to decide this on a basis of where is strategically, economically and politically important to protect “and where to let go because you can’t protect everything, you can’t do everything”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4071981.1572882032!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"he shone a light on irish life higgins pays tribute to gay byrne","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGay Byrne has died at the age of 85, following a long illnessPresident Michael D Higgins has led tributes to the late broadcaster Gay Byrne, remarking upon his sense of justice, as well as his ability to challenge Irish society and shine a light on the dark sides of Irish life.“A man of great charisma, Gay Byrne was someone who exuded warmth and presence, who was possessed of effortless wit, charm and who had a flair for broadcasting,” said Mr Higgins.“This was combined with an innate gentleness as a person, professionalism and humour.“Through his work in radio and on television he challenged Irish society, and shone a light not only on the bright but also the dark sides of Irish life.“In doing so, he became one of the most familiar and distinctive voices of our times, helping shape our conscience, our self-image, and our idea of who we might be. Beyond compassion, which he had in abundance, he had a sense of what was just.”Taoiseach Leo Varadkar described Mr Byrne as “the most influential broadcaster in the history of the State”, as well as “a much-loved figure who changed Ireland for the better in so many ways”.“On radio and on television over so many decades ‘Uncle Gaybo’ provided a voice for all those who had been silenced or were afraid to speak up, and helped us confront things that needed to be changed.”RTÉ director-general Dee Forbes said everyone at the broadcaster was “greatly saddened” by the death of Mr Byrne.“Gay was an exceptional broadcaster whose unique and ground-breaking style contributed so much to the development of radio and television in this country,” she said.“Gay’s journalistic legacy is as colossal as the man himself – he not only defined generations, but he deftly arbitrated the growth and development of a nation. Ireland grew up under Gay Byrne, and we will never see his like again.”Master of his tradeBroadcaster and current Late Late Show host Ryan Tubridy described Byrne as a master of his trade.“It is with enormous and profound sadness that I heard of the passing of my friend and mentor, Gay Byrne,” he said. “He was the master, a once off and the likes of which we will never see again.“I watched him as a child, worked alongside him as a young man and he guided me as I grew older and I will forever be indebted to him. We in RTÉ have lost a friend, a family have lost a father and a husband, and the country has lost an icon.”Broadcaster Joe Duffy paid tribute to the influence Mr Byrne had on Irish life: “More so than any one inidual, Gay Byrne represented modern Ireland and through his daily broadcasting on radio and television he propelled this country and its people forward.”Séamus Dooley, Irish Secretary of the National Union of Journalists, said Mr Byrne was “the father of public-service broadcasting in Ireland”.“A broadcaster of courage, vision and boundless energy Gay Byrne helped shape modern Ireland and used his talents to help create a more caring, compassionate and inclusive society,” he said.“He was often infuriating, annoying and provocative but Gay was never dull and in his career he brought light, laughter and humanity to television and radio debates.”Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin acknowledged Byrne’s role as chairman of the Road Safety Authority as well as the part he played as a broadcaster.“Gay Byrne has left an indelible mark, not only on Irish broadcasting, but on Irish society as a whole,” he said.“His intellect and emotional intelligence was unparalleled and his ability to sensitively approach delicate and sometimes controversial issues set him apart from other presenters.“Gay was a true public servant and accepted the chairmanship of the Road Safety Authority in 2006.“This decision gave the organisation a huge boost and Gay became the face and voice of many campaigns, which no doubt saved the lives of pedestrians, motorcyclists and drivers across the country.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4071179.1572812420!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"open letter began with recurring theme around denial of rights in north","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tProf  Colin Harvey is one of more than 1,000 signatures on an open letter to Taoiseach  Leo Varadkar. Photograph:  Laura DavisonPacemaker PressIn 2017, Niall Murphy found himself having the same conversation over and over again. There was a “recurring theme” around the denial of rights in the North – “the very explicit frustrations within the nationalist community in terms of how politics was being conducted”.“It was what I was hearing in the school car park when I was dropping my children at school, it was what I was hearing in court before the judge came out, it was what I was hearing at the sideline of a football pitch.”One of Belfast’s best-known solicitors, he did what solicitors do – he wrote a letter. That first communication, in December 2017, was an open letter in the Irish News from 200 Northern nationalists to the Taoiseach urging him to “give voice” to concerns around Brexit, the collapse of powersharing at Stormont and the undermining of rights. The group, Ireland’s Future, write again in today’s . In a letter signed by more than 1,000 people – two-thirds in the Republic of Ireland – they appeal to Taoiseach Leo Varadkar to begin a conversation “about our shared future on the island of Ireland”. “The Government needs to plan for this,” they write. Irish diasporaThe signatures are drawn from all sections of civic society, North and South, and among the Irish diaspora. Deliberately, there are no elected political representatives. Murphy stresses that the group is not party political, nor nationalist, and instead is a coalition of iniduals who share a concern about rights – not least those of Irish citizens in the North post-Brexit – and the conversation around constitutional change on this island. About 20 people are at the core of Ireland’s Future while Murphy is the spokesman, they include Gerry Carlile, Conor Patterson, Anna McHugh, Brian Feeney, Fachtna Ó Ceallaigh, Martina Devlin, Niall Keenan, Brian Loughran, Louise Clarke, Prof Colin Harvey, Tony Shivers, Frances Black, Paddy Cullivan, Patricia Mac Bride, Maighréad Ní Chonghaile, Chris Donnelly, Lorcán Collins and Brendan Mulgrew. “We think, respectfully,” says Murphy, “that this correspondence and the signatories to it represent a holistic overview of an island’s view that we need to talk. “What’s wrong with conversation, what’s wrong with planning, what’s wrong with having a plan? The most appropriate way to do that is through a Citizens’Assembly.” BrexitThe context to this is, of course, Brexit. It has “changed everything”, the letter states among the consequences are that the “discussion about the reunification of Ireland has moved centre stage”. Any Border poll should not be the “knee jerk that was the Brexit referendum”, stresses Murphy. Instead they want “mature, reasoned debate informed by the leaders of the State”. “We want to avoid the madness that has convulsed Britain’s body politic. Britain did not prepare, Britain put a flippant notion to an unprepared society and we feel that there are demographic and economic imperatives which are going to arise which should be planned and prepared for rather than responded to on an ad hoc fashion.” Within this, says Murphy, it is important that unionist concerns are heard. Privately, conversations are happening, “and whereas there might not be the confidence to articulate that out loud yet, we need to create a space where that can be done sensitively and constructively”. “Ultimately, in a new Ireland unionism is going to be there, they’re our neighbours, they own this place too, and they need to be accommodated,” he says. “I would like to hear a warm embrace for the unionist tradition in an all-island constitutional entity.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4071879.1572878226!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"q a why the focus on people arriving from georgia and albania","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPassport control at Dublin Airport. The easing of visa restrictions in the Schengen area has allowed  those in Albania and Georgia to travel to Schengen area countries and then on to Ireland. Photograph: PA    Why is there a focus on people arriving from Albania and Georgia?Over the weekend, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar instanced these two countries when discussing the arrival of asylum seekers into Ireland. The Taoiseach said there has been a 60 per cent increase in asylum seekers in recent years, and added: “There are, however, a lot of people from Georgia and Albania coming in with fake documents and that is the big driver of the increase.”Figures published by the International Protection Office, a branch of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, show 3,762 applications for international protection were received by the State until the end of September. Almost a quarter, 875, came from Albanian citizens and 15 per cent, or 556 cases, from Georgia. Why did the Taoiseach mention these two countries?Mr Varadkar did not outline any new information in his public comments but it was notable he chose to give voice to an issue that has been concerning Government in recent months.The trend of arrivals from so-called “safe countries,” such as Albania and Georgia has been evident for some time and has been a feature of figures published by the Department of Justice. While higher numbers of arrivals from countries such as Syria, where people were fleeing war, were previously a feature of the asylum process, that has given way to higher numbers from so-called safe countries.Those applying for refugee status are placed in the Direct Provision system, which sees the State provide accommodation on a full-board basis, until an assessment of their status is made. Asylum seekers from countries regarded as ‘safe’ are far less likely to be granted leave to remain in the State than those from at risk countries.The Irish Refugee Council (IRC) has criticised Varadkar’s comments, saying that picking out “ nationalities is dangerous and to suggest that a country is de facto safe for all is very dangerous”.How are people from Albania and Georgia entering Ireland?Albania and Georgia were granted permission to travel to and from the Schengen area without requiring a visa from 2011 and 2017 respectively. The Schengen area allows people travel within the European Union without passport checks.But don’t we have an opt out of Schengen?Yes, Ireland and the UK have an opt out of the Schengen area. However, the easing of visa restrictions in the Schengen area has allowed for those in Albania and Georgia to travel to Schengen area countries and then on to Ireland. There are no direct flights between Albania and Georgia and Ireland but other points of transit - such as Milan and Lanzarote - are understood to have been used. Some arrivals are understood to use falsified documents. What happens when such immigrants arrive in Ireland? If someone with falsified documents makes it through immigration control, they are free to enter Ireland. In some instances where falsified documents are detected, sources said people have then applied for asylum status which would see them enter the international protection system. It is understood there are cases of people simply disappearing after initial asylum screenings.Greater checks are now being carried out, for example, when people leave a plane at Dublin Airport.What happens when someone claims asylum?Anyone applying for asylum is referred to the Direct Provision system, although current pressures on the system mean emergency accommodation is often used instead of dedicated Direct Provision centres. At present, 7,655 people are in Direct Provision and another 1,800 asylum seekers are living in emergency accommodation.This has created pressures on a system already coping with a homelessness crisis, and there have been tensions between the Department of Housing and the Department of Justice over the use of emergency accommodation for those seeking asylum.The Department of Justice is attempting to increase the number of Direct Provision centres around the country to increase capacity and reduce the use of emergency accommodation, such as hotels and bed and breakfasts.What is the reason for the arrivals from Albania and Georgia?Government figures, whilst acknowledging there could be genuine refugee cases from such countries, believe those arriving in Ireland from Albania and Georgia are essentially economic migrants. However, the Government has faced criticism for this view with the IRC saying that by naming the two countries and referring to people from there as economic migrants Varadkar appears to suggest “that everyone from those countries is not a refugee or doesn’t have claim for refugee status”.A factor in the recent increases, it is believed, may also be due to Brexit. Sources said some immigrants arriving to Ireland may eventually want to travel to the UK using the Common Travel Area. However, it is argued that if the Common Travel Area is to be maintained, Ireland cannot become a back door into the UK."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4057998.1571674594!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the irish times most nominated in newsbrands shortlist 2019","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tRosita Boland with her trophy at the 2018 Newsbrands Ireland journalism awards Photograph: Simon CarswellThe  has received 32 nominations in the shortlist for the NewsBrands Journalism Awards 2019 – the highest number for a publication in this year’s competition.The NewsBrands Journalism Awards are open to any work published in print, website, online, mobile, video, audio or any other news delivery format from any NewsBrands Ireland member title.Five of the six journalists shortlisted in the Foreign Coverage category write for The : Sally Hayden Derek Scally Suzanne Lynch Lara Marlowe and Patrick Freyne.The  received four of the six nominations for Best Use of Video, citing the work of Simon Carswell, Kathleen Harris, Enda O’Dowd and Bryan O’Brien.Jack Power of The  was nominated in three categories Business Story of the Year Investigative Journalism and Young Journalist of the Year.  reporter Sarah Burns was also shortlisted as Young Journalist of the Year as was current  reporter Shauna Bowers for her past work at The Times, Ireland edition.Markets Correspondent Joe Brennan is shortlisted for Business Journalist of the Year.In the Campaigning Journalism category, The ’ No Child campaign has been shortlisted.Fintan O’Toole and Hilary Fannin are both nominated in the Broadsheet Columnist category, while in the Critic of the Year category The  has four writers shortlisted: Catherine Cleary Patrick Freyne Niamh Donnelly and Fintan O’Toole.Three  writers are shortlisted in the Features Broadsheet Writer of the Year: Rosita Boland, Conor Gallagher and Conor Pope.Carl O’Brien is nominated, along with Power, in the Investigative Journalism category.

suggests.Only a third of 1,000 small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) surveyed by distribution company CitySprint said they had seen the government\u0027s Get Ready For Brexit advertising campaign.One in five said they had not seen or accessed any government guidance or support since 2016, raising questions about how well prepared smaller businesses are, according to the report.Almost half of those polled said they do not believe the government has done enough to help businesses prepare for Brexit.Despite the findings, half of SMEs said they felt more confident than they did 12

around 11.6 million barrels per day, worth $719m at today’s market price.\u0026nbspThat volume of oil has made\u0026nbspAramco responsible for more global emissions than any other company in history by a comfortable margin, according to the Climate Accountability Network.Created with Sketch.Attack on major oil facilities in Saudi Arabia: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Smoke billows from multiple fires at the Aramco oil processing facility in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia on 14 SeptemberThick black smoke billows from a fire following drone strikes on major oil facilities in Abqaiq, Saudi ArabiaThe Aramco oil processing facility in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia prior to the drone strikes on 14 September Damage is seen to the Aramco oil processing facility in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia following drone strikes on 14 September, the previous day (Image 1 of 2)Damage is seen to the Aramco oil field in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia following drone strikes on 14 September, the previous day (Image 2 of 2)Damage is seen to the Aramco oil field in Khurais, Saudi Arabia following drone strikes on 14 September, the previous day (Image 1 of 2)Damage is seen to the Aramco oil field in Khurais, Saudi Arabia following drone strikes on 14 September, the previous day (Image 2 of 2)Smoke billows from multiple fires following drone strikes on major oil facilities in Abqaiq, Saudi ArabiaSmoke rises from a fire following a drone strike at the Aramco facility in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia on 14 SeptemberSmoke is seen following a fire at the Aramco oil processing facility in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia on 14 SeptemberSmoke billows from multiple fires at the Aramco oil processing facility in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia on 14 SeptemberThick black smoke billows from a fire following drone strikes on major oil facilities in Abqaiq, Saudi ArabiaThe Aramco oil processing facility in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia prior to the drone strikes on 14 September Damage is seen to the Aramco oil processing facility in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia following drone strikes on 14 September, the previous day (Image 1 of 2)Damage is seen to the Aramco oil field in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia following drone strikes on 14 September, the previous day (Image 2 of 2)Damage is seen to the Aramco oil field in Khurais, Saudi Arabia following drone strikes on 14 September, the previous day (Image 1 of 2)Damage is seen to the Aramco oil field in Khurais, Saudi Arabia following drone strikes on 14 September, the previous day (Image 2 of 2)Smoke billows from multiple fires following drone strikes on major oil facilities in Abqaiq, Saudi ArabiaSmoke rises from a fire following a drone strike at the Aramco facility in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia on 14 SeptemberSmoke is seen following a fire at the Aramco oil processing facility in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia on 14 SeptemberIt also presents the significant risk of so-called stranded assets such as oil fields and refineries which are highly valued today but may quickly become worthless as the world’s energy needs switch away from fossil fuels.\u0026nbspYasir al-Rumayyan, the chairman of Saudi Aramco, said on Sunday: “Today marks a significant milestone in the history of the company and important progress towards delivering Saudi Vision 2030, the kingdom’s blueprint for sustained economic ersification and growth.”The sale will be a publicity coup and a financial boost for Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler, Mohammad bin Salman, who is attempting to present a more modern vision for the conservative kingdom while decreasing its reliance on oil.Saudi Arabia hopes to raise around $40-$45bn from the sale of a 1 per cent to 2 per cent stake. Much of the cash is likely to flow into the kingdom’s Public Investment Fund (PIF), which has bought stakes in a host of companies including Uber.\u0026nbspBanks and advisors will also collect hundreds of millions of dollars in fees for their role in getting the Aramco share sale over the line.The shares will debut on Saudia Arabia’s stock market, the Tadawul, dashing hopes on Wall Street and in the City of London, which had been vying to win a share of the lucrative listing.Plans for a dual listing have been put on hold but may be revived in future.\u0026nbspThe importance of Aramco to world oil supplies was underlined in September when drone attacks on its oil plants sent the oil prices soaring.A temporary shutdown at the Abqaiq and Khurais plants after the attacks temporarily took out more than 5 per cent of global oil production.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

around 11.6 million barrels per day, worth $719m at today’s market price.\u0026nbspThat volume of oil has made\u0026nbspAramco responsible for more global emissions than any other company in history by a comfortable margin, according to the Climate Accountability Network.Created with Sketch.Attack on major oil facilities in Saudi Arabia: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Smoke billows from multiple fires at the Aramco oil processing facility in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia on 14 SeptemberThick black smoke billows from a fire following drone strikes on major oil facilities in Abqaiq, Saudi ArabiaThe Aramco oil processing facility in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia prior to the drone strikes on 14 September Damage is seen to the Aramco oil processing facility in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia following drone strikes on 14 September, the previous day (Image 1 of 2)Damage is seen to the Aramco oil field in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia following drone strikes on 14 September, the previous day (Image 2 of 2)Damage is seen to the Aramco oil field in Khurais, Saudi Arabia following drone strikes on 14 September, the previous day (Image 1 of 2)Damage is seen to the Aramco oil field in Khurais, Saudi Arabia following drone strikes on 14 September, the previous day (Image 2 of 2)Smoke billows from multiple fires following drone strikes on major oil facilities in Abqaiq, Saudi ArabiaSmoke rises from a fire following a drone strike at the Aramco facility in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia on 14 SeptemberSmoke is seen following a fire at the Aramco oil processing facility in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia on 14 SeptemberSmoke billows from multiple fires at the Aramco oil processing facility in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia on 14 SeptemberThick black smoke billows from a fire following drone strikes on major oil facilities in Abqaiq, Saudi ArabiaThe Aramco oil processing facility in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia prior to the drone strikes on 14 September Damage is seen to the Aramco oil processing facility in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia following drone strikes on 14 September, the previous day (Image 1 of 2)Damage is seen to the Aramco oil field in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia following drone strikes on 14 September, the previous day (Image 2 of 2)Damage is seen to the Aramco oil field in Khurais, Saudi Arabia following drone strikes on 14 September, the previous day (Image 1 of 2)Damage is seen to the Aramco oil field in Khurais, Saudi Arabia following drone strikes on 14 September, the previous day (Image 2 of 2)Smoke billows from multiple fires following drone strikes on major oil facilities in Abqaiq, Saudi ArabiaSmoke rises from a fire following a drone strike at the Aramco facility in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia on 14 SeptemberSmoke is seen following a fire at the Aramco oil processing facility in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia on 14 SeptemberIt also presents the significant risk of so-called stranded assets such as oil fields and refineries which are highly valued today but may quickly become worthless as the world’s energy needs switch away from fossil fuels.\u0026nbspYasir al-Rumayyan, the chairman of Saudi Aramco, said on Sunday: “Today marks a significant milestone in the history of the company and important progress towards delivering Saudi Vision 2030, the kingdom’s blueprint for sustained economic ersification and growth.”The sale will be a publicity coup and a financial boost for Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler, Mohammad bin Salman, who is attempting to present a more modern vision for the conservative kingdom while decreasing its reliance on oil.Saudi Arabia hopes to raise around $40-$45bn from the sale of a 1 per cent to 2 per cent stake. Much of the cash is likely to flow into the kingdom’s Public Investment Fund (PIF), which has bought stakes in a host of companies including Uber.\u0026nbspBanks and advisors will also collect hundreds of millions of dollars in fees for their role in getting the Aramco share sale over the line.The shares will debut on Saudia Arabia’s stock market, the Tadawul, dashing hopes on Wall Street and in the City of London, which had been vying to win a share of the lucrative listing.Plans for a dual listing have been put on hold but may be revived in future.\u0026nbspThe importance of Aramco to world oil supplies was underlined in September when drone attacks on its oil plants sent the oil prices soaring.A temporary shutdown at the Abqaiq and Khurais plants after the attacks temporarily took out more than 5 per cent of global oil production.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But the colony the researchers found was unusual, as it was composed entirely of worker ants and had no obvious available food source.Now, scientists from the Museum and Institute of Zoology at\u0026nbspthe Polish Academy of Sciences, in Warsaw, have deduced that the thriving community was sustained by cannibalism, and that the ants in the bunker were an accidental offshoot of a larger colony living at ground level near small ventilation pipes leading into the subterranean bunker.When they were first found, the scientists estimated the presence of close to a million inidual ants.\u0026nbspThe insects ended up in this situation as a result of large numbers accidentally falling down the ventilation pipe and being unable to climb back up to their nest.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Insects at risk of extinction Show all 12Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Wasps are of the order Hymenoptera, one of the most at riskDragonflies are of the order Odonata, one of the most at riskBees are of the order Hymenoptera, one of the most at riskButterflies are of the order Lepidoptera, one of the most at risk Ants are of the order Hymenoptera, one of the most at riskCaddisflies make up the order Trichoptera, one of the most at riskStoneflies are of the order plecoptera, one of the most at risk Saw-Flies are of the order Hymenoptera, one of the most at riskMoths are of the order Lepidoptera, one of the most at risk Damselflies are of the order Odonata, one of the most at riskMayflies are of the order Ephemeroptera, one of the most at risk Wasps are of the order Hymenoptera, one of the most at riskDragonflies are of the order Odonata, one of the most at riskBees are of the order Hymenoptera, one of the most at riskButterflies are of the order Lepidoptera, one of the most at risk Ants are of the order Hymenoptera, one of the most at riskCaddisflies make up the order Trichoptera, one of the most at riskStoneflies are of the order plecoptera, one of the most at risk Saw-Flies are of the order Hymenoptera, one of the most at riskMoths are of the order Lepidoptera, one of the most at risk Damselflies are of the order Odonata, one of the most at riskMayflies are of the order Ephemeroptera, one of the most at risk Several years later, the ants in the bunker still appeared to be thriving, prompting an investigation into how this was possible.In a newly published paper, Professor Wojciech Czechowski and Dr István Maák said their investigations revealed the wood ants were consuming the dead bodies of their fallen comrades that were accumulating on the bunker floor.\u0026nbspIn nature, a similar behaviour occurs frequently during spring, when protein food is scarce.\u0026nbspNeighbouring colonies\u0026nbspengage in so-called “ant wars”, which set territorial boundaries and also provide food in the form of the fresh corpses.Woman bitten by mystery insect has legs and fingertips amputated Pentagon ordered to reveal whether it used ticks as biological weaponsBritain is not immune to the ‘insect armageddon’Recent research has also shown that corpse consumption among wood ants is more common than previously thought, and that even the corpses of their nest-mates can serve as an important food source – and not only in periods of food shortage.“Here we show that the ‘colony’ in the bunker survived and grew thanks to an influx of workers from the source nest above the bunker and mass consumption of corpses of the imprisoned nest-mates,” the authors said.In 2016, the scientists experimented with creating a bridge for the ants to allow them to return to the original colony. At first they allowed a hundred iniduals to regain access to the nest, where they saw they were accepted as belonging to the larger, original colony.After this success they made the bridge permanent, and more recent visits to the bunker have revealed very small numbers of ants still living down there, with the vast majority believed to have returned to the original nest.The research is published in the Journal of Hymenoptera Research.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This came after an initial run during which members of the Nazi Party disrupted screenings by releasing mice into the cinema and, at one stage, attacking Jewish audience members. Censors in Austria, Australia, Italy and France also banned the film in the early 1930s.Many might find Clint Eastwood\u0027s American Sniper (2015) to be something of an insult, but Iran banned the war drama – based on the life of the US military\u0027s deadliest marksman – for being just that. Censors deemed it offensive to its nation.The anti-war sentiment present in Francis Ford Coppola\u0027s Apocalypse Now saw the film banned under President Park Chung-hee\u0027s regime in 1979.Ben Affleck\u0027s Best Picture-winning 2012 drama Argo was banned in Iran due to its negative portrayal of the country.Finnish censors believed that Sergei Eisenstein\u0027s 1925 Soviet silent film Battleship Potemkin would incite a Communist revolution, so gave the film an outright ban.746 Beauty and the Beast (2017)Disney\u0027s live-action remake of its 1991 classic was banned in Kuwait due to homosexual references involving the character LeFou (Josh Gad). It evaded a ban in Russia after being slapped with a 16+ age certificate and in Malaysia after having the references cut altogether.China banned William Wyler\u0027s religious epic Ben-Hur in 1959 under the regime of Mao Zedong for containing propaganda of superstitious beliefs, namely Christianity. While most films go on to have their ban lifted, the country has never given the Oscar-winner permission to be shown.It turns out there are some people who don\u0027t find Sacha Baron Cohen that funny, notably officials in all Arab countries (except Lebanon) who banned his 2006 comedy Borat for being too offensive.Officials in the Catholic country of Ireland found David Lean\u0027s romantic drama Brief Encounter to be too accepting of adultery to be shown in cinemas.The homosexual relationship at the centre of Ang Lee\u0027s 2005 drama Brokeback Mountain saw the film banned in all Arab countries bar Lebanon, where it was released in a censored format.The number of banned films in North Korea runs pretty high, but an unexpected feature on the list is the Tom Hardy-starring Child 44 (2015). Countries including Russia, Kazakhstan, Ukraine and Belarus all followed suit.Censors in China denied the release of Disney\u0027s Christopher Robin in 2008 because the character of Winnie the Pooh has become a symbol of resistance against the country’s ruling Communist Party and its leader Xi Jinping.Stanley Kubrick met a lot of opposition with A Clockwork Orange in 1971. While the film was never banned outright in the UK (it was withdrawn at the director\u0027s request after his family received death threats because of it), it wasn\u0027t shown in cinemas in Ireland, Singapore, South Africa and South Korea due to its depictions of violence and gang rape. It wasn\u0027t screened in the UK until after Kubrick\u0027s death in 1999.The high-profile adaptation of Dan Brown\u0027s novel The Da Vinci Code was banned in (take a deep breath) China, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Pakistan, Philippines, Samoa and Solomon Islands due to content deemed blasphemous.The Danish Girl, Tom Hooper\u0027s film inspired by the life of transgender painter Lili Elbe, was banned in Qatar, United Arab Emirates, Oman, Bahrain, Jordan, Kuwait and Malaysia on grounds of moral depravity in 2015.After it was decided that Deadpool couldn\u0027t be edited without affecting its plot, Chinese officials initially banned the film citing explicit content. Uzbekistan followed suit as the film violated the country\u0027s societal norms, while it received heavy editing in order to be shown in India.1846 The Death of Stalin (2017)Armando Iannucci\u0027s 2017 comedy The Death of Stalin failed to make the cut in Russia, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan because of its perceived anti-Soviet theme.Martin Scorsese\u0027s crime thriller The Departed hit a nerve with China in 2006 thanks to a line of dialogue that suggested its government intends to use nuclear weapons on Taiwan, a sensitive issue for the country. The ban has never been lifted.District 9, Neill Blomkamp\u0027s science-fiction film from 2009, was slapped with a ban in Nigeria due to accusations of being xenophobic and racist towards its citizens.2146 Fifty Shades of Grey (2015)The adaptation of EL James\u0027s erotic drama Fifty Shades of Grey may not have been as raunchy as some were hoping, but it was considered too explicit for audiences in Indonesia, Kenya, Malaysia, United Arab Emirates and Zimbabwe.   William Wyler\u0027s romantic musical Funny Girl was banned in Egypt because its male lead Omar Sharif – an Egyptian Muslim – is shown in a romantic storyline with the Jewish Barbra Streisand, who was vocal in her political support for Israel at the height of military tensions with Egypt in 1968.Paul Feig\u0027s all-female reboot of Ghostbusters was denied a release in China due to censorship laws prohibiting the promotion of cults and superstitions. Not even changing the title to Super Power Dare-to-Die Team (yes, really) could help its cause. Sean Connery\u0027s third film as British spy James Bond, Goldfinger (1964), had been released in Israel for six weeks when it was revealed that one of its main actors, Gert Fröbe, had a Nazi past. It had the ban lifted when a Jewish survivor came forward with the revelation that his life and his mother\u0027s were probably saved after being hidden from the Nazis by Fröbe.The country of Vietnam deemed the numerous murders shown in blockbuster The Hunger Games too violent for teenage audiences and decided to slap the film with an outright ban.2646 Jules and Jim (1962)François Truffaut\u0027s beloved French drama Jules and Jim found itself at the centre of a ban in Italy for its attitudes toward sex. The ban was quickly lifted.Not many people enjoyed 2017 sequel Kingsman: The Golden Circle, but the cinema censors in Cambodia sit top of that list. Thanks to the moment that sees the film\u0027s antagonist working from a lair in a Cambodian temple, the Colin Firth action film was handed an indefinite ban.It was a particularly gory death scene that saw Australian thriller Mad Max (1979) banned from being seen in New Zealand as it unintentionally mirrored an incident with a real gang shortly before it was released. The same scene saw the film banned in Sweden until 2005.Milk, Gus Van Sant\u0027s 2008 Oscar-winning biopic about gay rights activist and US politician Harvey Milk, was initially banned in Samoa with no reason given, though it was eventually revealed the film had been deemed inappropriate and contradictory to Christian beliefs and Samoan culture for its depiction of homosexuality.3046 Monty Python\u0027s Life of Brian (1979)The religious satire featured in Monty Python\u0027s Life of Brian was considered blasphemous in countries including Ireland, South Africa and Norway.

Charlie Chaplin\u0027s classic 1936 film Modern Times was banned in Nazi Germany for advocating Communism.Darren Aronofsky\u0027s biblical drama Noah (2014) found itself the subject of a ban in China, as well as several Muslim countries, because it was perceived to contradict the teachings of Islam.Malaysia disregarded Pulp Fiction for release and banned the Quentin Tarantino film scenes featuring drug abuse, explicit nudity and sexual violence.Sylvester Stallone\u0027s return as Rambo in 2008 – which he also directed – was deemed offensive by censors in of Burma who opposed the way the film depicted its country\u0027s soldiers. Officials in China were so worried that adults would assume animated film Sausage Party (2016) to be a children\u0027s film that they slapped it with an outright ban. On the flip side, France gave the film a 12-rating.  3646 Sex and the City 2 (2010)It\u0027s a wonder the first film of HBO series Sex and the City wasn\u0027t banned in Vietnam considering the critically-maligned sequel – released in 2010 – was prohibited there due to a conflict of cultural values.Although brief, the ban on 2004 sequel Shrek 2 was incurred in Israel due to the Hebrew dub added to the film ahead of release. A particular joke aimed at Israeli singer David D\u0027Or\u0027s high voice prompted the musician to take legal action, halting the film from being released until its removal.The Simpsons Movie was banned in Burma due to the juxtaposition of the colours yellow and red, which is considered to convey support for rebel groups in the country.Trey Parker and Matt Stone ruffled plenty of feathers with their big-screen South Park film, Bigger, Longer \u0026amp Uncut, and the comedic depiction of Saddam Hussein saw it banned in Iraq. The duo\u0027s 2004 film Team America: World Police would later be banned by North Korea for its comedic depiction of Kim Jong-Il.Iran didn\u0027t take too kindly to Zack Snyder\u0027s depiction of the Persian military in his 2006 film 300.North Korea suppressed 2012 from release in 2009 because the film depicted what the government considered to be an important year for the nation in a negative light (it coincided with its first leader Kim Il-Sung\u0027s 100th birthday).

Sir Edward has promised to represent change by being\u0026nbspa bit boring.The outcome of the election could have a bearing on the Brexit process, with the influence of the speaker having been highlighted by\u0026nbspMr Bercow\u0026nbspcontroversially allowing\u0026nbspMPs to pass legislation blocking a no-deal exit from the EU.The election will be presided over by veteran Tory Ken Clarke, who, as the current Father of the House, performs the role of interim speaker.\u0026nbspCandidates will submit their nominations between 9.30am and 10.30am and will need to have the backing of between 12 and 15 MPs.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The fact is that whatever promises are made over the course of this election campaign, taxes are going to have to rise over the coming decade.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Authorities have been raising awareness of the scheme for a number of weeks, and doubled the fine for non-compliance to 4,000 rupees (£43).Mr Kejriwal wrote on Twitter that he car-pooled to work with two cabinet colleagues. “Share cars. This will build friendship, strengthen relationships as well as save petrol and reduce pollution,” he wrote. Another minister rode to work on a bicycle, according to NDTV.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s mostly the stubble burning in the states of Punjab and Haryana which contributes to the pollution, and industrial pollution is also high.”Over\u0026nbspthe weekend, the chief minister of Punjab wrote to the prime minister Narendra Modi urging him to intervene in the crisis and criticising the “blame game” played by the various devolved governments of the region in order to avoid responsibility for action.“The harsh truth is that while all of us are busy conveniently passing the buck to one another, Delhi’s people are reeling under excruciating misery, and are facing one of the worst health disasters in the nation’s, possibly the world’s, history,” wrote Amarinder Singh.The air pollution crisis in the capital is certainly bad for India’s image internationally, with the smog quite literally overshadowing a T20 series opener between India and Bangladesh in Delhi on Sunday.And oft-cited WHO figures show India is home to 15 of the 20 most-polluted cities in the world, in spite of the accolades won by Mr Modi for his perceived successes on environmental matters.With all eyes turning to the prime minister, Mr Modi’s office is yet to take a strong stand on the pollution issue, even after a Supreme Court-mandated panel declared a public health emergency in the capital last week.The prime minister’s office called an urgent review meeting on the smog on Sunday, after which it was concluded that the cabinet secretary, Rajiv Gauba, would “monitor” the situation.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Are these two really the brightest and the best  Obviously not. But with politics becoming ever more isive and toxic, they are all we have left.Let’s be honest. What normal human being would want to be part of such a cesspit  As we are all well aware, the past three years have seen a constipated parliament unable, or unwilling, to sort out Brexit, forcing us all into a nightmarish version of Groundhog Day.I believe the idea of a European referendum was the height of stupidity by a spooked David Cameron who wanted to neuter Nigel Farage. When the nation voted Leave, Cameron was the first to abandon ship.Never mind “women and children first”. He was rowing away from a Titanic mess in a leboat stuffed with like-minded, snivelling clowns, leaving poor Theresa May behind playing an out-of-tune piano with the rest of the ship’s doomed orchestra. Mrs May foolishly called an election that was a personal disaster, then was worn down until she had to step aside.Boris Johnson thought he could bluster and blag his way to a solution and promised we would exit the EU a couple of days ago, on Halloween. For all his blather about “dying in a ditch”, he couldn’t deliver.So here we are, facing a pre-Christmas election at a time when distrust of politicians has never been higher and our expectations have been never lower. It is easy to dismiss the whole bloody lot of them as a waste of time.But there ARE some decent MPs who want to make a dference. Sadly, some are unwilling to put up with the scrutiny and vilication the job now entails and many are heading out the door.Female MPs, in particular, have been subjected to online abuse that chills the blood. As well as death threats, they have had to deal with vile monsters threatening rape and other violent attacks. It’s horric to have to cope with such hideous abuse on a daily basis. I can’t blame them for quitting in despair.Their fears are real. We saw that with the tragic murder of MP Jo Cox in . She was a we and mother who wanted to make the world a better place and do the best possible job for her constituents. It’s a real pity the MPs now calling it a day are mainly moderates who were calm ­voices of reason amid all the shrieking and howling from extremists on both sides of the political ide.Heidi Allen, a Tory who joined the Lib Dems, can no longer cope with the “nastiness and intimidation” which has become the norm in Parliament. Culture Secretary Nicky Morgan is leaving because the abuse towards her has had a “clear impact” on her ­family.The Tory and the Labour leaderships should hang their heads in shame at allowing such an appalling situation to develop. They should have called off their attack dogs and clamped down on cowardly online trolls.There have always been robust arguments and passionate debates in politics — but nothing like the sheer hatred and aggression Brexit has unleashed. MPs were used to attacks from opposing parties. But now some of the worst abuse comes from inside.Left-wing extremists threaten deselection for Labour MPs who even whisper about their discontent with Corbyn. Tories find themselves booted out for failing to toe the line. Sadly, the next six weeks will see even more of this aggression as we have to listen to hate-filled rants and ­ludicrous, undeliverable ­promises to secure our votes.It is strange to think that Westminster was respected and admired not so very long ago. I honestly don’t think those days will ever . We deserve so much better.SOME welcome good news comes in the form of Richard and Judy, who will pop back on to our TV screens to front the show they helped make such a huge success.It was meant to be a one-off when they presented This Morning a couple of weeks ago. But viewers were so excited, “R and J” have an open invitation to .The stumbling block has always been because Judy was reluctant toto live national TV. But Richard told me this week she really enjoyed herself and loved reconnecting with This Morning’s loyal audience.Richard was quick to stress that they are not after anyone’s jobs or in the market for a permanent– but it would be lovely to pop in now and again. I’m delighted. They are both total pros who make it all look delightfully easy and relaxed.They also have the sort of public affection only enjoyed by the Queen and Dame Judi Dench.IT is heartbreaking to think Ben Needham would have turned  this week. He has been for ever frozen in time as that little blond toddler playing in the Greek sunshine before going missing on Kos back in .Brave mum Kerry has never once stopped fighting to discover the truth. Three years ago, British police finally conducted a thorough investigation.They believe Ben was killed in an accident involving a digger on a building site on the island, where his grandad worked and close to where the family lived at the time. Despite handing over their evidence to authorities on the island, there have been no further attempts to find Ben’s body.Poor Kerry should have been celebrating her grown-up son’s milestone birthday, perhaps with her daughter-in-law and grandchildren. Instead, her agony ­continues.She has no closure, no grave to visit and is no nearer to finding out exactly what happened to her son almost three decades ago.I CAN’T wait to see what Michelle Visage and Giovanni Pernice have in store for us on Strictly Come Dancing. Last week their Halloween routine was perfection and Michelle foxtrotted around the floor like a gothic goddess.She was my tip to make the final even before the first steps were taken in this year’s competition. I knew Michelle had the sass, talent and work ethic to go all the way. I love that she’s flying the flag for the over-s while exuding buckets of sex appeal.Don’t forget that for years Michelle suffered with a serious autoimmune disease she believes was caused by her breast implants. She has only just recovered from surgery to have them removed.Michelle is a steel magnolia and the best is yet to come. So make sure you give her and Giovanni your vote.A HUGE thank you to everyone who has been so positive about Shine, my book out this week.With my th birthday coming up at the end of this month, it felt like a good time to reflect and take stock. I also wanted to share all of the knowledge and advice I’ve acquired from so many of the guests and experts I’ve met over the  years I’ve been on TV.So I decided to put it all into a book that will hopefully give useful tips and information to make your le better. I want it to be a book you can have by your bedside, to dip into when you need a bit of a confidence boost or advice on looking good and feeling great.I’m doing some signings on Saturday, so do pop in and say hello at WH Smith in Glasgow’s St Enoch Centre at noon and at Waterstones on Princes Street in Edinburgh at pm.I WAS in the US last week, going through astronaut training at Nasa. I will tell you about that very soon. But I also managed a couple of days to recover in Florida’s Key West. My husband and I had no idea that at this time of year there is a little event called Fantasy Fest. Well. What an eye-opener that was.Some brave souls were out and about in nothing more than expertly applied body paint. I was a bit bemused at first and obviously I refrained from joining in.But it is amazing how quickly you get used to someone wearing nothing but a leather posing pouch standing at the bar talking to you about the latest Trump baloney.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was called “man”.He was hemmed in on all sides by giant deserts he couldn’t cross because, at this point, God had not invented the Land Rover. But it didn’t matter back then because this part of the world was full of all the food and water the mans and womans would ever need.It was lush, green and beautul. Everyone was very happy. Now, imaginethey’d known the planet was about to wobble on its axis, which would cause us to start on an all-new orbit around the sun.Imagine the panic.

But they didn’t know the Earth was about to wobble. They just woke up one morning to find the climate had changed.It was warmer and wetter. In fact, there was so much rain, the deserts surrounding them came to le. This meant they could explore strange new worlds and boldly go where no one had gone before.They moved to Europe and Asia. They spread out across the seas and soon, they came up with ­literature and agriculture and architecture and medicine. They became civilised and happy and healthy. And then they started going on holidays and drinking beer and laughing on the way home from the pub with their friends and a delicious kebab.And then they got next-day delivery on anything they wanted and a new smartphone every year and Instagram. One day, a tall man with a motoring show on the television was even able to drive a Lancia right across the salt pans where it all began. And all of that was possible thanks to a big, juicy lump of global warming.That’s the thing about climate change. We keep being told the next sht will be a disaster for mankind. But who knows  You might wake up one morning to find your garden full of unicorns and mermaids and big chests full of jewels and money.LOTS of people are wondering why Jeremy Corbyn took so long to agree to an election. But the answer is simple.Corbyn knew the longer he could stall Brexit, the more damage would be done to the one thing he hates more than everything : Britain. He’s always sided with anyone who wants to do us harm. The IRA. Hamas. Russia. You name it.He wants everyone in those camps in Calais to come here because he knows it will destabilise our way of le. In fact, every one of his policies is designed specically to ruin the country.Because that’s what the bitter and twisted weasel wants. Mind you, the Shadow Chancellor is even worse.Which isn’t strictly trueyou’ve got a one-off Ferrari  Speciale MM. APPARENTLY Daniel Craig was fed up with saying: “The name’s Bond. James Bond.” Well, I’m sorry, my precious, but you’re not getting any sympathy here. If you’ve worked in a poultry farm for  years, you can say you’re fed up with chickens.Andyou’ve worked on the railways all your adult le, you can say you are looking forward to a retirement without trains. But you, Mr Craig, only said that line FIVE times. Which is hardly taxing, is it No matter. There’s talk about who will replace him in the role. And because Bond is so woke and #MeToo these days, we cannot rule out the possibility that the role will be given to Diane Abbott or Janet Street-Porter.Some of me hopes he really does die in the new movie, as has been rumoured. Buthe doesn’t, might I suggest the part is given to a chap called Geoffrey Moore, top I met him at a party once and was impressed by his louche, charming style, his clever eyebrow work and his bright orange skin that even David Dickinson would call “over the top”.I’m not sure he can act. But that doesn’t matter because neither could his father Roger . . . and he was the best Bond of them all.BAD news. It seems the plug has been pulled on the hotly anticipated prequel to Game Of Thrones.They had a stellar cast including the brilliant Naomi Watts.

And her husband Jonathan Ross.HBO, though, has obviously decided the end result won’t work, which begs a question: How can they know I’ve worked in television for  years butsomeone came to me and said: “We have a show featuring an old lady baking cakes” I’d have put their ideas in a big bag of rubbish, along with that hare-brained scheme to stage a prime-time dancing competition.GATWICK airport is set to roll out a new system to cut boarding times and reduce delays.Sounds clever, yes.

Nor is he remotely likely to hold the balance of power.There is no longer a route to the No Deal Brexit he wants. Nor any prospect of Boris Johnson caving to his demands for a pact, destroying the Tories’ unity. And it is patently untrue to say Boris’s deal is not Brexit. The Tory ERG simply wouldn’t back itso.It will end our membership, payments and free movement and extract us from the customs union and single market, with no “backstop” keeping us half-in. We would trade freely as an independent nation. And Boris alone can get us out. The sole alternative as PM is Corbyn, and he will keep us in the EU for ever.In a few constituencies Farage’s party could hurt Labour more than the Tories. Overall it is FAR more likely to prevent Boris winning the majority which is vital to delivering Brexit and without which it is lost. That is why Farage’s ultimatum to the PM delighted Labour.Two by-elections — in Peterborough and Brecon, both of which the Tories should have won — were gted to Labour and the Lib Dems by Brexit Party votes. On December , those could put Corbyn in Downing Street in a Remain coalition.At which point Farage’s legacy won’t just be that his vanity wrecked his le’s work.That a party he founded with only one aim, a real Brexit, became the very instrument of the project’s destruction.He will be remembered as the right-wing maverick who handed anti-Semitic, anti-Western Marxists an unprecedented chance to plunder the world’s fth-largest economy. The Sun admires Farage.His pressure brought about the referendum AND a better deal. But he could now be the author of a double national catastrophe.He and his voters should think again.WE’VE heard it all now.Labour’s Tom ­Watson, of all people, insists broadcasters must combat the Tories’ “fake news”.That’s the same Tom Watson who destroyed lives spreading a paedophile’s lies.Whose party’s campaign centres on a blatant fiction about Boris “selling the NHS to Trump”.Whose leader lies endlessly about his terrorist sympathies and anti-Semitism — then sinisterly orders reporters: “Just report what we say.”These charlatans lecture journalists about the truth.But they themselves are strangers to it.Andthey took power, Press freedom would be a nostalgic memory.The Sun joins everyone rooting for Owen and England’s rugby heroes.Best of ruck, lads!Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But oddly,  is one of the things that mean the Tories might win that majority this time round. They are determined not to make the same mistakes again. As one senior party figure puts it: “We screwed it up once. We’re not going to do that again.”When Chancellor Sajid Javid spoke to Tory MPs on Wednesday night, he reassured them that “this campaign will not be like last time”. He described Theresa May’s  effort as “the most incompetent election campaign in modern times”.In , the Tories assumed that their chunky poll lead would easily translate into a big majority. There was a complacency and cockiness about their campaign. There was no ­rationale for why Mrs May was going back on her pledge not to have an election and a belief that the Tories could use that lead to win a mandate for almost anything.This time round, the Tories are being much more cautious. The groundwork has been laid for this campaign. Conservative Campaign HQ has been getting election-ready for months. The Tories have heavy-hitters ready to join their ­campaign team, including Paul Stephenson, one of the key ­figures from Vote Leave’s  victory. In , Mrs May took her own party machine by ­surprise with her decision to go to the country.In another dference with the ex-PM, Boris Johnson has a clear argument for why an ­election is needed — the only thing this Parliament is capable of on Brexit is delay. It is hard to see how anyone who wants Brexit and has seen what has happened since the  election could disagree with that.This Tory desire not to screw up will also lead to more ­discipline. This time, the ­manesto will be a cautious document, not an attempt to gain a mandate for a series of deeply unpopular reforms. The fact that everyone knows this election will be close helps the Tories too. There’ll be much more scrutiny of what a Corbyn premiership would mean than there was in .Cabinet Ministers believe that the prospect of a Labour SNP deal which would see Nicola Sturgeon’s Scottish Nationalists help Corbyn into Downing Street in exchange for another independence referendum is already cutting through, and particularly in Scotland, where the Tories are increasingly ­confident they can limit their losses to five seats or fewer.But perhaps the biggest dference from  is between Johnson and May. May had never done a ­national campaign before, she disliked big events and preferred going door to door. Boris, by contrast, is a showman who has already ­successfully fronted one nationwide effort, the  referendum. Boris knows how to make himself the centre of attention in a way Mrs May never did.As one Cabinet minister puts it: “Boris is ­capable of stealing the oxygen from all the other candidates.”The most signicant threat to the Tories is pro-Remain tactical voting. The big question, frets one Cabinet minister, is whether Labour and the Lib Dems end up splitting the ­centre-left vote and letting the Tories win — as happened with Labour and the SDP in  — or whether there is anti-Tory voting that condemns scores of previously safe Tory MPs to defeat — as happened in .Butthe Tories avoid the pitfalls of , then even from a much less promising starting position they should be able to win a majority.THIS election will see the first ever head-to-head televised leaders’ debate between the two big parties. On November , Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson will clash in primetime on ITV. Both Labour and the Tories think they will benefit from this one-on-one format.On the Labour side, they hope that it helps them unite the anti-Tory vote behind Corbyn. The Tories think the question of who you want to be Prime Minister – Johnson or Corbyn – favours them.During the  campaign, Theresa May lost her lead on this question. But right now, Boris Johnson has a -point advantage over Corbyn. If he can maintain anything like this margin, he’ll still be in No  come Christmas.Downing Street also thinks that making this election a forced choice between a Tory government and a Labour government works to their benefit. Polling for Conservative Campaign HQ shows that half of voters want the Tories in government in some way, compared to just over a quarter for Labour.They calculate that making the election a choice between Johnson and Corbyn helps them squeeze the Brexit Party vote down – something which is particularly important given Nigel Farage’s determination to put up candidates right across the country.Influential Tories are also worried thatthe Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson turns in a barnstorming performance, her party could threaten the Tories in their shire seats.Johnson himself will not do the seven-way debate between the party leaders. The Tories are keen to downplay the importance of this event. I’m told they are considering sending Sajid Javid, Michael Gove, Priti Patel or Rishi Sunak.THE “moratorium” announced on fracking today is a sign of the Tories’ safety-first approach going into this election. They want to close down issues that could cost them seats.One minister defends the decision to abandon the effort to improve the UK’s energy security by saying: “The reality is, it wasn’t happening.”But a bigger factor was their desire not to go into the election with this as a potential vulnerability.I understand that, in stark contrast to , the manesto will be a cautious document designed to prevent handing ammunition to Labour.AT CABINET on Tuesday, Boris Johnson called the Scottish Secretary Alister Jack to speak.An embarrassed Jack explained that he wasn’t actually trying to get in, to which Johnson replied he thought his hand was up.Jack, a multi-millionaire who owns a large farm, then quipped to laughter: “That’s why my farm manager doesn’t let me go to auctions.”THE Tories are planning to accuse Labour of staging a massive raid on the pension pots of million voters.This would hurt the .million who contribute to a private ­pension. Afterwards, one Tory told me Javid’s message was clear: “Labour are coming after your money.”I understand the Tories are also preparing a “tax bombshell” attack on Corbyn.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But they never got one vote from our house. And I have been thinking of my parents over the past few days and wondering: Would they have broken the habit of a letime and voted for Boris Johnson Because that is the key to who wins this General Election. We hear a lot about how Boris has to woo “Workington Man” — “an older, white, non-graduate male from the north of England with an interest in rugby league and a tendency to vote Labour”. But it is not just Workington Man who holds the keys to  Downing Street now.From one end of the country to the other, it is all those voters such as my mum and dad, who never voted Tory before. That is who Boris has to woo and win. Those millions of Tory virgins.The polls all suggest there is a massive majority for parties which favour leaving the European Union. Butthat vote is split between the Tories and Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party, then we don’t get Brexit.We get Jeremy Corbyn gurning on the steps of No. We get an economy in ruins. We get Venezuela without the nice weather.  But splitting the Leave vote is not a strategy for delivering Brexit. It is a cast-iron guarantee that Brexit is cancelled. If you want to see the result of the Referendum, you have to vote Tory.My mum and dad would not have recognised the rotten Labour Party of today. They would have been baffled, then angered, by the total absence of anything resembling patriotism among Corbyn and his Marxist mob.My parents would have scratched their heads at Labour’s immigration policy — to allow “as much free movement as possible” — not because they disliked foreigners but because they thought the identity of their country was worth preserving.My folks would never have trusted a grizzled old Marxist like John McDonnell with their hard-earned wages. They would have been wary of seeing the police force supervised by Diane Abbott.They would have noted Emily Thornberry sneering at the flag of St George while happily adorning herself in the EU flag. They would not understand how Corbyn could happily lick the sandals of Hamas, Hezbollah and the IRA.My parents — the kind of people who fought our wars, paid their taxes for a letime and built this country up from the rubble — would not have spat on this Labour Party. And after years of seeing Parliament place itself above the people, they would have crawled across broken glass to get to the polling booth on December .My parents believed in democracy. They had no doubts about the importance of voting. They would never have voted for Jeremy Corbyn. But would they have seen that the Conservative Party is now their natural home That’s your historic task now, Boris — convince the millions of working-class patriots like my mum and dad that you truly understand their lives. Andyou can do that, you will win a landslide.We have heard a lot about the failure of fire chiefs and their policy of “stay put” which added to the death toll of .But there has not been nearly enough focus on the heroism of the firefighters who were there on that hellish night.Firefighters put their lives on the line for strangers.Yes, that is their job. But their job deserves our unequivocal respect and gratitude.PRESENTER Samira Ahmed is suing her employers at the BBC for £, in pay because she received a fraction of what Jeremy Vine was paid for allegedly “similar” work.I like Samira Ahmed on Newswatch and wish her well.But Jeremy Vine is far more of a household name.

And exactly how does a dog die, Mr President In my experience, a dog dies surrounded by humans who feel as though they have just had their heart torn out. A dog dies surrounded by love. A dog dies bitterly mourned by the family it leaves behind.According to Trump, the IS leader, “whimpered, cried and screamed like a coward . . . in utter fear, panic and dread”. My dog is not going out of this world like that. When our Stan finally goes, many years from now, he will be in my arms and looking in my eyes.Death will be painless and peaceful. It will be a moment of love and grief. Who writes your lousy material, Donald  All this “dying like a dog” rubbish felt stupidly off-the-cuff.While the world is mightily glad to see the back of a mass murderer, the florid violence of Donald Trump’s language sounded exactly like the kind of crass rhetoric we hear from terrorists.The President’s sneering “died like a dog” line was particularly misjudged because American special forces were helped in their ultra-dangerous mission by military search dogs.They pursued al-Baghdadi right up to the moment he detonated his suicide vest, injuring one of the brave dogs – a Belgian Malinois named Conan – who will be honoured at the White House next week.Kill all the terrorists you like, Mr President.

In the s and s, before the Pill was introduced, that dance of reluctance and “persuasion” was part of the courting process and the whole process of seduction was based on women pretending they weren’t interested only to be ­persuaded that they were.But look how dferent things are now.Also, let’s face it, when you get the magnying glass out, there are plenty of storylines from the past that don’t quite measure up to the standards of . Look at James Bond, who basically sexually assaults Honor Blackman’s ­character Pussy Galorein the movie Goldfinger.Or the song Every Breath You Take and the film Love Actually, both of which feature a stalker as the romantic lead. And when you think about it, Daniel Cleaver’s courting of Bridget Jones really just boils down to ­sexual harassment.There are countless other examples of “romantic” plots which are very dodgy indeed by current standards but, at the time, we all lapped them up. And don’t even get me started on the lyrics of rap songs that are being played today which routinely talk about killing and raping women. Now that is grim.But instead of allowing this song to exist as the relic from the past, soul singer John Legend and Kelly Clarkson have rewritten it. Their version now includes the lines, “What will my friends think If I have one more drink  ”.That is instead of “The neighbours might think,   Say what’s in this drink  .  Legend describes his version as having “a new-found sensitivity in the #MeToo era”. I’d put it a dferent way and say he is ­trying to re-write history.Last year a radio station in Ohio announced it would stop playing the original because of ­complaints from listeners saying the song, “didn’t have a place in modern music”. That’s fine. No one needs to play itpeople are offended by it. But the idea that we can airbrush the fact that it existed in the first place is ridiculous and I worry we are all in danger of trying too hard to be PC.The risk is we become so vanilla, so afraid of upsetting everyone with our view, that we stop speaking our mind, which is a form of societal repression. Yes, it’s good to stand up for what you believe in, but taking offence at the lyrics of a song more than  years old might not be the best cause to bat for.Everything has a context, andwe aren’t careful we will all be so worried about how “woke” we are that we will forget our own views and how to express them.PARENTS everywhere will be reassured to learn that even when you are a sporting hero your kids still think you are a bit of an embarrassment.Peter Crouch said in an interview yesterday that his daughter, Sophia, who is eight, initially asked him to stay outside when he dropped her off at summer camp – because the other kids were laughing about how tall he is .The thing is, as any parent will confirm,it wasn’t his height she would have found another reason that he had to stay outside, whether it be his shoes, coat or haircut.In fact, don’t worry Peter, as they get older they get embarrassed about you just for breathing.MILLIONS of motorists use their mobile phones while they drive. Thirty-five per cent of drivers under the age of , and  per cent of all drivers, admitted to taking their eyes off the road to check texts, email or social media, an RAC survey reports.But the current law means reckless drivers can only be prosecutedthey are caught using hand-held phones to call or text. Meanwhile, those who take photos or scroll through music playlists are exempt from punishment.So police have struggled to enforce the law because they are often unable to prove exactly what drivers are using their phones for. Bear in mind thata driver looks at their phone for just two seconds while travelling at mph, they will cover ft blind, drastically increasing their chance of an accident.So I’m fully behind plans for a ban on even touching a mobile phone while driving, which were announced – drivers take note – on Friday. It is thought the ban could be in place by spring next year.Drivers caught holding phones to browse social media, or even input a sat-nav location, now face six points and a fine of up to £. But how anyone can be complacent enough to check Insta while in charge of a moving metal box that can kill people is beyond me.I have not driven for ten years – I walk or get the Tube – but my kids do and it really bothers methey even so much as glance at their phones. There is no doubt that it is distracting – and dangerous for the driver, but also to others. So this proposed new law is nothing but a good thing as far as I’m concerned.I’VE never been one to embrace dressing up for Halloween or any other kind of forced fun.Sorryyou think that makes me sound like a killjoy, but one thing I have noticed with each passing year is the sexualising of Halloween going off the scales.Forget wizards, goblins and ghouls – every celebrity event seems to be populated only with sexy vampires, sexy ghosts and sexy witches.

This is fraught with danger.”Polls are all over the place, some showing an easily blown Tory lead of six per cent — less than Theresa May’s before she lost her majority.Momentum Labour has made a flying start with social media, bombarding targeted voters with eye-catching and wildly misleading messages — just as it did so successfully in .“You would think the Tory machine might have learned from that debacle, but they haven’t,” says an insider. “And you can’t build a new system overnight from scratch.”The challenge for the Tories is to define the battle lines within the first two weeks.“If it is a choice between Boris and Brexit or a second referendum — or even a third referendum — we are in a good place,” says an insider.But with five parties in this fight — the Tories, Labour, Lib Dems, Brexit Party and SNP — lines rapidly blur.Tory rebels such as Phil Hammond can also wreak havoc by standing as independents.Even Boris’s own ,-majority Uxbridge marginal is under threat from a bizarre invasion of Extinction Rebellion and Stop HS protesters.Nigel Farage, stung by Boris’s successful EU deal, has stunningly over-reached, threatening to field  Brexit Party candidates — although he won’t risk standing himself.His wrecking ball move has backfired among old allies including Leave campaign partner Arron Banks and one-time Ukip MP Douglas Carswell.His own party chiefs are in revolt, with Farage under pressure to back down fast.Cash donors have begun deserting and pro-Brexiteers are voting with their feet.One Sun reader, Brian Pearsall — a “paid-up Brexit Party supporter” — tells me: “I will be backing Boris.

Boris Johnsonaposs welfare chief dismissed calls to axe Francesca OaposBrien over vile comments she made in  - despite a massive backlash. Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey said it will be for the people of Gower, not Conservative Party chiefs, to decideMs OaposBrien becomes an MP. And the DWP chief said despite the fact I donapost agree with what she said in any way, she absolutely would vote for Ms OaposBrienshe lived in the Welsh constituency.Talks about a response were ongoing today at Conservative HQ, but sources said Ms Coffeyaposs comments had reflected wider thinking within the party. The partyaposs Welsh chairman Lord Davies said Ms OaposBrien was not subject to a disciplinary process, telling the BBC: The comments were inadvisable, obviously, but made in the heat of the moment watching a television programme. But I donapost condone it in any shape or form. However, this is a dredging exercise on the part of the Labour Party whose candidate in the Gower doesnapost want to talk about Brexit. Labour chairman Ian Lavery fumed: Removing a candidate who used such vile language about people on benefits should be a no brainer.    “The cuts to benefits and Universal Credit programme that Thérèse Coffey and her party are responsible for have forced people into poverty. “It is shameful that Boris Johnson is allowing Francesca O’Brien to stand for his party in Gower. This reveals the Conservatives’ contempt for the less well off.” Laura Pidcock, Labour’s Shadow Employment Rights Secretary, added: Thérèse Coffey is not fit to be DWP Secretary and the Conservative candidate for Gower is not fit to be an MP. “It is shocking that the Conservatives’ benefits chief has endorsed someone who would talk about people on social security in such a disgusting way. This is the person in charge of the roll-out of Universal Credit. “The Toriesapos cruel benefits regime has pushed families and children into poverty. And it is no wonder, when Boris Johnson’s party has such contempt for the less well off.” Ms O’Brien, who is standing in the Welsh marginal seat in the general election , made the comments on Facebook in . She said: “Benefit Street..anyone  watching this   Wow, these people are unreal!!!” In response to a friend, she added: “My blood is boiling, these people need putting down.” Yet Ms Coffey refused to back dropping Ms OaposBrien as a candidate today when she was grilled by BBC Radio aposs Today programme. She said the comments were clearly wrong and not ones with which I would associate myself in any way but added: She has apologised I’ve been told. That is important.    Ms Coffey added: I think that will be a decision for the people of Gower to make the choice on who they want to be their next Member of Parliament. Asked a second timeshe was happy for Ms OaposBrien to be a candidate the DWP chief replied: I think it’s a matter for the people of Gower on whether they want her to be their next MP. And they will have that choice next month. Ms OaposBrien made the comment at the time the controversial show aired on Channel . O’Brien also apparently endorsed a friend’s suggestion for “twat a tramp Tuesday” to “take your batts [sic] to the streets”. The candidate apologised, telling : “These comments were made off the cuff, a number of years ago. However, I accept that my use of language was unacceptable and I would like to apologise for any upset I have caused.” "},{"url":null,"title":"kevin maguire prime ministers brexit","story":"NewsopinionKevin Maguire: Prime Minister’s Brexit blunders will cost us all dearlyThe Treasury refuses to estimate the financial damage of Johnson’s Brexit bomb only because Chancellor Sajid Javid knows it is disastrousShareCommentsByKevin MaguireAssociate editor:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV NewsopinionBoris Johnson is an expensive nightmare for low and middle earners, the disabled, pensioners and users of public services\"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

The £million unbuilt aposluvvieapos garden bridge, illegal water cannons, narcissistic buses, the conceited Boris Island airport plan in the Thames that never took off and an expensive Taxpayers’ Stadium for West Ham United’s owners – who just happened to donate cash to the Conservative Party – were bad enough. But they are pennies compared with the pounds his party has cost the country, with their austerity programme – which has cut the economy, squeezed wages, destroyed public services and killed thousands of people – and now Brexit. The Treasury refuses to estimate the financial damage of Johnson’s Brexit bomb only because Chancellor Sajid Javid knows it is disastrous.    Experts at the respected NIESR think tank have calculated it would cost each of us £, within a decade by slashing £billion, or %, off the economy creating a Wales-sized hole. That’s on top of £billion thrown away on No Deal preparations – including a shipless ferry company – and £million on pointless October  virtual propaganda. His moronic “Get Brexit Done” mantra is as  as his Halloween promise to leave. The Tory quack knows a year, maybe years, of renegotiating how we live with Europe follows any orce from the bloc. Jeremy Corbyn delivers a big Brexit speech today in Essex in a smart move to address the issue. He can then focus an election fight on general issues such as wages, jobs, health, education and crime. Britain’s future in or out of Europe requires a fresh referendum, which Corbyn is offering, while Johnson wants to talk only about Brexit.

That includes when it becomes uncomfortable, unpalatable or personally inconvenient.So when the Conservatives promised to maintain free TV licences for the over-s in the  general election , there were no caveats or get-out clauses it seemed a straight pledge that millions of pensioners took at face value.But they reckoned without the sneakiness of the Tories, seeking to evade responsibility for their own commitments. And so began one of the more unedying spectacles of this Parliament: Conservative ministers desperately trying to wriggle out of their own manesto vow.  Slippery Boris Johnson, who is obviously wary of the row brewing as the election campaign hots up, said at the weekend: This needs sorting out urgently and Iaposll be talking to the BBC about how to sort that out. Well, for starters it “needed sorting out urgently” more than a year ago when the Mirror began warning of the threat to the benefit. Secondly, he has repeatedly tried to blame the BBC for Conservatives breaking a manesto pledge.

It’s just you, him, and the bomb, and you chat to him so you can buy some time in which you hope someone will come along, call the police, do the decent thing. So you talk to the soldier. There are lots of things he could be angry about with the people currently sitting above you – electoral fraud, using the NHS as a weapon, Brexiters campaigning against Brexit, Remainers who canapost agree on remaining – but the thing he is livid about is the Armed Forces Covenant. Not the idea of it, which is to ensure military personnel suffer no disadvantage due to their service, and sometimes get preferential treatment because of it. Nor the way it was enshrined in law in  with much fanfare, and the then-Prime Minister promising to “treat people with the dignity they deserve”.    No, he’s angry about the fact that within a year of it being made law, Parliament pissed on it. He’s angry that war veterans like him were made redundant just days before they qualied for a pension, while politicians facing reform to their own pensions got a higher salary to make up for it. Heaposs angry that veterans already investigated and exonerated of war crimes face being investigated again, even when no fresh evidence has been produced, and despite official promises it would stop. And heaposs furious that the veterans who gave their lives and their health for Queen and country - and in some cases, that of their wives and children as well - are still being ignored. Survivors of Cold War radiation experiments have been told evidence of their genetic damage is inconclusive that they must prove an injury sustained  years ago and that, eventhey do, they might be asked to prove it a second time.    Heaposs angry that ex-forces people still face barriers in finding jobs, homes, and mental health support. A study last year showed , veterans had psychological problems, , were in prison, and another , had no permanent address. He knows that everyone suffered in the past decade of cuts to public services. But he points out that those who are more in need of them always suffer most, and that only half of veterans who need that help ever ask for it. Heaposs particularly angry about the current governmentaposs commitment to the covenant, and the debt of honour it represents. He remarks bitterly that theyaposve finally signed it,  years on, and all that means is that the Tory party is now eligible for an employer recognition award. Oh, and theyaposve updated the the website.    Heaposs angry at the state of military housing,  years after the government said selling it off was a grand idea. Heaposs furious at the way his family had to go on a council waiting list. At how,they rent privately, a grasping landlord will rack up the rent for a building unfit for human habitation while their benefit is slashed. At how politicians call people who have to live in those homes scroungers, and say they should be put down. Heaposs angry at a Defence Select Committee report which said the Ministry of Defence was immoral and incompetent, and at a minimum income requirement for immigrants which blocks Commonwealth soldiers settling in the country they shed blood for. He quotes the committee chairman, who said: Every year we take evidence on the implementation of the Armed Forces Covenant, and every year we report similar complaints. The Government is failing in its moral obligation towards those who serve or have served in our armed forces. Heaposs angry about his mates killed for want of proper equipment, at a private defence industry quite literally make a killing with state-funded trips to dictatorial regimes, and heaposs angry at mealy-mouthed letters from politicians thanking him for his service and telling him thereaposs nothing they can do. He says politicians stand with the armed forces when it suits them, but turn their backs when it costs.    As he talks you realise youaposre angry, too. Youaposre angry about a Parliament that stopped governing in the nationaposs interest, and spent  years arguing over a thing that could not be done, purely because theyaposd staked their careers on it. Youaposre angry about allies who behave like enemies, knighthoods for men who hit women, a vice-admiral who consorted with a paedophile rapist yet keeps his pension, and his rank. Youaposre angry that because the people who took it upon themselves to run the country are unable to do so, youaposve been asked to re-elect Islamophobes, anti-Semites, incompetents and rabble-rousers so they can have another go at cocking things up, on a starting salary of £, a year.    You donapost like politicians pitting you against your neighbours because of how they pray or the colour of their skin. Youaposre perplexed about schools that have to shut down one day a week, about a NHS winter crisis that lasts all year, about a minimum wage which isnapost enough to live on. You thought all that crap was supposed to be over, by now. You remember how you were promised electoral reform in  and it never materialised. You wonder about the worth of a system that tells the critically ill to get up and work. You wonder how disabled people can have a better le without the allowances they need to pay for independent living.You realise that many veterans are disabled. And they are given the same crappy treatment as everyone , and often have to fight harder to be compensated by the employer who put them in harmaposs way.    You think about at your local postmaster, corner shop owner, launderette, binman, cabbie, cleaner, nurse, teaching assistant, council operative and heaven knows who  and wonder how, precisely, we’ll manage without migrants, and whoaposll be coming up with the points-based system youaposre told is such a great idea. Perhaps you look at your own bloodline. Perhaps you look at the history books. Perhaps, in the words of those who talk of sedition, treachery and surrender, you hear the echoes of bad people from bad times.

You stand there, feeling angry, and think about how  years ago a war veteran with  yearsapos fighting behind him, who worshipped the same God in a dferent way, who felt oppressed and angry about promises his rulers had made and broken, stood in the undercroft of the Houses of Parliament with  barrels of gunpowder, some coal and firewood, and matches in his pocket.    You think about how that veteran was seized and dragged before the king, how he and his fellow plotters were tortured with the rack and other instruments for  weeks to produce confessions, and how after a show trial they were taken to the yard outside Parliament so the politicians could watch as they were hung by the neck, cut down while still alive, castrated, disembowelled, and cut into pieces. Perhaps you know enough to remember that despite injuries so bad he could barely sign his own confession, Guy Fawkes was brave and quick enough to jump from the scaffold before the executioner could stop him, breaking his own neck and saving himself the extra agonies the state wanted to inflict. You wonder why we still celebrate the capture, torture and death of that man with a bonfire and fireworks, why we have forgotten that it was once laid down in law we had to do so whether we agreed or not, and that for centuries his desperation was used to persecute others who shared his faith.    You wonder how we all forgot why he was so angry, or that after he was gone the oppression for people like him simply got worse, and lasted for more than  years. You remind yourself we live in a country where Catholics were banned from marrying senior Royals until , all because Henry VIII took against them. Perhaps youaposd also wonder what the authorities would do to that Afghanistan veteranhe was caught red-handed with his bomb under Parliament, and how it would compare to what they would dohe was Muslim. You look over your shoulder at the door, and youaposre glad no-oneaposs come along yet. Maybe you wish him luck, and tell him that as Fawkes said on the rack a desperate disease requires a dangerous remedy. First photos of how temporary House of Commons will look in £BILLION refurb   Maybe you will try to talk him out of it, or go to find a policeman in the hope heaposll get help and the people who put themselves above will finally listen to those left below. Perhaps youaposre prepared to be optimistic about his chances of getting the help he was promised, and that he needs. Me  I think Iaposd quietly turn around, close the door, stick my elbow in the fire alarm and then let him get on with it.

The source said: The ISC doesnapost leak, it shouldnapost leak and this one has, in a very selective way. That has caused genuine concern.

MPs are electing a new Speaker for the first time in  years - less than  hours before Parliament dissolves for a general election. On the same day Mr Bercow - a former Tory - will resign as MP for Buckingham - leading to a race in his seat. But that contest will likely now be lumped in with the pending election. Current deputy Sir Lindsay Hoyle is the favourite while Labour grandee Harriet Harman is bidding to become only the second woman to hold the post. Todayaposs winner wonapost automatically be the Speaker in the next Parliament. But theyaposll be put forward as a single candidate to be aposconfirmedapos by MPs - so theyaposre pretty likely to keep the role. OnlyMPs vote down the new Speaker in December will there be another full ballot.  It comes after Mr Bercow - regularly accused of anti-Brexit bias but hailed as a hero of Parliament by his fans - finally announced he will bow out after a decade. The Speaker wept as he announced he would quit on October  in a declaration watched by his we Sally. The timing of his resignation was no coincidence. It meant the current Parliament - not a new one - could choose his replacement. That is important because it means a group of MPs who are against a hard, no-deal Brexit will be choosing the next person to oversee the legislature. Many of them are bowing out when Parliament dissolves on Wednesday So how will the Speaker election work and who is running  Heres everything you need to know.  MPs are voting for a new Speaker on Monday  November - the same sitting day that John Bercow quits as an MP. Candidates must submit their nomination papers, signed by at least  MPs from at three parties, to Commons authorities between .am and .am on the day of the election. Names of all the approved candidates are then published at am before a snap hustings in the Commons chamber at .pm - consisting of a speech from each hopeful. In the Speakeraposs chair for the debate will be Ken Clarke, the veteran Tory, because he is aposFather of the Houseapos - the longest continuously-serving MP in the Commons. MPs will then be given half an hour to vote for their favourite candidate on a ballot paper. If no single candidate wins more than % of the vote, the lowest-ranked candidateis eliminated and there is another round of voting. This continues until one candidate has won more than % of the total votes from MPs. A motion is then put to the Commons proposing the winner as Speaker. It can go to a vote again but by this point, they are likely to win. Traditionally the Speaker is dragged to the grand seat, supposedly against their will. Confirmed candidates Lindsay Hoyle Labour, Chorley, age . Odds:    The Lancashire-born businessman went to private Lordaposs College in Bolton and ran his own screen-printing firm before becoming an MP in . He has been a Deputy Speaker for nine years where his no-nonsense manner led to clashes with MPs - including telling off the SNP for singing EU anthem Ode to Joy in . In the same week he had a fierce clash with ex-SNP leader Alex Salmond, with the pair shouting at each other across the chamber over time slots given to Brexit scrutiny. Despite this Mr Hoyle is generally regarded as a popular figure who hasnapost made enemies in the same way as Bercow. There was an outpouring of tributes in  when his -year-old daughter Natalie was found dead. An inquest recorded an open verdict. Mr Hoyle was one of just three Labour MPs who did not declare their voting intention in the  EU referendum. His Lancashire district backed Brexit by % to %. Harriet Harman Labour, Camberwell  Peckham, age . Odds:     As Westminsteraposs longest-serving female MP, the QC is known as the Mother of the House with  yearsapos unbroken service. She spent more than two decades on the Labour front bench including as Deputy Labour Leader, Tony Blairaposs first Minister for Women and Leader of the House of Commons.  Born in London and educated at private St Paulaposs Girlsapos School, Ms Harman worked for the National Council for Civil Libertiesbefore becoming an MP in . Following a torrent of stories in the Daily Mail, she later said she regretted the NCCLaposs decision to grant affiliate status to a pro-paedophile group before she joined the staff. When she was elected barely  women had served in the Commons in its history. Her decades of activism for womenaposs rights led to mockery from right-wing pundits, including when she toured a pink bus round the country in . Her four-month stint as acting Labour leader, before Jeremy Corbyn took power, was marked by her decision not to oppose cruel Tory tax credit cuts that were later scrapped. Other controversies included being banned from driving in  after she was caught speeding at mph on the M. While in government she also tried to block the release of detailed Parliamentary expenses data. Due to her long experience and cross-party reputation, her name has been put forward as a possible caretaker Prime Ministerthe government loses a no confidence vote. Ms Harman was a prominent Remain-backer in  and though she has promised to be scrupulously neutral on Brexit, she has also warned she will be a champion for Parliamentelected. Her warning that she will take a robust stance could spark fears she will be a continuity John Bercow. Dame Eleanor Laing Conservative, Epping Forest, age . Odds:     The privately-educated solicitor from Paisley has spent six of her  years in Parliament as a Deputy Speaker, meaning she did not declare how she voted in the  EU referendum. She was a Special Advisor during the Thatcher and Major governments, and after her  election was an early Tory backer of equalising the age of consent at  for gay men. But she attracted controversy in  when she allegedly criticised a pregnant MP for leaving a debate to eat. She also voluntarily repaid £, during the  MPsapos expenses scandal over claims relating to a second home. Announcing her candidacy, she said the next Speaker should definitely be a woman as people need a breath of fresh air in Parliament. Meg Hillier Labour, Hackney South  Shoreditch, age . Odds: Not available  The privately-schooled former journalist and councillor served on the London Assembly before her election in . As Gordon Brownaposs Identity Minister she was tasked with promoting the failed ID card scheme - but was left red-faced in  when forgetting her own ID card at a photoshoot. She later served as Shadow Energy Secretary under Ed Miliband before rising to prominence as the hard-bitten chair of the powerful Public Accounts Committee. Pro-EU Ms Hillier voted Remain in the  referendum, voted against triggering Article  in , and earlier this year said Parliament should seriously consider delaying or revoking Article  to cancel Brexit. Chris Bryant Labour, Rhondda, age . Odds:     The privately-schooled former Church of England vicar dabbled with Conservatism as a student, before leaving the priesthood in  when he realised other members of the church believed the Bible doesnapost really like gays. He moved to London and rose through the ranks of the capitalaposs Labour groups through the s before his election to Parliament in . He shot to prominence soon afterwards for his role exposing wrongdoing in the press, including extracting a confession by then-Sun editor Rebekah Wade in  that the paper had paid the police for information in the past. He has become an outspoken voice on skin cancer after discovering he had melanoma on a trip to the barber. The MP voted Remain in the  referendum and said the whole country should have a chance to hold a second referendum on Brexit. His opening offer to MPs marked him out from John Bercow, emphasising that he would stick to rules and fairness. Dame Rosie Winterton Labour, Doncaster Central, age . Odds:  Not available  The privately-educated MP began her career as John Prescottaposs assistant in the s before her election to Parliament in . She spent almost a decade on Labouraposs front bench under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown before becoming the partyaposs Chief Whip in . Her six years in the top job presided over a tumultuous time in the party when more than  Labour MPs voted no confidence in Jeremy Corbyn but he refused to quit. Before becoming a deputy speaker in , which bound her to rules of impartiality, Dame Rosie voted Remain in the EU referendum but said it was important to respect the nationaposs vote to leave - including in her Doncaster seat. Sir Edward Leigh Conservative, Gainsborough, age . Odds:    The privately-educated veteran MP since  has only an outside chance due to his tub-thumping backing for Brexit. He has highly conservative views on social issues including backing the anti-gay Section  and voting against civil partnerships. Briefly a junior minister under John Major, the MP has spent all but three of his  years in Parliament as a backbencher including on the trade, procedure and parliamentary restoration committees.

He has tried to seek £, in damages from the University of South Wales over his  grade. Mr Riaz, who received the equivalent of a third class degree, said: Iaposm going to fight this evenI have to take it higher, even to the UN, reports Wales Online.  The student, who came to Cardf to study from Islamabad, Pakistan, claims he was not given the opportunity to continue his studies to complete an honours degree instead of a pass grade.  But his claim was struck out of county court in Cardf on Thursday after being described by the university as having no prospect of success. Mr Riaz added: Iaposm very, very keen that I take it as high as I can. A spokeswoman for the University of South Wales said all processes were followed fairly and accurately. Mr Riaz started his BSc hons chemistry degree in  but re-sat his first year after failing to get the credits needed. In , after suffering from poor health, the student said he suffered a fall on site, causing his second year modules to be deferred until the next year. As a result, Mr Riaz did not cover enough credits for an honours degree, and reached the maximum registration period for his course.  In a claim brought against the university, the international student described its decision not to allow him to take outstanding modules as unreasonable. But the university said Mr Riazaposs claim failed to particularise any cause of action and that arguments of unreasonableness did not fall under the courtaposs jurisdiction. Mr Riaz, who represented himself, said: I was quite good at my studies and I passed my English courses back home. I was the youngest and my family wanted to give me the opportunity for higher study. My parents are illiterate, they didnapost go to school. He added: A pass doesnapost mean anything to me. Having a pass degree is not going to help me to get anything. I wanted to do a PhD in organic chemistry. I was in my final year starting to apply for jobs in Europe, in the Middle East and do further studies. I had a couple of emails from Italy and Germany. They said were were impressed by my approach but unfortunately I do not have enough credits.

Michael, , and Paul Atwal-Brice, , say they found exposed wiring, dead cockroaches, dust and dirt on every fixture and fitting and, most disgusting of all, a used condom in the bed. The couple, from Barnsley, took their two adopted twins Levi and Lucas - aged  - on a dream holiday to the Walt Disney World Resort in Florida, US. But they claim what was supposed to be the trip-of-a-letime turned into an ordeal when they arrived at the £-a-night Caribbean Beach Resort hotel. Both boys are autistic and donapost speak, while they also suffer from epilepsy and asthma.    Having the room cleaned is important to their needs and the hotel was made aware of this, promising to clean and check the room before the familyaposs arrival. Disney World says the couple have received compensation numerous times, but claims their claims are exaggerated.Michael and Paul, who hit the headlines in  when they adopted two sets of twins - Levi and Lucas and toddlers Lance and Lotan, were terried about the dangers they claim the hotel room posed. Michael told : Straight away you could see the room was dirty then we saw a dead cockroach, which was quite big. There was lots of exposed wiring. Our boys have no sense of danger, so they could easily stick their fingers in that. There was so much crap and dust. You wouldnapost put a dog in there. It’s been a holiday from hell so far. Dead cockroaches and other bugs in  the room, broken lights with exposed wires and, worst of all, a used condom on the bed. The boys could have stood on the cockroach and could very easily have touched the condomthey dropped their bouncy ball down the side of the bed.  Levi and Lucas are severely autistic and require full-time care from their dads. This holiday was supposed to be like all their presents rolled into one. With flights, the Disney Package which includes tickets to Walt Disney World and the £-a-night hotel, in all the couple spent around £,. The flight took  hours before a two-hour ride on the Magical Express bus which takes holidaymakers to the resort.  After all that, the family were distraught with what they found. Thataposs what shocked us. Weaposve not just booked any old hotel. Weaposve purposefully booked this resort and spent a vast amount of money to make it all magical and special, said Michael. Itaposs supposed to be magical, once in a letime, but that was like a one-star bedsit. We couldnapost stay in there. The boys were upset and were screaming and distressed. It was a really bad start to the holiday.  When the couple complained to front desk at the Caribbean Beach, they say they were moved to another room. But to make matters worse, the next room contained just as much dirt and dust - as well as centipedes moving around the place, Michael and Paul allege.Michael said: It was more like Iaposm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! Having the room cleaned is very important to our boysapos needs. We made front desk aware of it and they said thataposs fine. They said it would be pre-checked but it was also really dirty and dusty, with centipedes moving around the room.

She had almost turned back on her way up the drive because the big house meant her nightmare was now reality. “It was a place people go to die,” explains Helen. “And my -year-old husband was moving in. I had to face what I’d been blocking out for months and admit ‘My Dan is dying’.” Helen, mum to nine-month-old George, had arrived at a hospice – Sue Ryder Leckhampton Court, in Cheltenham, Glos, and  days later her husband of  months died there from a brain tumour. But the care Dan and his family received transformed -year-old Helen’s views about death and is helping her grieve.    “They took the fear away,” she says. “They allowed me to be Dan’s we again, not his carer, so we could live those last days together.” Now Helen is backing a campaign to get us all talking about death. In  a Dying Matters campaign aimed to break this last great societal taboo. But research by charity Sue Ryder shows that, more than a decade on, we are still dodging the issue and denying ourselves “a good death”. They found % of people have not discussed their death with relatives, % haven’t written a will and fewer than % have planned their funeral.  Yet % of us know who we want to spend our final hours with and % have considered where, with most wanting to die at home or in a hospice. But % have no idea they can write that in an Advance Care Plan. Heidi Travis, Sue Ryder CEO, said: “We all need to start talking about the D-word. Deciding in advance how we want to die and having a conversation with loved ones will help ease and demysty the process.”    I spent a week at the hospice, one of seven run by the charity, and met with staff, patients, families and volunteers. Three-quarters of patients have cancer and others have degenerative or neurological conditions. And expert palliative care means half willhome after a first stay with their symptoms eased. Yet consultant Dr Paul Perkins, , explains: “There is still the stigma that this is where people come to die – and death is a taboo. We live longer and die in hospitals, not at home, so everyone is less aware of death – and it scares us.Our job is to make it as good as it can be by easing the physical process of dying. “We can’t ease the fear of leaving loved ones behind but we can help patients see that they’ve lived well. “And then, when that person is in their last hours – comfortable, warm, knowing that they are loved – we can look after the people holding their hands “That’s what hospices are about – loving people.”  I feel that sense of tranquillity and compassion while touring the wards with Head of Clinical Services, Debbie Williams, , who is a former oncology nurse. “I’ve been privileged to see many people die beautully here,” she says. “When patients first arrive they’re scared they will be writhing in agony when they die. We explain that they’ll start to sleep more, then be in and out of consciousness and gradually their breathing will slow and their body will shut down. Then they’ll die. “I don’t use euphemisms like ‘passing’ or ‘slipping away’. It’s important to be honest.” She goes on: “Of course it’s sad and sometimes I have a cry on the way home. “My mum died suddenly five years ago, just weeks after being diagnosed with cancer and after that I talked to my dad about his wishes. “My husband’s a paramedic and we talk to our kids, who are  and , about dying and where we’d like our ashes scattered. It doesn’t have to be a big issue. “You can do it in a casual way when something comes up on telly. But talking about death removes the stigma and helps us live our best lives.”    During my visit several patients are very close to death and the emotion of their families is palpable. They sit with their loved ones, popping out for a quick break in the family lounge. Volunteers are on hand to chat to patients and relatives. One volunteer, Pat Howard, , says: “I wanted to give something back after Mum died here in . We’re trained to handle dficult conversations but it’s about listening and empathising. “A young mum once asked me ‘How do I tell my son I am gong to die ’ “I arranged for our family support team to talk to her but also said ‘When my father died we’d look for the brightest star in the night and say That’s Dad’. She found that a help because her little boy had bought her a star for Mother’s Day.” Patient JJ, , has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease which ­worsened when she got flu and pneumonia. Husband Bob, , was spending every day at her bedside.    “She had antibiotics in hospital but they didn’t work and she was transferred here for a bit of extra care,” he says. “The staff are amazing,” smiles JJ beneath her oxygen mask. “Nothing’s too much trouble. You are a person, not a number. And I’m as comfortable as I can be.” Then I meet “S”, who has advanced oesophageal cancer. The disease has affected her vocal cords so she talks in a whisper. “I can’t swallow properly so I don’t want to eat,” she says. “But they always find something I can fancy – yesterday I had the ice cream from the middle of an Arctic Roll. Lovely.” She squeezes my hand. “I can’t change things,” she says, “but I have asked for Holy Communion because I think I’ll find it a comfort.” S died a few days later. Chaplain Rob Pestell, , is the least “churchy” man you could meet. He explains: “Some patients see the dog collar and say ‘Sorry, I’m not very religious’, I respond ‘That’s good, neither am I!’ “I get to know what makes them tick – and I say ‘That is your spirituality’. Most patients have accepted they are dying but some say ‘I’m a hopeless case’. I try to help them see the value of their le.”    Kath Keogh, , teaches hospice staff to talk to patients about death. “We can all do it better,” she says. “We have birth plans but don’t say how we want to die. Death is seen as a failure, not a natural part of le.” Hospice catering assistant Claire Pemberton-James, , says her job is a privilege. She meets all the patients as she tours wards taking meal orders. “Many don’t want anything,” she says. “ButI give someone four peas and half a fish finger and they enjoy it it’s the best feeling in the world. “You really get to know them through chatting every day or sitting holding their hands.” Claire was so inspired by her work that she wrote a moving song called The House on the Hill “...where love resides and the weary can rest”. It was performed at the annual Lights of Love service and a video features on the website. Receptionist Mandy Edwards, , is the first person frightened relatives meet when they arrive. She started working at the hospice after her father died there in . Six years ago her husband Bob, , died there too. “His death confirmed everything that is wonderful about this place – the peace and support,” she says. “Not one person walks through that door willingly the first time. “So I’m here to say ‘You’re here now – we are going to look after you’.”    Helen Hopkins felt that emp­athy when she arrived to book her husband Dan into the hospice last July. He worked for a bank and she was a hospital administrator when they met in . But four years later Dan got an itchy mole on his back, checked – and was told he had malignant melanoma. Three years later it had spread to his brain. “Dan never wanted to know how long he’d got,” she says. “So we never talked about him dying. “Then last June he got much worse. One night he didn’t recognise me and I started to realise he wasn’t going to get better. But when they mentioned the hospice I was terried. “When Dan arrived in his room he was very sick and a load of nurses came and took over. That’s when I realised I was just his we again. “I was terried of being a widow on my own with a nine-month-old baby. “But the process of Dan’s dying was dealt with and I could talk about it.” "},{"url":null,"title":"first picture toddler who fell","story":"NewsFirst picture of toddler who fell to death through faulty tower block windowDevastated mum Duygu Agac said she had reported a problem with the window handle before the tragedy in Tottenham, north LondonShareCommentsByBerny TorreWilliam JanesDave Burke:,  NOV NewsEighteen-month-old Ali feel to his death from the north London block of flats\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Adam Ellison is pictured smiling and goofing around with his friends at the Old Mill Pub in Prescot, Merseyside, in the images.A few short hours later he was stabbed to death as he headed home, the Liverpool Echo reported .The -year-old had got caught up in an argument with people on the back of a scrambler bike while walking the streets with his three friends. Adam was rushed to hospital but died a short time later. Two years on from the November  tragedy, the killers have still not been brought to justice.  Two -year-old males and a -year-old man, all from Huyton, Merseyside, were arrested last month, and have since been released under investigation. Adamaposs mum Joyce Ellison, , along with two sisters Nicola Moore, , and Joanne Evans, , spoke about losing Adam. Joyce said: He was part of our family for nearly  years and now we have got the rest of our lives without him. Itaposs destroyed us. We are a very close family and it has affected everyone.  You get your good days and your bad days, sometimes itaposs like a rollercoaster. You start laughing over something and then you feel as though you shouldnapost be laughing because heaposs not here with us and Iaposm finding something funny. I wouldnapost wish it on anybody. Adamaposs older sister Nicola said that younger members of the family have been deeply affected by his death. Itaposs two years but it doesnapost seem that long at all. It seems like weeks, she said.  The impact has been horrendous. Itaposs had a ripple effect on the family and the children in the family and we still have trauma and therapy because of that night and what we saw. We miss him so much, he was a massive part of our family and he was loved by everybody. We miss him everyday. Nicola went on to reminisce about her brother, who was always making people laugh and was the le and soul of the party. She added: He had such an infectious laugh and cheeky dimples, I miss that.  Joanne explained why the family were releasing the new photos of Adam. I want the photos to show people how Adam was just being himself that night, when he went out with his friends and his family, she said. I want someone to look into his eyes and realise how beautul a person he was and to think I canapost stand knowing something any more and not coming forward.  Joyce urged anyone with any information about the killers to come forward. She added: Youaposve got your whole le ahead of you but Adam hasnapost. Iaposm angry. Iaposve gone through dferent stages but angry that these people are still walking around. What would their mum thinkit was her son that was murdered  Sheaposd want someone to speak to the police then. The family are not doing him any favours and heaposs got to face up to what heaposs done, we want justice. Joanne added: Come forward because look at my mum. How can they sleep of a night knowing a little bit of information  They might be scared but thereaposs no reason to be scared. Detective Chief Inspector John Middleton, of Merseyside Police, described the attack and the impact it has had on the family. “This was a senseless assault which brutally cut short the le of an innocent young man who had everything to look forward to, he said.His family have been left devastated by their loss and they still have no answers to why this horric incident took place. “But I want those responsible to be under no illusion.

The inquest heard she was at an end-of-year school trip with staff and friends from Jameah Girlsapos Academy in Leicester. After Evha fell in she tried to climb up the travelator to follow the vessel her friends were in before disappearing from sight from both other witnesses and the CCTV. A teacher tried to climb over the barrier wall to get to Evha but was not able to do so.    She was later spotted face-down in the water by a park member of staff. The inquest heard Evha and other pupils on the circular vessel had been repeatedly standing up, and reaching into the water, against the rules, before it struck a barrier, sending her head-first into the water. Evha and four friends boarded the boat without a teacher after the member of staff allocated to look after them stayed with another pupil who did not want to go on the ride. The inquest at Staffordaposs County Buildings was told by Detective Inspector John Quilty, of Staffordshire Police, how Evha - who was unable to swim - initially fell into water up to her thighs. Appearing uninjured, she was then shown on CCTV wading along the edge of the ride route, towards the exit , trying to get back to her friends.Her schoolmates were shouting back towards Evha while another member of the public stood at the ride courseaposs barrier a few feet above told her to stop where she was.  The youngster, who was still in the water, carried on wading and then attempted to climb the rideaposs travelator which lts the ride vessels up out of the water, to an exit . But as she climbed the algae-covered wooden planks on the mechanism, she fell off the side into a much deeper area of water at the park in Tamworth, Staffordshire. After pupils and members of the public raised the alarm, theme park staff rushed to the ride and began a search. Some  minutes after staff were alerted to Evha originally going into the water, Evha was spotted face down. It was another six minutes before theme park staff were able to pull her out, when she was described as leless. Despite CPR being administered at the scene and advanced le support by air ambulance medics, she was pronounced dead less that two hours later at Birmingham Childrenaposs Hospital  Opening an inquest into her death on Monday, assistant coroner for South Staffordshire Margaret Jones said Evha and her friends had been on the ride without incident accompanied by teachers, earlier that day. The hearing was told that according to the theme parkaposs ride height restrictions, Evha was allowed aboard the vessel without an adult. A signed risk assessment prepared by the school before the trip stated that a member of staff would be allocated to groups of five or six primary age pupils, like Evha, while the older secondary age pupils could supervise themselves. DI Quilty said: The member of staff allocated to Evha and her group remained at exit and did not join her group and her intention was to meet children as they came off exit. Meanwhile, three other member of staff boarded a dferent vessel, travelling four boats behind Evhaaposs. A member of the theme park ride staff said he observed the good behaviour of Evha and her friends boarding their vessel. But CCTV showed that as soon as the ride begun, Evha and some of the other girls were leaving their seats and not keeping hold of the safety rail.

The sheep is shown being beheaded as it hangs in mid-air in the shocking video recorded at Farmers Fresh abattoir in Wrexham, north Wales. The disturbing video, whichhas decided not to publish in full , also shows sheep on a conveyor belt struggling under the weight of headless corpses. Sheep are also seen getting their heads and limbs stuck in the conveyor belt, with one having its throat cut after being trapped. Pictures taken at the abattoir, which is supposedly aposunder investigationapos, also shows sheep carcasses lying on the slaughterhouse floor, having died from unknown causes. The footage filmed during July and August  was released by animal protection organisation, Animal Equality.  The group claims much of this suffering took place when a Food Standards Agency inspector present. Workers are also seen brutally yanking at the trapped sheep out of the conveyor belt. The RSPCA has stated that it has aposconcernsapos about the footage, and has called for anyone with information to come forward aposas a matter of urgencyapos. Abigail Penny, acting executive director of Animal Equality UK, said: “These defenceless animals are treated like commodities, placed on a conveyor that delivers them to their death. Slaughterhouses are inherently unforgiving places and this systematic neglect – made all the worse by poorly designed equipment – causes even more distress for these terried lambs and sheep.” She added: “We demand justice for these vulnerable animals. The Food Standards Agency must take immediate action against Farmers Fresh Wales and their own officer who failed in his duties. If people want to stop supporting the suffering that takes place in slaughterhouses, it has never been easier to choose plant-based options instead of meat.”    Fellow animal welfare charity, Animal Aid filmed abuse in the same slaughterhouse earlier in . Its undercover exposé prompted the launch of a criminal investigation by the Food Standards Agency . Animal Equality has sent a letter of complaint reporting the findings to the FSA, in which it urged it to take enforcement action against Farmers Fresh.

Natasha Sherwin did not consider that her waters had broken at  weeks pregnant when she woke up in soggy sheets. The retail assistant and her husband Sam, , merely laughed it off together as they assumed she had embarrassingly wet herself in her sleep. The mood changed dramatically when the -year-old went to the toilet and discovered blood. After arriving at hospital, she was told by medics to prepare for labour. However, after  agonising hours passed and there was no sign of a baby, she was advised to opt for a termination as there was just a two per cent chance of survival. But Natasha was determined to give her little girl a fighting chance and incredibly, her motheraposs instinct proved right.    Against all the odds, her baby managed to stay inside her until the  week mark, with just tiny amounts of fluid to protect her. Natasha, from Elgin, Scotland, said: I was shocked to hear my waters were broke, I thought perhaps I had an accident until I started bleeding. Every time I moved in the hospital, water would trickle down my leg and doctors thought I was going to give birth. I was praying for the best but expecting the worst, two days later, I was askedI would like to terminate but my answer was always no. I decided I would let mother nature take its course - I wasnapost going to kill my baby. The pregnancy complication is known as pre-term premature rupture of the membranesand meant Natasha and her baby were at a high risk of developing an infection. The mum-of-two had to stay in hospital for two weeks following her waters breaking to seethe fluid levels would increase.    She says: I was warned my baby probably wonapost survive and askedI would like to terminate weekly until I was  weeks pregnant. I just couldnapost do that to my baby - I could feel her moving inside me and I just knew I had to let her fight. The fluid would build back up but disappear again - the highest it ever got was cm and for  per cent of my pregnancy there was none their protecting Faith. Her pregnancy was at a high risk and doctors kept her in from  weeks to ensure she was under close supervision. Natasha and Sam welcomed their daughter into the world on  January, . The newborn weighed  lb  oz and was immediately taken into NICU.   Unbeknownst to Natasha she had ingested E.coli which led to sepsis the day after she gave birth.She added: I was on deathaposs door. I was struggling to catch my breath and unable to speak. I couldnapost even see Faith as I was getting sicker and sicker. Sam was told to prepare for the worst as a CT scan discovered my right lung was full of fluid and the left was also filling up and I had pneumonia. I had my first cuddle with Faith after a week, I felt horrendous and still unable to move but I needed to see my baby.    Natasha spent two weeks fighting for her le and believes without the blood transfusion she received wouldnapost be here to see her children grow up. She said: Once I got better and was told about the severity of my little girlsapos condition, I was in shock and couldnapost believe this was happening to my family. The first six weeks of Faithaposs le were spent in hospital and after five weeks at home she was emergency flown down to Edinburgh because she stopped breathing and they had to put her on the le support machine. She was fighting for her le due to catching bronchitis and having chronic lung disease her body couldnapost fight it off without her having a machine to breathe for her.    She developed a blood clot in her leg and stomach that caused her leg to go grey and her toes were black. Tasha and Sam were faced with the aposhardest decision of their letimeapos as medics said they can either amputate her leg or give Faith medication to reduce the clots, but with a high risk of bleeding on the brain. She continued: Thank god the medication worked but her health continued to decline as her left lung collapsed due to a build-up of mucus.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA man who received a le-saving transplant from a teenager has described his emotional first meeting with the boy’s parents. Martin Strang, , was born with a congenital heart and spinal condition and later suffered complete kidney failure. He had been on dialysis for four years when stranger Toby Hart, , tragically died after plunging from a clf during a family holiday to Cornwall. The teenager’s parents honoured his wish to gt organs, and his heart, kidneys, liver and pancreas were all donated.    Martin, who received Toby’s kidney and pancreas, has now become close friends with Toby’s parents Sally and Graham after meeting them for the first time. Team GB transplant archery champion Martin said: “I was so nervous I sat in the car for about  minutes beforehand, wearing my Team GB kit, thinking ‘what do I look like  Are they going to like me  “But Sally, Toby’s mum, put her arms around me and hugged me for about ten minutes. It was a very emotional meeting. “Now we keep in touch all the time via text and facebook messages. Sally says ‘We’re family now,’ which is lovely.” Knitting shop worker Sally, , added: “Ever since Toby donated, I’d been really keen to know how the people who received his organs were. “What I love about Martin is that he has done so many things since having the donation. “I always think of it as Toby and Martin doing them together which is just lovely. “It’s not just that Toby is living on through other people, it’s that Martin has made the most of what he has been given. “Toby dying wasn’t a waste. That’s what’s really important.” Toby, of Warrington, fell ft to his death at Cadgworth Cove on Cornwall’s Lizard Peninsula in July . The tragedy came in July  just five days before his th birthday. Toby, who was on holiday with his parents and younger brother Stephen, had decided to become an organ donor two years earlier. His family decided to discuss the subject following the death of his grandmother. Sally explained: “When he applied for his provisional driving licence he ticked all the boxes for organ donation and it was a huge help when he died.    “We didn’t even have to think about it. At the hospital we were able to say ‘you don’t even have to ask because we want him to be an organ donor’. “There were lots of decisions we had to make – including what colour coffin we wanted - but this was the easiest one.” Martin was born with several serious medical conditions and diagnosed with Type  diabetes as a toddler. This resulted in him suffering kidney failure, leaving him reliant on dialysis to survive. Insurance broker Martin says he didn’t have a sporting bone in his body before receiving Toby’s kidney. But he decided to immediately take up a new hobby. Martin, of Falkirk, Scotland, explained: “I wanted to do something to honour Toby and celebrate getting my le back and just fancied archery as it’s such an inclusive sport.” By  he had become so proficient that he has taken home medals at British, European and World Transplant Games. He had also been put into contact with Sally and Graham through leading transplant charity the Donor Family Network In May this year Martin was making a trip down from Scotland to a Team GB when Toby’s parents asked him to meet on the spur of the moment. He pulled off the motorway and met them at hotel near their home for a coffee.    During the meeting Martin discovered that he shared many interests with his donor, including motorbikes and archery. He said: “We’ve discovered all sorts of uncanny similarities. My first holiday after the transplant was to Lake Garda– a place where Toby had holidayed. “Soon after the transplant, I bought a motorbike – unaware that Toby had bought a moped just before he died. “And when I asked: “Out of interest, did Toby ever do archery ” they both looked at each other and said he’d done a course as a child. I thought ‘this is just crazy’. “To get a gt like this is amazing. But to have so many coincidences with your donor is even more amazing.” Martin wears an archery armguard bearing Toby’s name, while his quiver belt is inscribed with the words: “For the needs of the many – in honour of Toby.” He met Sally and Graham again at the Donor Family Network annual service memorial service at the National Arboretum, at Alrewas, in September. Martin added: “Over the summer I visited Toby’s grave, placed my leather arm guard there for him to watch over and spent half an hour talking to Toby thanking him for what he has done for me. “I’ve told the family ‘it’s Toby doing this - not me. Every time I pick a bow up I’m thinking of him. “I’m getting word out there to raise awareness of the importance of organ donation and encourage people to tell their families about their wishes.” Nigel Burton runs the Donor Family Network, a charity which helped bring Martin and Toby’s parents together. He said: “When recipients and donor families meet it’s a very emotional time and it can be hard for both sides.

Mostly that’s because at first, I reasoned that it was only fair from Facebook’s mysterious algorithms that I — a -year-old woman in my childbearing prime from advertisersapos point-of-view — might be interested in baby content.    The wall-to-wall baby spam was irritating but amusing — a bit like an overbearing relative asking me when I’m going to hurry up and get married.  I mentioned it in passing to a few friends - and initially chalked up the phenomenon to my age, and maybe because I frequently ‘like posts’ from friends with babies across my social media profiles. But yesterday I made a discovery that transformed the experience from odd, to downright creepy. It became clear Facebook actually thought I was pregnant. And I think I know why.    aposBig Motherapos is always watching Like many women, I use a period tracking app to chart my monthly cycle. Yesterday, I opened the app to make an update, only to find an alert flashing at me. It was informing me that my period was very, very ‘late’. In fact, it wasn’t late at all. I had simply forgotten to log last month’s cycle properly, and, because I have notications for that app turned off, I hadn’t noticed when I didn’t complete the entry. But the app had certainly noticed. I corrected my cycle, and almost instantly the baby ads just stopped. It was then I began to feel uneasy as my mind made the connection between my period tracking app believing I had missed a cycle ten days ago, and my Facebook account that was suddenly trying to sell me pregnancy paraphernalia within days of my period appearing to be ‘late’. I have used this particular app for so long I don’t even remember when I downloaded it, or why I chose that particular brand.    So I pulled up the app’s privacy settings and noticed that while it promised not to share details I ‘entered manually’ with its third-party partners, the terms and conditions’ language cleverly avoided ruling out sharing information about aggregated data - like patterns or trends. I have chosen not to name the app here - it is not a well-known one, and appears to have been made by a small developer. Unless I have smoking-gun proof that it was selling my data to Facebook advertisers, I am not willing to make the accusation and damage someone’s business - they may have meant well, and it is an app I had until now enjoyed and used loyally for years.    What’s more, I wasn’t sufficiently troubled by the bizarre ads when I was seeing them to check the ‘why am I seeing this’ option on Facebook, or even to screenshot them. This problem of proof is not just a quandary for journalists - but for any of us who are concerned enough to try to investigate how our personal data is collected and shared online. Tech companies have an incentive to use opaque language, and the process to work out which apps are communicating with which websites, how often and why can become a confusing process as a result.  What I experienced has come to be known as ‘surveillance capitalism.’ For lay people like me, big tech has long felt like a wizard behind a curtain — clever, capable of changing how we experience the world in wonderful and spectacular ways — but ultimately powerful without enough accountability. This experience has confirmed to me I know too little about how much my social media technology and apps know about me. In a world where advertising is no longer restricted to billboards and magazines, I don’t want it to become so intrusive it leaves me feeling unnerved.    How did we get to this point  Humans are naturally fascinated by our own health - many of us love to count our steps, track calories, record our fitness routines in ways that can help us improve our lives immensely. It is a no-brainer that developers and social media giants have worked out how to monetise that precious data, and I hadn’t lost any sleep over it- yet. In many ways, algorithms have made my le better, more convenient, and more efficient. Those clever little trend-snfers have connected me with my new favourite bands, learned my style and promoted dresses and shoes I’ve dutully then gone on to purchase. Algorithms have uncovered my guilty pleasure and push the juicy ‘agony aunt’ columns I love to read to the top of my news feeds. But algorithms are rather like the body’s bacteria - you might not be able to see or understand them - but you can be certain they are not always working for you. Yesterday, a sinister thought popped into my mind. In future, my social media tech is likely to know I’m pregnant before I do - and I find that deeply unsettling. You might have heard about how US retailer Target was able to figure out a teenage girl was pregnant before her father did. Many people who were disturbed by my story after it went viral on Twitter noted, darkly, the news that Google has acquired Fitbit. Any time a company gathers more of your data, you have to wonder how soon the information being collected now to sell things to you now be weaponised against you in future. Where does it end  It is clear the dystopia is already here. Insurers are already linking customers’ premiums to their diet and health tracking apps, rewarding those who lead a healthy lestyle and penalising those who don’t. The dark side of period tracking apps has been well covered by tech journalists.    Icky stories have emerged in recent years revealing some companies were secretly using period tracking calendars in an attempt to track the moods of their female employees. But most upsettingly, an overwhelming volume of responses I received from women who had experienced a similar phenomena on their social media revealed it was happening following pregnancy trauma. Multiple women revealed they were still being slammed with ‘happy baby’ advertisements on their social media feeds after miscarriage or stillbirth. This is inappropriate, disturbing, and is something that should be a priority for the human beings behind these algorithms to find a way to address. However they do it, surely it must be done without forcing grieving women to give up even more personal information in the process. Inevitably, I can imagine that this could lead to yet more sponsored posts hawking things for sale - like happy pills and self-help books. Chillingly, as several women who have had miscarriages have claimed to me - they received ads for infertility treatment immediately after their pregnant loss. For anyone trying to get pregnant and struggling, the cheerful baby ads must be a galling reminder of their situation, sandwiched callously between pictures of what your old high school friends had for lunch and viral dog videos. aposWhy donapost you just use a paper calendar apos Many people asked me - somewhat condescendingly from men who have zero experience in this field - ‘why donapost you just use a paper calendar to track your period’  Without revealing more information than I am willing to share with the world , these trackers can be le-changing. Many, many women in your le will not not lucky enough to have an easy, pain-free, cycle that runs like clockwork. For many of us, it will be a constant, monthly feature of our lives for the better part of three decades.    Many women I know track their periods for their clever in-app analysis s. The apps give you knowledge - and knowledge is power. Tracker apps can help us save time, money and prevent embarassment. Some women have irregular cycles, and some are struggling to get pregnant.  Some might have corresponding health problems that worsen throughout their cycle, their hormones might affect mental health disorders and medication, or they may be using a natural counting method because they can’t use hormonal contraception for health reasons.  On the convenience side - which is really no one ’s business but a women’s own - knowing their cycle patterns might affect anything from when and how they choose to have sex, to what colour clothing they wear on a due day. It might give them a warning to pack sanitary items in advance, rather than avoid an expensive late-night rush to a corner shop for a heavily marked-up box of tampons.  Some using these apps will be trying to get pregnant- many are also using the apps to avoid it. Knowing exactly what stage of your cycle you are at when you are most at risk of pregnancy is a great help to many heterosexual women, who are still largely lumped with the responsibility for contraception with all the costs to their health and wallet, and the trial and error that comes with it.    The way many of the apps are designed assume the user would be happy to get pregnant - they are often pink-themed, focused on analysing when you are ovulating, and flashing excitable messages when your period is late. It lead me to wonder how many of these apps meant for women are designed by men - a quick spot of research confirmed mine was.  If you donapost think that matters, author Caroline Criado Perez has recently written a book about how products designed by men - from ill-fitting spacesuits to car passenger seatbelts designed for men’s bodies - can actually end up excluding and even endangering women. We are the products for sale Since my tweets about my discovery went viral, I’ve been thinking about my next steps.  The solution doesn’t have to be for me to stop using a tool that has improved my le on a monthly basis. But this has been is a welcome wake-up call for me. I will be learning more about how to more carefully navigate technology that mines my personal data, and about how to investigate it as a journalist. My experience reveals the cynical side to these mysterious algorithms that meticulously analyse my online behaviour to construct a picture of my fears and desires - to then sell on to advertisers. When we hand over our data for free in exchange for a small online convenience, we become the product for sale. It is up to me to work out now what my boundaries are, and to decide the price of convenience. While I might like the algorithms now that direct me to nice dresses and new music now, I can’t help but wonder how that data could one day be used to shape my future. On that question, Charlie Brooker’s brilliant Black Mirror series is already giving me nightmares.

The convicted drugs mule, who was locked up for trying to smuggle £.m-worth of cocaine in her luggage, said the women would openly get together behind bars. She often didn’t know where to look but was barely acknowledged. The -year-old claims some of the female inmates were known as “chetos” and used for sex, but many of the other prisoners craving affection would also join in.    Writing in her new book, Youaposll Never See Daylight Again, she said: “When you’re sharing a bedroom with  other people any right of privacy is out the window. “You see each other shower, you see everyone peeing, what’s a bit of sex between you and your most intimate  mates  I have to admit to being surprised by a couple of the relationships. “The chetos signposted their sexuality. Any time they hooked up with one of the more feminine inmates I wasn’t surprised, except when they found each other.  “Others spent so much time showing me pictures of their children and husbands I had to do a double take when I saw them face down in someone ’s cleavage. When their bloke visited, they’d be all over him. But for those cold winter nights in between they had alternative sources of comfort. “And when they got down to it they were so passionate it was like the world was ending. I was transfixed by their intensity. I’d never seen anything like it.”  Michaella, from Northern Ireland, was  when she and pal Melissa Reid, from Scotland, were arrested in the airport at the capital city of Lima in . She was initially sentenced to more than six years behind bars, but served just over two years in the maximum security prison. She was released in March  and has since given birth to twin boys. Describing one sex act between two inmates, she said: I was chatting when I got a nudge from the girl on the other side of me. I turned around.

She was screaming, she was shaking and she was crying. Mr Smith said Miley had been full of excitement when she set out to go trick-or-treating.   The mum-of-six said she decided to let the youngster join her -year-old sister Imogen and her friends for the Halloween tradition while she stayed at home with her youngest child, three-year-old Bradon.They were all so excited and off they went with their treat bags, she said. At the time I thought they would be safe just around the locals doors. But a short time later a neighbour, called Christopher Henderson, brought an hysterical Miley back to her familyaposs house and told Vicky she had been bitten by a dog. Christopher came running down shouting that she had been bitten by a dog, Mrs Smith explained. It was horrendous. I just lted her over the fence. He said he heard all the girls scream and the dogs were going mad. He said he had never heard anything like it. The children told Vicky they had knocked on the door of a nearby house, and as a woman inside handed out treats, two large dogs forced their way out causing the children to run away in fear. Vicky believes Miley tried to escape by climbing over a small gate, but at this point one dog bit her just above the buttocks. After Miley was brought home Vicky immediately called police, and the NHS  helpline, who advised her to take her little girl to hospital.  She was transferred from Wansbeck General Hospital to the Royal Victoria Infirmary, in Newcastle, where a consultant said Miley would need surgery. Mrs Smith said: Miley had to undergo surgery and have the wound cleaned and stitched, which was worse than they initially thought. We then had an overnight stay on intravenous antibiotics. We were discharged on November  with follow up appointments. The mum said she has been amazed by her little girlaposs bravery. She said: Sheaposs so tough, sheaposs been brilliant.  She loves dogs and says sheaposs still not scared of them, but she hasnapost seen a big one since it happened. But Mrs Smith is so concerned about her daughter being attacked again that she isnapost letting her go trick-or-treating next year. She said: I let her go out with her sister and then this happened.

These are just some of the distressing sights that have greeted visitors to zoos in Indonesia this year. Now animal rights groups say an astonishing % of these attractions should not be allowed to operate. Earlier this year a video of a distressed-looking skeletal sun bear was shared around the world. And there was widespread condemnation as pictures emerged of animals living in filthy conditions at another zoo.    These are among a string of controversies which have prompted calls for urgent reform to end the suffering. Marison Guciano, of the Indonesia Animal Welfare Society, told the South China Morning Post: “According to a search by wildle monitoring group the Scorpion Foundation in , around % of zoos in Indonesia are unfit for habitation. “I think the situation has not changed much now.” He said most zoos fail to meet five key criteria - keeping animals free from hunger and thirst, free from pain and injury, free from discomfort, free to behave as they would in the wild and free from stress.    In June shocking video of a sun bear at a zoo in Singkawang was shared more than , times on Twitter. The clip shows the skeletal animal stretching as tourists look on. In response the West Kalimantan Natural Resources Conservation Agency said it would monitor the bear. More shocking pictures taken at a mini zoo in Cilodong, West Java, show animals in tiny cages surrounded by litter, were met with horror.  A visitor wrote on Twitter: “The situation is very improper, and this is open to the public. Are there actions that can be done  Guys, what should we do about this ” Zoo bosses blamed tourists leaving behind litter, and pledged to clear the attraction up. Another video filmed in March at the Taman Safari Cisarua in West Java shows a trainer appear to lash out at a tiger to make the animal look at a camera while visitors pose behind it. In a letter to the countryaposs Minister of Environment and Forestry, after the clip emerged, activists wrote: We stand against wildle attractions for the sake of entertainment rather than education. These attractions are a form of animal abuse and exploitation. Animal trainers and showmen frequently engage in negative reinforcement, whipping and striking animals, forcing them to carry out unnatural tricks and demonstrating that the animals can only be aposcontrolledapos by pain and fear.

Anstey Campbell also ended up on a ventilator for almost three months and is still under hospital care after first experiencing tingling in her toes when she ed from a run on January  this year. Thinking it was nothing, she got ready for work but by lunchtime the sensation took over her feet and in the afternoon it had spread to her hands so she went to her GP who wasnapost concerned and said it could be stress related. That evening her legs became weak and her knees buckled when she stood up and the next morning, after a sleepless night due to chest pains, she fell to the floor as her legs were so weak. The paralysis worked its way up her body but luckily Ansteyaposs mum knew she needed to call an ambulance for her daughter and she was rushed to hospital.    Within  minutes of seeing a doctor Anstey, who lives in Dargaville, New Zealand, was diagnosed with Guillain-Barre Syndrome . The condition is a muscle weakness caused by the bodyaposs immune system attacking the nervous system. Anstey was transferred to ICU, but as her breathing deteriorated and her entire body became paralysed, even her eyelids, doctors decided to put her in an induced coma for a week to save her lungs. Doctors lowered Ansteyaposs sedation after and she was placed on a ventilator for  days. Doctors looked for a response after lowering the sedation, but there was nothing and they believed Anstey was completely unresponsive, however for  days she was actually experiencing locked in syndrome when the whole body is paralysed but a person is still conscious and aware of their surroundings.    Locked in syndrome was terrying for Anstey because she was desperate to communicate with doctors who were asking her for responses, but as hard as she tried, nothing happened and with her eyes shut she could only tell day from night by the visitors she could hear. She said: On the morning of January , I noticed pins and needles in the toes of my left foot after a run before work, but I didnapost think anything of it. By lunchtime I had pins and needles in both feet, I thought it was the new shoes I was wearing so went home and changed them, said Anstey. By mid-afternoon the pins and needles had spread to my fingertips, so I went and saw a GP because I thought it was weird. He didnapost seem concerned because I still had fullin my hands and feet.    He suggested that perhaps it was anxiety, and tothe following dayit hadnapost improved. I remember him bringing up GBS, but we brushed over it because itaposs so rare so we thought surely it couldnapost be that. That evening I was walking downstairs and my legs began to buckle, which was the start of the weakness which later turned into paralysis. Overnight I developed chest and stomach pain, it felt like bad indigestion, but no medicine relieved the pain and it just kept getting worse. I later learned it was a sign of my diaphragm and lungs slowly shutting down.    The next morning, as I got out of bed, I collapsed on the floor due to extreme leg weakness. I was living alone at the time, but luckily my mum had come to stay with me. I kept saying Iaposd be fine, but her motheraposs intuition kicked in and she came. We called the ambulance and I was taken to our local hospital where I saw a GP who was well known to me. The weakness was spreading to my upper body and face by this time. Within  minutes, the doctor diagnosed me with GBS and she told me what to expect and referred me to the emergency department of our nearest major hospital. I spent the day in the emergency department getting tests and scans before being transferred to ICU for closer monitoring.    Over the course of the day, I slowly became paralysed from the legs to the top of my head. By the time I was intubated I was so weak I could barely open my eyelids. My breathing was deteriorating, and the doctors could see the struggle I was having to breathe so they decided to put me under to protect my lungs. A few days after being intubated, it became clear that I needed long-term respiratory support. So, they decided to give me a tracheostomy and put me on a ventilator for  days. After around a week of being fully out, the doctors lowered my sedation and from what they saw I was completely unresponsive, but I was actually locked in, it was the most terrying thing imaginable.    I remember the doctors tried all these tests to get some sort of response and it was really terrying when I realised I was stuck inside. I was trying to do what they were telling me to, but nothing was happening. I remember the doctor pushing hard on my brow bone to try and make my eyes open, it was so painful and all I was saying inside was aposstopapos. It was terrying being unable to communicate, especially as I was so uncomfortable and I couldnapost say I was in pain. With my eyes permanently shut, it was dficult to establish day from night and my only cue was when the visitors dwindled. The first movement I got back was a twitch in my jaw, and it became one twitch for yes and two twitches for no.    Anstey was given five rounds of IVIG treatment and then five rounds of plasmapheresis. After  days on the ventilator, Anstey had to learn how to breathe again something which was once so natural but became a dficult task. Anstey is still in hospital, but she canhome each weekend. She has regained some strength in her upper body and has recovered movement since doing physio twice a day for the last six months. When I woke up, I was told that I had been quite sick, and my case was on the severe side so it would take me while to get off the ventilator and breathe for myself, said Anstey. When I came off the ventilator, I still had the tracheotomy so although the ventilator wasnapost breathing for me, I was still breathing in and out of my tracheotomy site.    When they capped that to seeI could breathe out of my mouth and nose, I only lasted a couple of seconds before they had to take the cap off. Itaposs bizarre to think that your body can forget how to do something so automatic like breathing. When I was in ICU, I was having chest physiotherapy twice a day to help remove secretions from my chest and prevent pneumonia. I was also getting assisted movements every day to prevent stfness. Since being in rehab, Iaposve been doing more intense physiotherapy twice a day to strengthen the movements I do have.

We knew we had three games in a week andwe can get all the points it would be huge.“There is starting to be wee gaps in the league, not huge ones but it was getting tight and congested not long ago. Everyone was beating each other.“To open a gap at the top would be huge for us.”Appere entered the fray on Tuesday night after just three minutes, with Peter Pawlett’s night cut short by a hamstring injury picked up with  seconds on the clock.Although he wasn’t expecting to be involved in the match so soon, the forward was ready to go out and play wherever he was needed.And the Tangerines kid was pleased to see them come through a testing game against the bottom-of-the-table Jags.Appere added: “I’d just sat down and was getting comfy to watch the opening part of the game and then, next thing I know, I’m coming on.“I had to adapt as quickly as possible to the game and, of course, you’ve got to be ready for the match.“I can play up top or off either side so it’s just whatever the manager tells me to play and whatever helps the team.“I’m happy to do that.“Just to get on and show what I can do by getting the assist, I was happy with that.“I think we knew it was going to be a tough game. You can’t look at it and think ‘they’re bottom of the table, this should be another win’ – it was always going to be a tough game.“To go out there, battle like we did and get the three points was really important for us.“It’s good to go out there and you have to be switched on, even after we got the goal.“It was a bit of a battle but we knew we needed the win on Tuesday. To get that was really important for us.“Obviously, the most important thing was the three points and moving on to Inverness tomorrow.”Appere provided a terric assist for Shankland to nod the winner in off a post but, rather than take the praise for his excellent delivery from the left, he was quick to praise Shanks for what he brings to the table, not only for the team but for Appere as a young player.“It was an alright ball in but it’s the header. It’s a great finish again from him.“To have somebody like that to just put the ball into and win you the game like that is just brilliant.“He was giving me advice throughout the game again and, even in training, he’s a great player to learn off.”With the Dundee derby coming around next Friday, Appere hopes to be involved again after scoring in the last one.“Hopefully, I can get some game time in the derby and I’m looking forward to that.

win over Morton on Friday night, it appears the stars might finally be aligning for Dundee.It wasn’t their best display of the season, far from it, but for manager James McPake a third win on the spin shows where he wants to take the Dark Blues.That kind of sequence is something the Dee haven’t achieved since November   when Motherwell, Hamilton and Kilmarnock were seen off consecutively in the Premiership.And James will hope stringing together Championship wins like the ones over Ayr, Alloa and Morton more often will see themto the top-flight.Although that is the long-term aim for Dundee, in this run some short-term concerns have also been addressed, with monkeys shaken off backs in the process.The - success at Ayr represented Dundee’s first away win of the season and they went back-to-back for the first time in the Championship this term as they comfortably dispatched Alloa -.Those were, undoubtedly, big steps in the Dens men’s development under new boss James, with the victory against Morton no less important.With the late collapse to a - defeat against Partick Thistle in their last home match still fresh in the memory, when Cameron Salkeld quickly cancelled out Kane Hemmings’ opener at Dens on Friday night, there may have been some doubts over Dundee’s mentality to bounce back.However, they collectively quashed all those worries with an onslaught of attacking football which finally brought the winner through Jamie Ness  minutes from time.That it was Ness who struck made it all the more sweet, given his recent injury troubles, while it also piled pressure on promotion rivals Dundee United, Ayr and Inverness for their clashes the following day.United responded excellently, downing Caley Thistle - in the Highlands, with the Honest Men enjoying a superb - win over Partick and their former boss Ian McCall on Saturday.After the weekend’s action, the Dee now lie third in the table and are in a good position for the second Dundee derby of the campaign set to play out at Dens this coming Friday night.They will want to put the first edition of the fixture back in August behind them and look in a far stronger position to do so.That it will be a - sort of game again, on the form of both teams, is out of the question.League leaders United have maintained a fair pace since that impressive win at Tannadice and lie six points clear of their city rivals.And, although the gap between the two sides before the first match, just three games into the season, was four points, the Dee are a better team now and won’t submit so easily.There has been a sea change at Dundee since a - defeat down at Morton in September and that, in no small part, is down to the acquisition of Graham Dorrans.Since the -year-old former West Brom, Norwich and Rangers man made his debut off the bench in that clash, the Dark Blues have won four games out of their last six, a draw at Queen of the South and that disappointing late loss against Partick aside.He has been fantastic in that run, with others like Kane Hemmings, Paul McGowan and Declan McDaid also stepping up to the plate on a consistent basis.Contributions from all of the above led to a perfect three wins from three last week, however, unfortunately for the Dee, United have gone toe-to-toe with them.It seems, instead of waiting for the Terrors to slip, the Dark Blues will need to take matters into their own hands soonthey are to turn promise into promotion."},{"url":null,"title":"britbox-streaming-service-pricing-announced","story":"UK streaming subscription service BritBoxwill

Two men were paid to accompany Patrick the Fool on his journey from England to provide entertainment for the King and his guests while residing at Tarbert.Also recorded is a figure for #making a suit for the King at Tarbert#.  Bruce visited Tarbert on many occasions. His final visit was in the year of his death.Tarbert is believed to have been one of the earliest Royal Burghs in Argyll. An early reference as such was made in . It is also said to have had one of the earliest paved streets in Scotland.King James IV also had a close connection with Tarbert. The addition of the #keep# to the castle, part of which still stands today, was constructed at his direction. Whilst this work was underway, James summoned parliament to meet him here to discuss matters local to the area. This meeting took place on July  .Over the years, many travellers of note have passed this way and commented on Tarbert and its scenic surroundings.In  Thomas Pennant arrived by sea at East Loch Tarbert and described the scenery as #picturesque#.CGS Teighnmouthpassed through the Kyles of Bute in  and commented that #it offers no scenery worthy of notice#. He continued to note that #the romantic little harbour of East Loch Tarbert – with the overhanging keep of its ruined castle # form a scene singularly picturesque#. He became a frequent visitor to Tarbert.In  Lord Cockburndescribed the Kyles as #rugged and picturesque# but, arriving at his destination, exclaimed: #But Tarbert! East Tarbert! How is it that I had never even heard of that curious little bay. There it lay, calm and silvery, like a scene from a theatre. A striking and beautul spot.#In the modern era, many thousands of tourists visit Tarbert each year.

Around  resident berth holders and more than , visiting leisure craft during the sailing season add considerably to the numbers who arrive at Tarbert and appreciate the attractive surroundings.The present plans for the power line, however, as exhibited by SSEN, will present a view on entering the harbour despoiled by a line of monster pylons.The current proposal suggests that four or five of the -foot pylons will dominate the western skyline. The visual impact of this scheme as presently proposed will have a negative effect on the experience of everyone who lives in, or visits, Tarbert.Tarbert was designated as a conservation area in the s. Argyll and Bute Council imposes restrictions on works likely to have a visual impact on its appearance.But the council has apparently raised no objection to this visually damaging proposal. Similarly, Visit Scotland is reported as having raised no objection as well as closing all its tourist offices in Cowal, Mid Argyll and Kintyre in the past year.With the recent decline in the Loch Fyne fishing industry, Tarbert is increasingly dependent on tourism to provide employment.Other issues include the sterilisation of ground under the proposed line of overhead wiring. Opportunities to extend social housing will be restricted under the present plan.OFGEM administers a £ million fund set up to mitigate the impact of electricity infrastructure on national parks and #scenic areas#.Tarbert, along with its harbour and the isthmus linking it with West Loch Tarbert, without doubt, constitutes a #scenic area#.Reconsideration of this proposal is essential."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column october 4 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsTo an observer, it seems that Argyll and Bute Council is, at best, confused over its approach to autism.The people who know this best are those affected by the condition and their families and their view of senior council officials was made crystal clear when Autism Argyll gave up banging its head against a brick wall a year ago.Little seems to have changed since then.A council Autism Strategy Group is apparently being bypassed in the formulation of a strategy, yet the councillor in charge of health and social care says the strategy is the responsibility of the HSCP.Yet again, it is people affected by autism who are losing out.

Her partner Rebecca Taylor read music as an organ scholar at Lincoln College, Oxford before attending the Royal Academy of Music where she was a Junior Fellow and completed the MA in Piano Accompaniment.The audience were introduced to the pair with an intense piece by Mozart about burning letters and it certainly woke us up. We moved onto Schubert’s #Du Bist Die Ruh# which was beautully controlled by both singer and pianist.This was contrasted with Shubert’s angsty #Gretchen am Spinnrade# and I commend Rebecca Taylor for playing the right hand part with ease. The journey then moved through Schumann and into Brahms where the audience murmured in agreement at the rollercoaster of emotions before us.As we reached Wolf the themes took a darker turn in a short but intense piece about crying tears of blood. Swtly moving onto Strauss and Mahler the audience were given songs of simple love, a sing off between a cuckoo and a nightingale and a man in great pain which reigned the audience in with a spiritual lull.The second half opened with a stunning rendition of Faure’s #Apres Un Reve#. Through Debussy’s impressionist piece, Rinaldo Hahn’s Operatic journey and into Du Parc comforting his love with a dream like harp created by the piano.The duo then gave us a contemporary piece by Joseph Horowitz which comprised of snippets from the monologues of Shakespeare’s Lady Macbeth and the music tracks her descent into madness. It was aAs a light and fun ending we were given #I can be a sexy lady#, a piece about poor mezzos and how they always play boys and not much  in operas.

This link resulted in the pupils being invited to be a part of filming.On the day of filming pupils were taken to Kilmartin Museum where they met with the cast and crew and chatted over a hot chocolate before the hard work began.Heading out to Nether Largie, the pupils were encouraged to explore the southern cairn and were filmed weaving in and out of the cairn and lting up rocks.The crew even gave pupils the opportunity to get involved with the filming, passing the responsibility of holding and positioning lighting equipment over to them, as Brendan O#Hara # who ha since been elected as MP for Argyll and Bute # directed.Filming for the Argyll episode took place in April  and although it has not yet been aired it is available on the STV Player, so it came as a bit of a surprise to guidance teacher Jamie Wire when a pupil announced they had spotted him on TV.He commented: #It#s funny how it has all come to light now as the pupils were all in S- and now only three remain in school, all in S.

A fantastic solo effort in a - win capped a great team performance. Tom would have run around with the customary shirt over the head celebration, however he found the snug fit just too much to pull over his head.By the time the final game took place the team had both done enough and run out of steam.

This was followed by Debussy#s Premiere Rhapsodie which was written as a test piece for a competition at the Paris Conservatoire this requires of the performer the full range of colour and technique which was deftly delivered. Finally we were given Poulenc#s last Sonata. In this, and many of his works, he was rebelling against the Impressionist style and was particularly reflected in the outer fast movements with often angular and zany writing.The second half of the programme started with the Saints-Saens#s Sonata # also his last work. Unlike Poulenc, here he was harping back to the th century#s more classical style style of composition.Their official programme ended with a highly-virtuosic rendition of Chausson#s Andante and Allegro, but we were also given a short and charming encore # one of Gerald Finzi#s three pieces for clarinet and piano.This was all chamber music of the highest quality Maximiliano#s musicality, technique, emotional expression and tonal range were exemplary as indeed were those of his accompanist, Scott. It was patently obvious from their opening bars that they had played many times together with the rapport between them a delight to witness.

It will include a new toilet, shower, laundry and kitchen building,  new camping pitches and  motor home pitches, most of which will have hook-ups.The total project will cost around £,. In addition to HIE’s contribution will be an award of £, from the Rural Tourism Infrastructure Fund, with the balance from IGHT.It is expected that the modern site will strengthen the local economy by an additional £, a year and that other businesses on Gigha will benefit from the increase in footfall and visitor spend.The Isle of Gigha camp and motorhome site is due to welcome its first visitors in autumn , after which it will be open throughout the year.Strategic planning to secure a strong, sustainable future for the Mount Stuart Trust and the Isle of Bute is at an advanced stage, with key decisions expected by spring .Speaking ahead of the next phase of community consultations, Colin Boag, managing director of Mount Stuart Trust, said: #We are working intensively with community groups, Argyll and Bute Council and the Scottish Land Commission to develop a range of initiatives to improve the rural and urban landscapes on the island of Bute and to unlock growth opportunities for the local economy.#There is a great sense of purpose and commitment from everyone involved. This is matched by a desire to make progress on a number of crucial projects. The trust will conclude a strategic review by the end of the year. In conducting this - year ‘look forward’, we have been well supported through discussions with iniduals and community bodies across the island.#As part of the overall review, we are creating a specic rural strategy focussed on building a sound, sustainable future for farming and forestry on the island. Following an initial consultation with key stakeholders in July, we are developing the rural strategy through a number of joint working groups. These are examining key priorities including dairy farming, rural training and skills, forestry development and the environment.#Our emerging rural strategy builds on work completed with Argyll and Bute Council to support their bid to the Scottish and UK governments for a multi-million-pound Rural Growth Deal. Working together with the council, Fyne Futures and the Bute Island Alliance, we drew up a proposal for investment of £million to pilot on Bute a new transformative rural development model for niche food and drink and primary island industries.The trust is also consulting with local communities about the proposals to release urban land for community projects. This important work is being conducted in line with the Scottish Land Commission’s protocol on community engagement.In August, Mount Stuart Trust, with Scottish Land Commission representatives, held an urban community workshop with key community organisations in Rothesay. Discussion centred on how potential community projects could utilise land in Rothesay, which is currently in either council or trust ownership.Colin Boag added: #Throughout the discussions with ious community representatives, a number of local groups have expressed interest to make use of some or all of the land on offer. We welcome their interest in creating opportunities for positive change on the Isle of Bute.#I am confident that the depth of collaboration between Argyll and Bute Council, the Land Commission, local communities and the trust is set bring a strong sense of renewal and confidence to the island.#It was a trip to the Co-op and trollies at the ready for Lochgilphead High School pupils, as they were set a mission in aid of the Argyll Foodbank.Staff from the school ided the group of S pupils into teams, giving each an inidual budget to stick to.

Kyles put together nice build up play, working the ball wide to Robbie MacLeod near the corner flag.

Funds raised go towards the peace building work of the Peace Pledge Union, who are unashamedly against wars and the causes of wars.On Tuesday November  and Thursday November  we will be selling white poppies from the foyer of the Lochgilphead Co-op.Bob Dixon, MinardSir,I agree with the points made by Robert MacIntyre in last week#s edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser, when he says that the proposed education cuts are #madness#.This madness is being forced on councils by the SNP government and its Green Party allies at Holyrood, who for years have been voting for Scottish Government budgets which force councils to make cuts.Unless the SNP and the Greens change course and stop cutting the money they give to councils, this madness will continue.I hope that Mr MacIntyre, a former SNP councillor, will write to the leaders of the SNP and the Greens and demand they give councils enough money to stop these mad cuts.Councillor Alan Reid, Liberal Democrat candidate for Argyll and ButeDear AileenWe are responding to your recent consultation about the council budget.Whilst we are very sympathetic to the dficulties that all public bodies, including the Scottish Government, have faced as a result of a decade of austerity it is only fair to point out that this was imposed not by the Scottish Parliament, but by Westminster.The truth is that overall the Scottish Government has maintained the overall funding for local government, as a share of the overall budget, at around  per cent.Councils have, once again, the option of raising additional funds by increasing the council tax, something they have sought for a long while.The inidual share of the total funding allocated to councils is decided by COSLA, using a needs-based formula. Argyll and Bute Council will receive a total of £. million to fund their services in - which, taken alongside the council tax increase they have decided to implement, will give the council an additional £. million this year compared to last – a rise of . per cent.They will also receive their fair share of the extra funding that has already been announced during the current financial year including £ million for teacher’s pay and £. million for increased teacher’s pension contributions.The council could do a number of things to improve its own prospects.You and your administration could work hard to influence the COSLA formula which does not favour rural authorities with falling populations. The Scottish Government Cabinet Secretary for Finance has confirmed to us that he is always willing to consider suggestions, through COSLA, from inidual local authorities.You and your administration could be more imaginative in streamlining central management and devolving delivery and local decision-making closer to local people.You and your administration could maximise income whilst remembering that local businesses are the leblood of recovery. The recent massive hike in inspection charges for food products is an example of the wrong decision being likely to damage the economy rather than enhance it.You and your administration could maximise your assets by working with communities. The council has been slow to undertake any signicant asset transfer which could lead to useful and productive partnerships.You and your administration could be more responsive to, and careful with, communities. The waste of money and time on things like the abortive Traffic Regulating Order for Mull and Iona indicates where you are not using resource wisely and storing up dficulties for the future.You and your administration could ensure that any cuts do not fall on essential services needed for future success. The proposed reduction in educational support staff is an example of where a choice is being made that will not only be counterproductive in terms of our collective future and wellbeing, but will also lose the council local sympathy and support.And you and your administration could prepare to use the already agreed additional £ million for the rural growth deal – coming jointly from the Scottish and UK Governments # to make a long term dference in your performance by instituting a step change in the local economy.As your local constituency parliamentarians we are committed to ensuring the maximum resource comes from central government to Argyll and Bute.We are always happy to work alongside, and in support of, the council and we would be keen to meet to help you develop a detailed plan for the future of the area we are all elected to serve. But we must all be straight with local people and explain that responsibility for the dficulties that the council is experiencing do not all lie at the door of the Scottish Government, and therefore nor do all the possible solutions.Michael Russell MSP and Brendan O’Hara MP"},{"url":null,"title":"21-year-old-accused-injuring-ex","story":"A STOW man has been accused of struggling violently with his former partner to her injury.David Steel, , of Mitchelson Farm Cottages, denies the offence said to have happened at the Tesco Car Park in Galashiels on June .A trial date has been fixed for December  at Selkirk Sherf Court."},{"url":null,"title":"skerryvore-set-christmas-selkirk","story":"SKERRYVORE are coming home to Scotland for Christmas.And they plan to get into the festive spirit with a party at Selkirks Victoria Halls.Skerryvorersquos ability to fuse traditional Scottish music and rhythms with a range of other genres is a trademark of their distinctive, high-energy sound.For more than a decade brothers, Danieland Martin Gillespie , their friends Fraser Westand Alec Dalglish , have been thrilling audiences all over the world.The addition of Craig Espie , Jodie Bremanesonand Alan Scobie onand their sound became even greater.With awards galore and sell-out tours all under their belt,  has been Skerryvorersquos busiest year to date, with performances in the USA, Canada, Australia, and all over Europe.But now they are ing to Scotland for the festive season.And to kick off the celebrations they will play the Victoria Halls on Saturday, December .Drummer Fraser West told us: \"Winter tour dates usually find the band at home in Scotland.\"It gives us the chance to spend the festive season with our families.ldquoSelkirkrsquos Victoria Halls is a new venue for us, and wersquod like to think it will be the first of a number of s to dferent Borders venues.The Skerryvore in Selkirk show starts at .pm.Tickets, priced at pound, are available from the Live Borders website."},{"url":null,"title":"focus-smallest-gallery-gala","story":"The Focus Centre in Galashiels is inviting visitors to what it claims is the smallest art gallery in Gala.It can be found in the foyer of the centre but, according to organisers, blink and you will miss it.The glass fronted wall cabinet was first used properly to house items and artefacts to coincide with Remembrance .But Mark Timmins, from Works Plus, and Tracey Alder, from Focus Crochet Group, put their heads together and discussed how the little cabinet could be used best in the centre.And so the Smallest Gallery in Gala got its name.Showcasing their handy work in the tiny gallery this month is the Crafty Dafties group run by Pat Johnston and Sylvia Knaggs who meet on a Wednesday at am till pm.They specialise in an array of crafting that includes quilting, sewing with all kinds of fabric, knitting and more.

There are many people walking around freely drinking during these times.ldquoThis makes it dficult to identy those young people who are underage drinking when there are such crowds.Another wrote: ldquoIntoxication in these areas is unpleasant to witness. In all cases we are entitled not to be subject to the loudness and antisocial behaviour this leads to.On the other hand, some respondents voiced their concerns about bringing in alcohol bylaws: ldquoI think itrsquos a complex situation which deserves time and thought. Irsquom not entirely sure that reacting in a retrospective way is the best approach.ldquoI feel there are many behaviours and traditions entrenched in Scottish and Borders society around drinking habits.ldquoI feel personally that there are alternatives for many people socially that do not centre around drinking or going to the pub, such as the cinema, concerts, sports, dining out, etc., but not everyone has the imagination or willingness to explore these as valid ways to enjoy yourself.Another objector wrote: ldquoDrinking in public places doesnrsquot cause a problem in itself. Issues arise when certain iniduals drink alcohol to excess in any setting.ldquoThe problem, in my view, wonrsquot be solved by a blanket ban on alcohol in public spaces. There are already laws to prevent antisocial behaviour but they need enforced.Police Scotland also provided a detailed response to the consultation. It reads: ldquoAlcohol bylaws are used within the three other local council areas within Lothian and Borders, namely East Lothian, Midlothian and West Lothian.ldquoBy having such bylaws in force it assists Police Scotland in reducing anti-social behaviour and violence both of which are known to have an association with drinking in public.ldquoCurrently the Scottish Borders area is the only local authority area in Scotland that does not have bylaws restricting the consumption of alcohol in public places.NHS Borders, Borders Alcohol and Drug Partnership and Scottish Borders Children and Young Peoplersquos Leadership Group provided a joint response, which reads: ldquoAlcohol consumption can take place in our communitiesrsquo private space as well as within licensed premises.ldquoNot allowing people to drink in a public place will help to reduce the normalisation of alcohol being an ordinary commodity and builds communities and environments that supports a culture change and reduces exposure for our children and young people.ldquoPublic drinking can adversely affect the quality of le for residents and our communities.ldquoAlcohol Focus Scotland report that one in two Scots experience harm from anotherrsquos drinking and often this harm is experienced in public spaces .ldquoIn this study % had experienced harm to others in public places and this was mostlyexperienced by the younger age group .ldquoAlcohol bylaws can be used as an additional tool to reduce the nuisance and disorder normally associated with public drinking.ldquoLicensed premises are well regulated within the Scottish Borders and provide the opportunity to consume alcohol in a safe environment.ldquoThe Scottish Borders is the only local authority area in Scotland that does not have bylaws restricting the consumption of alcohol in public places.Councillors will now be asked whether to conduct further consultation on two options: a blanket ban on public drinking to cover the whole of the Borders, or the introduction of an alcohol ban in certain areas of the Borders. Police Scotland has indicated it would prefer the first option, to ease the enforcement of the ban.Furthermore, councillors are asked to consider undertaking a pilot scheme in specic towns, which could then be used to gather further feedback from the public."},{"url":null,"title":"golden-granny-hilde-aims-fashion-success","story":"AN archery gold medal winning grandmother at the British Transplant Games is setting her sights on fashion.Hilde Paxton from Clovenfords, who had a liver transplant shortly after her th birthday, struck the bulls-eye at Newport earlier this year.And the -year-old is already preparing to defend her title next year by raising vital funds for her Edinburgh Transplant Sports Team.Hilde is hosting a fashion show on Saturday, November  in Galashiels.She told us: \"Edinburgh Transplant Sports Team has around  members from all over the east of Scotland who take part in the Transplant Games.\"An important part of being a member is helping to raise the funds required for sending members to the British Transplant Games.\"The Colours Fashion Team will take to the Focus Centre boardwalk on the Saturday for an evening of glamour and casual wear.Included in the pound ticket price is a complimentary glass of Prosecco on arrival.As well as the fashion show, there will also be a grand raffle and a licensed bar.Tickets for Hildes fashion show, which starts at .pm for pm, are available from the Salmon Inn and Focus Centre, Galashiels, the Bridge Inn and The Gt Shop, Peebles, or The Hub in Innerleithen."},{"url":null,"title":"top-up-tap-plans-galashiels","story":"GALASHIELS is set to become the first town in the Borders to receive an official top-up tap.Scottish Water has already installed the water stations in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen, Dumfries, Dunfermline, Ayr, Oban and Fort William as part of its Your Water, Your Le initiative.As well as providing healthy drinking water, the refill taps will also reduce the number of plastic bottles which are currently in circulation.Scottish Water now want to install the top-up tap in Market Place -

after falling into ft of water at Drayton Manor theme park was allowed aboard the river rapids ride without a teacher, an inquest heard.Evha Jannath was ldquopropelled from a six-seater vessel on Splash Canyon on May  , while on an end-of-year school trip with staff and friends from Jameah Girls Academy in Leicester.An inquest heard Evha and other pupils on the circular vessel had been repeatedly standing up, and ldquoreaching into the water, against the rules, before it hit a barrier, sending her head first into the water.Evha and four friends boarded the boat without a teacher, after the member of staff allocated to look after them stayed with another pupil who did not want to go on the ride.Headteacher Erfana Bora said the teacher acted in line with the schoolrsquos health and safety policy on the day.She said: ldquoWe canrsquot stipulate teachers must be on rides, as there will be instances where some children would not wish to be on the ride, and so in those cases itrsquos safer overall for the teacher to stay with that childhellip they make the assumption the park staff are responsible for overall safety on that ride.The inquest at Staffordrsquos County Buildings was told by Detective Inspector John Quilty, of Staffordshire Police, how Evha, who was unable to swim, initially fell into water up to her thighs.Appearing uninjured, she was then shown on CCTV wading along the edge of the ride route, towards the exit , trying to get back to her friends.Her schoolmates were shouting back towards Evha, while a member of the public standing at the ride coursersquos barrier, a few feet above, told her to stop where she was.The youngster, who was still in the water, carried on wading, and then attempted to climb the ridersquos ldquotravelator which lts the ride vessels up out of the water, to an exit .But as she climbed the ldquoalgae-covered wooden planks on the mechanism, she fell off the side into a ldquomuch deeper area of water at the park in Tamworth, Staffordshire.After pupils and members of the public raised the alarm, theme park staff went to the ride and began a search.Some  minutes after staff were alerted to Evha originally going into the water, Evha was spotted face down.It was another six minutes before theme park staff were able to pull her out, when she was described as ldquoleless.--vw,vw,px, px\"Police at Drayton Manor Theme Park in  --Despite CPR being administered at the scene, and advanced le support by air ambulance medics, she was pronounced dead less than two hours later at Birmingham Childrenrsquos Hospital.Opening an inquest into her death on Monday, assistant coroner for South Staffordshire Margaret Jones said Evha and her friends had been on the ride without incident, accompanied by teachers, earlier that day.The hearing was told that according to the theme parkrsquos ride height restrictions, Evha was allowed aboard the vessel without an adult.A signed risk assessment prepared by the school before the trip said that a member of staff would be ldquoallocated to groups of five or six primary age pupils, like Evha, while the older secondary age pupils could supervise themselves.Mr Quilty said: ldquoThe member of staff allocated to Evha and her group remained at exit and did not join her group, and her intention was to meet children as they came off exit.Meanwhile, three other member of staff boarded a dferent vessel, travelling four boats behind Evharsquos.A member of the theme park ride staff said he observed the ldquogood behaviour of Evha and her friends boarding their vessel.But CCTV showed that as soon as the ride began, Evha and some of the other girls were leaving their seats and not keeping hold of the safety rail.Mr Quilty, who led an investigation into the incident, said: ldquoAt no point do we actually see her saton the ride.Describing the moment the youngster was ejected from the vessel, he said: ldquoEvha is sat out of the seats, in the gap .ldquoShe is sat down at this point in time, and when the boat makes contactndash at the worst possible time ndash she stands up and, as a result of the propulsion and force of the barrier, that propels her out of the vessel.ldquoShe is just standing up, and as soon as she makes contact with the barrier she is pushed out, therersquos nothing behind her and she naturally falls out.Dr Frances Hollingbury, a Home Office pathologist, said she had determined a cause of death of drowning, although it was initially recorded as a result of blunt force trauma to the chest.She added that although Evha suffered multiple rib fractures, possible injuries to the lungs and a broken pelvis, she ldquowouldnrsquot have expected Evha to have died as a direct result of these injuries, without complications.The

That race took place over the course of last weekend.The series featured five rounds at dferent venues, and each race was set up like a car rally, with untimed uphill transition stages leading to ious timed downhill sections, the results of which were amalgamated into an overall race time. The stages ied massively in , from as little as  seconds to an absolute behemoth we endured at Laggan in April which took us  minutes to ride! The topography and trail surface dfered wildly from venue to venue but also from stage to stage, and the taped trails we raced down last weekend at Fort William epitomised this eclectic set-up.Stage  was the easiest and least technical track we have raced on all year, an entirely man-made sprint through flowing banked corners coated in compacted quarry dust. Of course you had to be careful you didn`t push too hard, it is all too easy to wreck a race run by hitting the deck on an easy stage. We assumed that the organisers were trying to lull us into a  sense of security with stage #and we were so right!Stage  started halfway down the legendary World Cup track , channelling riders through some savage rock gardens before cutting off to the right along a lung-busting fireroad before descending into another sculpted hardpack track which then erted down a horrendously muddy, freshly cut chute that was littered with roots big enough to swallow a bike wheel whole. Even walking down it was impossible.A big transition ride towards Torlundy took us to the top of stage , which was the famous Blue Crane trail running into Ridgeline. Both of these tracks are black-graded on a good day, but there is a huge dference between trying to ride these ‘for fun’ and then trying to race on them once  people have spent a whole Saturday skidding them to bits in the tipping rain! A lot of people fell foul of this stage, but we survived and we absolutely loved it.Stage  was a dferent animal altogether. We had tackled it fairly early on practice day and hadn`t had any issues with it, but the swarm of maniacs who had ridden it in the rain since our earlier visit had turned it into an absolute swamp and the ruts were so deep that I found it almost impossible to negotiate with my limited skills. Dave telling me afterwards that he had romped it didn`t help my mood one bit!The last  stages were so high up the mountain that we needed a trip on the gondola to get to them. The black graded Top Chief track is a fearsome animal that follows the best twisty bedrock line around the hill before plummeting several hundred feet straight down off it into the tree line below, where it once again becomes sanitised into a flowing, twisty and utterly hilarious serpent of a trail that had riders drting and whooping all the way to the carpark. The organisers had cleverly split the Top Chief track into two stages, as there is a long section of perched wooden boardwalk high up on the mountain that is great fun to ride but would be far too dangerous to race on. Stage  was therefore very short -taking most riders about  seconds to ride- while stage  was a  minute monster. What a way to finish a season!So how did we do David was fastest of the three of us, as he has been all season. He finished in a time of  minutes,  seconds. He races in the Senior category , so it is a tough school littered with sponsored riders and crazy kids. He finished th in seniors on the day, and th overall out of an entry of  riders. Having failed to finish the race at Laggan earlier in the year due to a mechanical breakdown, David has been constantly playing catch-up but he still managed to finish in a brilliant nd place overall in the seniors category for the season.Alex has ridden consistently all year and has managed to tread the fine line between wrecking and ruling perfectly at every round. He had one of his very few crashes on the last stage at Fort William which cost him a few seconds, but he still ed a very respectable time of : to finish nd in the Masters category. The Masters section almost always attracts the largest entry and it is full of well-heeled chargers on very expensive steeds, so for Alex to finish in th place in that championshipin his first full season is a highly respectable result.I have continually been either on par or just slower than Alex on nearly every stage of the year, and nothing changed here. I knowI`ve kept within a few seconds of him I have done just fine, and I managed my ride to achieve this perfectly right up until the last stage where a cruel puncture right on top of the hill put paid to any chances of a good result to finish the year. With  top s already in the bag for the season though , I managed to hold onto th place in the Grand Veteran`s championship which was some consolation for a day that finished with me feeling, well, a bit deflated.Competing in this series has been a brilliant experience for us. We have had some hilarious times racing our bikes through some of Scotland`s very best scenery, and we have loved camping out of the back of vans. The organisers at No Fuss Events have done an outstanding job of setting up a professionally run race series in some dficult locations and have always managed to tread the right side of a precarious line, providing us with stages that have been just barely on the rideable side of ridiculous!David Muirhead leads Alex Dickson down the rocky Top Chief track during Saturday#s practice.

A high-energy showing in Paisley saw the McFadyens-sponsored side run out convincing winners.With the match going ahead at the Kibble’s grass park despite the heavy rain overnight and during the week leading up to the game, the surface was in surprisingly good condition, allowing the Pupils to get into their attacking flow early on.Up against a home side not lacking in height and physical stature, the Pupils had to be ready to contend with some lofted early balls from back to front by the hosts, whose game plan seemed to be to get the ball to their forwards as quickly as possible, but the Pupils# defence of Fraser Wylie, Ross Souden, Ryan McConnachie and Stuart Crossan, stood up to the task well.The Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils quick passing and inidual pace and skill in the final third caused the hosts problems early on, and Ryan Gilchrist and Gregor McFadyen, and both had almost identical attempts to score, but snatched at their shots at the vital moment.However, the Kintyre Park side would not be denied for long, and scored after  minutes through a sharp passing move that released Gregor McFayden, who buried an arrowed shot from the edge of the box to continue his excellent goalscoring form.Then, the visitors made it - after  minutes, when an enterprising move out of defence found right-back Crossan, whose ball through to Johnny McCormick allowed the right winger to cut inside onto his left foot and release a thunderous first-time drive into roof of the net for a great goal, his second of the season.After seeing their deficit doubled, Carlton for their part put their Kintyre visitors under a bit of pressure from several corners and free kicks, but the Pupils’ defensive discipline continued to win over.Into the second half, the Pupils made it - when Donald McCallum scored another great goal, in a move started by Liam Renton, whose in-swinging corner was cleared to the edge of the penalty box where the ex-Dumbarton man McCallum made space to drive a deflected shot into the top corner of the net.At this point in the match, all three subs were used, with Ellis Robertson and Michael McKinlay replacing the excellent deep-lying midfield pairing of Ryan Gilchrist and Liam Renton, and Ross Brown entering in the fray in a direct swap with winger McCormick.The youngster Brown quickly got involved to create the Pupils# fourth goal, outpacing the Carlton full-back to draw out the last defender and square the ball across for Scott Souden to cheekily chip the ball over the home keeper into the net.The rampant Pupils completed the scoring in the th minute after hesitation between a Carlton defender and his keeper allowed McFadyen to nip in, touch the ball round the keeper to score a simple but well-earned second goal, for his brace on the day, and his fourth of the season.At the other end, the Pupils were determined to get their second consecutive clean sheet in league action, and while young keeper Alistair Ferguson spilled a deflected free kick in the latter stages, he bravely ed at the feet of the striker to smother his effort. The Pupils management noted how Ferguson’s kicking and distribution was first-class throughout the match.A Pupils spokesman said: ‘It was a great team effort, with our attacking players working together to cause problems all game. At the back, we defended high balls and direct play really well.’The Pupils are in league action again tomorrowwhen they welcome Argyll rivals Lochgilphead Red Star. Kick off is pm, with Kintyre Park the expected venue.The Pupils’ Liam Renton on the ball with Ryan Gilchrist looking on at Saturday#s match in Paisley.

George reminisced: ‘It was announced at a Town Council meeting that the Royal couple was scheduled to visit. It was all to be top secret, but that didn’t happen. The next morning the #secret# was ulged in a queue in one of the town’s shops and the news was out.’With a smile that showed how fond these memories are to him, George continued: ‘The Royal Yacht Britannia was anchored out in the loch and a small boat brought the Queen and Prince Philip to the quay where my father was delegated to catch and secure the rope. They were then driven to the Town Hall and there was a huge crowd present.‘Campbeltown Gaelic Choir, conducted by Mr M G McCallum who was also a councillor, had a lovely surprise for the Royal visitors. Prince Charles had just been made Prince of Wales, so the choir sang ‘God Bless the Prince of Wales’. This was very well received, and the Queen said that she had not heard it before.’George and Mrs McMillan were present at a reception given by the Town Council in the Town Hall. George remembers that he shook hands with the Queen and spoke with the Duke of Edinburgh. He said: ‘Only those invited could speak to the Queen, but the Duke moved among the gathering and spoke to some of the councillors. I was a coal miner at Machrihanish at that time and he asked me and some other miners about our work.’He continued: ‘The food and drinks were served on silver trays by waiters in tails and bow-ties. Afterwards, when the couple was taken on a tour of the town, the heavens opened and oh how it rained and rained.’A town councillor from May  to its disbanding in , and then a councillor on the District Council and the Strathclyde Regional Council, George was to meet the Queen and other members of the Royal Family on other occasions.

What is it I always do riddles when I tell stories. I think of riddles and stories as close cousins which support each other.A good brain-teasing riddle is usually fun, and children in particular love the challenge of solving a riddle, as well as making their own ones up.Irsquom often greeted with pleas for ldquoTim, tell us one more riddle when I enter a school, and Irsquom often challenged to solve a riddle made up by one of the children.They are an ancient form of learning and entertainment.The first discovered written riddles are close to , years old. They were written in Cuneorm, the writing of the ancient Sumerians.A shortened and simplied version of one of these earliest riddles is: ldquoA house you enter blind, but come out with sight. What kind of house is it  The answer is a school, although some may raise an eyebrow at this answer.Perhaps the most famous riddle from antiquity is the Riddle of the Sphinx to Oedipus, recorded in ancient Greek around the fth century BC: ldquoWhat is the creature that walks on four legs in the morning, two legs at noon, and three legs in the evening The answer is a human being. When a baby we crawl on four legs, as an adult we walk on two legs, in old age we need a third leg .With my now continuous painful knee, this riddle has particular relevance for me, although Irsquom stubbornly resisting the stick!I use riddles as ice breakers in storytelling sessions and as an engagement technique because they quickly hook an audiencersquos attention since they are, by their nature, interactive.But they are also great fun to use with the children in your family.I use them to help distract and calm my younger ones when they are fractious. I use them in the morning when the kids are getting ready for school so they concentrate on them while they are getting ready.We make the riddles about the things we can see and the things we are doing, for example: ldquoTherersquos a big one and a wee one and three in between, we are two families of five, we are all going to nursery, but we are usually not seen. Who are we  The answer, of course, is my sonrsquos toes!For younger kids, itrsquos important to repeat riddles they already know the answer to. It helps them learn the riddle and how wordplay works. It also teaches them the rhythm of how they are told.My four-year-old is getting pretty good at this, although the answers to his own made-up riddles donrsquot always make sense.That doesnrsquot matter at this stage, whatrsquos important is hersquos developing an understanding of how they work and it encourages him to look for things to make riddles about.His nearly six-year-old sister likes to challenge him too.Her riddle ldquoI am short when I sit, I am long when I jump, what am I  had me thinking for some time before I got the answer: a frog.To make a riddle, think of the answer first. Then work the riddle up to the answer. It involves thinking about all the dferent qualities, uses of and parts of the answer and how they can be twisted or described dferently.For example, a shoe has a tongue but canrsquot talk, a clock has a face and hands but no body, a river has a bed but doesnrsquot sleep.Once introduced to riddle-making, children can get really engaged with it. A group of seven-eight-year-olds in a P class challenged me last week with a riddle they had made up themselves: ldquoI have a brain full of teacherrsquos knowledge, I crash without moving, I freeze while staying warm, what am I  The answer is a computer.Some riddles rhyme and it can be an extra challenge to think of a rhyming riddle, but they donrsquot have to rhyme.It really is a fun and rewarding activity to make a regular habit in the car, dinner table, on a walk or even a bedtime riddle.To help you out, there are literally thousands of examples of riddles in books, on the internet, in history, films and ones you hear. But the best ones will be those made up yourself, and the more you do it, the better at it you will become.And the benefits of riddling regularly with your family can be signicant, especially for children. It can promote critical thinking, encourage the observation of the world around us, help language development and can be a powerful bonding process with your child. And itrsquos fun!And so when next time you are with your kids, grandchildren, nieces or nephews and find yourself waiting for food to be delivered in a restaurant or have no time for a proper bedtime story, or you just want to spend some quality time together without a screen, try make riddling part of it. Trust me, it will be fun.Oh, and the answer to the well-known riddle at the beginning  Itrsquos a coffin."},{"url":null,"title":"wallyford-bluebell-players-fantastic-experience-soccer","story":"The county sextet were in the studio throughout the show, which went out live on Sky Sports at .am.The players for the amateur team ndash captain Daniel Howie, Jordan McCallion and brothers Jack and Shaun Moffat ndash along with friends Darren Hall and Lewis Brown, took part in the volley challenge and pro am questions to win cash.They travelled by train to London last Friday evening, with Sky covering all travel and hotel costs, as well as taxi fares to and from the studio.The trip came about after Soccer AM posted on Twitter that it was looking for Scotland fans to appear on the show.After an email from Daniel and a couple of phone calls later, the trains were booked from Edinburgh Waverley to London Kingrsquos Cross as the members of the Musselburgh Tartan Army headed south.

replaced by a joint community pupil library which opened in the new Wallyford Primary School campus in April.A report to the councilrsquos policy and performance review committee said that the move had seen the number of visits to that library service almost halved.And it added: ldquoAlthough we have improved facilities within the school, there is no public transport to the school and limited car parking so some of our elderly customers are not now using the library.However, the report said there were hopes that when the new housing had been completed at Wallyford, where large development is ongoing, public transport would improve.The council put the increase on physical visits to library branches down to a combination of factors, including ldquoincreasing opening hours, merging library and customer services, increasing digital use and dferent types of events taking place within libraries.It said that the number of e-magazines and e-newspapers issued through the library

libraries in recent years and we have seen the numbers of visits increase by nearly  per cent since .ldquoDespite all the challenges which we face, we have continued to improve the library service which we offer through the opening of the new community library in Wallyford Primary School.ldquoThis has given more support for reading and literacy to primary age children in the Wallyford area and we have also been able to maintain a high level of library opening hours in recent years.The report on the service said: ldquoThe library service has changed signicantly over the years and many more services are provided within our libraries than have been previously.ldquo[The library service] continues to adapt to society changes and demands and going forward the service will be developed to promote reading for pleasure in particular and be available for those who need a bit more support, whether this be through giving assistance with digital developments or guidance in literacy or being a place for people to meet and socialise.The most popular library in the county is in Haddington, where the number of visitors to the John Gray Centre facility was , last year.Haddington and Lammermuir ward councillor Craig Hoy said: ldquoHaddington Library is the busiest in the county and that underscores its importance to the town and the wider community.ldquoItrsquos fantastic to see it being so well used and we should continue to explore what additional facilities and services can be located at the library and the John Gray Centre to ensure they continue to attract residents of

The River Esk snakes around the edge of the course.Prof Crofts expressed concern that dogs could easily swallow them, resulting in ldquolarge vet bills for owners.After ing the balls to the club, he has issued a call for the flood protection scheme, currently being drawn up for Musselburgh, to include measures to slow down water coming off the Pentland and Moorfoot Hills where the North and South Esk rise.Prof Crofts, of Musselburghrsquos Eskside West, a geography expert who has worked as a research scientist in Scotland, said: ldquoAlong the golf course there are very soft banks and you can see where they have been cut back, and probably there was some rough at the end of the fairway where lots of people have lost balls.ldquoWe cannot stop leaves and tree trunks being brought down the river but the speed of rise of the water level and its velocity shows that any flood prevention scheme for Musselburgh needs to look hard at measures to slow down water coming off the hills and into the river. Without this, the erection of walls being proposed in Musselburgh will not be public money well spent.ldquoMany of us feel the importance of the amenity of this stretch of the river ndash it is very fine.He said a tree planting scheme using native species should be discussed with landowners in the headwaters of the Esk catchment area, as government grants were available for such work.He said: ldquoI am talking about hundreds of thousands of trees maybe. Careful hand planting of trees is best rather than using tractors to dig ditches to prepare the land for planting as this would aggravate the problem by increasing the rate of water running off the hills. The trees would take up water from the soil.ldquoThe use of the reservoirs on the North and South Esk and the temporary flooding of the flat land along the river should be seriously investigated to store water during heavy rainfall and therefore slow the release of water into the river.ldquoIf you look at the flood issue, itrsquos caused by the river rising very fast but itrsquos made worsethere are high spring tides and a storm surge in the North Sea, and also a northerly wind across the estuary which piles the water up high and stops the river water escaping for a couple of hours either side of high tide.Professor Crofts has raised his concerns with consultants who are drawing up the Musselburgh Flood Protection Scheme and he has also made local councillors aware of his views.As for the coast, he highlighted small sand dunes which formed a natural barrier with grasses, which, below the ground level, had yards of roots acting as a natural catcher of the sand.Jackie Lambert, captain of Musselburgh Golf Club, said: ldquoThe club was unaware of the issue regarding golf balls being found on the beach near the mouth of the River Esk.ldquoWhilst, the figure of  golf balls is signicant, it is unknown over what timescale these balls have accumulated andthey are all, indeed, from the course.ldquoNotwithstanding this, the golf club will happily participate in any working group looking at the wider issues of flood protection and the environment in and around Musselburgh.

I have edited it for publication here, but I have attempted to keep the story as close to the original as possible, and the story itself is completely the idea of the children.IN PRESTONPANS, there lived two nine-year-old children called Max and Lily.One day, they went on a bike ride to Preston Tower for a picnic. When they got there they laid a chequered blanket down on the grass, opened their basket and began to eat.They were about to leave after eating their food when they saw a robin perched on a nearby branch. It seemed friendly and the children fed the wee bird some of their leftovers.The robin then flew to a nearby abandoned cottage. The children were intrigued and followed the robin to investigate the cottage.They couldnrsquot remember noticing it before and they were wandering around it peering inside through small a gap in the wall. They couldnrsquot see where the robin had gone. They should have just left it but curiosity got the better of them and they searched for a way in. They were anxious to find out what had happened to the robin.But there was no way in, as the entrance and windows were blocked. So they clambered up the cottage wall, the bricks crumbling under their feet.Tired and exhausted, they finally reached where they thought the robin had landed.They found an opening which led to a dark passage. Despite being a bit scared, Max and Lily decided to investigate and walked down the passage. It was dimly lit by small gaps in the wall that let in narrow beams of light. At the end, there was a staircase. They huddled together as they walked.Then all of a sudden, the floorboard behind them collapsed.Now in fear and panic, they dashed up the steps of the dilapidated staircase into the attic.From the corner of the attic, they could just make out a small black figure running towards them.They thought they had seen the robin but it was something much worse. ldquoMouse! screamed Lily. Then they heard a glass shatter ndash smash!They were now terried and they sat in pitch darkness. The only light they had was the light that was seeping through the bricks in the walls.As they sat in fear, they realised they needed to come up with a plan to escape. They searched the cottage for a way out.As Lily investigated around the room, she tripped over a rug that seemed to have something poking upwards. She called out for Max and he came rushing down the stairs.As Max kneeled down to take a closer look, Lily revealed what looked like a trapdoor.Astonished, the children pulled the handle.It led to a tunnel which was flooded with candlelight. Who lit the candles  Max and Lily wonderedwhoever had lit the candles knew they were there.They entered the candlelit tunnel and one step at a time they cautiously moved forward.Then, slam! The trapdoor shut behind them and they jumped in fear. This was all too much for them to handle, they were desperate to get out.Then Max heard a soft but evil whisper: ldquoPlease stay, Irsquom lonely.In terror, he pulled out his phone and pressed  but it instantly shut off. ldquoPlease stay, said the voice, now sounding child-like.ldquoHelp! screamed Max and Lily through the gaps in the wall, but help never came.Then they heard something on the floorboards above.ldquoThere must be something up there, said Lily. ldquoI guess the only way out is to follow the candlelight.So they ventured further down the candlelit passageway.As the pair made their way through the tunnel, they could just make out what looked like a white figure approaching, who had a terrying grin with sharp teeth.Max and Lilyrsquos hearts beat uncontrollably as they sprinted away from this terrying image and as they did so all the candles blew out, throwing the children into complete darkness.Was this thing still there  The friends sat together in the darkness breathing heavily, in shock and terror.Suddenly, in the darkness, icy fingers gripped Lilyrsquos arms.ldquoWas that you rsquorsquo asked Lily. ldquoNo, replied Max.All at once, the candles lit up again. Max and Lily turned round and saw a horrying face: ldquoArghhhhhhh!They woke in the sunlight. ldquoWhat  said Max, confused. ldquoWhat just happened   added Lily.ldquoIt must have been a bad dream, said Max. ldquoBut both of us had the same dream, how is that possible ldquoWe had better go, they said.As they were about to leave, they saw a robin.

He said: ldquoThis is a systematic problem which is causing a death spiral in the quality of nursery provision throughout the industry.The inspection report on Dunbarrsquos Pumpkin Patch rated its quality of care and support, staffing and management and leadership at twowith the environment rated a three .The report said that parents had contacted the inspectorate following its unannounced visit in August to discuss concerns.A high turnover in staff was raised by a number of parents, with one telling inspectors: ldquoOften when I drop my child off I have to introduce myself and my child to the agency staff.The report said: ldquoParents told us that they often did not know the staff when they dropped off their children in the morning, often resulting in their children being reluctant to attend.Mr Bruneau said that the introduction of mandatory SSSCregistration was creating recruitment problems throughout the industry.He said: ldquoBefore the advent of SSSC registration, our group of nurseries never used any agency staff as recruitment was simple. It included people of ying ages, experience and circumstance.ldquoIt was a healthy labour market now new staff are iniably under , inexperienced in le, work and certainly the care of children.ldquoNursery closures are inevitable as sites struggle to find staff, maintain standards and satisfy increased demand.He said his company had decided to rationalise itsservices, placing more experience in fewer sites, and called on the Scottish Government to reverse policies he said ruled out more mature staff from working in nurseries.He added that all five members of staff at Dunbar had been offered places at his other nurseries.A spokesperson for East Lothian Council, which used the Dunbar nursery as a partner provider, said: ldquoWe have worked with Pumpkin Patch as one of our partner providers, offering funded early learning and childcare for pre-school children for many years.ldquoOur officers have also provided extensive support to the Dunbar team to help them improve the quality of experiences following recent Care Inspectorate reports. Our assistance has been recognised and appreciated by the owners, who feel that we have done all we can to support them.ldquoWe acknowledge that this will have been a dficult decision for the owners and will have implications for their team at Dunbar. We also acknowledge the upset and disruption that the nursery closure will bring for parents using this service.ldquoOur staff will work with and support parents to find alternative early learning and childcare within the area that meets their needs.A Scottish Government spokesperson said: ldquoMore than , children are already benefiting from the expanded entitlement after we increased training opportunities and routes into the early learning and childcare sector, resulting in a record ,-strong workforce.ldquoWe are working alongside local authorities and providers to ensure the necessary workforce is in place ndash including running a national early learning and childcare recruitment campaign, increasing support for training places and modern apprenticeships, and enabling providers to advertise jobs free on the MyJobScotland website."},{"url":null,"title":"pensioner-completes-74-year-quest-discover-father","story":"David Simpson had spent  years looking for his dad after growing up in a Quarriers orphanage to the west of Glasgow before moving across the Atlantic.But his attempts proved fruitless until a visit to long-lost family in Elgin last year.John Hamilton, from Lost Haddington, then became aware of Mr Simpsonrsquos quest.He said: ldquoFrom the information David received from Quarriers, all he knew was that his father was a Jack Cunningham, a plasterer from Goodallrsquos Place in Haddington.ldquoHis niece AnnMarie Whyte did a search for Goodallrsquos Place and the result came back with a find against a Lost Haddington image for the old Goodallrsquos shop on the townrsquos Bridge Street this led to AnnMarie posting a question askingI knew who Jack Cunningham was.ldquoA search of the Lost Haddington collection for Cunningham brought back too many matches, so the search was honed to lsquoplastererrsquo and the results produced the equivalent of a Holy Grail image ndash a George Angus scan of a lsquoJohnrsquo Cunninghamrsquos security application to RAF East Fortune.As well as correcting the name, the image confirmed his occupation and address, as well as his height, hair and eye colour.A plea was put on social media for further information, which found that Johnrsquos nickname was lsquoGibbyrsquo and that David had a cousin living in Musselburgh called Janette Brotherstone.Mr Hamilton said: ldquoAlso, a further search of Lost Haddington for the word lsquoGibbyrsquo, with it being an unusual name, produced another George Angus image from  showing Davidrsquos father John when he was only five or six years old holding the date plate for his school photo ndash George had annotated the image saying the lsquoboy holding the date slate was Gibby Cunninghamrsquo, so when I sent David this image it was the first time hersquod seen his father.ldquoThe feedback from the Lost Haddington followers also indicated that John died in  when he lived at No  St Annrsquos Place.ldquoThrough the invaluable feedback which named Janette as his first cousin, David was put in touch with her and shersquos since sent him some old family photos showing his father throughout his le.ldquoThe photos came from Davidrsquos fatherrsquos home, where he died, as it was Janette who dealt with the death notices for both Davidrsquos father and Johnrsquos we Jessie Cagder.ldquoDavid visited Scotland in autumn  so I offered to bring him to Haddington, which he accepted.From there, David, who now lives in Rochester, New York, was able to see the home where his dad was born on Haddingtonrsquos St Martinrsquos Gate, as well as his homes on Goodallrsquos Place and St Annrsquos Place.It is thought Davidrsquos dad was lodged with a landlady while working in Elgin in .According to Mr Hamilton: ldquoThe landladyrsquos husband was away from home for two years as a soldier in World War Two and itrsquos during this period that John and the landlady must have had a moment of indiscretion together, which produced David!ldquoWhen the landladyrsquos husband ed home from the war due to injury and found his we holding baby David ndash that couldnrsquot have been his ndash he gave his we the ultimatum: lsquoTake him to the orphanage or itrsquos a orce.rsquoldquoAt the age of around one month old, David was taken to the Quarriers orphanage which is near the Bridge of Weir to the west of Glasgow.David left Quarriers at the age of  and eventually moved to Winnipeg in Canada in  before eventually settling in New York.More than  years ago, he began his bid to track down his family.

Any plastics, polyesters or other materials will be removed."},{"url":null,"title":"If Labour win  it  39 ll be less like Venezuela than Britain circa 1974","story":"Jeremy Corbyn was also talking tough this week. He identied some of the capitalist criminals Labour is coming for, including Sir Jim Ratclfe of Ineos. Though itrsquos not clear under what law the polluting plutocrats could be prosecuted.So, is this class war in the UK  Are we on the road to Venezuela  Whatever the polls say, a Labour victory this Christmas is quite possible with Nigel Faragersquos Brexit Party now splitting the Tory vote. There is a powerful mood for change in Britain. But what would a Labour government actually look like We have never had such an avowedly radical Prime Minister ndash not even in , when Labour was led by a small ldquoc conservative, Clement Attlee. However, Labour reality would be rather dferent from the rhetoric. Burrow into Labourrsquos policies, and what emerges looks more like reheated social democracy, circa, than a Bolshevik revolution.For a start, we can largely ignore the issue that ided the party so bitterly in recent times: nuclear weapons. Jeremy Corbyn may be a lelong member of CND, but Labour is no longer a unilateralist party. Its  manesto committed a Labour government to renewing Trident almost indefinitely.But Corbyn will still enter Number  with a raft of left-wing policies, from seizing corporate assets to abolishing private schools as well as taxing the rich until the pips squeak. However, many of the headline policies will never make it to first reading, let alone the statute book.Abolishing schools like Eton would involve y court action, not least from faith schools and the home school movement, who might also be affected. Labour is more likely to confine its assault on educational privilege to axeing tax reliefs worth about pound. billionSimilarly, seizing % of the shares of companies with more than  employees would be fiercely resisted in the courts by shareholders. They have deep pockets. I suspect Labour would confine itself to increasing corporate taxes, ending zero-hours contracts and restoring trades union rights ndash all of which are eminently doable.Indeed, looking behind the radical rhetoric, much of Labourrsquos policy agenda is surprisingly modest, viewed from Scotland. Measures like free personal care, abolishing university tuition fees, childcare for three and four-year-olds, scrapping the right to buy, lting the benefits cap and the bedroom tax ndash these are all achievable.Indeed, the Scottish Parliament has already achieved them, bar the welfare cap. Nicola Sturgeon will no doubt remind the Labour leader of this repeatedly in coming weeks.Nationalisation is a policy that used to be seen as ldquoloony left but is no longer. Taking rail into public ownership shouldnrsquot be too much of a problem, since Network Rail, which owns the track and signalling, is already in public hands. The service franchises could be replaced as they come up for renewal, without needing to hand billions in compensation to Virgin and the rest.Waterand energy would pose greater problems, not least because most of our energy companies are foreign-owned ndash often, ironically, by state-owned bodies. But with a good wind it should be possible for Labour to find a way. Public attitudes to public ownership of utilities have changed out of all recognition since the s.Similarly, there is broad public support for Labourrsquos Green New Deal. A majority of voters agrees there is a climate emergency. Though they may not agree with the measures needed to tackle it.Labour is not going the full Extinction Rebellion route of making Britain zero carbon by . But its own policy, passed at conference, is still pretty radical. It commits a Labour government to making Britain zero carbon by . Thatrsquos only five years longer.We are talking about the most radical change to our lestyles since the industrial revolution. Labourrsquos policy would mean decarbonising transport, home heating and agriculture in a decade. Millions of cars would have to be scrapped along with millions of home boilers. Air travel would all but cease.Labour promises a huge investment in renewable industries to compensate, but that is unlikely to replace the jobs lost in the car industry, oil and gas, road haulage and retail.So expect the Green New Deal to become somewhat lighter green in government. There is likely to be a rt between the Thunberg-supporting ldquode-growthers and Labour MPs, who traditionally see economic growth as the best way to address poverty and inequality.However, Britain already has a rather good record on eliminating greenhouse emissions, and this will continue, albeit with the  target reduced to % net zero.In sum, Labour offers a practical social democratic programme which could be very attractive to voters, especially younger ones. However there is one very big problem: Brexit.Labour is committed to negotiating a new Withdrawal Deal to replace Boris Johnsonrsquosand to putting this to another Brexit referendum. This will consume a vast amount of political capital and will surely dominate the first year of a Labour government.Corbyn wants to reintroduce the customs union and Brussels would probably agree to that. But Labour also wants close regulatory alignment with the European Single Market, which the EU  would probably reject. If Britain wants to be in the single market, it will have to join the single market, probably via the European Economic Area, along with Norway.Labour could go along with that in the end, since it wants friction-free access to the EU markets. Single market membership would solve the Irish border problem, for sure.But it would also mean Britain continuing to contribute to the EU Budget, while having no say over decisions taken by Brussels. Customs union membership requires oversight by the European Court of Justice, which will displease many.But that wouldnrsquot be the main problem. If Labour got this wonderful deal, including workersrsquo rights and environmental standards, and got it through Parliament , would it really then campaign against it in the confirmatory referendum Interviewers have largely stopped asking this question, because they never get an answer, but Europe remains a huge question mark hanging over Labourrsquos government agenda.Labour is still a Brexit party, though you wouldnrsquot know it to listen to most MPs. Many figures in the party are closet Brexiteers, like Jeremy Corbyn himself. Others are openly pro-Brexit, like the party chairman Ian Lavery and the MPs who voted for Boris Johnsonrsquos deal.Equally dedicated Remainers ndash mostly Blairites and supporters of the deputy leader Tom Watson ndash would fight back, insisting that Labour effectively promised to back Remain in the General Election. Brexit wrangling could delay the confirmatory referendum and ide the party, just as it split the Tories.Corbynrsquos enemies will ignite further ision by condemning him as anti-Semitic. It will take immense powers of leadership to prevent a Labour government being halted in its radical tracks by Brexit.The question for voters is: does Jeremy Corbyn possess it "},{"url":null,"title":"andrew-marr-show-ridge-sunday-reviews","story":"ldquoIrsquove thought very hard about this.

One and a half new BBC Scotland channels to be precise, or , licence fees for over s.Jack Thorne, the writer of Shameless and Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, was in charge of the adaptation. He gave little quarter to anyone unfamiliar with the novels. After a brief introduction covering the all-powerful ruling elite, known as the Magisterium, and a prophecy about a special child, we were pitched into a world very much like this world, yet somehow not. Welcome to the endless strangeness and complexities of Pullmanrsquos universe.Previous adaptations have fallen down in trying to get across the trilogyrsquos many and complex themes too soon. Wisely, this production homed in instead on the ldquodaemons, the spirit animals that encapsulate the souls of the humans to which they are attached. Scientist and explorer Lord Asriel James McAvoy, one of several Scots in the cast including James Cosmo and Gary Lewis has a very cool snow leopard as his daemon. His orphaned niece, Lyra, the child on whom so much will depend, has a stoat. Who doesnrsquot love a super furry animal that can talk British-Spanish actress Dafne Keen is excellent as the fearless, inquisitive Lyra, her dark features calling to mind the heroine of Panrsquos Labyrinth. McAvoy makes an awesome adventurer, never happier than when there is a swash to be buckled.Asriel has just blown in from the frozen north with tales of a mysterious substance he calls ldquodust. The existence of this material, which appears to conceal other worlds, is contrary to the Magisteriumrsquos teachings. It is the kind of information, indeed, that could topple empires.The mentions of ldquodust had unfortunate comic echoes of the Little Britain sketch about a slimming group leader who tells members that dust is all they can eatthey want to lose weight. The daemons, for all they were delightful in the main, took a while to get used to. When we could see their lips move it was obvious they were talking when we could not, their seemingly disembodied voices only added to the mounting confusion.Just when the story showed signs of slipping away, something happened that bodes well for any television drama: Ruth Wilson rocked up to play the mesmerising and beautul Mrs Coulter. Offering Lyra a job and the chance to move to London, the character played by the star of Luther and The Affair seems a dream come true for motherless Lyra. But her daemon is a gorgeous but terrying golden monkey - so make of that business what you will.By episode end, Asriel was racing back to the North, and scores of others were heading to London in search of vanished children. With armoured polar bears and Lin-Manuel Mirandastill to come, it would be a brave soul indeed who bailed on His Dark Materials this early.

Does he think that would be a fine example of democracy From the start the vote referendum was not sufficiently clear on the implications of leaving as no prior discussions appear to have been held with EU member states. No details were given on any options we could have with trading within the EU and where worldwide, in effect a sort of fait accompli. No comments were made whatsoever over what must have been blindingly obvious regarding border controls, in particular the Northern Ireland Eire one. That was the point when consultations with the ordinary people should have been made, before the vote and not now after the horse has bolted as Mr Mackay suggests.We have already had a ldquoonce in a letime vote regarding independence which the SNP is determined to hold again, so does he suggest we should follow suit with the Leave Remain EU one and throw democracy out with the bath water I voted Remain but grudgingly accepted the decision as that was the majorityrsquos wish. We now appear to be running the risk of those who feel denied their own wish to just re-run votes until they achieve their own desired result which, with such close results in both referendums, is a recipe for unrest. What should now be done is to discuss changes to the way we vote to give more meaningful results in future rather than the one vote either way first past the post system we currently have.George Dale, Beith.IF there is ever to be an Indyref the question to be asked must be fair, unbiased and easily understood.As evidenced by the question posed in the Brexit referendum, the opinion of the Electoral Commission is that a simple Yes No question is unfair as it contains an inherent bias in favour of the positivity of Yes against the negativity of No. It is encouraging therefore that Holyroodrsquos cross-party finance and constitution committee has recognised this in calling for more scrutiny of the question to be asked in any Indyref, instead of simply rubber-stamping the underhand attempt by the SNP to gain advantage by repeating the Yes No question asked in  .In demanding Indyref, it is clear that the objective of the SNP is to leave the UK union and join the EU, but there are concerns that a Leave  Remain question might confuse some as it carries echoes of Brexit. One question which goes to the heart of the matter and adopts the style used in  would be ldquoShould Scotland be part of the UK or part of the EU  UK or EU. There is no bias in the question and the choice could not be clearer.Alan Fitzpatrick, Dunlop.THE result of the election will be, in Scotland, a barometer of attitudes towards both Brexit and Scottish secession. It will be interesting to see how many of the SNPrsquos habitual voters who chose to leave the EU will remain SNP voters. A figure of around one-third of SNP voters represents Brexiters. Those seeking to support a Remain party have an easy choice: vote LibDem. Yet for those who oppose secession from the UK there really is only one choice: evenit means holding onersquos nose, one must vote for the party best-placed to defeat the SNP candidate. That will normally be the candidate who came second in , although in some cases, such as Ross, Cromarty and Skye ndash the constituency of Ian Blackford ndash it will not. That constituency has a strong Lib Dem heritage, and Remainers can vote Lib Dem happily.Nicola Sturgeon has made it clear that the issue in this election is Scotlandrsquos place in the UK. This is allied to a  claim that a Scotland could remain in the EU. Pro-Union people need to vote, and to vote for the party best-placed to unseat an SNP MP or to prevent an SNP candidate from winning.Jill Stephenson, EH.WHATEVER view we might hold about Brexit most people in Scotland must find it of great importance that we must defend our NHS. Our health service is under attack from two angles. First US health care companies want to get into health care contracts in the UK to make profits from that, and also the big drug companies in the US want to force the NHS to pay more for drugs, indeed as much as an additional pound billion for starters to get us level with prices in the US.So this is a time to look at our politicians now seeking our votes and make an important judgment. In a vote in the Westminster Parliament to protect the NHS the Tories predictably voted against, but the Liberals abstained. Now we know where the Tories stand on the NHS, they will sell it offthey get a deal they like with the US. So why did the Liberals not support the NHS, can Jo Swinson explain this to us when she is looking for Scottish votes Andy Anderson, Saltcoats.IF I hear any more politicians telling me that at last we will be able to use our vote to determine what party will win and get on with Brexit, I will despair. We have already done that ndash in General Elections, in referenda, and in local elections and European elections ndash but to no avail. Our politicians donrsquot give a toss who we elect or what we want, and at the moment it would appear that it would be extremely possible that a government will be elected ndash probably another minority government and we will start  in exactly the same situation where we find ourselves just now.I mean, letrsquos look at our choices.

Images of its reflection in the deathly still waters of Loch Rannoch have featured in countless calendars and for many Munro baggers, it is a favourite to be saved and savoured as their final summit.One of Scotlandrsquos best-known mountains and at the very heart of the country, Schiehallion is now set to adopt a new role the nationrsquos most inclusive Munro.Work is now underway on a new low-level, circular footpath at Schiehallion that will enable visitors who might normally struggle to fully experience the beauty of Scotlandrsquos outdoors to enjoy its natural beauty up close.The km easy access path and boardwalk will open up the fringes of the mountain to people with mobility problems, families with small children, wheelchairs and prams, and others for whom the peakrsquos uphill trails are too exhausting and challenging.The path, which includes seating areas and interpretation boards along its route explaining the arearsquos wildle and archaeological history, is part of ongoing improvement work being carried out by the Schiehallionrsquos owners, The John Muir Trust.That has already seen extensive repairs to the main path. Pounded by countless pairs of boots, it had stretched to up to  feet wide in sections and left an ugly scar on the hillside. That work led to the first section of the realigned uphill path being specically designed as lsquoeasy accessrsquo.The creation of a new accessible route encircling the base of the mountain is among a growing number of initiatives intended to open Scotlandrsquos countryside and tourist attractions to visitors with a range of mobility or health concerns.Taken together, they could see Scotland position itself as a leader within the potentially lucrative international inclusive tourism market.Last month VisitScotland launched a new guide to help tourism-related businesses become more dementia-friendly in a bid to help them tap into a pound billion lsquodementia poundrsquo sector.The guide highlights the kinds of improvements needed to upgrade infrastructure ndash such as disabled-friendly bathrooms and paths - menus and boost staff knowledge to help attract visitors from a rapidly growing sector.That followed a move earlier this year when the national tourism organisation took guests from two of Europersquos top accessible tour operators to a range of attractions including Stirling Castle, Royal Yacht Britannia, Clydeside Distillery and Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum, to showcase how leading destinations are already catering for the needs of less mobile visitors.It was the first trip of its kind specically designed to highlight Scotlandrsquos inclusive potential and has led to one of the operators, Denmark-based HandiTours, adding Scotland to its package tour programme for the first time. TThe other operator, WeTravel in Belgium, has also included Scottish destinations in its travel guides.Meanwhile, Edinburgh-based Euanrsquos Guide, a disabled access review website, has also worked with the national tourism organisation to produce three accessible itineraries for Scottish destinations, and this summer saw the launch of a new collaborative campaign to promote the Forth Valley as an accessible visitor destination for the first time.Forth Valley Accessibility Tourism Promotion brings together Falkirk and Stirling Councils, Discover Clackmannanshire and Loch Lomond  the Trossachs National Park and has seen a range of itineraries developed to meet the needs of visitors with autism, dementia and mobility issues.The push towards the inclusive tourism sector followed a VisitScotland Travel Trade Survey which revealed more than half of travel agents reported an increase in requests for accessible travel products.One in five people in the UK are disabled, including people with hearing loss and visual impairments, and that disabled tourism tend to take longer trips.In , pound. billion was spent in Scotland on trips where a member of the party had an impairment, including day trips, domestic overnight trips and inbound trips, however, the sector is seen as largely untapped, with potential for growth and improved experiences for guests.Dementia tourism, in particular, is expected to soar in coming years: , people currently live with dementia in Scotland, while the Scottish Government estimates that , people will be newly diagnosed with the condition during .According to VisitScotland, visitors with dementia face a number of challenges including having the confidence to travel, trying to communicate in noisy environments and becoming disorientated when navigating new places or long routes.It says that by becoming dementia-friendly, businesses could join see increased bookings during out of season periods when visitors are more likely to travel, and the potential forbusiness.Marina Di Duca, VisitScotland Inclusive Tourism Manager, said: ldquoParticipating in tourism activities can make signicant improvements to the lives of people living with dementia but taking holidays, visiting attractions and staying in accommodation can be challenging for people living with dementia, their carers and loved ones.ldquoIt is therefore imperative that tourism businesses understand how to support visitors affected by dementia.She added: ldquoCatering for this market also represents a number of benefits for businesses, helping ensure they experience the benefits brought by tourism.ldquoTourism is more than a holiday experience, it is vital to the Scottish economy, reaching every corner of the country, creating jobs and bringing economic and social change.The km Schiehallion path starts and finishes at Braes of Foss car park and is being created by the John Muir Trust and partners including Highland Perthshire Communities Land Trust, and Forestry and Land Scotland, whose land it will cross. The Trust is raising money for the project via its Wild Ways appeal and has secured funding from the Scottish Government and European Union through the Agri-Environment Climate Scheme Improving Public Access Fund.Liz Auty, the John Muir Trustrsquos Schiehallion Land Manager said: ldquoWe are really excited about this project that will allow people of all abilities to experience the hills and enable us to hold educational and public events together with our neighbours, Highland Perthshire Communities Land Trust and Forestry and Land Scotland.Euan MacDonald, co-founder of Euanrsquos Guide, said: ldquoWhile wersquore delighted to see the organisations and groups leading the way in making Scotlandrsquos countryside more accessible, we know that more could be done.ldquoThe lack of information about the routes and not having access to clean working accessible toilets are two major barriers which can prevent disabled people from taking part in outdoors activities."},{"url":null,"title":"mps-set-vote-john-bercows-successor-commons-speaker","story":"Eight candidates are bidding to take on the role following Mr Bercows departure, with the Commons business on Monday dedicated to this election.Deputy Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle is among those strongly tipped to emerge victorious, with fellow Labour MP Harriet Harman - the current longest continuously serving female MP - also predicted to do well.The other six candidates are Dame Rosie Winterton and Dame Eleanor Laing, who also both served as Mr Bercows deputies, Labours Meg Hillier and Chris Bryant , plus Conservatives Sir Edward Leigh and Shailesh Vara.: The  Scottish seats that matter - and the voters wholl decide who takes themCandidates must submit their written nominations between .am and .am on Monday, with their signed declaration needing to be supported by between  and  MPs.The Commons will meet as normal at .pm and each candidate will give a speech - the order decided by drawing lots.A secret ballot among MPs will take place once the speeches have concluded.MPs can only vote for one candidate and the result will be announced in the chamber.Any candidate who receives more than % of the votes will be proposed to the House as Speaker, although MPs will be asked to vote againno candidate meets the threshold.In the second round of voting, candidates who either came last or received fewer than % of the votes will not be on the ballot paper.There is also a -minute period after each round for candidates to withdraw.Ballots will continue until either one MP wins more than % of the votes or only one remains.A motion is then put to the Commons proposing the winner as Speaker and they will take the chairthis is agreed.

Can we generalise about the fortunes of towns where in this way  And do the same patterns and challenges apply in Scotland These are questions that we have explored in our data-based lsquoTownscapesrsquo project at the Bennett Institute at Cambridge University.Our research shows that the patterns ndash and the policy challenges ndash are indeed very dferent in Scotland. For a start, people who live in its towns tend to vote in a more ied way than in England. The swing towards the Conservatives across much of Scotland in the  election happened in towns like Perth and Ayr. But this was not true where. Labour made small gains in Motherwell, Kirkcaldy and Livingston, while the SNP retained many seats in the central belt.On Scotlandrsquos west coast, nearly all towns are declining faster in economic terms than the average British town. But those on the east coast are in a very dferent situation, with places like Peterhead prospering on the basis of its fishing, oil and gas industries.Those Scottish towns furthest away from a city tend to have their own self-sufficient economies as they have more jobs situated within their centres.At the same time, some places near to the prospering big cities are doing particularly well, and bucking the wider trend towards town decline that is apparent across the rest of the UK.Dunfermline is one such example. It experienced the largest population growth of any town in Britain between  and , and over the last decade it was the third fastest economically improving town in Britain.Its industrial heritage, adaptable economy and role as a dormitory for professionals working in Edinburgh have supported a large increase in the townrsquos population and in public service provision.But there are also some notable similarities between some of Scotlandrsquos towns and those in other parts of the UK.High streets north of the border are often struggling, as they are in England. Nearby cities continue to hoover up much of the nationrsquos high-skilled labour. Currently, nearly four-fths of all public service jobs are located in either Glasgow or Edinburgh. And hard-pressed councils are having to deal with funding reductions.In recent years there has been a notable sht towards the consolidation of key public services in Scotland, following the mergers of some regional police and fire services.Concerns about the plight of smaller places outside the big cities have made their way into Scottish politics in recent years. New Scottish Government policies have been introduced to support town centre living and enable the re-use of empty premises on the high street. Its latest budget includes a proposal for a new pound million Town Centre Fund.These issues will surface in the election campaign now underway.Our research suggests that the debate about towns needs to engage two key pointsit is to be meaningful.First, we need to put aside tempting generalisations about towns and the people who live in them and get a more granular understanding based on evidence of the particular challenges and dynamics at work in each place.And, second, we need to use a wide iety of tools when it comes to developing tailored policies for dferent places. One important part of the tool-kit concerns governance.The Scottish Government is in control of most of the policy areas that affect the fortunes of towns and has the capacity to make decisions on housing, skills and healthcare that will make a huge dference to them. It should, therefore, be held accountable for its policies, and its political opponentsrsquo ideas scrutinised too. But so too should the UK Government, which remains responsible for some of the most important fiscal and economic decisions affecting the prosperity of cities and towns across the land.There is every reason to think that towns will do betterlocal government is stronger, and placed on a more sustainable financial footing. This suggests that the devolution of power within Scotland may also be an important part of the policy mix required to tackle the challenges facing many of its towns.Ben Goodair and Michael Kenny are from the Bennett Institute for Public Policy at the University of Cambridge"},{"url":null,"title":"conservatives-blame-snp-lib-dems-labour-new-brexit-clock-message","story":"The do-called Brexit clock now shows the amount of time since the UK ldquoshould have left the EU.The new countdown clock at #@Conservatives# HQ pic hIhEDQCxcA picture shared by Tory MP Harriett Baldwin shows the clock, now counting upwards, above which a message reads: ldquoTime since we should have left the EULabour, Lib Dems and the SNP hadnrsquot blocked Brexit.The original timer was unveiled by Conservative Party chairman James Cleverly on July  and was displayed beneath a message which read: ldquoWe will have delivered Brexit and left the EU by.The digital timepiece was one of two, each reported to have cost at least pound, with the other delivered to Downing Street to be displayed in the Prime Ministerrsquos office.:Ian McConnell: East Renfrewshire Tory MP ignores Brexit economics to point at SNP\"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Brexit:  days until Britain is scheduled to leave the EU\",\"description\": \"Brexit:  days until Britain is scheduled to leave the EU\",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer v media RTLwxC poster.jpg width\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests RTLwxC.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": Downing Street has confirmed that Boris Johnson will not seek any extension to the Brexit transition periodhe is ed to No  in the General Election.Under the Prime Ministerrsquos proposed deal with Brussels, the UK will continue to follow EU rules after it has left the bloc until the end of  to allow the two sides to negotiate a new trade deal.:Boris Johnson will not seek Brexit extensionhe wins general electionParty Chairman @JamesCleverly with the ## We will deliver Brexit by October st.Back @BorisJohnsons pledge here: https:t.co ZkcKvLONpm pic aFFKfcavThe Prime Ministerrsquos official spokesman said the Government would not be seeking any extension to that as Mr Johnson believed there was sufficient time to get a trade deal.ldquoThe Government will not be extending the transition period.

In Orkney, Police have joined up with Orkney Road Safety forum, to encourage cyclists to remain safe and visible, with not only education, but the handing out of bike lights.Police are reminding cyclists that along with obeying all traffic signs, traffic light signals and not cycling on pavements, they must equip their bikes with the appropriate lights and make sure they are lit when it starts to get dark.Officers in Orkney will be proactively looking to address cyclists who ignore the legislative requirement to illuminate their bikes in darkness, and will be providing bike lights to those who need them. Just over  pairs of bike lights have been purchased using funding from Police Scotland Safer Communities for this purpose.#Visibility is key to keeping cyclists safe on the roads and I would encourage cyclists to ensure they wear bright reflective clothing and illuminate lights on their bikes, both front and rear, in order to make themselves more visible to other road users,# said chief inspector, Matthew Webb.#This is equally applicable during the day, but more important at dusk and when it#s dark, to avoid collisions and warn other road users to their presence.#Some cyclists wear dark clothing and particularly on faster roads they can be almost invisible to drivers until they are close to them.#He added: #I recognise in this rural community that a lot of the measures are equally applicable to the equine community and they are more than welcome to make use of the same free offer.#This initiative has been supported by the Orkney Road Safety Forum who will assist with the distribution of these lights, which in addition to the police office, are available from the OIC hubs and Scottish Fire and Rescue Service Community Safety Advocacy.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Headteacher Erfana Bora said the teacher acted in line with the schoolrsquos health and safety policy on the day.She said: ldquoWe canrsquot stipulate teachers must be on rides, as there will be instances where some children would not wish to be on the ride, and so in those cases itrsquos safer overall for the teacher to stay with that childhellip they make the assumption the park staff are responsible for overall safety on that ride.The inquest at Staffordrsquos County Buildings was told by Detective Inspector John Quilty, of Staffordshire Police, how Evha, who was unable to swim, initially fell into water up to her thighs.Appearing uninjured, she was then shown on CCTV wading along the edge of the ride route, towards the exit , trying to get back to her friends.Her schoolmates were shouting back towards Evha, while a member of the public standing at the ride coursersquos barrier, a few feet above, told her to stop where she was.The youngster, who was still in the water, carried on wading, and then attempted to climb the ridersquos ldquotravelator which lts the ride vessels up out of the water, to an exit .But as she climbed the ldquoalgae-covered wooden planks on the mechanism, she fell off the side into a ldquomuch deeper area of water at the park in Tamworth, Staffordshire.After pupils and members of the public raised the alarm, theme park staff went to the ride and began a search.Some  minutes after staff were alerted to Evha originally going into the water, Evha was spotted face down.It was another six minutes before theme park staff were able to pull her out, when she was described as ldquoleless. -- vw,vw,px, px\"Police at Drayton Manor Theme Park in --Despite CPR being administered at the scene, and advanced le support by air ambulance medics, she was pronounced dead less than two hours later at Birmingham Childrenrsquos Hospital.Opening an inquest into her death on Monday, assistant coroner for South Staffordshire Margaret Jones said Evha and her friends had been on the ride without incident, accompanied by teachers, earlier that day.The hearing was told that according to the theme parkrsquos ride height restrictions, Evha was allowed aboard the vessel without an adult.A signed risk assessment prepared by the school before the trip said that a member of staff would be ldquoallocated to groups of five or six primary age pupils, like Evha, while the older secondary age pupils could supervise themselves.Mr Quilty said: ldquoThe member of staff allocated to Evha and her group remained at exit and did not join her group, and her intention was to meet children as they came off exit.Meanwhile, three other member of staff boarded a dferent vessel, travelling four boats behind Evharsquos.A member of the theme park ride staff said he observed the ldquogood behaviour of Evha and her friends boarding their vessel.But CCTV showed that as soon as the ride began, Evha and some of the other girls were leaving their seats and not keeping hold of the safety rail.Mr Quilty, who led an investigation into the incident, said: ldquoAt no point do we actually see her saton the ride.Describing the moment the youngster was ejected from the vessel, he said: ldquoEvha is sat out of the seats, in the gap .ldquoShe is sat down at this point in time, and when the boat makes contactndash at the worst possible time ndash she stands up and, as a result of the propulsion and force of the barrier, that propels her out of the vessel.ldquoShe is just standing up, and as soon as she makes contact with the barrier she is pushed out, therersquos nothing behind her and she naturally falls out.Dr Frances Hollingbury, a Home Office pathologist, said she had determined a cause of death of drowning, although it was initially recorded as a result of blunt force trauma to the chest.She added that although Evha suffered multiple rib fractures, possible injuries to the lungs and a broken pelvis, she ldquowouldnrsquot have expected Evha to have died as a direct result of these injuries, without complications.The inquest continues.copy -.

They weren’t just losing but being ground into the south-west London soil.We know now the miracle very nearly came off, with Scotland leading - on the last play of the game, only to let in England once again to close out a - draw. I doubt I will ever experience such eye-popping, man-hugging drama at a rugby match again. It was my team, my country, and I still get goosebumps thinking about it.: South Africa captain Siya Kolisi ready for shot at history: Defence coach says England can pile pressure on South AfricaBut whisper it up here, Scotland’s shock treatment might just have sparked England’s progress to the Rugby World Cup final in Tokyo, because since that March day they have only lost once, in August when a second string side including only six of today’s starters lost a World Cup warm-up - to Wales in Cardf. A week later, a team featuring  of today’s opening line-up thrashed Ireland -. The chances are anyone reading this column will already know whether Owen Farrell has held the Webb Ellis Trophy aloft orhe was down on his hunkers in despair as the honour fell to a victorious South African captain Siya Kolisi. And I should want the Cup to be raised for the first time by a black Springbok skipper.Pipe band member in But I don’t. I want to see the Veldt Leviathans cut open by the skills of Farrell and George Ford, honed on dimly lit rugby league grounds at Wigan St Pats and Bradford, because I’m supporting England. Always have. Ever since that collection of Esso  Mexico World Cup football coins was completed, I’ve backed England when they aren’t playing us.I was in the pipe band in  when Kenny Dalglish stuck the ball through Ray Clemence’s legs, my mates came back from Wembley the following year with tufts of grass and bits of wood they said were from the obviously tubular goal posts, and in  alongside everyone  I laughed along with Andy Cameron and ‘We’re on the March with Ally’s Army’ and sat stunned as we were undone by Cubillas and Peru. But it was striking how the rest of the country seemed to want Scotland to do well in Argentina, in contrast to those blokes who head to the pub wearing the football shirts of countries they can’t locate on a map when England play.In  I was playing for Preston Grasshoppers when the Grand Slam was won, where Wade Dooley was still learning his trade and couldn’t know he’d experience what it was like to lose to Scotland in a title decider six years later. That day I turned out for Furness RUFC from Barrow, the only Scot in a packed clubhouse where afterwards everyone patted my back and shook my hand asI’d actually been playing at Murrayfield. This morning I’ll be texting a couple of my team-mates from that day.A gun to Zeffirelli’s headYears living in England, playing rugby union and covering professional rugby league has made me feel as much part of their game as ours. The rest of the house is solidly behind England too, but at least my we can justy her support on account of actually being English. So the rest of the gang can claim red and white blood, but even so my hockey-playing daughterstill gets asked by some team-mates how she can support “them” when “we’ll never hear the end of it”. Well we never tire of Archie Gemmill’s goal or  and I’ll never forget Twickenham .There will of course be those who will say that it’s only to be expected from a Conservative, and a lot worse, although there are plenty of our persuasion who are in the Anyone-but-England camp. But I’ve never seen the need to wallow in every set-back suffered by English teams to demonstrate pride in my heritage and culture or the dferences between us, and I’m as quick as the next Scot when abroad to correct anyone who thinks I’m from where. Like the woman in Arizona who saw me in a kilt and askedI was Irish.I am reminded of the story told by Italian film director Franco Zeffirelli when he was a partisan fighter during the War. Trapped between Allied and German forces he gave himself up to what he hoped were friendly troops. “English ” he called, and thought his le was over when a soldier shouted back “No” in a guttural tone he didn’t recognise and put a gun near his head. The soldier hissed, “We’re f***ing Scottish.”Seven ministers in seven yearsTalking of culture, seven ministers in seven years is not a musical based on government departments, but it should be at the Department of Culture, Media and Sport, where this week Nicky Morgan announced she will be the latest Secretary of State to depart since Jeremy Hunt’s elevation to health in .For us in the news business, it’s a key appointment, but no sooner had the industry got to know what Maria Miller, Sajid Javid, John Whittingdale, Karen Bradley, Matt Hancock and Jeremy Wright were all about, than it was usually time to move on.Ms Morgan has only been in the job three months, not even enough time to pop into the News Media Association offices for a spot of lunch. Nowhere will her departure be more keenly felt than amongst the senior civil servants she leaves behind who have seen them all come and go but in such a short space of time were thoroughly impressed by the speed with which she mastered complex issues and her ability to absorb a brief instantly.If Ruth Davidson can be offered £k for two days work a month, the ex-education secretary and treasury select committee chair won’t be short of offers.Edinburgh Christmas market: Treatment of memorial benches a disgraceAsthe mesh of steel currently spreading across Princes Street Gardens wasn’t shocking enough, the pictures circulated on social media of memorial benches carelessly heaped up in a corner by construction workers like an abandoned game of Jenga symbolised an equal lack of concern behind Edinburgh council’s decision to let it happen.It would be going too far to say the council officers who allowed the Christmas Market operator Underbelly to proceed with their scheme without submitting a planning application couldn’t care less about the benches, but the evidence strongly suggests they didn’t care enough to make sure it didn’t happen.Administration councillors were quick to respond on Twitter to tell the public how terrible it was, that immediate action would be taken, that it shouldn’t have happened, but the fact is it did.At every meeting of Edinburgh council, we on the Conservative seats listen to one SNP councillor after another boasting about the fantastic job they are doing to protect the city centre, but on this occasion they are responsible for the despoliation one of Edinburgh’s most treasured places.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"popular designer dogs and puppies being sold for four figure sums online in

Bridges, chief executive of Edinburgh Dog and Cat Home.ldquoThe only way we can begin to tackle this issue is to promote responsible breeding practices with the highest welfare standards.Charities advise the best way to avoid such problems is to rehome a rescue pet from an animal sanctuary.Although not a legal requirement, experts advise ensuring that any dogs bought online are registered with the Kennel Club or another similar organisation.Yet many online adverts offering puppies across the city fail to mention any such accreditation.They include French bulldog puppies available for £, and Havanese for more than £,.So-called designer dogs such as cockapoos have also been spotted for sale online.ldquoUnfortunately itrsquos unlikely that a ban on the advertising of pets for sale online would eradicate the challenges of poor animal welfare, impulse buying of pets and unscrupulous sellers looking to make a profit from selling animals, added Mr Bridges.ldquoWe would always encourage anyone thinking of buying a dog or cat to first think of rehoming an animal from a local rescue centre.ldquoIf that is not an option for your family, please ensure that you use a reputable, registered breeder so your money doesnrsquot help fund criminals or the puppy farming trade.While puppies advertised online in the Capital are in litters of five or fewer, the Scottish SPCA has led efforts in recent years to crack down on so-called puppy farms.These large-scale intensive breeding operations see puppies bred for profit ndash often in horrendous conditions.Scottish SPCA chief superintendent Mike Flynn said: ldquoThe enormity of the industry is due to profit and public demand.The quickest way to halt the supply of illegally bred pups is for public demand to fall.ldquoIf you go to a reputable breeder, you may be waiting over  months for a puppy.ldquoWhen people find out about theof wait, they turn to the internet where they can get a puppy immediately. ldquoThis is how the

A non-aggression pact between the Greens, Lib Dems and Plaid Cymru has been widely discussed in Wales, but so far no similar deals have been reached in Scotland.The Scottish Greens faced criticism from Nationalists after confirming last week they would stand in Perth and North Perthshire - held by veteran SNP MP Pete Wishart with a majority of just .: Tory MP Ross Thomson quits as election candidateMr Rennie, Lib Dem leader in Scotland, said: “Scottish Labour say that they oppose another independence referendum and want to remain in the EU but they have been put in their place by Jeremy Corbyn.

Butthis is rejected, what other options are out there for the SNP:Wildcat Referendum This would see the Scottish Government forge ahead with a vote regardless of the legal position, perhaps insisting they have a mandate from the Scottish peoplenot Westminster. It would win widespread support from grassroots nationalists who are hungry for action, but this approach in Catalonia only resulted in Madrid sending in troops on the ground and the leaders of the pro-independence campaign, who organised the vote, being jailed. Although such a hardline approach met with widespread criticism, it has done nothing to further the independence movement. Nicola Sturgeon has so far ruled out such an approach, insisting it wont gain international recognitionLegal challenge Both Nicola Sturgeon and and her Constitution Secretary mike Russell were notably cagey about the prospect of a legal challenge when quizzed about this at the SNP conference in Aberdeen last month.After the success of the SNP Home Affairs spokeswoman Joanna Cherry in spearheading the UK Supreme Court challenge against Boris Johnsons unlawful proroguing of Parliament, the party may feel going down the legal route is a feasible option. Its not clear what the grounds for challenge would be, but a number of constitutional experts believe that Holyrood may already have the authority to hold a legal referendum on independence under the devolution settlement - and the matter would at least be worth putting to the legal test. The problem is that, the Scottish Parliament would definitely not have the authority to implement independence in the event of a yes vote under such a scenario. It may nonetheless be seen as a legitimate way to test public opinion, although the the prospect of a boycott by unionists may scupper this. Unilateral Declaration of IndependenceSenior Nationalists, including ex-Health Secretary Alex Neil and Western Isles MP Angus MacNeil have talked up such an approach. This would see the Scottish Government open independence negotiations in the event of a majority SNP victory at a Holyrood or Westminster election. A motion was brought to the SNPs party conference seeking a change n policy to adopt UDI as a \"Plan B\"a Section  is not successful. but it was rejected by delegates and Nicola Sturgeon has spoken out against such an approach.Non co-operation Although unlikely, the SNP could opt to live a bit dangerously to increase the pressure for independence. The Scottish Government has signicant powers in a range of areas which could be utilised to make le very dficult for Westminster. For example the Greens have been agitating for tighter controls on the transportation of nuclear weapons from the Faslane naval base, with some claims that Holyroods control of environmental laws could even effectively thwart their passage through Scotland in order to be \"serviced\" at Aldermaston. The current SNP Transport Secretary Michael Matheson has previously sought to introduce legislation which would criminalise ministers who prepare the way for the use of nuclear weapons. Thequestion is whether such a confrontational approach would alienate voters from the independence cause. ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"first look at the jarls squad ","story":"Plenty of onlookers were already on the streets as the squad made its first procession of the day from Islesburgh Community Centre, past the galley shed on St Sunniva Street and on to the Toll Clock Shopping Centre.In the gloom, the ranks of the Jarl#s Squad looked the part wearing emerald green kirtles with dragon mots underneath simple brown leather breastplates embossed with the same mot.

I do think the government has to recognise the costs up here.#Ms Henderson described food bank usage as #shocking in this day and age#, and highlighted the Trussel Trust – the organisation behind the food bank – which had data on who is accessing the service.#Once you#ve got clearer information on the problem you can look at ways of dealing with it.#She described as #a sin# that perfectly good food was being thrown out by supermarkets just because it was at or near its sell-by date.Mr Robinson said the government#s roll-out of the universal credit was at the #root cause# of the problem.#It#s been an absolute shambles. How they expected folk could go for weeks without any money at all, just with the the promise it would be sorted out, I think is disgraceful.#He said the much-maligned #bedroom tax# had also been a contributing factor, and added it was important for people both in public and private sectors to have a fair living wage.Ms Valente said she had been shocked by the numbers of people who needed to use the food bank but were too ashamed of their poverty.#The cost of housing is one of the things I find quite shocking,# she said, adding that people needed to #earn a huge amount of money# to put a roof over their heads.She was also #appalled# by universal credit, and added it was wrong for society to #really target# or make people feel bad about being poor.Mr Wenger said people were encouraged to go to Citizens Advice Bureau, which could advise people on how to manage their finances.But Debra Nicolson, who stood as the Green candidate in the recent Holyrood campaign, pressed for more information on what candidates would doelected.Other questions were asked about the stigma attached to free school meals, and how it can be tackled.Ms Valente said responsibility lay with the government, but stressed the council needed to ensure social work staff and support services were fully prepared to help.Mr Robinson pointed to the -plus housing waiting list, and stressed affordable housing was key to solving the problem.Ms Henderson added there was an #antiquated rule# in the council that a percentage of the housing stock had to be kept free in case there was an emergency, and added she had argued that should be scrapped because #people need houses now#.Mr Flaws added there would always be a stigma until people are prepared to talk more openly about it.Mr Wenger said beating stigma, and preventing discrimination, needed to start at an early age. He added SSE had raised energy prices three times in one year, and stressed the issue should be picked up in the council.A former councillor, Iris Hawkins, wondered how well the candidates would adjust to #le in the goldfish bowl.#Mr Wenger said many people knew him already as a postman and as a tourist guide.

It suits me now#. Once that#s done you just have to get on with it.#As for Ms Henderson, she stressed she would be #very happy# to be accountable from the start.#There will be no curtains in my goldfish bowl,# she said.The site of a new Gilbert Bain Hospital was then brought up by chairman Jim Anderson, with Mr Robinson – who chairs NHS Shetland – left feeling distinctly on the spot.#I think wherever the site is it needs to be somewhere that is close to,not within, Lerwick. That#s going to be one of the real challenges.#Mr Wenger had his eye across the Bressay Sound.#Build the fixed link to Bressay, and build the Gilbert Bain Hospital on Bressay,# he told Mr Anderson.Mr Flaws admitted there were few options on where the hospital could be built.#You have to be looking on the outskirts of Lerwick – the south road or the north road.#Ms Valente said there was no easy solution.#I suspect any decision to build the hospital is going to be  years down the road.#Ms Henderson said any consideration needed to be #future-proofed#.

Where did the candidates stand on this in light of the climate emergency Mr Flaws said he believed that was why the council had not yet declared a climate emergency.#The council is going to have to update its carbon management plan and see how it is going to bring this forward.#The council needs to be more transparent on what their long-term thinking is.#Part of the discussion focused on the Viking Energy windfarm.Ms Henderson said it was dficult to address Sullom Voe #until they#ve said what they want to do#.She added she was #not a fan# of the inter-connector, and the Viking windfarm was #not a green scheme – it#s only green in the context of money#.Meanwhile, Mr Robinson said the council should declare a climate emergency #and not worry about the oil companies#.He said BP had a #huge solar arm# in its organisation, while Total also promoted its environmental credentials and the Danish Dong Energy had gone completely out of the oil and gas sector.#Without declaring the emergency I don#t think there#s any real impetus to do anything.#Without declaring the emergency I don#t think there#s any real impetus to do anything– GARY ROBINSONMr Wenger said Sullom Voe helped provide the UK with oil and gas.But he said attitudes were changing, particularly with a growth in electric car usage.#Electricity you can produce without burning fossil fuels is the best.#Ms Valente said it was impossible to get rid of fossil fuels #over night#, but stressed thinking had to start now.#Maybe Shetland can do without Sullom Voe but the economy of Britain still depends on that. We need to bring it down and work on other solutions.#But I think the council does need to declare a climate emergency.#Questions were also raised on ferry links to the mainland, with concerns voiced about the number of cabins and the freight constraints.Ms Valente said the boats were #not fit for purpose,# and added capacity for freight was #dreadful#.Mr Robinson said Shetland should be able to design a ferry to suit its own needs. He said the real problems with NorthLink vessels lay at constraints at Aberdeen Harbour, as well as regulations which limited where on a vessel cabins could be placed.#To my mind we really should have the power locally to resolve our own ferry service, so we can design something that works for us.#Mr Flaws said the ferries were commissioned roughly  years ago. He said it was dficult for his family of five to get away on the ferry.#They#re just not fit for purpose. We need to say what we need rather than be told what we should be using.#Discussion also focused on the bus service, with support for cheaper – or even,possible, free – buses being offered.Mr Flaws said it would be good to see more people using buses.#If it was cheaper or free then maybe more folk would be using it. If that was an incentive to get more folk on it, then that should be looked at,# although he acknowledged some bus times did not suit everybody.Ms Valente cited an occasion when she lived in Sandveien when the bus could get her to work just before am.#They they changed the service, so that actually you either had to get to work by half eight or half nine.

If Edinburgh and Skye do suffer from overtourism, what can we do about it  In a free country, we cannot stop people from coming here, evenwe wanted to.It should also be recognised that folk visit those two places for dferent reasons. Edinburgh is an architectural jewel which is at its most crowded during the annual festival. People come to Skye for the scenery — most notably in recent years to the Trotternish Ridge and the Fairy Pools, two undeniably beautul spots in an island which is full of other undeniably beautul spots.Edinburgh cannot be expected to cancel its festival, any more than we want to drain the Fairy Pools or blow up the Old Man of Storr.And we do not want to stop them coming. They bring money, which provides jobs and kickstarts enterprises and improves the island#s economic wellbeing even outside the realm of the local tourist industry.Professor John Lennonof Glasgow Caledonian University#s Moffat Centre is presently commissioned by another independent body, SkyeConnect, to carry out a major survey of the impact of tourism on Skye.Professor Lennon and his colleagues are not due to deliver their report until next spring. But he will offer a taste of its findings so far to the autumn conference of SkyeConnect next month.We look forward to both the sample and the full report. We can hazard a guess at some of its content.Skye has been #discovered# by the rest of the world, like a Caledonian Machu Picchu.Unlike the Peruvian Inca site, however, Skye is a very big island. Unlike Machu Picchu, it is not yet collapsing under the weight of its visitors# feet.Skye can — and Mark Crothall congratulated the Skyetime campaign for pointing this out — accommodate half a million visitors, and continue to benefit hugely from their spending, particularlycertain adjustments are made to the tourist itinerary.More people should be encouraged to spend a quiet and infinitely rewarding week in Elgol or Waternish, in all four seasons, than take a whistle-stop, bucket list summer tour of the Storr, the Fairy Pools and back to the bridge.And of course, local and national government should do much more to improve the basic infrastructure of the island, from roads and parking areas to public transport and public toilets.Skye has bucked the trend of the rest of the north-western Highlands and Islands by growing its population and its economy in recent years.That has chiefly been because of the tourist industry. After  years of steady and apparently irreversible decline, the growth quite naturally took everybody by surprise. We should now learn to adapt to it, rather than call it #overtourism# and hope that it goes away."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/001WH2510NCA-web.jpg","title":"west highland free press audio files friday 25th","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineEvery week, Skye  Lochalsh Council for Voluntary Organisations http:www.slcvo.org.uk  produces an abridged audio version of the West Highland Free Press.

Anyone that met her - she took a piece of their heart straight away and they never forgot her.Ruby had to battle a lot day to day, but she did it with huge strength, she was fully depended on us   for all of her care. This was huge for us as a family.Ruby did not sleep at night. She had a lot of cerebral irritation and suffered from frequent seizures daily We, as her parents, were the only ones able to provide this care.This is where the Hospice played a huge part in our lives, Ruby attended the hospice for respite from the age of six months. The hospice is a home away from home that provides the most amazing care and love to the children and their families with full : medical care  .We, as a family, felt completely comfortable that Ruby was being cared for to the highest standard, in a place filled with love and joy. This gave us time to refuel to keep going that bit longer.The Hospice were also there for us in Ruby’s end of le care, we spent our final two days with her there, in the comfort of a home setting with the support of the nursing staff around us.This gave us precious time that we would never have got anywhere .We made memories that we will cherish forever and we are truly indebted to the Hospice for having such a signicant impact in our final days with Ruby.We decided to host Rubys Birthday Fundraiser last year and it was a huge success, raising an amazing pound,. The whole community and local business were fully behind us and couldn’t have done it without them. The NI Childrens Hospice is the only one of its kind in Northern Ireland providing care to  children with le limiting conditions.The annual running cost of the Hospice is pound.million, that is for four rooms of the  the hospice has - the hope would be to get all  rooms funded and running.The government support is only % of this, thats why the Hospice relies so heavily on fundraising events to keep this facility running for families like ourselves.My goal in le is to keep Ruby’s memory alive and by holding her parties its raising money in Ruby’s name for the Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice.We will be forever indebted to the Hospice for all the support they gave us during Ruby’s le with respite, end of le care and all the memories we created in Horizon House. I continue to tell my story of grief and Ruby’s le on my blog Chasingladybirds it has been a good way help journey through grief and to also reach out to others in the same situation.Everyone that knew Ruby knew that ladybirds was her wee thing.When she was only a few months old a ladybird landed on her toes one summer day and thats where it all started.In my journey of grief I decided that blogging might be a good outlet and a good way to share my story and journey of grief.Chasing ladybirds came from our connection of ladybirds with Ruby, and Chasing was down to we will always chase Ruby’s memory.We will never forget our memories and love for her - we will always chase every moment we had with her.Lisa and her family would love ityou can make it to Rubys Birthday Fundraiser.Admission costs pound for adults and children go free. There will bouncing castles, soft play, face painting, nail painting, little gladiators, cake sale and a raffle with an array of great prizes,as well as Victoria Sponges with filled do-nuts.Raffle tickets cost pound a strip and can be purchased before the partythey can’t attend by contacting Lisa via Instagram: @chasingladybirds or Facebook: Lisa Powell.The fun kicks off at pm until pm and most importantly all money raised goes towards this vital cause - a poignant and fitting way to remember little Rubys legacy.

I really trust him and the cast can see how his mind works as a director.”Known for her comedic roles, Katie spoke of how it was great to sink her teeth into a dramatic role. “This is a real love story of a middle class Protestant who falls in love with an Irish rebel – and we’ll leave it there,” she laughed.“I don’t want to give too much away. Myself and fellow actor Maria Connolly are on stage the whole time, linking the threadsyou like. It is such a lovely piece of writing by Kate.“Kate’s son Sean, one of the forces behind the Dead Rabbit Bar in New York, will be offering an Irish coffee before the show courtesy of the bar as well. It is a very limited run, just over two nights, but it’s wonderful that audiences will be able to see Kate’s final work.”The piece, produced by GBL Productions’ Briege Lynch, is an emotional one for all involved as Briege said she knew Kate since she was four.“I’m very honoured to have Betrothed as my first producing credit,” she said. “I’ve known and loved Kate since I was four running in and out of the Community Arts Forum offices as a young child where my dad, Martin, was director and Kate was the administrator. I probably got under her feet a lot but she was always so kind and caring and would sneak me treats. I’m sad that she isn’t here to bask in the glory of getting this writing from the page to the stage.”Betrothed by Kate Muldoon runs at the Grand Opera House in the Baby Grand from November  and .

The event will also see launch of a groundbreaking new report that outlines a framework for community development.The paper, entitled ‘We Must Dissent’, is the result of a community survey that assessed the human rights of local residents against the major issues facing the area. Amongst the issues identied were concerns around road safety, housing, health, education, and unemployment.Another key issue was the pressures of commercial land speculation in the area, which has presented an obstacle to the community development of the Lanyon Tunnels.Despite planning permission and £.million being granted for the development, plans have been stalled by owners of an adjacent piece of land – which was subject to plans to build a £million office block.In , residents won a legal victory when the High Court ruled that planning approval for office block was unlawful. However, the potential for future plans to develop the land could impede access to the tunnelsgiven the go-ahead.Speaking ahead of next Wednesday’s event, Fionntán Hargey from the Market Development Association said the tunnels development would provide a “massive boost to people’s self esteem”.“It would physically reconnect them to city centre and it would also reconnect them into the economic, social and cultural le of Belfast. “The tunnels got planning permission in , and there is £. million in funding sitting there ready to go, and there are three groups of residents trained up and they’ve got business places developed. We also have updated drawings that have recently been commissioned. “The issue is that there is a private developer who is refusing to grant access to allow the project to go ahead.”He continued: “Next Wednesday will refresh people on the latest concept drawings and give people wider overview of the Redeveloping the Local Economy programme. Our aspiration is that by January we will be launching a report, and we will have several groups of residents with business ideas that are on course for development.” Next Wednesday’s event will take place at pm in the Market Community Centre where guest speaker, Dr Sean Byers, will discuss the economics of community empowerment.

It needs to test the durability of its ‘surge’ in the Euro and council elections a few months ago and the most obvious way of doing that is to present itself as the only genuine ‘other’ alternative in every seat.Its chances of winning any seat don’t, on the surface, appear to be high. That said, I wouldn’t completely dismiss Long’s chances in East Belfast and it is likely that some small-u unionists might sht towards the party and keep up their percentage overall.The DUP and UUP have an ‘understanding’ in North Belfast and Fermanagh South Tyrone but may now look to reaching a broader one embracing South and East Belfast and North Down. The problem is that there seems nothing bankable for the UUP from any arrangement, meaning that it could really struggle for relevance, seats and votes.Two things are certain, though.

Higgins.Mannus was born in Canada but moved with his Northern Irish family back to their homeland at the age of seven.At yesterdays final, the former Linfield and St Johnstone goalkeeper, who also had spells at Larne and Carrick Rangers, ended up as one of Shamrock Rovers heroes.He saved a penalty in a shootout after the  minutes of normal and extra time ended in a - stalemate against the League of Ireland champions.Rovers won the shootout - and Mannus was immediately surrounded by his team-mates as they recorded their first FAI Cup win for  years in front of over , fans.One of his Rovers colleagues, Ronan Finn, hailed Mannus as the \"best goalkeeper in Ireland\".However, on social media Mannus - who brought a young child onto the pitch after the game to join in the celebrations - was subjected to a torrent of abuse over the Irish anthem issue.One condemned Mannus for failing to respect the anthem, adding that he \"doesnt have to sing but respect costs nothing\".Some of the attacks descended into sectarian abuse.Others said Mannus was one of our own and some defended the goalie, who has been capped nine times for Northern Ireland, insisting he was well within his rights to do whatever he wanted during the playing of the anthem.Several compared his approach to that of Londonderry-born Republic of Ireland international James McClean, who is subjected to regular criticism over his refusal to wear a poppy on his shirt at games in the Premier League in England.One poster said: \"The same people slaughtering Alan Mannus are the same people who do be up in arms when James McClean gets hate for standing up for his beliefs.\"Eleven years ago a Northern Ireland under- international was caught up in a similar controversy over the national anthem before an FAI Cup Final, where he was playing for Derry City against Bohemians.Sammy Morrow did not turn with other players to face the Irish flag, but he later said that he stood up straight with his head up to show his respect. He said he was disappointed and disheartened by the criticism levelled at him.There was also controversy over the pre-match ritual in the  Irish Cup final.Cltonville FC players appeared to bow their heads during the playing of God Save the Queen before their - defeat against Coleraine.Cltonville officials had requested that the song not be played before the game at Windsor Park."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37391119.ece/7857c/BINARY/road%20closed.jpg","title":"northern ireland traffic alerts latest updates","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

remains a stark reality in Northern Ireland, a report has found..pushThe latest publication by the Independent Reporting Commissionsets out how the ongoing political vacuum, Brexit uncertainty and an increase in attacks has made ending paramilitarism “immeasurably more dficult”.The second report from the IRC on progress towards ending paramilitary activity in the region comes after a year which saw several murders.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Journalist Lyra McKee who was killed by dissident republicans as she observed a riot in Londonderry These include the killing of journalist Lyra McKee by dissident republicans in Londonderry in April, as well as the death of community worker Ian Ogle at the hands of loyalists in east Belfast in January.The last  months also saw a number of attacks including the detonation by dissidents of a bomb at Derry court house and the planting of an under-car bomb targeting a police officer which was discovered at a golf club.The IRC commissioners state that paramilitarism remains a stark reality in Northern Ireland, and continues to be a serious obstacle to peace and reconciliation.The commissioners also reiterated their analysis from their first report last October that ending paramilitarism “can only be sustainably brought about by means of a Twin Track Approach, which combines policing and justice responses alongside systemically tackling the serious socio-economic deprivation facing the communities where the paramilitaries operate”.In their second report, the commissioners recommend that tackling paramilitarism be made a new dedicated outcome in the Programme for Government as the best way of achieving the whole-of-system approach they believe is needed.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  A car bomb exploding outside the court house on Bishop Street in Londonderry in January They point to the need for neighbourhood policing to be enhanced and for urgent action to address the delay in cases coming before the courts.The commissioners also highlight the need for increased asset recovery, recommending that an agency focusing solely on civil recovery of the proceeds of crime be established in Northern Ireland.To that end, the commissioners have called for a major public debate to begin, aware that their recommendations to end continuing paramilitary activity will need the support and confidence of the whole of society.The four commissioners include John McBurney and Monica McWilliams, who were nominated by the Northern Ireland Executive Tim O’Connor, nominated by the Irish Government, and Mitchell Reiss, nominated by the UK Government.They are tasked with reporting annually to the UK and Irish Governments and to the Northern Ireland Executive."},{"url":null,"title":"plan for 40 east

Its a considerable concession, as she may have had an interest in standing in the constituency herself.\"In the past the DUP and UUP have formed electoral pacts in closely fought constituencies, such as North Belfast and Fermanagh-South Tyrone to avoid splitting the unionist vote.In an interview in this newspaper on October  Mr Aiken had said \"there will be no pacts with the DUP under my leadership\", and said the UUP would run in all  constituencies.However, it sparked a row within unionism, including criticism from within the UUP amid fears it would jeopardise Mr Dodds chances of retaking the North Belfast seat.On Thursday this newspaper revealed that  unionists in the North Belfast constituency had written a joint letter urging Mr Aiken to rethink his plans.And the next day it emerged police were investigating threats against UUP staff members.In a -word statement yesterday, Mr Aiken said: \"In a modern democracy no one should have to face threats, intimidation or coercion of any sort because of their involvement in the democratic process.\"It is appalling and totally reprehensible and should have no place in Northern Ireland in the st century.\"Mr Aiken said, as Ulster Unionists, it is their role to \"protect and promote the Union\" and vital Northern Ireland MPs take their seats in Westminster.He added: \"In the face of Boris Johnsons terrible deal which forces Northern Ireland towards the edge of the Union, we cannot gt a seat to Sinn Fein who support this direction either in North Belfast or Fermanagh and South Tyrone.\"In Fermanagh-South Tyrone, Michelle Gildernew has an -vote majority.Mr Elliott had been expected to be the partys unanimous choice, but when contacted by the Belfastyesterday, he refused to confirmhe plans toto front line politics.\"There is a selection meeting taking place this week and I am considering the situation,\" he said.On Saturday Mrs Foster said she believes in unionist co-operation and parties working together to maximise representation.Mrs Foster said: \"Despite the DUP being the largest unionist party in the constituency, it is right to put wider interest ahead of narrow party politics and indicate our support for Tom Elliott to retake this seat.\"What the UUP man said yesterday ...“The outcome of the forthcoming Westminster elections will impact on Northern Ireland more than any other part of the United Kingdomplans for a border in the Irish Sea are implemented.“DUP responsibility in this debacle cannot be whitewashed away. It was their acceptance of a regulatory border in the Irish Sea on the nd October, vigorously opposed by the Ulster Unionist Party, which opened the floodgates for Boris Johnson and his dreadful deal. The Union itself is now in a precarious position not in spite of the DUP’s stance but because of the DUP’s actions.“We have been in discussions with senior political and community figures across North Belfast. In doing so we listened respectfully to all views expressed, including deeply held concerns that they will be unrepresented in Westminster in the critical months ahead.“This has been done in the context of threats and intimidation against Ulster Unionist Party staff and members. In a modern democracy no one should have to face threats, intimidation or coercion of any sort because of their involvement in the democratic process. It is appalling and totally reprehensible and should have no place in Northern Ireland in the st century.“As Ulster Unionists it is our role to protect and promote the Union. Therefore it is absolutely vital that MPs are ed who will take their seats and be able to influence the future direction of our nation.“We are a party that believes first and foremost in the Union, and secondly in the importance of representative democracy. Therefore we have decided not to nominate a candidate in North Belfast in the forthcoming election. The DUP recognise that they cannot win North Belfast on their own, despite having dismissed the opinions of other unionists in the past. They cannot expect to continue on that basis and must now realise they need Ulster Unionist voices at Westminster.“The choice in North Belfast is between Nigel Dodds as MP or an abstentionist MP who refuses to stand in Westminster to talk about health, education, justice, international affairs, or the future direction of the United Kingdom. In the face of Boris Johnson’s terrible deal which forces Northern Ireland towards the edge of the Union, we cannot gt a seat to Sinn Fein who support this direction either in North Belfast or Fermanagh and South Tyrone.“It is better to elect Nigel Dodds in North Belfast and hold him to account for his promises on the Union than facilitate the election of an abstentionist Sinn Fein MP who still cannot condemn IRA violence. We acknowledge that this decision will be welcomed by some and will disappoint others, but we believe it is in the best interests of our country and the Union.”What he said in Belfaston October  ...“The UUP will be contesting every seat in the general election. We will be aiming to win back Fermanagh and South Tyrone from Sinn Fein and South Antrim from the DUP. There will be no pacts with the DUP under my leadership.”"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38658717.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/Sinn-fein-GElection_announcement_.jpg","title":"general election sinn fein pulls out of three constituencies in race for westminster seats","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

amend current Dail rules to remove the Government’s ability to block a bill on the basis of potential incidental expenses and costs.SPBP TDs will lodge a Dail motion to unblock over  opposition bills currently stuck in limbo because of the governments use of the money message.At a press conference in Dublin on Monday, Solidarity People Before Profit TDs said, while this is constitutional, some bills put forward by opposition TDs are being blocked by the Government on frivolous grounds.People Before Profit TD Richard Boyd Barrett said all too often, a bill receives an overwhelming majority “only to veto it on very vague, very  cost grounds”.Rise TD Paul Murphy said no matter what bills Opposition party TDs put forward or how much support it gets “it does not make any dference”.“The most blatant example is the abuse by the Government of the ’money message’ procedure, which they have used to block over  Bills, despite them being voted for by a majority in the Dail,” he said.“You can

Government has used its  “executive veto” to ignore the will of the majority of the Dail on issues such as the sex education bill and the climate emergency bill which had popular support.The motion which will be debated in the Dail on Wednesday would change current standing orders that govern the progress of opposition bills.Mr Murphy saidthe bill passes, it will signal “signicant democratic reform”.“This is a change to the standing orders.“If we pass it on Thursday, then it is changed immediately.“It’s a signicant democratic reform for the benefit of people across the country and for the benefit of future attendees and a future Dail where executive veto won’t be able to be used,” he said.Solidarity TD Ruth Coppinger said the Government’s use of a money message to block SPBP’s Objective Sex Education Bill is reckless.“There was widespread support for this Bill from student, women, youth and LGBT organisations.“We can see now that far right and religious fundamentalists are targeting sex education reform now, because they want to hold back social progress.“The Government, by not moving decisively, is playing into their hands.“They must stop blocking vital sex education,”

This is the time for change. I want to be that change.“This is the st century for goodness sake, we need to escape from the overbearing and hierarchical structures that have made it all too easy for a culture of bullying to take root.”Father of the House, Mr Kenneth Clarke explains how the next Speaker of the House of Commons will be selected today.Watch the Speaker’s election live here: https:t.co UcpHKFeoFind out more about the Speakers election: https:t.co DjOgaqhuL#SpeakersElection pic ODSTsoEuzu— UK House of CommonsNovember , Meg Hillier, Labour MP for Hackney South and Shoreditch, also insisted on the need for a “culture sht”, adding: “We have to put our own House in order and call out bad behaviour where necessary, but prevent it before it gets to that point.”She added she is “not a grandstanding politician” and would speak as little as needed, before saying: “The main thrust of why I’m standing is the bullying and harassment that is still too re in this building.”Ms Hillier said there is a “good list of MPs to work for and a bad list of MPs to work for”, noting: “Staff know this, we know this, it may be an uncomfortable message, it may not be a vote winner today, but we should not be complacent evenwe’re on that good list.”The favourite for the role, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, opened by paying tribute to a “great hero” of his, former speaker Betty Boothroyd, who watched from the side gallery.He highlighted his experience as a deputy speaker for nine years, and stressed the need to allow backbench MPs to hold those in power to account.Sir Lindsay also said the Commons is “not a club” whereof service takes priority, adding: “The person who walked through that door yesterday is just as important to their constituents – their voice must be heard as well – and the pecking order ought not to be there, it is about equality.”Sir Lindsay also vowed to push on with security reforms to keep MPs, their families, staff and the Commons safe.Harriet Harman, a Labour former minister, concluded the speeches by stressing the next Speaker is “really important” as the public’s view of Parliament “is at an all-time low”.Ms Harman said: “I would reform the Speaker’s powers to make them transparent and accountable to this House, and I would be fearless in standing up for the rights of the House.”She added: “Six hundred years, only ever one woman.“There have been  men, and this is my question to the House today. Can we show the country we have changed by putting the second woman in that Speaker’s chair ”Mr Bercow, , departed the Speaker’s chair on October .He entered Parliament in  and held several shadow ministerial positions before taking the Speaker’s chair on June  , promising to serve “no more than nine years in total”.He abandoned that commitment ahead of the  snap election, but allegations of bullying by former members of his staff, denied by the Speaker, led to fresh calls for him to quit.In recent months he also came under fire for a series of controversial Brexit rulings in the chamber, which were widely considered to favour Remain supporters."},{"url":null,"title":"shares in gambling firms plunge after mps call for online crackdown","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Stephen’s family accepted a request from the College to rename the Year  Class League, which Stephen had been a winning captain of in , in Stephen’s memory.  Presentation of the Shield with Conor Glass, the Quinn family and organiser Mr William McAteer.  The traditional setting of the day of the Halloween holidays has since become Stephen Quinn Shield Final day. As ever this year’s final was a very exciting final, battled out by two teams who had met in the group stages when Pt had come out on top in a high scoring encounter. googletag.cmd.push With the full Year  cohort of pupils giving excellent support Ti opened brightly with Dara O’Kane, Daragh O’Neill and Ruairi Biggs all to the fore. Ryan McGrath was excellent in goals while Danny Mc Goldrick was very solid in defence. Pt though worked their way back in to the game after the early onslaught and as the half wore on they had a lot of play but couldn’t manage to get the crucial scores, despite hitting the woodwork on two occasions and seeing two other goal chances go agonisingly close to the major they needed. Daire Hull, Leon Woods, Jack Rodgers and Corie McKay were proper driving forces for the underdogs while Dara Hassan was excellent in goals but the absence of Padraig O Kane from full back was a huge loss to their team. This was more keenly felt as the underdogs tired through the second-half and it was Ti who finished strongly to send joint captains Dara O’Kane and Daragh O’Neill up to collect the much coveted Stephen Quinn Shield. The Quinn family were present to hand over the Shield and they were joined by another previous winning captain of the event and St Patrick’s legend, Conor Glass, revisiting the St Mary Building while on holidays from his professional career with Hawthorn in Australia. “The College would like to thank the Quinn family for their unwavering support of the event and for being in attendance to do the presentation,” commented Paul Hughes. “Thanks also to Mr William McAteer who organised and ran a fantastic event and to Conor Glass for attending the event. Finally of course a huge well done to all the Year  pupils who took part over many lunch times in the past few weeks.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The event aimed to look at the issues affecting Atlantic Salmon in the freshwater and marine environment, with particular focus on the salmon of the Foyle system. The conference was well attended by members of the angling community interest- ed to hear the latest updates and research developments.  Opening the conference, Loughs Agency chief executive officer, Sharon McMahon, explained that “globally salmon numbers are in decline and we must work collectively to ensure the survival of this iconic fish in the cross border catchments of Foyle and Carlingford areas’. Speakers, who included Professor Ken Whelan, Dr Cathal Gallagher and Dr Robert Rosell, took the audience through the scientic journey of the salmon and echoed the stark warning that scientists, anglers and government agencies need to work together to protect the Atlantic salmon. Dr Diego Del Villar also presented to the large crowd on the SeaMonitor project.  SeaMonitor is a unique marine research project, the first of its kind in Europe, studying the seas around Ireland, Western Scotland and Northern Ireland. It will deliver Europe’s largest telemetric marine array and spatial models, supporting the conservation of several species including Atlantic salmon and will ultimately produce a Salmon Manage ment Plan for the River Foyle.The Loughs Agency will shortly be launching a public consultation to capture the views of the public in managing the salmon fishery. John McCartney, director of conservation andprotection, said: “We value the input and opinion of the public when reviewing our salmon management programme. I would encourage everyone take time to consider and respond to the questions’.Speaking after the conference, Francis Curran, chairperson of FASTA, said: ‘I’d like to thank the Loughs Agency and the professional speakers for providing an interesting forum on the challenges that the angling community face in terms of conservation of our Foyle system. We recognise that there are many drivers that are feeding into the problem but that anglers are up for working in partnership with the relevant government agencies, fishing clubs, private fisheries and the angling community North and South.”Mr Curran concluded: “We endorse the consultation process that will be rolled out by the Loughs Agency which will help inform decision makers as we move forward into this dficult period.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Described by her art teacher, Karen Torley, as someone who ‘paints mainly in acrylics and watercolours but over the last year has grown so much as an artist both in ability and confidence,’ and testament to this is shown by her large Facebook following and the great support she receives from all over the country.“I love painting because it makes me happy and gives me confidence,’ said Tori, as she relaxes in the comfort of her Waterside home among a number of paintings she recently finished for the exhibition,” said Tori.‘I called the exhibition ‘True Colours’ because I like bright colours and love the song since I heard it when it was being used for Autism Awareness.’Looking forward to her daughter’s upcoming exhibitions, mum, Dara, said she has seen Tori change for the better since taking up art. “There has been so many positive benefits since Tori has started to paint and we are so glad that she has found what she truly loves doing. We are all very proud of her,” she said.The budding young artist has many strings to her bow and presently has a work placement once a week in an office under the guidance of Habinteg Housing and is supported by Mencap. The young Waterside woman is also a keen photographer in her spare time.Tori is also been supported by the Foyle Down Syndrome Trust where she presently learns printing skills under their social enterprise programme and she put these skills to good use recently by printing her own posters and invites for the upcoming exhibitions. But it’s art that is still her first love and its where she’s directing all her energy to become and make a career of being a professional artist.Karen Torley, Banyan Theatre and Tori’s art tutor agrees. “Since I started working with Tori three years ago she has grown so much in her talents and confidence. We work together weekly on new paintings but have daily discussions on art and new ideas. Watching her development as an artist gives me so much joy, she is the highlight of my week.”Hoping for a great turnout at the two events, Tori’s mum Dara added: ‘All any parent wants for their children is for them to be happy and she is so happy when she is painting.’Tori’s exhibitions will take place at the Waterside Theatre from Friday, th November and the second will start at the Garden of Reflection on Monday, th November. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

New projects this year included social prescribing mdash helping people who present to their local GP to get out and about in their local area.New investment in multi-disciplinary teams in GP practices in Down was now being rolled out to the rest of Newry and Mourne. He said the Network was central to that roll-out and CDRCNrsquos experience of social prescribing made the organisation a great source of referrals to local community activities.Cllr Casey said CDRCN along with Community Advice and other umbrella support organisations were key to the delivery of Council services. He was grateful to the Network and especially to the hundreds of groups and thousands of volunteers who work away, day and night with no financial reward to make sure this area is a safe, pleasant and prosperous place to live, work and play.Alan Dumigan, CDRCN chairman, thanked the outgoing management committee for their time and expertise in bringing the Network forward.He acknowledged Board member Doris Noe, of Lecale Conservation, who, he said, had contributed her time, energy and expertise over the last number of years to the organisation and he wished her well in her retirement from the board.He thanked the community groups for their ongoing support and the management and staff for their continued commitment.The guest speaker, Dr Chris Leggett, recalled his long association with the community network and the exciting new developments. He acknowledged the importance of projects tackling social isolation and poverty and the need to address mental health and suicide in our local area.Nicholas McCrickard, CDRCN manager, presented the work of the organisation and reported that an increasing range of activities and projects were delivered to a high standard.He thanked the board and staff for a ldquofabulous year and acknowledged that the community and voluntary sector from Bangor to Crossmaglen was a thriving and creative place which was tackling issues relating to health, the economy, the environment and more.ldquoWorking together with the local Councils and Government departments is key to our success, he said. ldquoOur communities have a powerful voice coupled with large numbers of willing volunteers and we have risen to the challenge of tackling mental and physical health problems.The evening concluded with a talk from local photographer Raphael Mason on how photography can impact on peoplersquos physical and mental wellbeing.

Conor Woods got Ballycran moving in the eighth minute with a converted free, but Dunloy responded with two-in-a-row from Elliott and Nicky McKeague to go four points clear.Liam Savage kept Ballycran ticking over with a point from play, but a goal and a point from Cunning eased Dunloy into a - to - lead by the th minute.Woods and Cunning, via a rsquo, swapped points before Liam Savage grabbed his second score of the game in the th minute.Two further Ballycran points from Woods reduced the arrears to four points by the th minute, but Paul Shields and Chris Brogan stretched Dunloyrsquos lead to - to - after  minutes.Woods registered Ballycranrsquos seventh point in the th minute, but Dunloy finished the first half scoring with points from Shields and Cunning as the Antrim side went into the break with a commanding - to - lead.The scores should have been much closer as Ballycran registered six wides in a competitive first half.Woods opened the scoring after the break, but Ballycranrsquos uphill challenge got even harder when Gerard Hughes was given a straight red card, forcing the peninsula side to play the remainder of the game with  men.Cunning and Woods exchanged points before Ryan McGarry, Elliottand Molloy helped Dunloy storm into a - to - lead midway through the second half.A point from Liam Savage slowed Dunloy up for a while, but they quickly regained the initiative and points from Elliott, Eamon Smyth, Cunning and McKeague had the Cuchullains - to - ahead with six minutes remaining.Woods scored a late point for Ballycran, but it was quickly cancelled out by points from Molloy and McKeague and a goal at the death from Anton McGrath to put the game to bed.Ballycran: Stephen Keith, Michael Hughes, Sean Ennis, Gerard Hughes, Brett Nicholson, Padraig Flynn, Patrick Hughes, Liam Savage , Phelim Savage, Scott Nicholson, Conor Woods , Michael Ennis, Stuart Martin, Colum McManus, Chris Egan.

We are being terrorised in our homes and our property is being damaged.Mrs Smyth said it was almost impossible to report incidents to the police.ldquoIf we can get through the police often donrsquot respond, she continued. ldquoThese temporary gates have been being put up for almost two years now. Torn down and put up again. Itrsquos the residents who suffer, not the council people for delays in signing off on the workthat needs to be done.The residents are being supported by local Independent councillor Cadogan Enright, who accused the council of being ldquonot exactly on top of their game.He said: ldquoThe need for fences and gates to make the area into a cul-de-sacs was triggered by an emergency situation where pensioners were and still are under siege by a small number of nersquoer-do-wells, culminating with the actual burning down of a pensionerrsquos cottage.ldquoThe council have not been treating this as an emergency. Were it not for the Housing Executive repeatedly replacing the eight temporary steel and wood barriers week after week when they are torn down, the area would be unviable as an area where pensioners can live.He added: ldquoI have proposed a workshop between the social partners led by the PSNI, Housing Executive, council and other partners to agree in detail a step-by-step process for gating orders in writing so that we never again have such a series of dreadful delays.A spokesman for the council said last night: Newry, Mourne and Down District Council can advise that the Northern Ireland Housing Executive has applied to the council for gating orders in the Model Farm area and that the Council is currently following gating order guidance produced by the Department of the Environment.ldquoThis process requires consultation with the Department for Infrastructure and members of the public in the area. A public advertisement of the proposals is then required. It is expected that this process will be complete in December .ldquoThe Policing and Community Safety Partnershiphas increased the number of Community Safety Warden patrols in this area over the last few weeks as a deterrent to reports of anti-social behaviour.ldquoThe PCSP will continue to work in partnership with the PSNI to ensure that warden patrols are appropriately deployed across the Newry, Mourne and Down District Council area where reports of anti-social behaviour have been received..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/30th October 2019 Fond.jpg","title":"Fond farewell to council chief  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council have bade farewell to their retiring chief executive, Mr Liam Hannaway.The celebratory event, which was hosted by council chairman Charlie Casey took place last Tuesday at Killeavy Castle, near Newry.Paying tribute on the evening, Cllr Casey reflected on Mr Hannawayrsquos many years in public service and his dedication to Newry, Mourne and Down Council.He said: ldquoLiam has spent  years in public service.

We will eventually cover all old estates, subject to continuing funds and satisfactory contracts.Movements have already been made with the awarding of a number of pre-paint repair contracts and work on all contracts should begin by March or April next year.More programmes of maintenance work are being prepared and will be starting in the - financial year, subject to the approval of the Executiversquos Board.CASTLEWELLAN mdash Uncertainty has surrounded the recent proposals to establish units for educationally sub-normal pupils at Castlewellan.The South Eastern Education and Library Board give approval in January for two new units to be set up at the local controlled primary school.However, plans were revised when the neighbouring school, St Malachyrsquos Primary, decided it wanted to have special ESN units.Board officers decided thatan ESN unit is established at St Malachyrsquos the demand for ESN facilities at Castlewellan Primary mightand therefore only one unit might be necessary at each school.But confusion arose when the Board placed advertisements in a local newspaper about the plans to establish the units.Castlewellan councillor, Mrs Ethel Smyth, a Board member, was unsure about whether or not the Board had changed its policy and was intended to establish the units at St Malachyrsquos instead of at the controlled school.Mrs Smyth, who has raised the matter on several occasions, told Board members, this week that she was aggrieved about the whole affair and thought that Board officers had acted in a ldquovery surreptitious manner.ldquoThis sort of thing raises suspicions in the community and itrsquos just not good enough,: said Mrs Smyth.However, she was assured by Board chairman, Mr Cecil Kirkwood, that Board officers had not acted in an underhand manner and that there had only been a misunderstanding.KILLYLEAGH mdash A Killyleagh priest had called this week for people to follow the example of friendship shown by more than  Protestants and Roman Catholics who joined together in a special Halloween dinner and concert organised by his church.He is Fr Hugh OrsquoHagan and he was speaking hours after  senior citizens had enjoyed a dinner and concert in St Maryrsquos Hall, organised by the hall management committee.Speaking afterwards Fr OrsquoHagan said that Killyleagh and Shrigley had a unique community, ldquo everywhere has like here, Northern Ireland would be a more peaceful place.Invitations to Thursdayrsquos dinner and concert went out to both sides of the community and Fr OrsquoHagan stressed that he hoped no senior citizen had been forgotten, either Protestant or Roman Catholic.The idea of the dinner mdash which was such a success last year, when he was held for the first time mdash has been widely praised in the town, especially by the senior citizens and Thursday nightrsquos was no exception, with many voting it a big hit.Before the dinner began, Fr OrsquoHagan mdash who has been priest in Killyleagh for over  years and who is the longest serving priest ever in the town mdash welcomed everyone and thanked them for coming.He welcomed especially, the three ministers in the town, the Rev J C Boggs, Rev J D Mark and Rev R E Conn. Also Lady Pym who was representing the local senior citizensrsquo Friendship Club.BALLYGALGET mdash A request from the school management committee of St Patrickrsquos Primary School at Ballygalget to provide transport for  pupils has been turned down by the local Education Board.The school management committee had explained to the Board that the  infants end their school day officially at .pm, but there is no transport to take them home until .pm.The school committee requested action because there was no teacher available to supervise the infants who had to remain in the school building.The transport officer of the Board, Mr Milligan, stressed that seven of the children were below compulsory school attendance age and as such were not eligible for school transport.Outlining the background to transport facilities provided at the school, Mr Milligan pointed out that an Ulsterbus had carried the children to and from the school for over  years.It had not generally been the practice of the Board to provide buses to take the children home before the end of the normal school day and there were no Board vehicles free to provide transport.Despite a y debate, the Boardrsquos Educational Services Committee said they could not suggest a solution to the problem.DOWNPATRICK mdash Downpatrick priest Dr Joseph Maguire has been re-elected chairman of the finance committee of the South Eastern Education and Library Board.Dr Maguire told members of the committee that he considered it an hour to be re-elected and he promised to serve the interests of the committee and the Board in every way that he could.COMBER mdash Proposals by Comber traders to prevent moves which they say could threaten their businesses, may well be turned down.The threat is in the shape of the Department of Environment who have announced that they intend introducing parking restrictions in the main shopping areas of the town.The confrontation between the Department and Comber Traders Association has been long running, but on Thursday it seemed that a solution could be found.The Traders Association had an on-the-spot meeting on Thursday morning with a representative from the Roads Division, who listened to the tradersrsquo complaints and suggestions for the siting of the yellow lines in the town. Also present was a representative from the RUC traffic branch.However, there are fears that the tradersrsquo suggestions will be dismissed and the Department will push ahead with their proposals to restrict parking in Comber.The Traders Association feel that the proposals are a very real threat to their livelihood and are inconvenient mdash a view shared by many residents in the town who have backed the Association in their fight with the Department..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/30th October 2019 Greenkeeper.jpg","title":"Greenkeeper gets revenge at sunny Spa  ","story":"SPA golfers faced a novel end-of-season challenge on Saturday when head groundsman Lee Cartmill set up the -hole course for his Greenkeeperrsquos Revenge competition.It was essentially a fun event which attracted a large number of both ladies and gents and proved to be so popular it is likely to feature again on the Spa calendar.But the devilishly dficult pin placings did not deter Alan Carson who topped the leaderboard with a magnicent score of  points while Catherine McEvoy won the ladies -hole competition with  points.Spa PGA professional Gary Wardlow warned competitors that the pins were in ldquorather unusual positions but after a number of impressive scores were ed he reckoned it had not been sufficiently challenging.Stuart Alexander had his best start for many months with eight straight pars followed by a birdie at the par four th, but unfortunately his great run did not continue.At least two other competitors mdash Sam Boyd and William McAnally mdash also had birdies at the th where the pin was placed in the left-hand green side bunker.Menrsquos results: st Alan Carson , nd George Wilson , rd Chris Chittick , th Stephen Adams , th Brian Graham .Ladiesrsquo results: st Catherine McEvoy , nd Vivienne Abernethy , rd Carol Shields ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/30th October 2019 Hat-trick.jpg","title":"Hat trick of titles  ","story":"IT was a case of trebles all round recently for a highly-talented teenager from Kilmore.Eighteen year-old Conor Mullan, a son of well-known Crossgar garage owner James Mullan, was in seventh heaven after adding the Ulstermotocross semi-expert title to the Irish and Ulster Youth crowns won earlier in the the year.Conor blazed his way to victory in all three competitions and crowned a sensational year at Desertmartin last week when he clinched the Ulster title, despite riding with a few niggling injuries, including a troublesome shoulder.To clinch Ulster and Irish titles in the same year is some achievement and Conor has done it in style.The Year  pupil at St Patrickrsquos Grammar School, Downpatrick, now has his focus on sitting his A-Levels next year ldquoI am in Upper Sixth at the minute, taking A-Levels in geography, technology and business studies, he said.ldquoNext year the plan is to go to university, where Irsquod like to study business, or economics.

Together, we want to deliver inclusive, transformative regional regeneration, strengthen our economy and boost our prosperity.Ambitious plans to revolutionise tourist facilities in Newcastle are part of the City Deal proposals and are making signicant progress.Ground condition survey work is taking place in the resort at the base of the Mournes where a new a gondola ride into the heart of the mountains would be based, with the local council confirming that it is planning to appoint a dedicated team to deliver an outline business case designed to pave the way to secure funding to help build the project.An economist is also to be appointed to help with the delivery of the business case which is expected to be completed in early spring or summer.The Gateway proposal is one of the key projects included in the local councilrsquos bid for a share of poundbn investment package under the Belfast City Regional Deal.The world class tourist attraction proposals include the gondola ride into the heart of the Mournes and an ultra-modern visitor centre at the site of the old quarry at Thomasrsquo Mountain with the proposals expected to be delivered with the help of a range of funding partners to signicantly increase the number of visitors to the resort.Other proposals include an Alpine coaster ride enabling people to hurtle down the side of the mountain on a single track in a buggy.Newry, Mourne and Down is hoping to secure poundm from the Northern Ireland Executive and is committing poundm of ratepayersrsquo money to fund the proposed gondola ride and visitor centre.Council officials are also working alongside Tourism NI to secure financial backing for other aspects of the tourism investment and support to move the ious projects through a series of key

that a le-extending drug will be made available free for their young son who has cystic fibrosis.Jen Banks and her husband Dermot were told yesterday by the Department of Health that Northern Ireland would follow the lead by NHS England and make Cystic Fibrosisdrugs Orkbambi, Symkevi and Kalydeco available to eligible patients.It is hoped that their two year-old son, Lorcaacuten, and other CF sufferers will be offered the drugs within weeks.The initial cost of a yearrsquos supply of the drug was estimated at pound, per patient.Last night Jen told the Recorder that she and her husband were ldquoecstatic but the news still has sunk in after they were called to a meeting with Permanent Health Secretary Richard Pengelly at Stormont.The surprise announcement came as the couple were preparing to import the generic drug from South America as part of a CF Buyers Club of families.In a desperate attempt to start their son on the drug as quickly as possible, the couple and their family fundraised around pound, to buy Lorcaacuten three months treatment.ldquoWe were so close to getting the generic drug ourselves and that would have been great as Lorcaacuten would have started on it, but we would have still been campaigning and pushing for it, said Jen.ldquoWe have been told that the Department of Health want to copy what NHS England did and get the drug into peoplersquos hands within  days, starting rightly so, with those most in need.The mother of two admitted that living with Lorcaacutenrsquos condition and knowing that there was a drug that could dramatically improve his quality of le was ldquoabsolutely horrendous.ldquoIn many ways we feel that Lorcaacutenrsquos infancy has been stolen from us, Jen said of her first child who was diagnosed at  days old.ldquoThe torture wasnrsquot that he had CF, it was that there was something that could help him but there was a company out there that was pricing the drug so highly, it was unobtainable.Jen believes that Lorcaacuten will be on the drug before Christmas and recognises this as a gt of le.ldquoItrsquos not that this is just a good Christmas present but that we have actually been given extra Christmases with our son, said Jen.ldquoOne of the models for the drugs suggest thatyou start it at age six, you can have an extra  years on top of the normal le expectancy for a CF sufferer. ldquoItrsquos like we have been given  Christmases with Lorcaacuten, that it what it really means to us.Lorcaacuten currently needs two sessions of physio each day and uses a nebuliser five times a day along with  tables to absorb fat from his food.He has been fighting off the pseudomonas infection since last Christmas.Jen said: ldquoHopefully, by taking the drugs, it will mean that will be the end of the infection and he wonrsquot get other infections.ldquoIt gives us even more time to keep him healthy until the better drugs come along.The  year-old has been one of the most vocerous campaigners to have the drug make available in Northern Ireland.She and her husband planned over the summer to move to Louth as the drug is free to patients in the Republic of Ireland but the sale fell through.The mother of two also vowed this week ldquochain herself to the railings at Stormontthe Department of Health did bring the drugs to Northern Ireland.Jen also praised the Recorder for its ldquocontinued and compassionate support of her familyrsquos storyldquoAll of the coverage made us feel that people really cared and we canrsquot thank the paper enough for its support, added

true for singer Mark McMullan, who has just landed himself the lead role in a major touring production of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat.Mark will follow in the footsteps of Jason Donovan and Philip Schofield who played Joseph when he takes to the stage in Doncaster for a five-month tour from December .The role is Markrsquos first major performance in a national stage musical and will feature classic songs such as Any Dream Will Do and Close Every Door To Me.Such success has been long on the cards for the Crossgar man who distinguished himself as one of the upcoming stars in local musicals with the St Patrickrsquos Choral Society in Downpatrick.Mark has been a constant help and support to his older brother, Declan, and parents John and Brenda after Declan suffered a cardiac arrest at the age of . Declan has lived with locked-in syndrome ever since.A video of Mark singing Take Him Home from the musical Les Miserables to Declan went viral in , landing him a spot on The Nolan Show.The emotional rendition of the song, which touches Declan and his parents every time they hear it, and the simple story of the brothersrsquo love and devotion, led to further performances for Mark on RTE.However, it wasnrsquot until this June that he won hearts as the runner-up in Britainrsquos Got Talent.His performance wowed judge Simon Cowell who told him it was the best performance of the series.Despite losing out to  year-old Cha Pensioner Colin Thackery, Markrsquos showcase on the hit show led to musical producers noticing his talent and superb voice.The McMullan family managed to keep the exciting news quiet until last week.Father John explained: ldquoMark was approached by the producer several months ago but we couldnrsquot really say anything. Declan, of course, wanted to tell the world but we didnrsquot want to say until Mark knew for definite it was  per cent.ldquoWe are hoping to travel over for his first show as this will be a great stepping stone for him.While the opportunity may have alluded the talented  year-old until now, Mark said he is ready for the challenge.ldquoIrsquom not nervous about performing as Irsquom definitely ready for this but Irsquom a bit nervous about the other performers who have played the role and feel an obligation to be good and do everyone proud.Mark has already appeared in a youth production of Joseph as the Pharaoh, having performed with St Patrickrsquos Choral Society from the age of  to .He said that while he grew up in a musical family, it was his grandfather, Seamus Mullan, and mother, Brenda, who really encouraged him.ldquoI knew I could sing from an early age as Irsquom from a musical family, said Mark. ldquoBut it wasnrsquot really until I joined the choral society and sang publicly for the first time a few months later in Calamity Jane that people began to tell me I was really good.ldquoPeople told me that I could make a career of singing and it began to occur to me that maybe I could do this.ldquoMy granda was a member of St Patrickrsquos Choral Society and sang in the choir of Mary Mother of the Church in Saintfield. The choral society gave me a taste for musical theatre and my mum really pushed me to do it. It turned out that I just loved it, added the former pupil of St Colmcillersquos High School in Crossgar and Down High School, Downpatrick.Mark performed in every musical staged by the society until his final appearance in Sunset Bouled, with music from Andrew Lloyd Webber, at the Grand Opera House in .ldquoThat role was the hardest one I had ever done, as while I have had plenty of leading roles, it was one that had me on stage in a major theatre and for nearly every scene, just as I will have to do the same in Joseph, said Mark.While Declanrsquos illness undoubtedly shook the McMullan family to its core, Mark said that he believes some good has come out of it.ldquoBefore Declan took sick in , my dream was always to go and live and work in London and do musical theatre. Unfortunately when that happened I had to put that dream on hold.ldquoI never thought I would look at it again as I knew I had to help Declan and my family, but unwittingly, the bad thing that happened to Declan has actually helped me pursue that dream even more.ldquoHe is my biggest supporter, hersquos like my manager. I speak every night to my Mum and him and he wants to know everything.Mark will continue with his job as architect while living in Newcastle-upon-Tyne with his partner, Zoe Hunter, who he met while they were students at Down High, until he feels confident that a secure future lies ahead of him in musical theatre.ldquoIrsquom also doing a Masters degree in architecture so between work, studying and rehearsal, le is very busy at the moment, he added.Bill Kenwrightrsquos production of Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webberrsquos musical will play in Doncaster from December  to January  before continuing its UK tour in Peterborough, Aylesbury, Wimbledon, Coventry, Bradford, Chesterfield and Sunderland..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/30th October 2019 Meeting.jpg","title":"Meeting on bypass plans  ","story":"ROADS issues topped the agenda during a meeting in Downpatrick last week including progress on the multi-million pound Ballynahinch bypass scheme.South Down MP Chris Hazzard led a Sinn Fein delegation which met with senior Department of Infrastructure officials at Rathkeltair House.The MP was joined by South Down MLAs Emma Rogan and Sinead Ennis and councillors Oonagh Hanlon, Cathy Mason and Willie Clarke.Mr Hazzard said roads officials provided the delegation with a detailed overview of the local situation, including the impact of successive government austerity budgets on the departmentrsquos ability to maintain the network, invest in much-needed new public transport infrastructure and deliver the appropriate winter service in the months ahead.The MP said that despite the dficult operational environment, it was pleasing to hear that the roads department is continuing to deliver much-needed improvements, including progressing with the final legal stages of the Ballynahinch bypass.It was also confirmed that work is continuing on congestion alleviation schemes in Downpatrick and much-needed road safety enhancements in Mayobridge.ldquoWe also discussed the imminent public inquiry of the vitally important A junctions scheme, perhaps the highest priority local roads scheme given the huge road safety advantages that scheme is likely to deliver and the Newry southern relief road, said the MP.ldquoI was also pleased to hear roads officials speak passionately about delivering a number of park and ride facilities that will help meet the growing demand for modern, fit-for-purpose public transport options in the local area..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/30th October 2019 Niall.jpg","title":"Niall backs start up loans plan  ","story":"THE founder of a Castlewellan business which makes an intelligent outdoor storage solution has been chosen to champion UK start-ups by the government-backed Start-Up Loans programme.Niall Greenan from The Smart Bunker was one of  business founders honoured at a reception at Westminster last week to celebrate some of the UKrsquos most successful small businesses.The Smart Bunker is an easy-to-use dispensing system which releases coal with a simple pull of a lever to fill the bucket to the required amount that can be carried.Mr Greenan , came up with the idea when he realised how dficult it was for his mother, who has arthritis, to fill a coal bucket from her traditional coal bin.He used a pound, Start-Up Loan to develop the device, which has gone on to win several awards.Mr Greenan has also expanded The Smart Bunker to include safe storage of wood pellets, ice treatment and animal feed.The product has attracted attention for its sustainability credentials, providing a good alternative to the plastic bags usually usedfor agricultural storage.

The South Antrim MLA bluntly and emphatically replied: “No. We’re not standing aside. We’re going to fight all  constituencies.”Askedhe would regret his decision to run  candidatesit was to cost someone like Nigel Dodds his seat, Mr Aiken said: “Nigel Dodds and the DUP made it very clear, time and time again, that they don’t need Ulster Unionist support and we didn’t put a border down the Irish Sea Nigel Dodds needs to answer that question.”He went on to set out his reasoning for such a stance, arguing that the DUP had undermined the Union both through its involvement in ious scandals and its handling of Brexit, and said that the UUP would offer an alternative of either a very soft Brexit or cancelling Brexit entirely, which he said would not be as damaging to the Union.However, by yesterday Mr Aiken outlined a policy diametrically opposed to that which he had initially said he believed in.In a statement, he referred to what he said was the DUP’s responsibility for the Brexit “debacle” which “cannot be whitewashed away”.Denouncing the party for which he is urging north Belfast unionists to vote, he went on: “It was their acceptance of a regulatory border in the Irish Sea on October , vigorously opposed by the Ulster Unionist Party, which opened the floodgates for Boris Johnson and his dreadful deal.Naomi Long to stand again in East Belfast at general election Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“The Union itself is now in a precarious position not in spite of the DUP’s stance but because of the DUP’s actions.”Mr Aiken said that he had been in discussions with “senior political and community figures across north Belfast” and had “listened respectfully to all views expressed, including deeply held concerns that they will be unrepresented in Westminster in the critical months ahead”.He went on: “This has been done in the context of threats and intimidation against UUP staff and members. In a modern democracy no-one should have to face threats, intimidation or coercion of any sort because of their involvement in the democratic process.“It is appalling and totally reprehensible and should have no place in Northern Ireland in the st century.”He said it was “absolutely vital that MPs are ed who will take their seats and be able to influence the future direction of our nation” and “therefore we have decided not to nominate a candidate in North Belfast in the forthcoming election.“The DUP recognise that they cannot win North Belfast on their own, despite having dismissed the opinions of other unionists in the past. They cannot expect to continue on that basis and must now realise they need Ulster Unionist voices at Westminster.“The choice in North Belfast is between Nigel Dodds as MP or an abstentionist MP who refuses to stand in Westminster to talk about health, education, justice, international affairs, or the future direction of the United Kingdom.“In the face of Boris Johnson’s terrible deal which forces Northern Ireland towards the edge of the Union, we cannot gt a seat to Sinn Fein who support this direction either in North Belfast or Fermanagh and South Tyrone.“It is better to elect Nigel Dodds in North Belfast and hold him to account for his promises on the Union than facilitate the election of an abstentionist Sinn Fein MP who still cannot condemn IRA violence.”On Saturday, DUP leader Arlene Foster announced that the DUP would not stand against Tom Elliott in Fermanagh-South Tyrone, saying that voters “deserve to be represented in the House of Commons rather than an absentee MP standing on the sidelines”.Howver, Mr Elliott told the Press Association that he was not prepared to confirmhe plans to run as a candidate ahead of a selection meeting on Thursday.DUP leader Arlene Foster – who Steve Aiken has derided as “two borders Foster” – was quick to endorse the UUP decision.The former first minister said: “We welcome the fact that the Ulster Unionists have reached this decision.“They know that they cannot win in North Belfast and that first class representation is already provided by Nigel Dodds. I have a strong sense that unionism across Northern Ireland wants to see unionist parties working together for the Union.”Alliance, which over recent years has continued to stand candidates inareas where it faced physical attacks, including a constituency office which was torched, said that “paramilitaries cannot be allowed to win”.The party’s North Belfast candidate, Nuala McAllister, said: “This backtracking by Steve Aiken is not only him caving in but also effectively bowing the knee to the DUP before he has even taken the reins of the UUP. He made a big play about running candidates in every constituency but has now lost any credibility he had.”Sinn Fein’s North Belfast candidate, John Finucane, has appealed to unionists opposed to Brexit to vote for him, saying that unionists who oppose leaving the EU “are not represented by Nigel Dodds, one of the chief architects of the Tory Brexit”. He said: “With the UUP withdrawing from this contest under pressure from loyalist paramilitaries, there is now no unionist candidate representing those who voted to remain in Europe.”The TUV had called for unionist unity in seats where Sinn Fein could otherwise benefit, saying that it would be “folly to gt seats to Sinn Fein” and that “any party that sets such a course is not serving the Union”. The PUP leader Billy Hutchinson had also called for a single unionist candidate.Just hours before Mr Aiken reversed his policy, former UUP leader Mike Nesbitt had warned that it would be “nothing short of hypocrisy” for his party to sign up to an electoral pact with the DUP.Speaking on Newstalk Breakfast, the Strangford MLA said that the election was a chance for unionists to voice anger at the DUP’s behaviour.He said: “Since the last election, the DUP have been embroiled in a sort of alphabet soup of scandals – both corporately with the likes of RHI and inidually with Ian Paisley Jr.“And also their stance on Brexit, I think, is an existential threat to the future of the United Kingdom.“So it is very dficult to be making those sort of criticisms of a party and then to go into the ballot box on the th of December coming and give them one of their preferences. That is nothing short in my analysis of hypocrisy.”He said the pressure coming from the DUP was “frankly undemocratic”.He added: “I mean, they are criticising us for saying we want to run candidates in a political election. If it is a democracy, we are entitled to run in all  constituencies.”try catch  TrendingCounsellors brought into NI school to help pupils after teen killed and four others hospitalised in horror crashMother tells of agony after sons body found -

Children seem genuinely excited to learn, smiling, waving and saying hello to Mr Rees.Evenlode Primary School itself has an interesting history.It was opened in  as the first open plan primary school in South East Wales.The population of the school has risen dramatically over the last  years, from  on roll in  to the present .The building itself, a maze of classrooms and corridors plastered in colours, has also changed to accommodate more pupils.Much of the semi-open plan design has disappeared, making way for more conventional classrooms.The school benefits from having a superb site with two playgrounds as well as a large playing field, a designated play area for Reception children, a wildle area, open access to the local tennis club facilities, a newly constructed lsquooutside classroomrsquo and adventure trail.One of the first stops was a hall used by its lsquoSaplingsrsquo Out of School Care, the pre and after-school club for children.Saplings provides childcare for around  children from all year groups, providing breakfast in the morning and looking after children from .am to pm when needed.There, the children can access a wide range of activities, switched up on a regular basis.These have included cooking, gardening, art, crafts, sporting activities, outdoor play and plenty more.A couple of pupils, part of the Saplings, are called through. They happily talk about their favourite part of the clubs. One says arts and crafts another, going outside and playing sport four more say the food.Saplings isnrsquot the only place the students can indulge in a little food.Pupils have set up a fruit tuck shop in the school yard, a group endeavour that students control all aspects of - from placing orders for snacks, selecting the products, handling finances and, of course, selling to their friends.A small group of budding merchants were excited to show me their wares, selling oranges and bananas at break time.There was plenty more to do outside, as well.Mr Rees himself taught fire-making lessons in their fire pit, while the school also made use of rope courses, and a newly refurbished gazebo.Bike racks could be found at the front and back of the site, with students encouraged to cycle to school.Sport is very high on the schoolrsquos agenda.ldquoWe have kids from the school representing us in cricket, rugby and tennis at a county level, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore also fielding regular football, rugby and netball teams, and we are pushing plenty of other outdoor activities - like our new ropes and outdoor assault course.ldquoWersquore lucky to have parents in this area who are incredibly supportive of sports, and we have some shining examples of sporting prowess in our children.ldquoWe think itrsquos a very important part of being a rounded and healthy inidual.The school doesnrsquot just focus on sport - they aim to nurture minds and souls too.ldquoExpressive arts is a major area of focus at the moment, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore lucky enough to have a drama specialist supporting us, helping coach the children through both acting and production.ldquoWe are even working with the Welsh Government on a production of H.G. Wellrsquos The Time Machine, to be held in our school hall.The hall had been built with money raised from selling off surplus land, with a further loan from the Vale council.It is tidy, modern, and neatly decorated, with a sophisticated looking lighting system - built with help from parents.ldquoWersquore very proud of the relationship we have with parents here, said Mr Rees. ldquoThey have been enormously helpful with our budgetary concerns.Evenlode is a school with a cheerful outlook, a happy student body and a strong working relationship between staff, students and parent alike.It deserves to go far. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This must be investigated.ldquoThis is a deliberate attempt to present a  equivalence between genuine political canvassing and those who would wish to scam vulnerable people.ldquoMany people will be deeply unsettled by this behaviour from Cairns at the same time as the Tories are attempting to suppress votes by making it a requirement to show ID at polling stations- a move that will disproportionately affect working class, ethnic minority and young voters.ldquoThis is not how politics should be done.

However he is recognised as one of the greatest ever British rugby league players.Elizabeth lsquoBettyrsquo Campbell, also born in  in Butetown, was the first black head teacher in Wales.Following a public vote on hidden heroines Cardf Council confirmed earlier this year that a statue of Betty will be built in Cardf - the first woman to feature in our capital city.On the weekend I will be on a question and answer  about institutionalised racism in Wales, across sport, the media, politics, and the world of work.I look forward to sitting on the  with Cllr Saeed Ebrahim, lawyer Hilary Brown, and Chisomo Phiri from EYST.As more and more Black History Month events take place across Wales, I cannot help but feel a sense of pride in how far we have come as a nation.I hope that these events continue to inspire the next generation of young black leaders as we still have so much more to change.To all my constituents, to everyone across Wales, I hope you all join in with the celebrations and festivities of this historic month, attend the events, learn about those that have trailblazed for us and make this a Black History Month to remember. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It would require the removal of seven of the  ancient trees in the Conservation Area.Many of the trees had been assessed in September  as deserving of a Tree Protection Order, which would prevent them from being cut down, though the Vale council has said they are in the process of securing the protection orders.Residents say one ndash Ash Tree , crucial to development ndash has already been removed. John Lean, a resident of Kymin Terrace, said: ldquoAround a week ago, the first ash tree was sawn down. It was painted as a routine tidying up of their grounds, that it was sick, and was carried out not by the architects who made the main application, but by the warden. We do not believe there was anything wrong with that tree.ldquoAn application was made under Section  of the Planning Acts for the removal of Ash Tree , another tree not in the wood but next to the house, and the removal of a fallen tree. No notice was given to local residents the Vale council did not inspect the site before permission was given, and the first we knew of it was when we heard the chainsaws.Ash Tree  would have to be removed for any development to take place, to allow construction traffic to pass.David Burnett, a resident, said: ldquoThis creates a dangerous precedent for further development here.ldquoWhen the construction of Homeside House was permitted on appeal in , the inspector at the time made it clear that it should not impinge on the woodland. The woodland was described as lsquoinviolatersquo ndash itrsquos at least  years old. What was true then is true now. Other residents had further complaints about the proposed development, and the methodology used to carry out inspections.The large footprint of the dwelling occupies over half the site. The access road would also have to be able to take construction traffic, which residents fear would further damage the site and could limit parking.One resident described a bat survey as lsquocompletely inadequatersquo, as the resident said the survey carried out on behalf of the applicant noted observation was made on two occasions only.William and Karen Stonehouse said: ldquoThe development would involve the destruction of a valuable natural habitat without any benefit to the community whatsoever.ldquoPenarth is not short of expensive properties. It is affordable housing that is desperately needed to prevent the continuing drain of its young people who can no longer afford to buy any property here.ldquoThis proposal does nothing to address that.Joanna Masters said: ldquoI am very concerned about the proposed plan to fell the wood.ldquoI thought the world was becoming more environmentally aware, particularly regarding the value of trees, but it seems the Vale council is, in its own way, as irresponsible as Brazilrsquos Bolsonaro.A spokesman for the Vale council said: ldquoThis planning application has yet to be determined and will be considered in exactly the same way as any other, with the views of all interested parties taken into account.ldquoThat will involve reviewing all letters of representation and consultation responses on the matter. IldquoIt has been resubmitted after a previous one for a similar development was withdrawn as it failed to provide full details of the impact on nearby trees.ldquoWe are in the process of arranging Tree Preservation Orders for trees there that meet the criteria for that protection.ldquoThe council did approve an application to fell an ash tree from Homeside House as, after inspection by an officer, it was deemed to have a fungal bracket, which can structurally weaken trees to the point of breakage. That being the case, it was decided a TPO was not appropriate.The freehold for the woodland was purchased by Proxima GR Properties in  from McCarthy  Stone, who had built an unsheltered accommodation around the site.The Penarth Times has attempted to reach Proxima GR Properties for a comment. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Their sole motive has been about blocking Brexit.I have long thought the only way out of this is a general election.The British people need to be given the opportunity to have a clear out of those politicians who said one thing to get elected and have done another in office.All Labour and Conservative MPs were elected on manestos explicitly promising to respect and honour the referendum result.The people of Penarth deserve better than this.Earlier this month, I was present on the steps of the Senedd as the petition to save the Sam Davies ward at Barry Hospital was presented to the Assembly.I joined other local representatives and campaigners from Unison to receive the petition, and send a clear message on the health boardrsquos proposals.Under the plans, the -bed older persons rehabilitation ward will close, with services transferring either to the community or Llandough Hospital.Local opinion in Barry is quite clear that the ward should stay, while in Llandough, further expansion of the hospital will cause further pressures on the village.You wonrsquot often catch me standing alongside Unison, but on this we completely agree.These plans need to be dropped.The Royal British Legion have officially launched the  Poppy Appeal, and as ever, I am delighted to pledge my support.It is crucial we commemorate those who made the ultimate sacrice to defend our freedoms, including those from Penarth.Wearing a poppy is an understated yet clear way of demonstrating that, and it also raises vital funds to support current and former servicemen and women and their families.It is often misunderstood as condoning or celebrating war, and that could not be further from the truth. It is respecting those who have fallen.Irsquod like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the Royal British Legion for their work. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But she was so happy - she said it was the perfect place as it was the start of so many good memories, and that she never anticipated it would happen in Stanwell.ldquoMy first thought when she said yes... I was just ecstatic. The idea for the proposal had been brewing for a while in the background, and both our families were in on it.ldquoShe was under the impression she was going shopping with her mum and I was going golfing with my dad that day.ldquoBy the time she got to the entrance of Stanwell she started to guess what was going on.ldquoI had a load of foil balloons with photos of us printed on them - the first from when we were really young, just after we met, and they were arranged towards the classroom in chronological order, so the last was from our recent holiday in Tunisia.ldquoThere were also some ldquowill you marry me balloons in the classroom, which may have given it away.The couple are currently living in Southampton.Mr Ware is a project engineer for subsea cables and renewable energies, while Miss Bushby is a trainee solicitor, qualying next March.ldquoWe have a few plans going forwards, said Mr Ware. ldquoWersquove just found a venue for the wedding next year, and wersquove vaguely picked a date, but wersquore not telling anybody just yet.ldquoWersquore also planning on ing to live in Penarth after the marriage.The school were excited to get in on the romantic story.ldquoWhen I asked they were really keen to get involved, said Mr Ware. ldquoThey said it was the first proposal in Stanwell.ldquoIrsquom just happy Jemima was fine with going to school on a Saturday. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals.

The Top  Northern Ireland Companies  dinner, with AL Goodbody, brought together some of top business chiefs making the list, to the grand backdrop of Queen’s University’s Great Hall. The event heard renewed calls for securing a deal on Brexit, and the restoration of Stormont, as we approach , days without a devolved government here. John Mulgrew, editor of Ulster Business, told those gathered: “On the precipice of Brexit, the voice of business has never been stronger or more important – further enforcing the need for a deal. Avoiding a hard exit. And retaining a strong trading relationship across the island. “But we should also take this opportunity to clearly note, that we are approaching , days since having a devolved government – up and running. “It affects you and your businesses, and it’s cited as the key reason putting off investment from overseas, and our own local companies, from making key investment decisions.” The Top  edition is an annual showcase of the leading and largest companies, located right across Northern Ireland. This year sales rose by almost %, approaching a combined figure of £bn. And for the eighth year in a row, poultry processing giant Moy Park has come in at the number one spot, with turnover of £.bn. Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said: “What the Top  companies have achieved in the past  months in what can only be described as capricious circumstances is truly remarkable – but imagine what could have been achieved had we some semblance of ‘normality’. “My hope is that we find ourselves doing so in a Northern Ireland that is embarking on a new and positive era of opportunity, rather than picking up the shattered pieces of a ‘no deal’ Brexit for many years to come.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"firms must prepare for no deal as economic forecast revised down","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland firms must prepare for a ‘no deal’ Brexit – a bank chief economist has warned – as it downgraded its forecast for the economy to .%.  Danske Bank’s Conor Lambe said there were still a number of possibilities for what might happen over the next  days, with the UK due to leave the EU on October . Possibilities included a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of Article  period or a general election. But predictions were \"incredibly dficult\", he said. \"Businesses should behave prudently and use this time to ensure they are as prepared as they can be for a worst-case scenario, no-deal Brexit, in case it occurs at the end of this month,\" he said. The .% is down from the bank’s previous forecasts, delivered in June, that growth would hit % in  and .% in . In its latest Northern Ireland Quarterly Sectoral Forecasts report, Danske Bank said that the Northern Ireland economy likely expanded in the second quarter of the year, but the rate of growth over the first half of the year remained modest. “We have revised our forecast for economic growth in Northern Ireland downwards for both  and ,” he said. “This largely reflects the modest data for the first half of the year, increased Brexit-related uncertainty and the weaker global economic environment. “Assuming that a no-deal Brexit is avoided, we expect the Northern Ireland economy to grow by .% in  and .% in , below the .% we expect UK GDP to grow by in both years. “A combination of strong wage growth and more stable inflation is likely to lead to solid growth in consumer spending, but the lack of clarity around the UK’s future relationship with the EU is expected to continue holding back business investment.” It says the information and communication, and professional, scientic  technical services sectors are expected to be the fastest growing parts of the economy over the next two years. Meanwhile, output in the construction sector is forecast to rise by .% in  and .% in , while expected output growth in the wholesale and retail trade sector has been revised down to .% in  and .% in . Public administration and defence is continuing to have the weakest outlook of all the sectors of the Northern Ireland economy, with output expected to contract by .% in , and by a further .% in . “Over the coming weeks, a number of potential Brexit options are possible, including a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of the Article  period or a general election,” Mr Lambe said. “Predicting what will happen next in the Brexit process is incredibly dficult, but businesses should behave prudently and use this time to ensure they are as prepared as they can be for a worst-case scenario, no-deal Brexit, in case it occurs at the end of this month.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/BOI11_web.jpg","title":"bank of ireland uk empowering colleagues to support local communities","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by Ulster Business Paul Slevin, Alison Mitchell, Ian Sheppard, Sally Irvine, Christine Graham and Paul Magee With a purpose to enable customers, colleagues and communities to thrive, Bank of Ireland UK staff are building on a long history of supporting local charities and community organisations. Ulster Business speaks to Northern Ireland managing director Ian Sheppard, and learns more about how colleagues are being empowered to play an active role in the local communities where they live and work Bank of Ireland UK sees developing its colleagues and helping customers and communities to thrive as part of its DNA, according to Ian Sheppard, managing director in Northern Ireland.From key charity partnerships, to fundraising, volunteering, sponsorship and more, Ian says the desire for Bank of Ireland UK is to make a positive impact by empowering colleagues to make a dference.“When I speak to my colleagues, I hear how really active and involved they are in their own community,” Ian says. “There are so many examples and I never cease to be amazed by their passion and commitment.An important partnership for the bank is with Alzheimer’s Society, its flagship charity for the last two years. In that time around £, has been raised in Northern Ireland, but as Ian explains it’s about more than fundraising.“We realised that not only can we help them financially, but there are resources we can share and opportunities we can offer which can help to signicantly raise the charity’s profile and raise much needed funds.”One example in which the bank has supported Alzheimer’s Society in this way is through its own long-running partnership with Ulster Rugby.“We donated our advertising and promotion activity for a televised game at the Kingspan Stadium making the charity ‘Sponsor for a Day’. This included using their logo on the back of the Ulster Rugby jerseys, taking over the pitch side boards and inviting a group of people living with dementia, their family and carers to the game – helping to get their brand message out to not only a stadium with capacity of , people but to a much wider TV audience.”Alzheimer’s Society sees some fantastic people giving their time to help others. That’s no clearer than its Side by Side programme, which Bank of Ireland UK helps to fund.The photograph on the front of this edition of the magazine taken at the Grand Opera House in Belfast features Mary Dalzell a Side by Side volunteer, alongside Hazel Whiteside, who has been living with dementia for two years.They share a love of music, theatre and cinema and the Side by Side programme, which re-connects people with dementia to their communities by doing the things they love, has not only put a smile on both their faces but has had a positive impact on their lives.There are so many people impacted by dementia and Alzheimers in our local communities, and its touching so many people’s lives, taking this as our motivation, the bank now has almost , staff trained as Dementia Friends.The bank’s ‘Give Together’ programme means staff can take one day a year to spend the time working with a charity or community organisation of their choice. “This day can involve anything from gardening work to painting a youth centre,” Ian says“Beyond Alzheimer’s Society, colleagues are helping many other organisations such as Macmillan Cancer Support, Cancer Research UK through its Relay for Le Legenderry, the Wooden Spoon children’s rugby charity, and Space NI, which offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community.” You canabout some of the good work colleagues have done further on in this feature.“We are also committed to reflecting the community by developing a erse and modern workforce – which is part-and-parcel of a progressive company,” Ian says. “It’s something that current and future employees expect in their employer. For us its part of our DNA, something that’s always been there but we are now putting a clear and visible structure around it,” Ian says.This has included being a founding member of FuSIoN – the Financial Services Inclusion Network which drives to support and promote LGBT+ professionals across the sector, becoming JAM Card members – allowing staff to knowcustomers with a communication barrier need ‘just a minute’, as well as recently being awarded the Diversity Charter Mark.“Our community involvement is something we are very clear about - something I’m passionate about and it’s an easy ask to get staff engaged. It’s very natural, and it has always been developed from the ground up,” Ian says.He believes this contributes to the huge numbers of staff doing their bit – enabling their own local communities to thrive.  ALISON MITCHELLA customer service manager for Bank of Ireland UK in Londonderry, Alison has worked for the bank for  years, but her motivation for fundraising and support for Alzheimer’s Society began in , following her mother-in-law’s diagnosis with dementia. Alison trained at her local hospital to become a dementia volunteer and learned so much she asked Alzheimer’s Society to run similar sessions in her own branch to enable staff to better assist customers with dementia.Sadly, Alison’s mother-in-law passed away in May of this year but to mark her passing and to raise vital funds in her memory, Alison took part in Alzheimer’s Society Cupcake Day. Initial plans to simply sell cupcakes within her own branch changed rapidly as colleagues from nearby branches heard of the event and wanted to support both Alison and the charity.  Faced with orders for more than  cupcakes, Alison requested a Give Together day, which is time given by the bank to both iniduals and teams to give back to their communities. Alison says: “I was in the kitchen from am to pm baking and icing but it was worth it. The event raised £, which Bank of Ireland UK matched doubling the amount raised to £,. “I could not have achieved that without the support of family, colleagues and the wider business. I was proud to raise the funds in my mother-in-law’s memory and I am proud to work for an organisation that not only values our role in the wider community but supports it too.” CHRISTINE GRAHAMChristine Graham has helped to raise funds for Cancer Research UK through the Relay for Le “Legenderry” event held in St. Columb’s Park, Londonderry.The Derry-based senior business manager for Bank of Ireland UK has personally been touched by cancer as she lost two close family members to the disease. Her young great niece was also diagnosed with a rare form of cancer in  and is now doing well, but seeing the impact a cancer diagnosis has on a family inspired Christine to get involved with the Relay for Le event.“Our event truly is ‘legenderry’,” she says. It is a -hour relay race that brings the whole community together to celebrate the lives of cancer survivors, to remember those lost to the disease, to fight back by increasing our knowledge of cancer and by raising money to fund le-saving cancer research.”In just three years the event has raised over £, for Cancer Research UK with Christine helping to raise £, in  – not only the most successful Relay for Le event in the UK this year but all funds raised in Northern Ireland stays here.  Christine values the support she has had from the bank who promote the event to the wider community and from her colleagues who enter teams.“Relay for Le is for all ages and stages, all shapes and sizes,” she says. It’s cross community and intergenerational and the atmosphere every year is electric.”Plans are already underway for Relay for Le  which promises to be another massive event. PAUL MAGEEPaul Magee, associate director of the corporate banking team, became involved with the Ulster Region Committee for Wooden Spoon, the Children’s Charity of Rugby, five years ago after he successfully completed the charity’s Four Peaks Challenge, reaching the summits of the UK and Ireland’s highest peaks. He is now an active committee member for Wooden Spoon, helping to raise funds to provide le-enhancing experiences for disadvantaged and disabled children. “All funds raised in Ulster stay in the region and benefit the children here,” Paul says. “For instance, we provided £, to the Mae Murray Foundation to buy specialist equipment for the first fully accessible beach in Ulster at Benone Strand. When we created the access to the beach, one parent was very emotional as he watched his teenage daughter in the sea for the first time. It’s those occasions where we’re responding to a need within the community that makes the effort worthwhile.”Wooden Spoon has funded numerous charity projects, most recently £, for a new multi-sensory room at Parkview Special School in Lisburn and purchasing a horse for Riding for the Disabled Association in Coleraine, a charity that enhances children’s lives every day.  With his passion for and involvement in Wooden Spoon, Paul is grateful for the support Bank of Ireland has given him in his role with the organisation, specically the corporate banking team who value his dedication to making a dference. He says: “The bank has been fantastic – I appreciate the flexibility the team offers in the lead up to events and my colleagues often attend Wooden Spoon fundraisers. I’ve also benefited from the bank’s Give Together initiative, which offers days of paid leave that employees can use for volunteering. The bank’s support has helped facilitate my commitment to Wooden Spoon, where I can really see and be a part of the impact the charity has on the local community.” SALLY IRVINEOver the last  years Sally Irvine’s coffee mornings have become a highlight in the office calendar, in turn raising more than £, for MacMillan Cancer Support and funding  days of specialist nursing care for cancer patients across Northern Ireland.Sally, a business lending and credit governance manager at Bank of Ireland UK, arranged her first Macmillan Coffee Morning in  following a colleague’s cancer diagnosis. She found herself wanting to do something to help people living with cancer and so took the plunge and decided to be a host as part of Macmillan’s biggest coffee morning fundraising event. From the outset, Sally had tremendous support from her team members and the wider business, and this has contributed to the ongoing success of the event.The bank plays a huge part in ensuring Sally can deliver the event each year by giving her support through their Give Together scheme.Sally says: “The coffee morning has become a very special occasion and a great day of fun where people from across the bank come together to have a wee cuppa and a cake and take time to catch up while raising money for a really important cause. One in two of us will face cancer at some time in our lives and I am passionate about continuing to fundraise to provide the specialist nursing care that’s so vital for those living with cancer.”Plans are already underway for this year’s Macmillan Coffee Morning and Sally is hopeful the annual fundraiser will continue to hold a special place in the office calendar. PAUL SLEVINBranch manager at Bank of Ireland UK in Newry, Paul Slevin is someone who embodies the bank’s ethos of community involvement through his role with the charity Space NI.  Space NI offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community. Through its service Home to Hospital, the organisation has helped  elderly people travel to crucial hospital appointments, while its Family Support Hub offers vital assistance to families in distress. Paul joined the charity in  and has just completed five years as chairman of the Board of Directors. He is proud that his background in finance has enabled him to support the charity through its repositioning process to ensure that its activities best serve the community.  Since Paul’s involvement with the charity began, Space NI has won the ‘One to Watch’ award at NI Social Enterprise Awards and the ‘Community Wellbeing Initiative’ at the All Ireland Pride of Place Awards. The organisation has also grown and opened a third premises in Newry and launched a range of volunteer made soy wax candles to raise crucial funds. “Bank of Ireland UK encourage all staff to give back,” Paul says. “Every manager I’ve had was very active in their community, so they were both great role models and great motivators. I think it’s really important to give our time, our expertise, and to do whatever we can to help and support the communities we live and work in.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/12312323.jpg","title":"novosco sold to global services giant for m","story":"Posted on Monday  October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland IT services firm Novosco has been bought by a German-based global industry giant for around £m, it has emerged.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: \"We’ve got a great new deal that takes back control — now Parliament should get Brexit done on Saturday so we can move on to other priorities like the cost of living, the NHS, violent crime and our environment.\" Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, said: “This agreement is a fair compromise between the EU and the UK. It is testament to the commitment and willingness of both sides to do what is best for EU and UK citizens. We now have a newly agreed Protocol that protects peace and stability on the island of Ireland and fully protects our Single Market. I hope that we can now bring this over the line and provide the certainty our citizens and businesses so deserve.” Michel Barnier, the European Commissions chief negotiator, said: “We had dficult discussions over the past days. We have managed to find solutions that fully respect the integrity of the Single Market. We created a new and legally operative solution to avoid a hard border, and protect peace and stability on the island of Ireland. It is a solution that works for the EU, for the UK and for people and businesses in Northern Ireland.” The DUP has said it could not support the deal brokered by Mr Johnson. So, what deal was agreed  A statement from the European Commission says: “In terms of regulations, Northern Ireland will remain aligned to a limited set of rules related to the EUs Single Market in order to avoid a hard border: legislation on goods, sanitary rules for veterinary controls , rules on agricultural production marketing, VAT and excise in respect of goods, and state aid rules. “In terms of customs, the EU-UK Single Customs Territory, as agreed in November , has been removed from the Protocol on Ireland   Northern Ireland, at the request of the current UK government. EU and UK negotiators have now found a new way to achieve the goal of avoiding a customs border on the island of Ireland, while at the same time ensuring Northern Ireland remains part of the UKs customs territory. This agreement fully protects the integrity of the EUs Single Market and Customs Union, and avoids any regulatory and customs checks at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. “Finally, the EU and the UK have agreed to create a new mechanism on ‘consent, which will give the Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly a decisive voice on the long-term application of relevant EU law in Northern Ireland. The Commission has been in close contact with the Irish government on this point.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/redbus.jpg","title":"wrightbus deal struck to buy ballymena bus maker","story":"Posted on Tuesday  October  by John Mulgrew A deal has been struck to buy the business and assets of Ballymena bus maker Wrightbus after it entered administration with the loss of , jobs.

We hear about the firm’s plans for growth hereBelfast City is changing and its transportation network and parking strategy have a key role to play in supporting its growth. Innovative use of technology to make parking ‘smarter’ and promoting better use of city centre space will contribute to creating the right environment for business investment and the lestyle of residents, commuters and visitors. The need for effective parking planning reaches beyond Belfast city though as parking issues are common in towns across the country. Parking planning is not just about the provision and management of spaces – the majority of parking acts require some sort of enforcement system to ensure effectiveness. As an experienced parking operator, APCOA can work with the public and private sectors to contribute knowledge and expertise to the planning and implementation of effective parking strategies. An on-going investment in developing parking technology also offers new ways of improving services to clients and the public.In August, APCOA acquired the business of Nationwide Controlled Parking Systemsin Ireland, including subsidiaries Parking Enforcement Solutionsand Mobile Research Solutions.The combined operation resulting from the acquisition sees APCOA’s business in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland double in size to cover more than , site locations and it will enable them to service all counties in both countries.APCOA’s existing business in Northern Ireland operated a number of sites including two city centre multi storey car parks in Belfast city centre. The NCPS subsidiary PEA brings a further c. locations, primarily in the greater Belfast area with key sites such as the Titanic Quarter, numerous NHS hospitals and trusts and the Odyssey.

We’re really excited about the opportunities ahead.”Neil Cunningham, managing director of APCOA in Ireland, explains why he sees the acquisition as a positive move for the business in Northern Ireland.“This investment strengthens APCOA’s ability to offer countrywide services and gives us a stronger base for future growth. Colleagues in both companies have a keen focus on customer service and we’ve brought together two experienced management teams.“I’m also delighted that Jason Ballard, founder and chief executive of NCPS and PEA, will continue to work with us for the next six months to support the smooth integration of the business. Combine those factors with the wide range of services and innovative technology we can offer, the possibilities for further growth in Northern Ireland look very strong indeed.”  Philippe Op de Beeck, chief executive of APCOA Parking Group, says the company “profited from healthy organic growth last year”. “In addition, we are currently strengthening our focus on strategic acquisitions.“The group recently acquired Onepark A S in Denmark, after having bought another smaller Swiss company early last year.
