The pictures captured a whole tennis match in silhouette – serve, return, volley, forehand, backhand – so that the shadows advancing on the court took on a graceful life of their own, tethered to the ankles and feet of young men and women in ankle socks and white plimsolls. The relation of player and shadow – high summer’s constant doubles partners – has become a familiar theme for sports photographers, but Wolff was among the first to celebrate it.In the decade that followed, the German photographer and his assistant-cum-stage manager Alfred Tritschler became famous as “the masters of the Leica”, extending the range and scope of the pioneering hand-held camera, with work showcased in every major magazine and newspaper. The Leica company, which had given the former medical doctor one of its prototype 35mm cameras to experiment with in 1926, subsequently delivered all of its new lenses to Wolff in advance of release for him to create advertising images. A travelling slideshow of some of the results was watched by hundreds of thousands of people across the world.All of Wolff’s technical mastery coincided, of course, with the darkest days in his country’s history. Almost accidentally, he documented in his pin-sharp, perfectly lit way the end of the Weimar republic, the rise of nazism and the devastation of war. Wolff’s house in Frankfurt and his extensive personal archive were destroyed by bombing in 1944. A selection of the prints and negatives that remain has been collected into a book that includes not only his photographs of tennis players, but also early images of Hitler Youth, the launch of the Hindenburg zeppelin and the 1936 Berlin Olympics. Not for nothing is the book called Light and Shadow. Dr Paul Wolff \u0026amp Tritschler: Light and Shadow – Photographs 1920 to 1950, edited by Hans-Michael Koetzle (Kehrer Verlag), has been nominated for the Kraszna-Krausz 2020 Photography Book award.

About 63,000 sq km of this land is Wilinggin country of the Ngarinyin people and their connection to country dates back 60,000 years.One of the first stops towards Wilinggin country passes the Queen Victoria Head – a rock formation bearing an uncanny resemblance to the famous monarch. While it’s a blunt reminder of colonialism, it’s also the gateway to an area that until very recently had far more dubious name – the King Leopold Ranges, named after the Belgian king responsible for grievous atrocities, brutal oppression and enslavement of African people.An estimated 10 to 15 million Congolese people died under his brutal regime. Leopold is a figure among many whose inappropriate immortalisation has been brought to the global stage by the Black Lives Matter movement.But after two years of work behind the scenes, traditional owner groups made some new headlines with a historic name change to the Wunaamin Miliwundi Ranges. It’s a hybrid name to represent both the Ngarinyin (Wunaamin) and Bunuba (Miliwundi) traditional names.Since then, another seven places in this conservation park have changed back to their Ngarinyin name.Since the Wanjina Wunggurr Wilinggin native title determination in 2004, the Ngarinyin people have made significant moves to empower their community and return to, and care for, country. One of the first things they set up after determination was an Indigenous ranger program: the Wunggurr Rangers.Ngarinyin man Robin Dann was one of the first rangers employed and is now head ranger, living on country in the Ngallagunda community, with his family. His younger brother Kane Nenowatt is more recent addition to the Wunggurr rangers while his wife, Tanya Spider, sits on the Wilinggin board of directors.Dann’s granddaughters Anastacia and Lizinta Jumburra provide boundless energy and infectious smiles, but they also represent a new generation for the community.“These changes are about time, mate, but we always kept the names when we worked on country anyway – they never went away. But this does give us recognition and that makes us proud,” Dann says.One of locations changed back to its traditional name is (the formerly named) Barker pool, now Dudungarri mindi. The name refers to the dreamtime story of the Wanjina spirit and the Yawarlngarri jirri (blue catfish) which live in this pool. This represents a rich and ancient history that Ngarinyin people hope to share with visitors alongside the staggering beauty of the region.For the Wilinggin Aboriginal Corporation, this moment also highlights the benefits surrounding native title. With it comes a genuine economy: employment and investment brought to the region by the people themselves. With a second ranger group on the way, the determination of the Ngarinyin people to stand on their own is a shining light in an uncertain world."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7eaee58d488348967613c17f9e6584f881abda0/0_128_4367_2620/master/4367.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aae66b710e984f4044ee4e1738308a19","title":"poem of the week akwaba by kwame dawes","story":"A father welcomes his wailing newborn child to the world and as her time begins he vows his love for everiBrown snow lines the roadways.The still, grey city whispersin the sunrise, inching into bloom.I see your slick wet headswaddled in a sheet of bloodyour mother breathing into the half-light.Sena! Wailing across my heart!iiLorna stares at the televisionnot recording the flicker of lightsjust willing love to flow slowin warm streams of her milkinto your quick-suck mouthlocked on like a fish in passion.iiiPicture this my heart’s solace:forever, I will watch your eyesblaze through my dim, lensless blur.Forever, sweet Sena,Gift from God AlmightyAkwaba, akwaba, akwaba.Akwaba, sometimes spelled with an additional “a” (Akwaaba), is a Ghanaian word from the Twi dialect meaning “welcome”. It’s the joyous title of a joyous early poem by the multi-talented and far-travelled Ghanaian-born writer Kwame Dawes, greeting a new daughter through a single word steeped in memory.The poem was originally published in the collection Progeny of Air, which won the Forward prize for best first collection in 1994. It’s included in his New and Selected Poems, 1992-2002, a valuable introduction to the work that established Dawes as an unusually wide-ranging younger poet.Dawes has confronted some of the most painful events in the history of Africa and the Caribbean: his 1996 collection, Requiem, for example, responds to the barbarism of the Middle Passage and takes the form of impassioned elegies for the “countless dead”. On beginning to read Akwaba, not knowing the meaning of the title, I wasn’t sure of the mood. The scene-setting – brown snow, grey city – and even the initial descriptions of “your slick wet head  swaddled in a sheet of blood” gave me a few pangs, a suggestion of loss and injury before the light dawned, and celebration transformed the images to life and hope. The snow was brown simply because it was thawing the city, lit by the sunrise, was “inching into bloom”.The poem resembles a miniature song cycle, each song having a shape of its own, while following an upward curve of emotion. Line seven, standing by itself at the end of the first poem-song, signals intensity when it utters the child’s name. It goes on almost to recreate the sound of new baby’s cry: “Sena! Wailing across my heart!”In the second poem, the mood is calmer. The scene expands: the mother is now feeding the child in front of a television programme she’s not watching, being absorbed in “willing love to flow slow  in warm streams of her milk”. As the mother nourishes the child with love and milk, the father nourishes her with love and verbal invention. A tenderly humorous metaphorical flourish is complete with sound effects suggesting the noise of a child’s sucking: “your quick-suck mouth  locked on like a fish in passion.” This inner, second section unfolds a spare, fresh, modern “Mother and Child” image. Perhaps you could imagine it had been painted by a surrealist or cubist artist. There is nothing stark. The mother is named. The language is gentle, sensuous and, with “quick-suck mouth”, vividly colloquial.The speaker is always addressing the child in the poem, and, in the first line of part three, it’s she who is “my heart’s solace” and is given this image of herself to treasure as a “picture”. The walls of the room have been opened out and stretched into time. The time is “Forever” because the poet’s religious faith allows him that concept – eternal life. The focus on vision contrasts the “blaze” of young eyes and the middle-aged “blur”. Physical loss of vision is repaired in this stanza through the power of imagination: even “lensless” eyes can see the “blaze” of the child’s. And it’s implied, I think, that the child is also looking back at the parent who looks at her. Similarly, she is his “heart’s solace” but the love declared is also solace given. The return to welcome in the poem’s last line, with the triple flourish of “Akwaba”, is splendidly simple and effective. It suggests that welcome is registered not only on the singular occasion of birth, but that it is endlessly renewed.Kwame Dawes continues to build on his achievements. His work covers many genres besides poetry, and is driven by a spirit of creative generosity, shown in his collaborations with visual artists, musicians and other poets. His latest collection is a fresh cycle of poems co-written with the Australian poet John Kinsella, A New Beginning."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f819910e2e9e8210f81d9ed48a82acecee0bfb1/0_48_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2bcd03ab3f737038c836982a0ab509d7","title":"jamie oliver worst nightmare the return of the turkey twizzler bernard matthews","story":"It was junk food loathed by nutritionists and loved by children and eventually banned from school menus after a high-profile campaign by the chef Jamie Oliver.Now the infamous Turkey Twizzler is making a surprise comeback, 15 years after the manufacturer Bernard Matthews stopped making them after a wave of negative publicity.Bernard Matthews, which is now owned by the 2 Sisters Food Group, will announce on Monday the so-called “comeback of the century”, following hints posted on social media.

Bolloré will take over from Sir Ralf Speth, who has run the carmaker for a decade, next month. Speth will become the non-executive vice-chairman of JLR.Tata Steel, which employs 8,000 people in the UK and has made losses for a decade, was seeking financial support of several hundred million pounds."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/260953485c3b836b7e003d4137fa87bcb652061a/0_0_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=53a80161e5287800755f6897549f62ec","title":"markets japan gdp us china trade talks ftse sterling eurozone business live","story":"Rolling coverage of the latest economic and financial newsWhile UK households struggle, the mood is a little brighter over in Germany.The Bundesbank predicted that growth would surge now that the Covid-19 pandemic has been lifted, letting shops reopen and life return towards normality.In its latest monthly report, it predicted that consumer spending would drive private consumption up:“The clear and broad-based recovery in macroeconomic performance, which began after the low point in April, will continue. “The German economy should grow very strongly in the summer quarter of 2020.”However....the Bundesbank also pointed out that the global economy will remain under pressure until a vaccine is brought to market, which would hurt German exporters.Here’s our news story on the latest moves towards home-working:As Kevin Ellis, the PwC chairman, says:“There’s no question that lockdown has done away with presenteeism. It’s shown many business leaders that their people can be productive, engaged and happy working from home. Here’s Andy Bruce of Reuters on today’s drop in financial wellbeing:The financial health of British households deteriorated in August at a faster pace than last month, in an unpromising sign for the economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, a survey showed on Monday. The Household Finance Index from data company IHS Markit fell to 40.8 in August from 41.5 in July, dragged down by the biggest drop in job security since 2011.A wave of lay-offs is already underway and economists fear worse will come when the government’s furlough scheme closes at the end of October.UK shoppers continue to shun the high street, in another sign that the economy is still suffering from Covid-19.Diane Wehrle, Insights Director at Springboard says that shops in London suffered the most: “The first week of the peak summer holiday period delivered spectacularly hot weather but largely lacklustre footfall performance. Customer activity across UK retail destinations rose marginally from the week before but the uplift was less than a third of the increase recorded in the previous week. It was clearly high streets - where footfall marginally decreased - that subdued the overall result, whilst in shopping centres and retail parks footfall rose from the week before. “Despite the poor performance across high streets nationally, footfall in coastal and historic town centres rose marginally, undoubtedly due to the school holiday period and hot weather, whilst in regional cities and in London in particular footfall declined.”The drop in UK financial wellbeing in August shows that households are still suffering economic harm from the pandemic.Lewis Cooper, Economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey, explains: “The latest survey data highlight a continued strain on the finances of UK households, with the headline figure dipping in August as pressure intensified slightly. The 12-month outlook for finances remained highly negative amid substantial uncertainty surrounding the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.Incomes from employment fell sharply again, while the survey measure of job security perceptions remained firmly in negative territory as the winding down of the government’s furlough scheme looms.Overall, the data hint at some worrying trends when put in the context of the significant recession facing the UK. Although lockdown measures are looser households are spending less, earning less and unsure about their jobs, all of which has the ability to add severe friction to the pace of the economic recovery.” UK household finances have continued to deteriorate as the Covid-19 pandemic pushed the country into a steep recession.The latest Household Finance index, just released by data firm IHS Markit, shows that household spending fell again this month as take-home pay declined. The survey also found that people are increasing worried about their financial prospects, and the risk of losing their job.August data highlighted another reduction in income received from employment, with the latest decline sharp, despite easing further from May’s record drop.Troublingly for the UK economic outlook, the survey measure of job security perceptions was also negative amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and a substantial number of redundancies. Here are the key points from the survey:This pulled the index down to 40.8 in August, from 41.5 in July.That shows a “further, slightly sharper, deterioration in the financial situation of UK households” says Markit (any reading below 50 indicates that things got worse).  Looking into the future was just as gloomy, as households in the UK remained highly pessimistic of their financial wellbeing over the coming 12 months. Reaction to follow...Fears of new Covid-19 lockdowns and travel restrictions are hitting shares in airline and hotel operators this morning.The jump in cases in some European countries is dragging travel stocks down again, adding to Friday’s losses after the UK imposed a 14-day quarantine on arrivals from France. On Saturday, France posted its highest daily infection total since easing its lockdown. Neil Wilson of Market says Germany’s latest travel warning -- anyone returning from mainland Spain and the Balearic Islands must undergo mandatory COVID-19 testing - has also worried traders. As noted in the week ahead, the number of new Covid-19 cases across Europe is the number one thing to watch in the coming days as it has the potential to send nascent economic recovery into reverse. A sharp rise in cases in Spain, France and Germany will make traders nervous about new lockdowns and ensure that local equity markets remain volatile. Nevertheless, basic resources stocks registered strong gains in early trade to offset much of the losses elsewhere.The wider FTSE 100 is now up 18 points, lifted by miners and building firms, at 6201.“The negative news piling up on the global economy, relations between China and the US and a seeming second wave of coronavirus makes you wonder what stocks would be doing without the stimulus pledged by governments and central banks.“Investors will be wary of reaching the point where the announcement of big financial packages no longer acts as a positive catalyst.Tata Motors has denied reports that it plans to sell its stake in UK carmaker Jaguar Land Rover.The Indian conglomerate insists that it’s committed to JLR, after talks with the UK government about a possible bailout collapsed. Tata also says that JLR “remains strong”. More here:While offices are struggling, the residential housing market is booming.The UK housing market has had its busiest month in more than 10 years in July, with the traditional summer lull replaced by a flurry of activity from buyers and sellers, according to the property website Rightmove.Would-be sellers were also active, with more properties coming on to the market than in any month since 2008.Property companies are under pressure this morning, amid fresh signs that office life will not be the same after the pandemic.Asset manager Schroders told its staff they will not be hauled back to their desks in London this autumn. Before Covid-19, they were expected to be there most of the time. Now, Schroders managers will take a “new approach to flexible working”, having seen that they can function well with staff working from home.Accountancy firm PricewaterhouseCoopers is taking a similar view, saying it expects the majority of its staff to continue working remotely afterr the coronavirus pandemic has passed.This shows a real change of approach for City firms, who had previously staff to trek to the capital every day for work. And while employees may welcome the work-life balance (and the reduced risk of catching some thing nasty on the Tube), it suggests demand for office space will be rather lower.M\u0026ampA news: French multinational pharmaceutical company Sanofi is buying US rival Principia Biopharma in a $3.4bn deal.The deal will give Sanofi full control of a multiple sclerosis treatment developed by Principia, which the two companies have been working on.It will strengthen Sanofi’s focus on autoimmune and allergic diseases.The FT’s Leila Abboud has a good take here. Here’s a flavour:It is the second and largest acquisition struck by chief executive Paul Hudson since he took over a year ago, and reflects his strategy of focusing on speciality medicines for cancer and rare diseases, rather than the mass-market cardiovascular and diabetes drugs that have traditionally generated its revenues.With the deal, Sanofi acquires a pipeline of drugs known as BTK inhibitors that may help treat autoimmune disorders by curbing white blood cells known as B-cells from attacking healthy tissue. European markets are an uninspiring sight this morning. The recent rise in Covid-19 cases in parts of Europe doesn’t seem to be alarming investors.Mohit Kumar of Jefferies says the markets are primarily focused on the economy recovery:The news on the COVID front has been mixed, with a flare up in a number of European countries raising concerns over a potential second wave, but some optimism on the vaccine front. The market continues to shrug off the recent rise in the number of cases.Our view remains that the main driver for the market would be expected policy actions and any economic fallouts from renewed lockdowns rather than the rise in the number of cases. Asia-Pacific markets were rather mixed today, after Japan posted its worst growth figures in decades.However, China’s market rallied sharply after its central bank pumped more liquidity into the financial system - and the trade talks were postponed.Here’s how the major markets closed:China’s central bank has taken fresh measures to support its economy today.The People’s Bank of China (PBoC) say it would provide 700-billion-yuan worth of medium-term loans. That’s more than enough to roll over the 550bn yuan injected in recent months, which mature later this month.It also injected another 50 billion yuan into the economy, to keep borrowing costs stable. More here.Investors are also digesting the news that the United States and China delayed a review of their Phase 1 trade deal.The two sides were initially slated to talks for Saturday, but this didn’t actually happen. According to Reuters, the postponement was due to “scheduling conflicts” and the need to allow China more time to buy US exports (a key part of the deal).No new date for the initial six-month compliance review between U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He has been agreed, the sources said.The officials were expected to hold a videoconference on Saturday, the six-month anniversary of the trade deal’s Feb. 15 entry into force as the coronavirus pandemic began spreading globally.One source familiar with the talks said the delay was related to a conference of senior Communist Party leaders at the seaside town of Beidaihe on China’s northeast coast. The postponement did not reflect any substantive problem with the trade deal, the source said, adding: “The new date has not been finalized yet.”Given the frosty nature of relations between Washington and Beijing (Huawei, TikToc...), this postponement does at least prevent the two sides falling out. The slump in Japan’s economy last quarter was mainly driven by a slump in household spending, says Adam Cole of RBC:As expected, the bulk of the fall in GDP was accounted for by weaker consumer spending. Japan’s economy has now shrunk for nine months, points out Robert Ward of The International Institute for Strategic Studies:This chart from Jeroen Blokland of Robeco shows just how sharply the economy shrank:Japan had been relying on the Olympics to drive its economy back to growth, points out Bjørn Sillemann of Danske Bank. But obviously that’s now been delayed by a year.Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.Global markets are subdued this morning, after Japan became the latest country to suffer a historic economic slump due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

After six months of catastrophic mismanagement, from delaying lockdown to the A-level marking fiasco, this autumn is sure to bring even more ersion, distraction and brazen victim-blaming.Led by a shallow prime minister, populated by careerists and directed by a grandiose and sophomoric special adviser, the government at present is fashioned towards ruling – not governing. But it’s not lack of qualification alone that has produced its incompetence. The defining feature of today’s Conservative party is indifference to the outcomes of its failed policies – none of which it has been seriously punished for.The gutting of the state, the impoverishment and deaths caused by austerity, the chaos of Brexit and the global embarrassment that has been its pandemic response are failures that should have brought an end to its tenure. But the party has developed one skill: avoiding consequences by way of constructing false enemies – immigrants, welfare scroungers, the European Union. It has achieved this herd impunity with the help of a credulous and oftentimes knowingly complicit media.When faced with the actual task of governing during a real crisis, not a confected one, the government has flailed, U-turned and contradicted itself. Throughout it has stuck competently and consistently to its one principle – never apologise, never explain, always blame someone else.The political and cultural infrastructure that makes it so easy for the powerful to shift responsibility on to others while refusing to show humility or acknowledge mistakes encourages a limited range of public responses to political crises. When an issue arises, the government launches into dramatic displays of action for the benefit of the watching public, and the media follows its cue, inflating the scale of the problem. Any legitimate demands for rational analysis of a situation are trivialised as liberal hand-wringing. Calls for accountability are dismissed as a “politicising” of events, as Boris Johnson has repeatedly characterised Labour questions about its handling of the pandemic, or the result of media “agendas”, such as when journalists sought answers about Dominic Cummings defying lockdown rules. When immigrants are spotted crossing the Channel, we are presented with the grossly disproportionate response of appointing a chillingly named “clandestine Channel threat commander”. The journalists ignoring the distress of a man in a dinghy bailing out water with a plastic bucket are likely not doing so out of a studied xenophobia, but this callous way of reporting is so entrenched that it’s become habit.And everything is about to get worse. What lies ahead is the ersionary plan to make the British public accountable for the government’s failures. The seeds for this deception were planted during the pandemic’s first act. We were to “stay at home, protect the NHS, save lives”, and then later “stay alert, control the virus and save lives”. Cabinet ministers rolled out these staccato orders to us whenever they were cornered on the detail of their policies, as if the entire success or failure of the pandemic response hinged only on public observance and not the government’s decisions.The seeds are flourishing. The Conservatives want us to believe that their efforts were thwarted by a mass exercise in national sabotage by irresponsible iniduals, by black and ethnic minority communities allegedly not observing its rules, by badly run old people’s homes, even by the poor advice of its own scientists.At crucial junctures the Tories will anticipate public anger and earmark a convenient target to be subjected to public scrutiny. As A-level students saw their futures dissolve, a source “close to Gavin Williamson”, the education secretary, was mobilised to the Daily  to say that teachers were “not to be trusted on grading”, and it was they who gave students an unreasonable expectation of their results.Round two of the fight between teachers’ unions and local governments is brewing, as they object to schools re-opening in September without a robust test, track and trace system. Perpetually locked in a fight with professional bodies and their own civil service, ministers bully people whose sense of vocational duty will not allow them to warp reality to suit government propaganda.These aren’t new tactics. The poor were blamed for borrowing beyond their means in the wake of the financial crisis, and the bankers got away with it. Immigrants, not government austerity, were blamed for the shrinking of the welfare state. After a decade of gutting public services and growing its media patronage, the Conservative party has become very good at making people fight for the scraps of resources it leaves behind. Its efforts will add one more test to the trials facing the British public in the autumn – will we turn against the government, or each other?• Nesrine Malik is a  columnist.

It has since become commonplace to argue that coronavirus has created both a need and an opportunity for fundamental change. Though we might like to pretend otherwise, the kind of deep-seated changes we need to confront our ongoing crises would certainly be disruptive. Retiring dirty industries and growing clean ones is disruptive. Shifting from an economy that bids up land values to one that does socially useful things is disruptive. Redressing the imbalance between London and the rest of the country is disruptive.The pandemic means that much of this disruption is now happening anyway. We are enduring the pain – so couldn’t this be an opportunity to gain?A government with vision could accept that the economy is being reshaped by coronavirus, and design its support in a way that leans into some of those changes and softens the transition to a different future. Instead we are getting the worst of both worlds. The government is allowing coronavirus to wreak economic havoc and has accepted that job losses are inevitable. Figures now confirm that the UK is in the midst of the worst recession among G7 countries. Yet it has no vision beyond an attempt to preserve the pre-crisis economy. Billions of pounds – thousands of lives and livelihoods – will be wasted in the service of this doomed endeavour.An obvious example is aviation. We know that we must fly less to avoid catastrophic climate change. We also know that this process will hit workers and that they must be supported through a just transition. We cannot have a rerun of the 1980s, when pit closures left coal miners on the scrap heap and hollowed out entire communities.Now, with planes grounded and passenger numbers through the floor, the industry is in freefall. It may not return to pre-crisis levels for years, if ever. British Airways and easyJet are cutting thousands of jobs and eroding conditions for their remaining workers, despite taking advantage of the furlough scheme and a combined £900m in low-cost loans from the Bank of England. This is disaster capitalism in action.The New Economics Foundation has called for a sector-wide crisis support plan that combines a limit on redundancies with a job reskilling programme, supporting workers to find new, green jobs. If ever there was a moment to bite this bullet, surely it is now. Yet the current strategy seems to be almost precisely the opposite: preserve as much of the airlines’ pre-crisis business models as possible and let workers pay the price.Another case in point is the high street. Alarm is growing about the impact of prolonged home-working on the sandwich trade and, perhaps more to the point, on city-centre commercial property values. It was enough to prompt Boris Johnson to urge people back to the office despite his own chief medical officer saying we have “reached the limit” of lockdown easing. The economic arguments for this fall apart under scrutiny. The Centre for Economic and Business Research claims that £2.3bn of spending has been “lost or displaced” from central London during lockdown. But there is a big difference between lost and displaced. Since humans need to eat, one assumes that the demand for lunch is still being met – but much of it by neighbourhood shops and cafes rather than Pret a Mangers in Canary Wharf.Now that people have realised they can do their jobs from home and save hours of commuting time, this trend will almost certainly continue as a matter of choice rather than necessity. Is this really such a bad thing? It could breathe new life into local high streets and improve people’s wellbeing. London First insists that getting the capital moving again would boost the economy, since it accounts for a quarter of national growth. But this is a circular argument. The fact that our economy is so skewed towards central London is a problem. The fact that so much of it revolves around lucrative commercial property is a problem. Of course these things cannot be changed without disruption. But the disruption is happening anyway. To insist that we must go back to eating overpriced sandwiches at a desk is nothing more than special pleading from those who stand to lose out.Instead, perhaps we should be asking whether the fall in commercial property values represents an opportunity to bring land back into public or community ownership and repurpose it. Could we reimagine town centres with fewer office blocks or coffee shops and more parks or outdoor markets? Unfortunately, the demand for “shovel-ready” projects for the government’s £900m Getting Building fund seems to be pushing local authorities in exactly the opposite direction. Millions are being sunk into city-centre office developments at precisely the time when the future of such developments is in doubt.The pandemic isn’t only changing where we work but also how we work. Many businesses have responded to reduced demand by using the furlough scheme to bring workers back part-time. Millions of parents are still juggling work and childcare, and some have realised they would prefer to work part-time if they could afford it. A shorter working week has long been advocated as a way to spread both paid work and unpaid caring responsibilities more evenly. At a time when there is less work to go around – when huge labour market disruption is already happening – it could be a critical tool to prevent mass unemployment.The thinktank Autonomy has proposed extending the furlough scheme to support part-time working on a longer-term basis – and using this to ease the transition towards a shorter working week. Germany already does this through the Kurzarbeit, or short-time working scheme. By persisting instead with plans to withdraw support, the government is not only risking mass unemployment and worse economic disruption – it is also failing to seize the opportunity to help us move towards a better relationship with work, time and care.We are getting the disruption without the renewal, the pain without the gain. The pandemic is upending our lives and our economy: that much is a given. Whether we use this moment to build something better is a political choice.• Christine Berry is a researcher, writer and consultant"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a36a381148b0b67af7b381e0404cb443aaf9cd99/0_0_1592_955/master/1592.jpg?width=1200\u0026amp;height=630\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026amp;overlay-width=100p\u0026amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026amp;s=3243030041638c0fb8aa9e449e558c87","title":"studying at home how to stop procrastinating and stay organised","story":"Finding time to juggle priorities was hard even before Covid-19, but it’s always possible to learn and hone your planning skillsBeing organised and finding time to juggle competing priorities can be a challenge for students at the best of times. But the coronavirus pandemic has disrupted even the best-laid plans. The good news is, organisational skills can be learned.Take it one week at a time. During each term or semester, it is best to take each week as a block of time – 168 hours – and then ide it into smaller chunks. Most planners or calendars ide up the day into hourly chunks, and some ide these further into half-hour or even 15-minute blocks. Plan on a weekend, start on a Monday.  Set aside an hour on the weekend when you properly plan out your week – put an hour in your timetable each week to do this. Your weeks may be very similar: labs, lectures and tutorials won’t change, and some of your extracurricular activities might stay the same, so you can copy regular events across rather than having to fill everything in from scratch.Prioritise. One of the most important elements of organising effectively is knowing what is deserving of your time. It’s important to make enough time for your studies but also for other things that matter to you too, such as friends, clubs and societies, or volunteering. It is also helpful to distinguish between essential items that will help you achieve your study goals and non-essential items – perhaps with a simple colour-coding system. These non-essential items might still be very important to you personally, but they are not directly related to your study goals. For example, exercise might be important to you and help you relax, but on its own it won’t get that essay written. If you label pastimes like this as “non-essential”, when things don’t quite go as planned – perhaps you are ill for a few days and get behind in your work – it will be easier for you to rearrange your upcoming timetable.Make a diary. Once you have decided what is important to spend your time on, you need to prioritise these things. You might put study for exams as your first priority for the week, spending time with friends as your second, and exercising third, for example.Don’t forget the basics. While it may not be as exciting or fun as hanging out with friends, you still need to eat, sleep, wash, clean your living space, buy groceries and toiletries, plan your finances, and do laundry. Give yourself some leeway when scheduling and accept that life admin will always take up some of your time.Regularly review your timetable. Each week will be different. There will be different demands on your time, different deadlines, different events and other things that come up. For example, if you have a thesis due at the end of one semester, you will allocate more time for writing this in the last month of the term than the first month. You can, however, save time by using a rough template for your weekly timetable, filling in as much information as you have at the beginning of the term or even academic year, and reviewing it regularly to adjust and fill in more detail."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5496512ec56ab6ef446f81fb3638566be8aece8/8_0_4783_2870/master/4783.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a0de9cc16d2a93588d55d52406d57f3c","title":"us schools reopening coronavirus teachers","story":"The debate over whether to resume in-person classes continues across the US as some schools plan to reopen after pressure from TrumpDuring a school board meeting in July over school reopening plans, Louise Radloff, the county school board chair, was caught on a hot mic telling another member, “I could strangle him”, in reference to another board member arguing in favor of starting school virtually. She has since apologized.Opponents’ fears are justified. Gwinnett county has reported more than 20,000 Covid-19 cases, with local infections rising over the past few weeks. Worried teachers have been holding caravan protests against in-person school reopenings.“The district’s plan sends a clear message that any risk we incur for face-to-face learning is worth it, even if it could mean death,” said David Battle, a middle school teacher in Lawrenceville, Georgia. “Who are we willing to sacrifice for face-to-face instruction?”The Orange County Teachers Association has declared an impasse in negotiations with the district over reopening plans and is suing the district to keep virtual learning in place.“Based on the numbers in Florida it is simply not safe to open,” said Gail Weston McDonald, a middle school teacher outside of Orlando. She has severe asthma and was able to receive a doctor’s note to be approved to work from home. “Sadly the students who will be forced to go to school will be students from lower-income families, putting their lives in danger.”Jeffrey Barrois, an elementary school teacher in Jefferson parish outside New Orleans, Louisiana, said his school already had a positive coronavirus case reported while teachers are attending development and training sessions ahead of in-person classes resuming on 26 August.“They didn’t tell us who the person was. They said there are protocols involved, how they determine who has and hasn’t had close contact, an answer to how, I’m not exactly sure,” said Barrois. “The word ‘strike’ has been used, but we haven’t had an official position taken by our union local.”“I’m trying to make things as safe as possible. I’ve personally been stocking up on different masks. We only received one mask. Teachers are buying their own stuff,” said Batten. “My biggest concern is are we going to lose a student or teacher? That’s what scares me the most.”School districts in most major cities and metro areas around the US are beginning the 2020-2021 school year with virtual learning for at least the first few weeks of school pending the state of coronavirus cases in their areas.But several school districts have begun or plan to resume in-person learning. The openings come after pressure from the Trump administration to open up. “SCHOOLS MUST OPEN IN THE FALL!!!” Donald Trump declared on 6 July. He has threatened to take away funding from schools that don’t open and called teachers’ union leaders “disgraceful” for opposing his plans.Nearly 100,000 children around the US have tested positive for coronavirus. And as some schools around the US have begun reopening in person, coronavirus cases have spread with quarantine orders already reported in schools in Georgia, Mississippi, Indiana and North Carolina.He explained teachers were concerned over medical accommodations not being permitted to teachers and staff for at-risk household members, how hybrid learning will work, and concerns over lack of ventilation in schools that have traditionally suffered a lack of cleaning supplies such as soap. In March 2020, schools were not closed until 16 March, as 74 public school employees in New York City died of coronavirus.“In March, when they shut down schools, it left a lot of teachers scarred. A lot of educators died and a lot of our students had family members die and it was clear the virus was spreading because schools were open, and schools were left open longer than most jurisdictions in the US,” said Andrew Worthington, a high school teacher in Manhattan and union chapter leader at his school.Worthington explained teachers were struggling to plan for the school year because there is no set school calendar yet and it remains unclear how many students will be opting for virtual learning over in person and how lunches for students in classrooms will work. Teachers in New York City conducted sickouts in March before schools were shut down and are considering using sickouts again to protest against school reopening plans.The New York State Nurses Association issued a statement calling for New York City to postpone in-person school reopenings, citing the ongoing risks of coronavirus and lack of infrastructure to handle super spreading events.“Our government at a federal level and local level hasn’t done enough still to get the pandemic under control, and make it safe for us to be in school buildings with our students,” said Monique Dols, an early childhood special educator in the Bronx. “Our biggest concern is that the school buildings become an avenue for the coronavirus to spread again like what happened in March.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c53840a3d44fcb1766161a2f372574dbb730ed85/0_147_5475_3285/master/5475.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=27c847ef98e0643ad28549a461f17dcd","title":"from farm to factory the unstoppable rise of american chicken","story":"How industrial chicken farming transformed an ‘alternative’ meat to the most consumed meat in the USA century ago, Americans would not recognise our modern hunger for chicken. The year-long market for tender but relatively bland chicken meat is a newish phenomenon, and without it the idea of chicken cutlets, $5 rotisseries, or the McNugget would be a fantasy.How did America go from thinking of chicken as an “alternative” meat to consuming it more than any other meat?The story starts with corn.At the turn of the 20th century, chicken was almost always eaten in the spring. The priority for chicken raisers at the time was egg production, so after the eggs hatched, all the male birds would be fed up and then quickly harvested as “spring chickens” – young, tender birds that were sold whole for roasting or broiling (hence the term “broilers”). Outside the spring rush, you might be buying a bigger, fatter fryer or an old hen for stewing.“Farmers were sending chickens of all sorts of ages, different feather colours, and tremendous variety to the marketplace in the early 20th century,” says Roger Horowitz, food historian and author of Putting Meat on the American Table. But almost all chickens in the market were simply surplus to egg production, making them relatively uncommon – even rare. Tender spring chickens in particular could fetch a good price. But it is worth noting, Horowitz says, that the higher price wasn’t necessarily coming from pent-up demand.“It’s not as if consumers were clamoring for broilers,” he says. Though there was some consumer demand for chickens, the relatively high price for broilers likely had more to do with the limited, seasonal supply than a passion for poultry.During the second world war, however, red meat was rationed, and a national campaign encouraged the consumption of poultry and fish to save “meat” (beef, pork and lamb) for “the army and our allies”. Eating chicken became more common, but the preference for young broilers, and white breast meat, persisted. As the war drew to a close, feed millers, which buy and grind corn and other grains to feed livestock, saw a big opportunity to spur that demand for meat chickens, which consume large amounts of corn. When traditional banks refused to finance new-fangled “chicken farms”, the feed companies themselves offered farmers loans to buy feed and equipment, putting the pieces of the modern contract poultry system in place.Consumer acceptance of broilers out of season was not automatic. In the 1930s, the average American ate 10lbs (4.5kg) or less of chicken annually by 2017 that had risen to 64lbs (29kg), according to the Economic Research Service at the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). For decades chicken battled to be seen as a “meat”, and did not surpass its most expensive competitor, beef, in terms of overall consumption until 2010. A strong USDA-funded marketing campaign helped out.“In the 50s and 60s, you see where these agricultural extension operations start pushing out recipes very aggressively about broilers,” Horowitz says, and as feed companies and hatcheries (most of which would eventually become so-called “integrators”, which own several of the businesses involved in chicken production) continued to consolidate the industry, they were able to more carefully calibrate the chicken itself to what would sell most profitably, focusing on lowering costs and raising proportions of the highest-demand cuts, namely breast meat.Don Tyson, the late president of Tyson Foods, famously said: “If breast meat is worth two dollars a pound and dark meat is worth one dollar, which would I rather have?” But for generations, the idea of buying just the most coveted cuts of chicken was foreign to most consumers. It wasn’t until the 1980s that preferences began to switch to cuts of meat over the whole bird.These companies owned and understood their chickens from egg to table and were able to exert unprecedented control over the biology of their flocks. Now, not only are they able to fine tune the birds’ characteristics with incredible accuracy, they can also map interactions with feed, environment, and processing to maximise profits.For integrators and corn farmers alike, the investment paid off. In 2019, 9.2 billion 6lb (2.7kg) broiler chickens were harvested in the US, consuming about 1.8lbs (820g) of grain for every pound of chicken.But the impact on chickens from the changes in production is troubling.Over the past 70 years, the poultry industry has measured its success in terms of how many pounds of meat a chicken can produce for a given amount of feed. Modern chickens are more efficient than ever, with producers able to calculate to the ounce how much “input” of food, water, air and time are required to get a set amount of white and dark meat.The modern chicken is fully industrialised.With more than 500 chicken breeds existing on Earth, it might surprise you to learn that every nugget, breast, and cup of chicken noodle soup you’ve ever eaten likely came from one breed, a specialised cross between a Cornish and a white  rock.The genetic lineages of chickens grown by the world’s biggest poultry companies are a closely guarded secret. But one common commercial line, the Cobb 500, originated from a contest held by the USDA’s Agricultural Extension Service in the 1940s, aptly titled the “chicken of tomorrow” competition. The winner, the Vantress chicken, would become the standard meat chicken by the 1950s. This chicken and its many descendants were optimised for a few key factors: large breasts, white feathers, fast and efficient growth, consistent sizes and gentle dispositions.The average size of a grocery store chicken in the 1920s was about 2.5lbs (1.13kg). Today it hovers around 6lbs (2.7 kg), which a broiler chicken can reach in about 47 days, according to the National Chicken Council (even younger, smaller birds are used for fast food restaurants).The use of naturally double-breasted breeds and millions of dollars in research has produced birds with massive breasts, but gaining that muscle mass quickly requires near constant food consumption, and leads the birds to have much lower activity levels. Growing pains lead to sedentary birds.White feathers are key for marketing, because pin feathers and follicles of birds with coloured feathers can hang on to pigmentation, and coloured bird carcasses don’t appear as “clean” or sell as well to picky consumers.Consistent sizing is required to ensure that slaughterhouse line speeds can stay high. Processing chickens is one of the biggest bottlenecks in getting chickens from farms to grocery stores, and consistently sized birds keep the machines running smoothly.Gentle dispositions are also a must as chickens are naturally aggressive and even cannibalistic, especially in confined spaces and large numbers. Poultry houses are more profitable the more birds are inside, so reducing the chickens’ natural disposition to fight and eat one another is key to facilitating modern poultry rearing. Faster-maturing birds also tend to be gentler, because aggressive behavior is more common among sexually mature chickens, a milestone most broilers never reach.With limited diets, these industrial birds can live semi-normal lifes, but if allowed to eat continuously, as they are genetically designed to, they tend to have extremely high mortality rates beyond the ideal harvest date. Counterintuitively perhaps, the industrialisation of chicken led to far fewer choices when buying poultry.“If you look at cookbooks in the 20s and 30s – for a certain kind of dish you get a fat chicken, for another you get a fryer or broiler. And the marketplace distinguished between those kinds of chickens,” Horowitz says. The industry’s obsession with perfecting the broiler machine came at the cost of the consumer’s ability to choose other varieties of chicken.As chickens became more commonplace in grocery stores, brands started to reintroduce variety by offering inidual cuts, skinless and boneless meats, and processed products (which also allowed them to improve the flavour, which had become decidedly bland over time). But as consumers’ interests trend away from more highly processed foods in search of story and connection to place, a niche may be opening for birds other than the Cornish cross.Growing food movements around the world are already spurring conversations about the possibility of making slower-growing chickens of different breeds, harvested at a larger variety of ages, more widely available. Even the company that grows Cobb 500 chicks is offering a new “rustic” variety with golden plumage, rather than the standard white. The conventional poultry industry may actually be poised to lead this trend, as it currently makes chickens of various sizes and ages available to institutional customers (fast food fried chicken, for example, is usually made from smaller, younger birds than are available in the grocery store).In the meantime, breeders and geneticists at the world’s largest poultry companies will continue refining their lines of Cornish cross broilers, in particular to grow quickly in harsh environments or on lower-quality feeds, conditions that might be more common in the developing world.“Instead of just selecting birds for maximum growth and size,” says Clauer, “now the genetic companies can look at 20, 30, 40 parameters and look very closely at the bird’s anatomy, health, structure, all the things that go into a modern bird that makes it much more efficient and have better liveability.”Though competition will likely come as technologies around lab-cultured and cell-based meats continue to progress and gain consumer acceptance, the sheer efficiency and short growth time of chickens is insulating the industry for now.Sign up for the Animals Farmed monthly update to get a round-up of the best farming and food stories across the world and keep up with our investigations.

The quality seems variable, but we won’t know what we’re looking at until it is all in.”Good growing conditions over the summer, when about half the wheat harvest was brought in across the country, ended for many regions in the past week with severe thunderstorms following the mini-heatwave, which saw the longest period of temperatures over 34C (93.2F) since comparable records began in 1961.But the problems with the harvest started at the beginning of the year. While this spring was the sunniest since comparable measurements began in 1929, and substantially drier than usual, it followed the wettest February ever recorded. Storms Ciara and Dennis battered many regions of the UK in the early and middle of the month, causing widespread flooding, followed by Storm Jorge at the end.The ground was already wet in many areas, after a sodden winter, and the further downpours seen in February left many farmers unable to plant seeds and a poor start to the growing season for many. All of that was followed by a dry spring that meant germination was difficult and in many places delayed, Bradshaw told the .While there are unlikely to be any problems importing grain, as harvests have held up in other parts of the world, for many farmers it means a difficult end to the year after the disruptions of lockdown.Some grain farmers face an additional pressure: if the UK leaves the EU without a deal at the end of the year, a tariff regime would spell disaster for farm exports. For that reason, many will want to sell their barley crop before the end of December, which may mean having to accept lower prices.“We have a known export market now, but there are then unknowns beyond January,” said Bradshaw.The lockdown affected some sectors far more than others. Dairy farmers were forced to throw away fresh milk that could not be collected, as the catering trade came to an abrupt halt and supply chains could not be immediately remodelled to redirect the production to retailers.People eating all their meals at home ate differently than they would normally: the milky cappuccinos and lattes demanded from coffee shops were out, and the steaks ordered in restaurants gave way to thrifty ways with mince at home. The latter caused particular headaches for meat producers, as normally they strive to “balance” the carcass between expensive and cheap cuts.Potato farmers saw farmgate prices halve, as the chip shop and catering trade disappeared overnight. Many farmers sought out innovative ways to market, from veg boxes to vending machines.Meanwhile, farmers who had ersified into offering accommodation and tourism, with children’s play areas or farm visits – as successive governments had encouraged them to do – have had a seesaw year. That side of their business broke down completely as lockdown prevented travel, but they are enjoying a late resurgence with staycations favoured over foreign trips.While the lockdown was a temporary measure, in the longer term farmers were being forced to grapple with the impact of the climate crisis, said Bradshaw. “What we are seeing is more extremes of weather,” he said. “Dry and wet weather seem to get stuck in patterns.”He pointed to the long drought of 2018, which made growing conditions difficult and left many farmers with a severe shortage of fodder for livestock. Last year, a wet autumn drenched the soil and caused flooding in many areas, destroying or delaying crops across the country.Aidan McGivern, a meteorologist at the Met Office, confirmed that the UK was experiencing a changing climate, with warmer and wetter winters, and rainfall coming in heavier bursts during summers. He said the season of summer thunderstorms – like those currently seen in the southern half of the country - was likely to extend in future from spring to autumn, and heatwaves would become more common.“When we experience a summer heatwave, it is more extreme than in the past,” added Mark McCarthy, the head of the National Climate Information Centre at the Met Office. “Climate change also increases the intensity of rain fall during the summer months, and heatwaves are followed by convective downpours. The challenge is knowing how to manage that.”In future, farmers might have to look at growing different crops, said Bradshaw. Maize and even soya beans might become an option, where previously they were rarely seen in the UK.Farmers were also looking to improve their own land management to account for a more variable climate, he added. “There has been more focus on soils, how they can store more water to be more resilient,” he said. “And we are looking at more spring crops to spread the risk across the year.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44dfbdeeb512fa3e4973027014dd2e9c259cd1b9/0_457_4580_2747/master/4580.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3ba267b842f82299f97ba8689996a019","title":"nigel slaters work from home lunch recipes","story":"Get away from your desk to enjoy pastrami sandwiches, crispy-fried kefir chicken, and raspberry burrata focacciaI work from home, but I refuse to eat at my desk. It is one of those small rules of life I have upheld for as long as I can remember. Lunch neither refreshes nor recharges unless I am several feet from my place of work. Even if this, often the shortest of all meals, only takes 10 minutes, I always move to another room to enjoy it.It is all too easy not to stop for a break. To pick at something as you type or talk. But I believe we should stop, even if just for a few minutes. It is crucial for our wellbeing and probably good for our work too.OK, I need little excuse for a bite to eat. A sandwich perhaps, a hastily thrown together fridge-raid piled on a piece of thick bread. As such it is fine, but I think we can do better. You can toss a few prawns in a quickly made marinade, or some pieces of chicken into a bowl of buttermilk, and they can sit calmly doing their thing, until you are ready to cook. The hard part is partially done by the marinade as you work.The prawns can be grilled or fried in a wok, they can be wrapped in lettuce and eaten in the hand or tossed into a deep bowl of noodles. That chicken, now tender and ready for you, can be dipped into paprika-seasoned flour and fried, and eaten hot or given time to rest. I also think such a recipe works cold, each piece of crumbed chicken dipped into a bowl of mayonnaise.The sandwich can be a classic affair of pastrami on rye spread with cream cheese and cucumber. But it could also be something new, like the one I made with focaccia dipped in maple syrup, toasted and topped with berries.With the clock ticking, it is unlikely lunch will be a drawn-out affair. But it will, in my house at least, be taken away from the desk. I shall not share my lunch with my laptop.I have a fondness for the cardboard-wrapped delights of the takeaway sandwich shop. Those layers of soft bread and peeping fillings have more appeal to me than that of simply convenience. At home I am more likely to make an open sandwich, adding a curl of smoked salmon or a fold of ham or whatever comes to hand in the fridge. What appeals to me is having something more interesting than butter or mayonnaise to spread on the bread. Ricotta with mint and chopped radish a spicy apple chutney stirred through mayonnaise grated beetroot folded though cream cheese with poppy seeds and a sprinkle of cider vinegar, perhaps.For an open sandwich of pastrami I made a spread of cream cheese and grated cucumber. I could have added chopped gherkins and capers too. If mascarpone isn’t around, try ricotta or a full-fat cream cheese.Such a recipe, light, well-seasoned and spreadable, is suitable as a dip too. A bowl of soft cheese and herbs in which to dip a freshly picked, pencil-thin carrot or a blistered curl of pork crackling.Makes 6 small open sandwichescucumber 300gdill a small bunchmascarpone 250ggrain mustard 2 tbspsalt and pepper to tasteradishes 8dark rye bread 6 thin slicespastrami 200g, thin slicesSlice the cucumber in half lengthways and scoop out the seeds with a teaspoon. Coarsely grate the cucumber, place in a sieve balanced over a bowl and leave for 15 minutes.Finely chop the dill. Put the mascarpone in a bowl, add the dill, mustard, salt and pepper and mix briefly. Slice the radishes into rounds.Squeeze the grated cucumber with your hands to remove much of the water, then stir the cucumber into the mascarpone. Spread this thickly onto the slices of rye bread, then lay a slice of pastrami on to each one. Add a few radishes and a twist of ground pepper.I like having something partially prepared, waiting calmly until I’m ready to take a break from work. Chicken, soaking in a marinade, will sit quietly in the fridge until you feel like tossing it in seasoned flour and frying it till the inside is juicy, the skin crisp as ice. I make a batch, eating some hot and setting the rest aside to eat cold. Chicken, marinated in buttermilk, is an American classic, but buttermilk is less than easy to find. Thwarted once again, but with my mind set on fried chicken, I decided to use kefir. The resulting batter was light, crisp and deliciously fragile. Blessed with the same tang as the traditional recipe, I would do it again. Kefir is certainly easier to track down than buttermilk nowadays. (If neither can be found, you could add a squeeze of lemon juice to a tub of natural, unstrained yogurt.)The chicken can marinate overnight. The flouring and frying and subsequent baking will take 45 minutes. You can have most of the chicken for dinner and keep a couple of pieces back for lunch the following day. I make a salad of shredded white cabbage to go with this, seasoning it lightly with white wine vinegar and dill while the chicken crisps. We used large free-range thighs, finishing them in the oven to cook them right through, keeping the batter crisp. This has the advantage of making them less greasy too. If you have small chicken thighs, then you may find they are cooked after the initial deep frying. Keep the oil at 170C-180C and check carefully that the chicken is thoroughly cooked to the bone.Serves 3chicken thighs 6, bone in, skin onkefir 500mlgarlic 4 clovesolive oil 3 tbsprosemary leaves 1 tbspsea salt 2 tbspsunflower or groundnut oil about 200mlplain flour 150gsmoked paprika 2 tspground chilli 2 tspred or orange peppers 2, largePut the chicken thighs into a deep bowl and pour the kefir over them. Roll the thighs over to completely coat them, then cover and place in a fridge for anything up to 24 hours.Peel and thinly slice the garlic, warm the olive oil in a sauté pan, then add the garlic and fry for 3 or 4 minutes till it starts to colour, then add the rosemary and continue cooking for 1 minute. Lift the garlic and rosemary out with a draining spoon and drain on kitchen paper. Add the sea salt and wipe the pan clean.Set the oven at 160C fangas mark 4. Warm two-thirds of the sunflower or groundnut oil in the pan to come halfway up the thighs. Put the flour into a shallow bowl and season with the smoked paprika and ground chilli. Remove the thighs from the marinade and press into the seasoned flour, making sure it clings generously to each piece. Lower each piece into the hot oil, no more than three in the pan at once. The oil should fizz and bubble immediately.Fry the chicken for about 4 minutes until the underside is golden, then turn carefully and cook the other side. Secure a rack or cooling tray over a roasting tin. Lift each piece of chicken from the pan with a draining spoon and place on the rack. Continue frying the remaining chicken, then place the chicken in the oven for 25 minutes till deep golden and cooked right through to the bone.Cut the peppers in half and remove the seeds and core. Warm the remaining oil in a sauté pan, add the peppers and fry them for about 10 minutes till soft and giving. Lift out, set aside and discard the oil. Lay the peppers on a serving dish then place the chicken on top and season with the salt and garlic mixture.If you toss together a marinade in the morning, your seafood, meat or vegetables can steep quietly while you work.We did this with prawns this week, letting them sit in a mixture of fish sauce, mirin, vinegar and lime juice. I could have thrown a handful of them on the grill and stuffed them into a soft, flour-dusted bun with some curls of cos lettuce, but used them instead to liven up a bowl of noodles.A marinade has often done its work once the meat or fish is removed. This time, the liquid was simmered down to a few spoonfuls, which we used to dress the transparent angel hair noodles and green herbs. I used mint and coriander but also basil. I’m growing a pot of Thai basil at the moment, so a handful of its purple-stained leaves went in as well.Serves 2For the marinadefish sauce 2 tbspmirin 2 tbsprice vinegar 1 tbsplime juice 100ml (about 2 limes)red chilli 1, medium raw prawns 16For the noodlescucumber 100gmint leaves 12coriander a handfulangel hair noodles 100ggroundnut oil 2 tbspCombine the fish sauce, mirin, rice vinegar and lime juice in a medium-sized mixing bowl.

Cut the cucumber into short lengths and then into large matchstick-sized pieces, then put them in a bowl with the mint leaves and coriander.Put the noodles in a heatproof bowl, pour a kettle of boiling water over them and set aside while you cook the prawns.Warm the groundnut oil in a shallow pan. When it starts to sizzle, add the prawns and let them cook for 2 minutes. Remove the prawns, then pour in the marinade and leave it to bubble for a couple of minutes until it has reduced by about half.Drain the noodles and add to the cucumber and herbs. Add the prawns, then the marinade and toss everything together.Of all the useful things to have around for a casual lunch, a bowl of aubergine puree takes first prize in my house. A spread for warm flatbread the heart of a pasta sauce a condiment for grilled lamb cutlets or something in which to fold chopped tomatoes, coriander leaves and fried onions.You bake an aubergine or two, scoop out the silken, honey-coloured flesh within, and mash it with a fork. It is a blank – though delicious – canvas to which you can add your own seasonings. For which, read: a drop or two of olive oil, a fistful of mint, some pomegranate seeds or a scattering of toasted sunflower and pumpkin seeds. Shredded basil and a crumbled block of feta chopped cherry tomatoes and sautéed courgettes brandy soaked golden sultanas and soft fried onions are all good too.A roasting tin of aubergines takes about an hour to cook to melting softness. It’s a quick task to slit the skins open and scoop out the centre with a spoon. And there it can stay, in a bowl in the fridge, until you are ready. This time, we used it as a spread for toasted baguettes, scattering the surface with crisp, spiced chickpeas and a handful of toasted seeds.Serves 4aubergines 3 mediumolive oil 4 tbspgarlic 1 headchickpeas 500g, tinned or bottledras el hanout 3 tsptomatoes 200g, assortedbaguette 1 largeFor the toppingpumpkin seeds 1 tbspsesame seeds 1 tbspsunflower seeds 1 tbspdried thyme 2 tspsea salt 1 tspSet the oven at 180C fangas mark 6. Put the aubergines in a roasting tin, pour over the olive oil, then tuck the head of garlic among them. Bake for about 35 minutes then remove the head of garlic and continue cooking the aubergines for another 30 minutes or until they are completely soft.Separate the head of garlic into cloves then squeeze each one in turn to remove the soft, creamy flesh within.Remove the aubergines from the oven, break them open and scoop out the soft centre of each into a bowl and discard the skins. Reserve the oil in the roasting tin. Stir the garlic cream into the aubergine.Rinse the chickpeas and add them to the reserved aubergine oil in the roasting tin. Stir in the ras el hanout, then bake for 20 minutes, till the chickpeas are sizzling.Finely dice the tomatoes. Remove the chickpeas from the oven and mix with the tomatoes.In a dry, shallow pan, toast the pumpkin, sesame and sunflower seeds for 5 minutes or so over a moderate heat till fragrant, shaking the pan regularly as they cook. Add the thyme and salt, then set aside.Split the baguette in half lengthways, then cut each half into two pieces. Toast the cut sides. Spread the aubergine mixture over the toasted surfaces, top with the chickpea and tomato mixture, then finally the toasted seeds.I am not sure whether this is sweet or savoury – or even if it matters. The idea was inspired by the classic treatment of sheep’s cheese, apricots and honey I have eaten all over Greece and the Middle East. Soaking the bread in honey (I have used maple syrup too) produces simply gorgeous toast: deep gold and crisp on the outside, saturated with syrup within. You should probably make sure it’s a plain or herb version rather than one studded with olives or sun-dried tomatoes. If you have no raspberries, use apricots or blackberries, or, as I did the other afternoon, deep red cherries.Cut the focaccia in half horizontally and then into 4 squares. Put them on a baking sheet, cut side uppermost, and trickle with the maple syrup or honey. Place under a heated overhead grill for 8 minutes or so, until they are golden and lightly crisp.Break or slice the burrata and ide between the focaccia, then cover each with raspberries. Dust the surface with ground pistachios and serve.

Every time it caught my eye, which was often, I admired it, then thought “must-put-in-fridge-before-it-wrinkles”. It had started to wrinkle by the time it reached the fridge. I also suspected a soft spot, which I hoped would go away in the fridge drawer. Strangely, it did not go away, and the next day I picked up the pepper and put my thumb through its side. Fresh, bloat, active decay, advanced decay, dry: the five stages of decomposition, one of the few things I remember from biology lessons at school. They are the stages of vertebrate animal decomposition, I know (I feel them all), but surely they can be applied to fruit and vegetables, too? As hard as I try to be vigilant, I usually have something at all five stages of decomposition in my kitchen, especially at this time of year, when the window between firm and ripe with a halo of fruit flies is not a big one. Tomatoes, apricots and peaches are the trickiest: the kitchen counter in August is a sort of incubator, but the fridge numbs out flavour, and in the case of tomatoes alters their flesh so you get that soft, mealy texture when they’re brought back to room temperature. Again, I feel this. I also know the red pepper should never have been in the fruit bowl it was careless, and now here I am with my thumb inside a soft, gaping hole.Active decay requires action. “It won’t hurt you, Just wash or scrape it off, cut it off or out.” I’m glad to have learned these lessons young from every woman in my family, and to have had them fortified by Vincenzo, who is his grandmother’s grandson and even more ruthless than me – only not as careless. Cutting off the rotten bit felt like amends for my carelessness. As did slicing what was left and cooking it slowly in olive oil with sliced red onion and, after a while, ene, then treating it all to a handful of pine nuts, currants, sugar and vinegar for what turned out to be a Sicilian-tasting sweet-and sour-mixture to have with potatoes.I have used ene, escarole and romano lettuce in this dish, and they all worked beautifully, wilting down into floppy rags but retaining their sturdy midribs. I’m sure rocket or radicchio would work, too. The thing to remember is to let the onions and peppers cook until they have lost their raw, sunny crunch and softened completely. This takes time, so don’t rush or be afraid to let the edges of the peppers and onions catch ever so slightly: in this, you catch flavour. It turns out that slightly wrinkled peppers actually do this more effectively and willingly than fresh, muscly ones.Not that I am advocating carelessness or decomposing vegetables: simply noting that if you did happen to encounter active decay, use it to your advantage: sweet and sour.2 red onions1 large red pepper6 tbsp olive oil1 garlic clove1 pinch red chilli flakes1 tbsp pine nuts or chopped almonds1 tbsp currants (optional)1 tbsp sugar1 tbsp red wine vinegar1 small head ene or lettuce, cut into thick ribbons800g waxy potatoesPeel and halve the onion, then cut it lengthways into slender new moons.

But he could help solve a problem for Spurs as, under Premier League rules, clubs must name at least eight homegrown players in their 25-man squad and his English nationality would fill a slot.If he wins the race to be Lloris’s understudy there will almost certainly be game time for him as Spurs face a hectic schedule in the opening weeks of the season.

The team may have finished second in Primera Iberdrola but they were nine points behind Barcelona and failed to reach the Copa de la Reina quarter-finals for the first time since 2012.Having had three different coaches during the 2019-20 season, Atlético Madrid hashave been unstable and unreliable. First, the coach Sánchez Vera surprisingly left in October. Pablo López was appointed as his successor and although he managed to taketook them into the last eight of the women’s Champions League for the first time, his contract was terminated in January following a spell in which Atléti drew four out of seven games.So now they are preparing for the WCL quarter-final with a coach, Dani González, who has been in charge for only seven games. He has a lot of new players at his disposal, so their playing style and formation under him is still a bit of a mystery.Sánchez Vera was happy for his team to sit back and soak up pressure while Pablo López’s team focused more on possession, which is something Dani González favours too. “I’m discovering other ways of working with him,” the goalkeeper Pauline Peyraud-Magnin told L’Équipière last month. “We’re really working on the Spanish game: the passing, the possession. There’s also a lot of physical work.”The team has changed a lot in the past few months. In May, the Spanish international Virginia Torrecilla discovered she had a brain tumour and began treatment. Nine players, including several previous starters, also left the club during the summer.There are also concerns over whether they will actually even be able to play their quarter-final against Barcelona on Friday after five players tested positive for Covid-19 last week and they had to cancel all training sessions. Uefa has said they will need a minimum of 13 players, including one goalkeeper, to play.This Atlético looks very different from the one that finished nine points away from Barcelona in March. Some high-profile players have left, including the goalkeepers Lola Gallardo and Sari van Veenendaal as well as Kenti Robles and Elena Linari, but the club have acted to sign good replacements.Hedvig Lindlahl and Pauline Peyraud-Magnin are an extremely strong goalkeeping duo while Meryl van Dongen and Alia Guagni will both add depth to the defence. Turid Knaak, Emelyne Laurent and Grace Kazadi have all arrived to bring new energy to Atléti’s attack.Dani González did not have much time to shape the team to his own possession-based playing style before the coronavirus outbreak. González, who played for the men’s team in 1995-96, has been part of the club’s staff since 2010. In June, the club renewed his contract until 2021. “The goals for this season are to continue to grow as an organisation and to solidify a way of working that allows us to reach an optimum level in all the competitions,” he said when he extended his contract.During the last three years, Ángela Sosa has scored 27 goals and in the 2018-19 she was won the league’s MVP title. Surprisingly, her performances were not enough to be included in Spain’s Women’s World Cup squad. She has great vision and an eye for goal, but there are rumours of her leaving the club, and her participation in the last eight is not yet guaranteed.During the coronavirus crisis Atlético’s Silvia Meseguer, who is about to finish her medicine degree, volunteered to help at Madrid’s temporary hospital, IFEMA. Meseguer has been trying to balance her education and football career for years and last season she retired from the Spanish national team to be able to focus more on her medical career.Leicy Santos joined on a loan from Santa Fe at the beginning of the season. Although she has only played 170 minutes in the WCL, she has proven to be the team’s best signing this year and a key part of Atléti’s midfield. This summer, the club signed her permanently on a contract until 2024.Barcelona are the favourites in the quarter-finals, even more so after Atlético had to suspend training due to the Covid-19 cases, but their new signings also make this team unpredictable. But even if they would get past Barça then Wolfsburg – who should defeat Glasgow City comfortably – are likely to be too strong. The German side have already beaten Atlético twice in this competition, making it hard for the Colchoneras to dream beyond the semi-finals.This is Atlético’s fourth participation in the Women’s Champions League and the very first time they have qualified for the quarter-finals. They have been knocked out in the Round of 32 once by Wolfsburg (in 2017-18), and in the Round of 16 twice, by Lyon in 2015-16, and Wolfsburg in 2018-19."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af6c87fc6fc77e39d7e99c2b3028fdbeb083e568/195_58_3074_1844/master/3074.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2951b66e10e145594d3b85df1302041f","title":"coronavirus lockdown surge puppy ownership uk","story":"Kennel Club finds many new puppy owners missed ‘red flags’ because of lack of researchEvery festive season, households across the UK are reminded that “a dog is life, not just for Christmas”. But as dog lovers rushed to buy new puppies during the coronavirus lockdown, many seemed to ignore this advice, and bought dogs having done little research – or even without meeting the animal beforehand.According to research by the Kennel Club, the coronavirus crisis has led to a surge in puppy ownership across the UK.However, a quarter of new owners admitted they bought their dog after doing little research, with one in four pandemic puppy owners saying they might inadvertently have bought their pet from a puppy farm.Meanwhile, Cats Protection said it had also noticed a rise in demand for cats since May. The charity has rehomed about 2,400 cats since it began its new “hands-free homing” process during lockdown. In response to the findings, the Kennel Club has launched a #BePuppyWise campaign urging people to take time and do proper research before purchasing their dog.Bill Lambert, head of health and welfare at the Kennel Club, said: “Our dogs are certainly helping us through the pandemic, providing a welcome and happy distraction as Covid-19 causes anxiety, suffering and disruption across the nation.“However, we do have concerns about those puppies which may have been bought on impulse, without owners doing their homework on how or where to get a dog responsibly, or fully realising a puppy is a new family member for life, not a short-term commodity.”Battersea Dogs and Cats Home has also warned about the risks of buying a puppy without doing proper research. Its chief executive, Claire Horton, said: “Battersea sadly knows all too well the pain caused by the cruel puppy trade – both the suffering endured by the animals involved and the heartbreak their new owners feel – as we and rescue centres across the country are forced to pick up the pieces.“We know nobody buys a pet with the intention of hurting an animal, but purchasing puppies and kittens online often does just that. The pet they receive at the end of this buying chain may be incredibly unwell, underage for sale and under-socialised due to the conditions in which they were bred, leaving owners confused, distressed, disappointed and usually significantly out of pocket.”Jacqui Cuff, Cats Protection’s head of advocacy and government relations, urged cat buyers to be aware that a surge in demand creates the ideal conditions for unscrupulous sellers who put profit before welfare.“These profit-driven sellers may be selling kittens which are sick or too young to be separated from their mothers, which can lead to high vet bills. Sadly, some kittens bred in poor conditions may not survive, which can be incredibly distressing for their new owner.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df1f6cae4aa30ad66dae5f17aa41a79fccca8945/0_187_1368_821/master/1368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=24da72c75293e2b5ba43b34aa824b61f","title":"how we met he just grabbed me and gave me a big snog","story":"Lynn and Kim Davies, 53 and 54, found love on stage after their characters shared a kiss. They live together in a small Worcestershire villageLynn Davies moved to Worcestershire from Bristol in October 1999, trading in city life for a country village. “I was working as a freelance television writer. I wanted the chance to explore a rural lifestyle and find a real community,” he says. He had only been there for a few days, when a shopkeeper suggested he go to the village hall for a drama club meeting. He didn’t realise until he got there that it was an audition for a play.When he arrived, he spotted Kim Cresswell, who worked as a housekeeper at a country estate and had joined the group to meet new people. “I thought she was striking. But I couldn’t start chatting someone up the minute I’d arrived.” He submitted a form to join the group, and Kim noticed that he had trained at Lamda, the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art. “I thought: ‘Right, we’re having him. We won’t see anything like that in this village again.’”Before they knew it, they had both been cast in the play. “I’m not sure we’d even exchanged names before we had to rehearse this scene together,” Lynn recalls. It was a romantic scene, where the characters kissed. “He just grabbed me and gave me a big snog,” laughs Kim. “The characters clearly liked each other so I figured we should probably do it properly,” Lynn adds.Later that evening, there was a party and the pair got chatting. They snuck into the village hall kitchen to share a bottle of wine. “I knew by the end of the evening that I was going to marry him,” says Kim. “I told my best friend and she said I was utterly mad. I had to take him to see her so she could make sure he was good enough.” Luckily, Lynn aced the interview.The couple took things slowly over Christmas and began dating properly in the new year. By March 2000, Lynn had moved into Kim’s house, where she lived with her five-year-old daughter from a previous relationship. “They adored each other from the start. On one of the first nights he put her to bed, I remember them getting out her drum kit. I had to laugh,” Kim says.They married in September that year on Iona, a remote island in Scotland. “Lynn suggested it and I thought: ‘Why not?’ It was organised over the phone.” They didn’t tell anyone about the wedding, but persuaded the local vicar and his daughter to travel up to perform the ceremony. “We asked the landlady and landlord of the bed and breakfast we stayed at to be our witnesses. It was just us, them and a tourist who was visiting the church at the time,” says Lynn.They took pictures on the beach before heading out for a meal together. “We wanted a small private wedding and Iona is an incredibly spiritual place,” says Lynn. Kim trusted his judgment. “I’d never been on any adventures before we met and now we’ve had so many.”The couple say they complement each other well. “I’m a country mouse and he’s a town mouse,” Kim says. “I’ve introduced him to all the community activities he came looking for, and he holds my hand when we go to the city.”Over the years, they have been involved in many small productions, from village plays to special events like the local asparagus festival. Although they don’t perform together as much now, they still share a love for drama. “We go out to different historical sites and always end up raiding the dressing-up box,” says Kim. “We just enjoy taking silly pictures and having fun together.” They also try to travel to Iona every year for their anniversary.Lynn supported her recent career change, and Kim now works for a mental health crisis line. “He makes me laugh all the time,” says Kim. “And I’ve learnt more from him than I ever did at school. He’s pushed me to be better and I owe him a lot.” Lynn describes his wife as the most thoughtful person he has ever met. “She’s the only thing that keeps me sane. We don’t have to do anything to be happy together.”• Want to share your story?

It’s been a sanctuary to return to from countless trips around the region, a place where the rigours, and sometimes dangers, of Iraq, Syria, Libya and elsewhere could be set aside for a while.In Lebanon, I could get things done. For all its faults, it’s a can-do place, where resourcefulness has got its people through. And it’s needed to be. Almost nothing works as it’s supposed to here: just getting by requires the spirit of an entrepreneur and a handyman.Few of the things we would take for granted elsewhere – electricity, clean water, waste disposal, the internet – are a given here. I’ve become proficient at each, just as I have in overlooking the country’s profound flaws. The dysfunction that underwrites Lebanon is part of the pact of living here. But no one could have guessed that it would end up destroying Beirut – literally.The explosion that thundered through the city on 4 August was clearly not normal. Since the end of the civil war, there had only been a few explosions here – car bombs that assassinated people. But this cataclysmic event was of a different magnitude. Whole streets of buildings were wrecked the closer to the port, the greater the chaos. I’d experienced explosions in Baghdad, Aleppo, Gaza, Mosul and southern Lebanon, but always during war and never on this scale. What on earth had just happened?As the dust cleared that fateful night, as the cascading of glass from high-rise towers slowed, the panicked aftermath of the blast turned to cold anger this had probably been very preventable. It wasn’t a hostile act, but a disaster borne of staggering incompetence and indifference to the welfare of the city’s residents.Nearly 3,000 tonnes of ammonium nitrate, one of the more lethal explosive compounds, had been stored in a shed at the entrance to town for six years. Within days of the blast, we learned that fireworks had been kept in the same shed, and a welder may have started a fire that ignited it all.The chain of events was unfathomable, as was the sheer scale of the damage. All the places where my formative memories of Beirut took shape were destroyed. Many of the people who helped shape them were wounded, some of them badly. I’ve made a career in the Middle East trying to keep a dispassionate distance from the events I’ve covered and people I’ve met. But that nominal barrier didn’t apply this time. This was personal.Everything that had blighted Lebanon – the corruption and incompetence of its leaders, the indifference of officials, nepotism, non-state actors, the widespread abuse of power – had come together in an apocalyptic storm that had shocked the world. How on earth could it have been allowed to happen?More than a week later, a broken city is still wrestling with the aftermath, as it is with the truly existential question of whether a functioning country can emerge from the ruins. Paying for the damage is beyond the capability of a bankrupt state already brought to its knees by three decades of industrial-scale corruption.International aid will help with the first stages of recovery. Life will go on for the Lebanese who decide to stay, or can’t leave. But what sort of an existence will it be here? If this isn’t the impetus to put the state on a more credible and sovereign footing, could anything succeed in turning things around?My house is repaired (I was 1.2 miles from the centre of the explosion), as are those of friends and colleagues who were closer to the port. If there is a “normal” left in Lebanon, I’m somewhere near it. But life here is unsettling now, more so than at any point in Lebanese history this is the moment of reckoning.I moved to Istanbul from Beirut 18 months ago, and I’ve been back a few times since. Every trip it’s been obvious how quickly Lebanon is sinking into intense poverty because of the financial crisis. It’s been sad to watch it unfold from afar. I was actually supposed to be travelling to Beirut for the first time since Covid-19 lockdowns lifted the week of the explosion anyway, and had already braced myself to see a much changed country. I didn’t expect to be frantically making phone calls and sending messages to check on the whereabouts of friends in the aftermath of one of the most powerful explosions ever recorded.When you’re flying into Beirut, one of the easiest landmarks to spot from the plane is the port, with its giant grain silos towering over the eastern, Christian side of the city. I used to use it as a marker to figure out where my old apartment was from the air. The night after the explosion, the whole docks area was ablaze with rescue teams’ floodlights, and the hipster-ish neighbourhood of Mar Mikhaël behind it – my old home – lay in total darkness. It was surreal.It truly is difficult to comprehend the scale of this disaster. A friend showed me the remains of his flat and I couldn’t understand how he was still alive. The first apartment I lived in in Beirut, 900 metres from the port, was blown to smithereens. Luckily, my elderly neighbours were not home at the time.The speed with which teams of volunteers from all over the country mobilised to help those whose homes were affected is a true testament to the kindness and generosity of ordinary Lebanese people. Their dedication to helping out neighbours and strangers alike stands in stark contrast to the non-existent clean-up effort from the state. More than once I saw groups of police and soldiers standing by, looking on as citizens did all the work.One thing that will probably stick with me – and all Beirutis – forever is the sound of broken glass, absolutely everywhere, all the time: falling from tower blocks and skyscrapers being swept or bulldozed out of half a city crunching under your shoes like fresh snow.It’s one thing to report in war zones and dangerous places when you’ve made careful calculations about risk and you know what to expect when you arrive. Scenes of devastation akin to Syria or Iraq in a place you considered as home, and as safe, is heartbreaking in a different way. The people of Lebanon deserve so much better."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebabed6cfcc4961c57e89782b68ef577a5d5c522/0_33_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c9bd827cc8c5e361ba8f2a6e873e9bed","title":"housing market has busiest month in more than 10 years","story":"The pandemic has ‘rewritten the rulebook’ as pent-up demand boosts the market, says RightmoveThe housing market has had its busiest month in more than 10 years in July, with the traditional summer lull replaced by a flurry of activity from buyers and sellers, according to the property website Rightmove.Would-be sellers were also active, with more properties coming on to the market than in any month since 2008.The housing market was closed in lockdown and reopened in mid-May, sparking a flurry of activity. July brought a stamp duty holiday on homes costing up to £500,000 in England and £250,000 in Wales and Scotland, which further fuelled activity.Last week figures from the UK’s largest estate agency firm, Countrywide, showed that demand for homes costing between £500,000 and £750,000 had soared since the tax break was announced, and Rightmove’s figures suggest a similar effect for other agents.Miles Shipside, a Rightmove director, said: “There have been many changes as a result of the unprecedented pandemic, and these include a rewriting of the previously predictable seasonal rulebook for housing market activity and prices.”He added: “Rather than just a release of existing pent-up demand due to the suspension of the housing market during lockdown, there’s an added layer of additional demand due to people’s changed housing priorities after the experience of lockdown.”The demand for homes has put pressure on lenders and conveyancing which, under social distancing rules, are often operating below their usual capacity.Shipside said: “Patience will be required, especially with some lenders limiting their product ranges due to capacity constraints in their ability to process mortgages.”At the end of last month Nationwide building society warned of a “false dawn” in the housing market after reporting a price jump in July.It said that as the furlough scheme unwinds there could be more job losses, which would dampen activity again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c99631b9ee2b1771186b57871aa687bf605a50a1/0_185_5567_3342/master/5567.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=167389972a232fb98a0ab966826338ca","title":"florences classical regeneration how an outdoor music festival thought big under lockdown","story":"The team behind the Italian city’s New Generation festival needed a larger stage if they were to host a socially distanced event – so they created one in the famous Boboli GardensRoger Granville, Max Fane and Frankie Parham are not men to let a worldwide pandemic get in their way. Plans for the fourth New Generation festival in Florence were well underway when Covid-19 shut down Italy, then the rest of Europe and beyond. All of Europe’s summer festivals were cancelled, many reinventing themselves digitally, streaming live or prerecorded concerts. Some have been able to stage events outdoors for a reduced audience with strict social distancing measures in place. The New Generation festival decided to do both.“Throughout March and April we were constantly coming up with all kinds of contingency plans. We were determined to find a way to put something on,” says Granville, one of the British trio behind the summer festival.Now in its fourth year, New Generation (so named because of its commitment to emerging talent) has previously taken place in the magnificent private gardens of the 17th-century Palazzo Corsini. “We looked into what it would mean to build a socially distanced theatre there and it became clear the gardens weren’t big enough given all the health security we needed and the distancing.” So they looked for other outdoor venues within the city, and decided that the Boboli Gardens – next to the Pitti Palace – would work. On the basis that if you don’t ask you don’t get, they approached Eike Schmidt, director of the Uffizi Gallery (which is also responsible for the historic gardens) to see if they could build a large stage outside and host a four-day festival there.“Amazingly, he said yes immediately, and that he was a big fan of what we were doing at the Corsini Palace. And so here we are,” says Granville. The festival has been renamed Re-Generation, and a temporary theatre constructed that, were it at normal capacity, would seat around 1,500, but for the late August event will house only 500. “It’s absolutely enormous. Similar dimensions to the Bolshoi in Moscow,” says Granville. Enormous, too, was the paperwork required. “The permissions stage was about 7,000 pages worth … I’m not exaggerating. Italians love a bit of paperwork. Every single thing has to be submitted and approved.”Temperature checks on arrival and mandatory masks will add to the new normal of live events, and performers too will be distanced. (“We’ve got markings everywhere to the nearest centimetre.”) The festival’s new opera production of Rossini’s Cenerentola has likewise been specially staged. Luckily, it’s not much of a stretch to imagine the Ugly Sisters keeping their distance from Cinderella, Granville says with a laugh.Another major change to this year means that tickets for every show will be free. In previous years prices have ranged from €35 to €250, and if the British holidaymakers who comprised a substantial part of the audience will be absent, the team expect local music lovers to join them in the Boboli theatre.In another first, every event across the four days will be live-streamed. This says Granville, costs an absolute fortune: “Not a single corporate partner came on board – and that wasn’t for the want of trying. All the money is from iniduals.” It felt important, he says, to reach as wide an audience as possible and send a message about how crucial the arts are to society, and, that “with patronage, with collaboration, with flexibility and creativity we can all look out for each other … and get people back on their feet.”Granville, 31, and his fellow producers Fane, 28, and Parham, 31, might come across as extras from a PG Wodehouse novel, but don’t be fooled. Their commitment and their phenomenal fundraising abilities are second to none. As well as the summer festival, they are opening a new opera school in Florence this autumn. Eight young singers and two répétiteurs will have nine months of masterclasses, language lessons, drama coaching and psychological training as well as performance opportunities. Sufficient funds have been raised to cover the fees the trio are hoping that in future they can offer funding for accommodation and maintenance costs as well. This year’s intake includes students from Poland to Puerto Rico, Swaziland to Scotland – fingers are crossed that all will be able to travel to Italy next month.Ralph Strehle, a German-born singer, academic, and former member of Germany’s under-16 national football team, heads the school. He believes sports psychology has much to offer singers, and speaks of the importance of pre- and post-performance routines, of learning to prepare for and focus on “winning” – whether in auditions or performances, and of focusing on developing muscular control and relaxation techniques. The 10 students won’t, however, be at the gym on a regime of press-ups and five-mile runs. We tend to suggest yoga and the Alexander technique, says Strehle, although developing stamina is, of course, crucial for a young singer.Students will have the opportunity to participate in each summer festival’s opera production, whether as covers or chorus members. This year, as well as Rossini’s Cenerentola, there’s a symphonic concert (Beethoven’s 7th), with Daniele Rustioni conducting the Italian Youth Orchestra, a jazz night and late-night events including pioneering Disklavier pianist Dan Tepfer, and Devotion, who Granville promises are “the Spice Girls of the 21st century, three of Britain’s best young drag queens, hugely musical, brilliant and funny”.The eclecticism testifies to the New Generation credo: all great music is great music, you’re allowed to love Beethoven as much as you love Beyoncé or Pink Floyd or Bach, as Granville puts it. “Live performance … of the utmost quality is what’s important,” says Fane. “Classical music doesn’t so much have an image problem as a huge messaging problem. I know everyone’s doing the best they possibly can in incredibly challenging situations, but I wish that the people with influence and power in the industry got around the table once a month and decided how to lobby government and how to lobby the public to argue the case for the existence of what we do.”Both emphasise that the arts are not a luxury but a necessity, especially in these times. “It is something like Beethoven’s Third Symphony that has you leaping out of bed in the morning and gets you going again,” says Granville, who hopes the festival will be watched far and wide and will prove inspirational, mobilising and galvanising. “It’s a festival to demonstrate the restorative power of the arts in the city of the Renaissance.”• ReGeneration festival streams live online at newgenerationfestival.organd from the Uffizi’s YouTube channel from 26-29 August.

He already awards annual “Stormzy scholarships” to two black students who attend the University of Cambridge, paying their tuition fees in full as well as providing a substantial grant to cover living expenses.The Black Heart Foundation was founded by Ric Lewis, the American-born boss of the Mayfair-based property investment fund Tristan Capital Partners, who holds joint US-UK citizenship.Lewis said his charity had already handed out 100 scholarships since 2013, while a fundraising round that aimed to bring in an extra £1m in the wake of the Black Lives Matter protests had almost hit its target before Stormzy decided to make his substantial gift.He said his organisation had been “invigorated” by the generosity of the Merky Foundation. “Their contribution is an amazing testament to their vision and commitment to higher and further education for ambitious, hardworking young people from the most under-resourced and under-represented communities in our society.

He explains how music gave him a voice – and what he wants to say nextIt’s a crisp December night in the heart of Taipei, and Freddy Lim is presiding over a campaign rally to remember. Flanked by his bandmates, and looking out over a 50,000-strong crowd, he steps to the front of the stage and lets out a guttural scream. Even without the CO2 cannons, video screens and orchestra at his back, or the facepaint daubed on his forehead, it’s an unlikely scene for a parliamentary candidate in the thick of a re-election campaign.“During the campaign I was so exhausted every day,” he remembers, looking back on the events of 21 December. The night’s rally-cum-concert has just been released for posterity as Taiwan Victory Live, his band Chthonic’s latest live album and concert film – as well as a document of his two vocations, metal and legislative politics, mid-collision. “But on stage, I felt like I’d been refreshed, like there were thousands of people at my back and I could do anything,” he grins.“Those people banging their heads and moshing, exchanging energy with you, they provide something very unique, deep in your soul, that can support you to keep going. I’m so happy we did it, because my team had debates over whether voters might have wanted their member of parliament to seem more serious. If I went back to being a metalhead, would it be a good image? But a lot of fans and supporters, after that concert, tried to mobilise campaigns to convince people to vote for me in my district. I don’t think any other kind of event can do that.” He held his seat.Since forming in 1995 with Freddy on lead vocals, Chthonic have become cultural ambassadors for Taiwan – its history, myths and struggles. China maintains that Taiwan is part of the People’s Republic of China: not a sovereign entity, but a rogue province that will one day be brought under its control. Acknowledging Taiwan’s independence, and risking reprisals from China, has therefore become awkward for other countries. As a result, Taiwan is excluded from the World Health Organisation and the United Nations, has official diplomatic ties with only 14 UN member states, and since emerging as a democracy in the late 1980s and early 90s, has faced internal tensions between pro-independence and pro-China factions.Releasing eight albums of uncompromising, category-defying metal and playing hallowed metal arenas such as Donington Park and Ozzfest, Chthonic have drawn lyrical themes from their country’s past, telling the stories of indigenous peoples and their mistreatment. It’s something that evolved naturally in Freddy’s life and writing, but gradually began to convey a real sense of responsibility.“During our teenage years we feel a lot of pressure from outside, and there are a lot of complicated emotions on the inside,” he says of what drew him to metal. “Through high school my parents got orced and I faced some difficulties within my family. Metal allowed me to relax and release what I was feeling. Later on I found metal bands who were not just expressing emotions but also had thoughts on issues like racism, conflicts between different ideologies, or were trying to uncover their country’s mythology and culture. When I formed Chthonic, I started to think more about what ideas the music could carry. And when that involves complicated issues about society, you have to do more, to contribute more.”He says events in the country’s history, such as the violent repression of the indigenous Seediq people by Japanese colonists in the 20th century, or the years between 1949 and 1987 that were spent under martial law (often referred to as the White Terror), “come with heavy burdens. When we read these stories, we feel a lot of deep emotions. I need to get the feelings they bring up out with music, or I’d explode, I think!”As Chthonic’s career progressed, the whole band became more and more heavily involved in championing human rights causes. Bassist Doris Yeh has been an eloquent spokesperson in the global metal press, turning a spotlight on everything from the Awakening Foundation, a group that combats gender-based discrimination and inequality in Taiwan, to Hong Kong’s pro-democracy Umbrella movement. And in 2007, the five-piece memorably hit the US on what they branded the “UNlimited Taiwan” tour, calling attention to Taiwan’s exclusion from international organisations such as the United Nations.“Before that time the Taiwanese government had tried to buy ads in the political columns and introduce what’s happened between Taiwan and China, and why Taiwan couldn’t be a member of those international organisations,” Lim remembers. “I don’t want to say that those ways have been useless, but they’ve put a limit on our imagination. With music, with movies, with more soft power, I think Taiwan can show different sides, and make people want to get involved.”Freddy was elected as chair of Amnesty International Taiwan, a post he held between 2010 and 2014. But after the Sunflower Movement brought a new wave of youth activism in the country, occupying the Legislative Yuan arm of parliament in protest against a trade pact that would bring the country more into alignment with China, he began to feel that standing on the outside was no longer enough. “I started to try and convince more people that they should get involved directly in politics to push their ideas. I hit a point where I thought: I can’t only be a supporter, I have to work with them.” He formed the New Power Party (NPP) and ran for office in 2015.After being elected as a member of Taiwan’s Legislative Yuan in 2016’s election as part of the fledgling NPP, running on a platform of social justice and support for Taiwanese independence, Freddy used his first term in office to champion progressive causes. The theme he comes back to most frequently is the importance of breaking an older generation’s stranglehold on political office.“Nowadays, the metabolism of politics of Taiwan is quite healthy. I can see a lot of young people getting involved or running for office. It makes our politics healthier and more erse.” He laughs. “For example, in politics when people mention me, they see me as part of the young generation. Come on, I’m 44!Choosing to run as an independent in search of his second term – part of a coalition of young independent candidates on the progressive end of Taiwanese politics, Democracy Frontline – Freddy was banking on that very generation stepping up and getting behind him. It seems to have worked. At the election this January, he won in a tight race against a representative of the traditionally conservative, pro-China Kuomintang party. “Mobilising young people and working together, across party lines – it’s very important. This is the right place for me.”Now, Freddy’s two worlds are coming together again in his new podcast with Emily Y Wu, Metalhead Politics. He views it as a forum for publicising Taiwanese political issues worldwide (particularly the country’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic) while also serving as a launch-pad for new material from Chthonic.“We’re discussing how, maybe instead of albums, we should write more singles and release them once in a while,” he muses. “We don’t play live too much, maybe once a year in Taiwan only. If we can write some new songs or produce the concerts well with some unique ideas, we can put them online so fans anywhere can also enjoy the shows and new music. It’s important to get people listening to what’s going on here – whether they’re metalheads or not.”• Chthonic’s album Taiwan Victory Live, and episodes of Freddy Lim’s podcast Metalhead Politics, are both available now."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e36d7913fcd873c8826dd7edf4ae5ce8177b7d29/0_47_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bdfce486aa2225e279418fc8cb26cf4f","title":"labour insists tory mp accused of should not return to commons","story":"Labour had called for the former minister to be suspended after his bail date was extendedThe Conservative former minister arrested on suspicion of rape has agreed not to return to work at Westminster next month after his bail was extended to November, his party announced on Sunday.With the House of Commons summer recess due to end on 1 September, opposition parties had called for the MP to be suspended from parliament.Instead it is understood he has voluntarily agreed not to attend the House of Common, but will continue to represent his constituents from home. He will not have the party whip suspended while the police investigation continues.In a statement released on Sunday, a spokesperson for the Conservative whips’ office said: “These are serious allegations and it is right that they are investigated fully. A decision on the whip will be reviewed once the police investigation has been concluded.”The accused MP, who has not been named, was taken into custody in east London on 1 August and subsequently released while investigations are carried out. The complainant, a former parliamentary aide, reported four incidents alleged to have taken place between July 2019 and January 2020 in Westminster, Lambeth and Hackney. She alleges that the MP assaulted her, forced her to have sex, and left her so traumatised that she had to go to hospital.The Sunday Times reported that the allegations were first reported to the Conservative chief whip, Mark Spencer. It is understood Spencer does not believe a sexual assault was reported to him in his conversation with the complainant, but acknowledges that she reported “abusive behaviour and threats”. He advised her to go to the independent complaints and grievance scheme (ICGS). The alleged victim made her claims to the ICGS this year.Campaigners including the TUC and the Fawcett Society have called for parliamentary authorities to take action. “The House of Commons should be no different from any other workplace. Safety and the safeguarding of staff must be paramount. Failure to suspend is yet another example of minimising violence against women and girls and failure to believe victims and survivors when they bravely speak out,” they said.Jess Phillips, the shadow minister for domestic violence and safeguarding, said: “Safeguarding can’t be done by half measures. To suggest that there is no safeguarding risk through online contact with constituents shows a worrying lack of understanding of how abuse manifests.“This halfway house of allowing him to work from home is a product of the Conservatives failing to take fair, clear and decisive action over this very serious issue, and we should expect better from a party of government.”A statement from the politan police said: “A man in his 50s was arrested on Saturday 1 August 2020. His bail to return date has been extended to early November 2020. The investigation is being undertaken by the Met central specialist crime complex case team.”News of the former minister’s arrest emerged days after Charlie Elphicke, a former Conservative party whip and married father of two, became the first MP in a generation to be convicted of sexual assault.He was found guilty of three charges of sexual assault dating back to 2007 and 2016, including one incident in which he forced himself on a woman at his Belgravia home, groped her and shouted: “I’m a naughty Tory.”The former prime minister Theresa May’s government faced criticism after removing the whip from Elphicke when allegations first emerged, only to return it before a crucial confidence vote."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6269f8a5b9ce06cdcd699819e7ff3fc05b9e81a0/0_517_2866_1719/master/2866.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7dea92443c12df133d6fb1c70ada598f","title":"have you accessed a food bank in the uk for the first time coronavirus","story":"We would like to hear from people who have used a food bank for the first time during the coronavirus pandemicAccording to figures from the Food Standards Agency (FSA) in July, millions of people went hungry or relied on food bankds during the first few weeks of lockdown.We would like to hear from people who have used a food bank for the first time during the pandemic.How have you been coping and what was your experience like?

He discusses hope, horror and survivalJoe Tracini calls the voice in his head Mick, after Jagger. “I see it as the Rolling Stones lips. Just a massive mouth screaming all of the time.” Is he a fan of the Stones? “I know nothing about them, but I respect them because they’re not dead. And, like me, they definitely should be.”The actor, TV presenter, comedian and former magician is becoming known as a radical voice in mental health at a time when the nation’s mental wellbeing has taken a hammering from the pandemic. Over the past year, particularly through lockdown, he has become the public face of borderline personality disorder (BPD), a destabilising condition that can make life really hard for people.Tracini, the son of the popular entertainer Joe Pasquale, was a child prodigy. In 2003, he was the British junior magical champion and was named the most promising comedy act by Ken Dodd. He was only 15 years old endless opportunities lay ahead. He attended the Italia Conti Academy of Theatre Arts in London and learned how to sing, dance and act, before starring on TV in My Spy Family, Coming of Age and Hollyoaks. But, for a long while, drugs, alcohol, BPD and despair got the better of him.Although initially the videos were primarily for his benefit, he thought lockdown would be a particularly difficult time for a lot of people. “I made a couple of videos about how I cope with thinking about killing myself. I assumed there were a lot more people thinking about it than there had been. And it turns out that I am an expert in not killing myself, because I’m not dead.” He grins.He also wanted to open up because the condition is so stigmatised. “The only place BPD comes up is when somebody killed somebody in a crime documentary. People don’t talk about personality disorders, because if you do that calls into question who you are as a human being. That is really scary. A close friend said to me they didn’t want to think about the fact I had a personality disorder, because my personality was the bit they knew and if that wasn’t in order maybe they were wrong about me.”Tracini, 32, has a sweet baby face (Joe 90 meets Alan Carr) and a life-affirming smile that belies everything he is talking about. He is supremely polite, slightly geeky and wears T-shirts that show off his elaborately tattooed arms (and disguise his self-harm scars). He lives in Hackney, east London, but is staying at his mother’s S-shaped bungalow in Rochester, Kent, when we speak on Zoom.In his videos, we often see two Tracinis on a split screen. The one on the left is straight Joe, trying to explain his condition to the world, while the bloke on the right wearing the BPD T-shirt goads him, taunts him and obsesses about the fact that Dick Van Dyke is trending on Twitter (“Dead or racist? It’s normally one of those two things these days”). While serious Joe worries that “tomorrow is not a given”, BPD Joe retorts: “What d’you mean tomorrow is not a gibbon?” and asks why he is always going on about monkeys. Sometimes there is no split screen, just Tracini explaining that talking about killing himself in front of so many people is a form of insurance – the more people he tells he won’t do it, the less likely he is to do so. His videos have been viewed more than 40m times.In one video, Tracini sings a song about the erectile dysfunction caused by his BPD in another, he wears a snorkel and a thong to protect himself from Covid-19 elsewhere, he chats to Miriam Margolyes while she is chomping on a raw onion to ensure he keeps his social distance. Tracini is fascinated with language and wordplay. Why are bees’ knees so special, he asks he has never even seen a pair. On another occasion, he breaks down the word hopeless – it does not mean he has no hope, just that he has less hope than others. At one point, he says he always feels empty – as hollow as a chocolate Father Christmas.When Tracini was finally diagnosed with BPD in his late 20s, it was life-changing. “I felt such relief knowing that what I had was a thing, because my immediate thought process on it was: if it’s a thing, you can fix a thing. I thought I was beyond repair. I thought that I was utterly done for ever.” He was told that long-term, regular therapy might make it slightly better. It was good enough for him. It gave him hope.Tracini tells me about the condition’s nine traits, as outlined by the American Psychiatric Association. All of these affect him, many at the same time. “Fear of abandonment, unstable relationships, chronic feelings of emptiness, impulsive self-destructive behaviours, explosive anger, self-harm, paranoia and disassociation, extreme emotional mood swings and an unclear, unstable self-image.” He pauses. “It’s a very human thing to lessen your own struggle by going: ‘Yeah, but everybody has this stuff.’ But I’m not going to do that, because I do know that mine’s worse.”He made his first short video in January, because he had spent his life telling lies and he just wanted to tell the truth, unadorned, however painful it was. “The only reason that I’m able to be so honest is because I’m doing it to the back of an iPhone,” he says. “I’m not gonna go into Sainsbury’s and go: ‘Hi, how are you, I suffer with erectile dysfunction.’”Tracini says he has never quite been sure who he is. He was born Joe Pasquale, like his father. His mother, Debbie, played bass guitar for a band called Family Affair. (His parents split up in 2008.) He remembers making his first joke on stage at the age of 18 months, when Pasquale brought him on. “I pulled at my hair and said: ‘This is a trick Paul Daniels can’t do.’” Was he really only 18 months old, I ask in disbelief. He nods.Despite having four sisters (three from his father’s first marriage), he did not much engage with other children or childhood. “I was a real novelty, because I spoke and thought like an adult. I wrote my own stuff and would do five to 10 minutes at the end of my dad’s act when I was seven years old.” He adored his father and wanted to be his double. “I’ve got hundreds of hours of me on film. And it is essentially me, this tiny little boy, being my dad.”As soon as he was old enough, he changed his name. He chose Tracini because his grandfather, wrongly, told him it was the original family surname. “My adult career has been trying to undo everything that I taught myself growing up about how to be like my dad.” He still adored his father he just wanted to be his own person – whoever that was.By the age of 12, he was done with traditional school. He was sick of being bullied – one boy tried to strangle him with his own scarf, while another locked him in a skip for three hours. His cousin, who had flunked university, taught him in the shed at the bottom of the family’s garden in Kent. He dedicated himself to magic and was soon good enough to make a living from it. “My first gig was a children’s party aged 12, for a 13-year-old’s birthday.” Did he earn much? “Yeah, I think I earned more in cash than I ever have done since. But I used to put it back into the act. So I’d just buy more magic.”In hindsight, he says he did magic only because he did not have friends. “I didn’t know how to talk to another person without getting a deck of cards out or without entertaining. I physically could not function around other human beings if I wasn’t working.”He quit magic after he turned his hand to acting. Success came easily, but he did not know what to do with himself in his spare time, so he started using cocaine. “All of the money I had went on drugs. I was spending about two and a half grand a week on cocaine.” When he gave up drugs, he became an alcoholic. (He has been drug-free for eight years and sober for five). As he got older, his behaviour became more and more extreme. He does not remember much of that time. He attempted suicide multiple times, although he counts only one attempt as genuine. His friends and family stuck by him. Tracini says he hates to think of the agonies he put his parents through. He begins to weep.Life is just so exhausting, he says, that there is not a moment when he is unaware of himself. Has he never felt inner calm? Actually, yes, there was one day, recently.“It was my 32nd birthday,” he says. “And I stopped thinking. It’s like I had a day off from being me. I was happy. And I only realised that I was happy when I quite quickly became unhappy again. So, yes, it does stop. And I can try and live for those moments.”Despite his poor mental health, Tracini has had a stable professional life – he has rarely been without work. He left Hollyoaks in 2014 after a three-year stint, thinking he would go on to something bigger and better. But there was nothing bigger than trying to quell the voices in his head. He briefly returned to Hollyoaks in 2018, after his diagnosis, but acting gigs were increasingly hard to come by. Since 2017, he has presented the children’s TV show The Dengineers (“Basically Grand Designs for kids”) with Meryl Fernandes. In December, it won a Children’s Bafta for best factual entertainment show.Despite all his pain, he seems to want to make people happy, I say. “Well, there’s that Robin Williams quote, where he says the saddest people like to make people happy because they know how it feels to feel utterly worthless and they don’t want anybody else to feel like that,” he says.When he started posting his videos, thousands of people wrote to him, checking how he was and telling him he had made a difference to their lives. Some asked him for advice, which astonished him. “People thinking about killing themselves should not ask for advice from me. It’s like a chicken asking Colonel Sanders for advice. It’s not gonna happen and, no, I can’t help you.” He sounds fierce, but he is laughing.Tracini can’t stand most of what is said in the media about mental health – he says so much of it is po-faced or exploited by celebrities to promote a product. “I used to be watching, thinking: ‘Yeah, great, when’s your album out?’” So many mental health narratives are sugar-coated, he says. “It’s empty and fluffy, like: it will get better. I’m a lot of things, but I’m not fluffy and what goes on up there isn’t fluffy. It’s not a nice little gif with a hug.”I mention his girlfriend, Holly Houseman, a professional dancer who helps with his routines. Suddenly, I hear her voice in the background, all light and laughter. Tracini says he worries that he does not give enough back in the relationship. “That’s ridiculous, because otherwise I wouldn’t be with Joe,” she says. Does she find him as exhausting as he does? “No!” She looks at him. “Even on your worst days, you still make me laugh.”How has the relationship changed him? “It’s given me something to live for more. Having Holly in my life has made me feel more capable of some sort of future, though I can’t think long term.”“Well, we talked about getting a rabbit and that’s quite long term, because we haven’t got a garden yet!” says Houseman.Tracini is developing a BPD standup routine, which he hopes to take on the road. “It’s called Ten Things That I Hate About Me. It’s basically a Ted Talk gone wrong,” he says.He knows that nobody will turn up to see him they will be there for Mick, the abusive loudmouth in the BPD T-shirt. I ask if he has a name for the quiet, contemplative Tracini. “Funnily enough, I have a T-shirt with ‘Me’ printed on it. But I don’t wear that one.” He does not really know that fella well, he says. Perhaps he will start wearing it when he gets to find out a bit more about him, I say. “Yeah, not half,” he says with a rush of enthusiasm. “It cost 24 quid!”In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or by emailing jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

The world champion took a dominant victory in Barcelona and said he felt he had reached a high in his driving technique. Climbing from his car afterwards he also pointed to the Black Lives Matter symbol on his helmet and insisted that he would keep the pressure on to ensure the issue of racism remained in the public eye.Hamilton finished 24 seconds in front of Red Bull’s Max Verstappen after a race in which the British driver had led every lap from pole. He had been unchallenged out front. It looked serene and Hamilton believed he had found another level.“We all try for perfection and it is not always easy to deliver,” he said. “When I came across the line I didn’t know it was the last lap, I was like a horse with blinkers. I was just going to keep going. For me it was right up there with some of the best drives I have done.”Hamilton has extended his lead in the world championship even further and now has four wins from six races this season but, while he has enjoyed more spectacular or hard-fought victories, he nonetheless felt this performance was outstanding.“I felt like I was in the clear zone,” he said. “The clarity I had whilst I was driving. It is hard to say what helps you get into that space. I felt fantastic in the car, it was physically challenging but in not making mistakes and delivering lap upon lap I was in the perfect zone. I never would have thought I would have a lead of 24 seconds. All these elements were in place and I was very centred in my core.”The drivers once more made their anti-racism gesture on the grid but Hamilton restated his determination to ensure the momentum for change would not be lost. “It is important to continue to push,” he said. “There are many, many companies here that have not held themselves accountable. And there are a lot of people out there in the world who haven’t."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47655edf982079bc1f7ddf9435cf4cb56648cf12/0_149_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dfcaf3d65e532884221c68072933ae81","title":"england v pakistan second test day five live","story":"“Re Pete Salmon and his nuts,” says Charles Sheldrick. “‘The biggest scams going this side of pesto’. As a keen maker, I was shocked by the cost of pine nuts in our local supermarket ... over £30kg!”I feel like we’re getting towards the gizuz a recipe stage. Also, feel free to send in more cooking lifehacks. “Shots fired,” says Matt Dony. “Please let Simon Lewis know that I couldn’t understand a word of that, owing to the frankly ridiculous Nor-Walian accent. (Although, yes. I will miss MS Dhoni. In a world of too few Donys, having an elite sportsman who is a perfect homophone for my name was always enjoyable.)“Oh go on then. Here’s an essay on the great man from Joy of Six: cool sports stars. “Wish I’d known about the Town End Farm Shop,” says Tom van der Gucht. “I had my stag do in Malham and a sausage-making course would’ve been ideal. Not that I was disappointed with the activities – a pub crawl hike taking in the Falcon at Arncliffe, Malham’s pubs and Kettlewell hit the spot too.There used to be an amazing Sausage and Mash restaurant in Oxford called The Big Bang, but it’s sadly no longer there...”On my stag, my “friends” stuck a few shots of Dave’s Insanity Sauce on a tray of other shots, with the intention that I would be given one. Except I picked one of them all by my own self, got rid of it, and was overtaken by a full-body experience that caused me to cry tears – not eye-watering, actual floods of tears – of over-stimulation. It was something. There’s been a bit more rain. “Jumping in from Kuala Lumpur,” says Joel Eley. “I really remember the Ashes series of 2009. I was working in Bahrain and time difference was perfect to watch most of the play. I could get Hatfield Broad Oak sausages from my local supermarket at an exorbitant price, but as it was the village I grew up in I did not care. Used to have a couple of Aussies and fellow English over and good times were had. Shame about the weather but the sausage banter is spot on.”I remember that series too, on the Fridays, a few of us used to keep away from the score then get together to watch as live with all picnic accoutrements. Talking of bland food, here’s Leonard Cohen. “I’m somewhat aggrieved you went as far as to extol challah and Israeli hummus, without the dessert of choice from the shtetl, the glorious babke,” he says. “Attached is my latest attempt.”Tell you what, when I was in bed with corona, one of my mates delivered babke with the challah on the Fridays, and I cannot begin to describe how well it went down. For those interested, this came not from Daniels but from Bread, also in Temple Fortune. Recommended. “When I first came to England, I tried chicken tikka masala,” says Digvijay Yadav. “Learnt the hard way that masala means ‘with curry’ not ‘extra spicy’. It was sweet.”Whoops! Raised on a diet of bland English and Ashkenazi food, to this day, I regret the first 22 years of my life, before I discovered something I believe is called “flavour”. “All this toast has made me think of my lockdown revelation,” says Pete Salmon, “nut butter. Did everyone else know before that to make any sort of nut butter you get the nuts and grind them in a food processor for about 15 mins? That’s all. Some free spirits add a bit of salt or cinnamon or vanilla essence, but you don’t have to. Seriously, commercial nut butter is one of the biggest scams going this side of pesto. On the meat front, Toby from down Ballingham is the man to see. Will sell you half a Shropshire lamb start of spring. And you’ll have some leftover at the start of the next. A word to the wise.”I cannot state strongly enough how beyond me this last element is. “Please let Matt Dony know that it is the very lawlessness of North Wales that makes for such fantastic sausages ,” says Simon Lewis, “including the excellent Edwards of Conwy. Anyway, I thought Mr Dony retired from the international sausage scene last week - or am I getting my vowels mixed up?”“Keep up the good work,” says Charles Sheldrick, “a second cricketless day in the offing … but sausages are even more interesting than cricket. The very finest sausages are home made. If anyone is thinking of giving it a go can I recommend Town End Farm Shop as a place to start? Family run butchers in Malham that run courses. Where else would you go to learn how to make Italian charcuterie? As for the kit you need and sausage skins, here has everything you could need and lots of lovely shiny things you probably don’t but can’t resist….“Heaps Sausages do some amazing concoctions,” tweets Gary Naylor, “and, yes, you can see how the sausage is made in The Room Where It Happens. I used to buy their stuff at Smithfield in the 90s, a little sheepishly, as I only went for their vegetarian options.”Another little thing one might do is coat one’s sausages prior to grilling. Honey, mustard, hot sauce. “Sausage OBO,” says Jack Lee. “If I may suggest something beyond the traditional banger: Boerewors from a butcher near Hastings - no pork in this one!”“Start delayed again,” says Richard Tinner. “Are we anywhere near the record for the least amount of play in an English test match due to weather?”Nowhere near. At Nottingham in 1926, England and Australia managed 17.2 overs in 50 minute, and for years, that was the best of the worst. But then at Kandy in 1993, Sri Lanka and India mustered 12 overs in 49 minutes. Lovely stuff. Sam is back on the toast tip – for those who missed him earlier, he recommends running the toaster through a cycle before sticking in the bread. “It just keeps the centre soft and warm as opposed to potentially firm throughout, whilst the dark (I’m a dark toast person) accepts the butter. It’s an added texture factor I suppose. I can’t not do it anymore. Never looked back.”If my wife wasn’t on a call downstairs, I’d be there checking this as we speak. Maybe if I interject and explain, she and her work folk will understand. “Oh where have you been my blue eyed son?” asks Richard Hirst. “We had a brief exchange about the greatest Bob during the first Test, in the context of your paean to Mr Willis. Since then I’ve been considering in more depth Bob’s relationship with cricket, which is perhaps greater than has been previously thought. Not only did he change his name to make Mr Willis’s life easier - RGZ Willis would have looked frankly silly – but also:- He anticipated and put to bed the debate about reverse swing - ‘it don’t need a weatherman to know which way the swing goes’- He emphasised the importance of attitude when batting last - Positively Fourth Innings (Woakes and Buttler had clearly paid heed to this in the last Test, because they wanted to be on the side that’s winning)- He foresaw the weather outlook for this Test as for so many others - A Hard Rain’s A-Gonna Fall and Shelter From the Storm- He knows what cricketers talk about during those rain delays - Rainy Day Women #12 and 35- And he’s spent many hours watching failings and flailings outside the off stump – I gazed upon the England batsmen flashing.I could go on (Percy (Fender)’s Song It’s Alright Ma I’m Only Beefy), but I think it’s clear that following the Nobel Prize the only fitting tribute left is to make him President of the MCC.”One of my mates is a teacher, and cried in front of his class when he discovered Bob had won the Nobel. Back to the name thing, though, I like to refer to him as Shabtai Zisel ben Avraham. “Disappointed that Porthmadog Meats don’t have a delivery service,” says Matt Dony. “I dearly want to try those sausages, but they are based in the wrong half of Wales, I’m afraid. North of Aberystwyth is a lawless wilderness. Here be dragons. Specifically, dragons who can’t speak Welsh properly.”“Great we can finally OBO some sausage on a wet day,” emails Patrick Duce. “In the interests of balance, there’s some great vegan options out there, as this Beyond Sausage packets shows ... delicious.”I cannot believe it’s take us this long and apologise on behalf of myself and my colleagues. On Twitter, @DerPendler1 gets in touch to flag the TMS link for today – thanks. I think it’s also available on the BBC website, if you go to the match page and click on “Natural Sounds”. “Lovely rain induced discussion and one I will follow closely from my couch,” says Sam Howard. “If I could remember who told me to put the toaster on empty for a cycle and THEN toast the bread, I would kiss them. Also, only scramble your eggs in the bacon pan.”I’m intrigued: how and why does that make for better toast (and what an underrated invention toast is)? But you don’t pour the bacon residue into your bloody mary? Pah. There’ll be a further inspection in 50 minutes, which will be 12pm BST. But it’s raining, and there are menacing black clouds all over the show. “This is completely unfair,” says Naomi Adams. “Having been quite seriously ill during lockdown, and mandated by the hospital to elevate my leg, I was looking forward to lying on the sofa while watching the cricket and occasionally answering a few work emails. Instead, I am at my WFH desk feeling cheated by the weather. And It’s sunny here in south London.”I’m sorry to hear that, but glad to hear that you’re on the mend. On the plus side, another Test starts on Friday, and you now know where to store your chilli peppers. The umpires undertake a forlorn tramp around. We’ll get a verdict of some sort presently, and Athers notes that on such occasions, the match referee should speak to media, explaining what’s going on. And while we’re here, here’s one more: whenever you grill meat – burgers, Porthmadog Meat sausages and the like – don’t tip away the juice, fridge or freeze it to toss in the next time you make stew or meat with sauce. Please do send in your own. However, I will never grasp why people use any chilli that isn’t a scotch bonnet, on which point a cooking, er “lifehack”: keep your peppers in the freezer so that when you chop them you’re not left with burning fingertips which lead to all sorts of hilarity when you take out a lens or visit the toilet. “Spicy meats, eh?” emails Andrew Thomas. “You need to try Porthmadog Meats’ sausages. You have to sign a disclaimer when you buy them accepting all blame for injuries sustained during and following their consumption.I hope my rabbi isn’t reading. “The answer is simple,” says Em Jackson. “School sports hall and a game of Kwik Cricket. Run on every ball bowled, hit or not, a four for hitting the back wall along the floor, six for hitting the back wall in the air, batter out if caught in two hands, whole team out if caught in one (off the back wall only).”I’d watch that, as I would corridor cricket. Shane Warne, the most relentlessly positive man in the world, doesn’t think we’re getting any play today. Great stuff. Thanks Pete Salmon for pointing that out. He also notes: “So the players will go into work today knowing there is no positive result possible, nothing they do will mean anything, and all their good work will prove utterly futile. Welcome to the real world chaps!”Yes, although I trust all 22 players are committed nihilists. Apparently my email was incorrectly entered at the top the the page. That’s been amended now, but to be clear, please get in touch via daniel.harris.casual@the. I’m fizz all day – no beer, no wine. Then as many spicy crisps as I can find, as much spicy meat as I can find, challah from Daniels in Temple Fortune (local knowledge, truss), Israeli hummus (none of that grainy, lemony, supermarket muck), sour sweets to make your mouth hurt and various meat in various pastry. I’m seriously considering going downstairs and preparing myself a cricket picnic. How do you eat yours? Sky show us footage of a lunatic downpour in the middle of the night, and that the outfield is extremely wet. No play before lunch and maybe no play beyond that, reckons Robkey Key, depending on whether the sun comes out. “Or maybe they should call the Test off and decide to play some kind of single day game, a unique event,” responds Peter Brown. That seems a better option, though again, I think the seriousness with which these sides compete would prevent that from happening.“Wouldn’t it be great,” tweets Gary Naylor, “if Joe Root were to say, ‘It’s a summer like no other. Everyone has worked so hard to get this on, not least Pakistan. I’m declaring now and Azhar has agreed to set a target of 280 from as soon as possible after lunch. Let’s get it on!’”It would, but elite-level sport isn’t like that, it’s about being a hard-nosed winner. If either side was 2-0 up, then perhaps, but with the series in the balance and Test championship points available, you need to be serious. With nothing doing this Test, we also find ourselves looking forward to the next one. I’m sure England want to pick at least one of Archer and Wood, but who do they leave out given no one will be tired after five days doing not very much and the series on the line? I suppose we have to talk about the rain and bad light situation. It wouldn’t have made any difference in this Test, but it is fair to start at 10.30 if time’s been lost out of the game I don’t see much reason to oppose that. The light, though, is different because we need to be sure that the players are safe. It’s fine for Jimmy Anderson to talk about needing “leeway” – he knows a bit about cricket – but ultimately, we have a law specifically so that there is no “leeway”. “Leeway” is what will get people hurt. Let’s look on the bright side: I cannot wait till England go to Pakistan. Mainly because it’ll be fun watching the struggle to pick a pace attack when you need at least two spinners, but the prospect of reverse-swing is also tantalising. On the spinning point, I wonder if Root and Smith think Bess has the highest potential of the various options, though Leach was decent in Sri Lanka. Bess was pretty good in the first West Indies Test, and also offers the batting and fielding that Leach does not. If it’s close, which it is, then I can see why that might be the determining factor, even if someone better than both would be better. Er, oh. I guess no chance of starting on time, and a good chance of no play this morning. Sometimes, the preambles just write themselves ... and this time isn’t one of them. There’s so much to like about both these teams – even the cricket we’ve seen in this Test has been great – but unfortunately, it’s going nowhere. A few years ago – OK, a lot of years ago – they played three-day games in the Britannic Assurance County Championship, which meant a lot of forfeited innings in pursuit of a result. But with England about to go dormie one, I can’t see Joe Root agreeing to that, however much we’d all enjoy watching Rory Burns and Dom Sibley commandeer a chase. On which basis, I’m not sure what we’re going to see today. Usually, that’s one of the best things about sport, but on this occasion ... it’s still one of the best things about sport. For as long as the weather holds, we’re going to enjoy the best thing that’s going on anywhere on this planet at this time, so it is incumbent upon us to wade right in.

It helps, of course, when you have a full film crew and five top-flight choreographers. Dance of Dreams is a six-minute ode to San Francisco, backed by Bernard Herrmann’s deeply romantic music for Vertigo. It’s directed by Benjamin Millepied and the highlights are a solo by Justin Peck for principal dancer Joseph Walsh, equal parts assiduous and fully free-flowing, and a duet from Christopher Wheeldon for Madison Keesler and Benjamin Freemantle, circling the rotunda of the Palace of Fine Arts while showing off Wheeldon’s fluent command of the pas de deux.More west coast action as Marquee TV streams films made pre-lockdown from the San Francisco Dance film festival, including the powerful Your Face by director Yoram Savion, with flex dancer Drew Dollaz’s rangy grace illustrating the story of a black boy growing up, graduating from an energetic six-year-old (“a jazz drum solo waiting to happen”) to the hardened defiance of a teenager. Also check out Marianela Núñez being gorgeous in Nela, and the silly seriousness of Swedish choreographer Alexander Ekman, plus films from Scotland’s Screen.Dance festival, too.One of the many shows postponed due to coronavirus was Rhiannon Faith’s Drowntown, a dance-theatre piece on the themes of isolation and vulnerability, more apt than ever in current circumstances. With her cast, Faith created a video prologue to the piece while all her dancers were in lockdown, and the short film certainly captures the sense of being trapped. There’s frustration, loneliness, paranoia, helplessness – and a teaser for the stage show, when performances can finally (fingers crossed) resume.In honour of America’s Pride month, New York City Ballet dancer Taylor Stanley was filmed outside a rainbow-lit Lincoln Center, in choreography by Kyle Abraham. To the sound of Erik Satie, Abraham coaxes multiple identities out of Stanley’s body: a slow walk with hands up, as if confronted by police, twists into a delicate Nijinskian pose both sinuous and staccato stories flow through his body. Stanley’s a ine dancer, and this is a few minutes of movement with grace and gravitas.Two shorts from the BBC’s Filmed in Lockdown series. In Can’t Kill Us All, Botis Seva finds his sanity deteriorating under pressures of lockdown, fatherhood and racial injustice. You can feel the turbulence. In Flying Home, street dancers BirdGang, choreographed by Simeon Qsyea, make good use of the now all-too-familiar segmented Zoom-style screen.As the title suggests, you can’t stop dancers moving, and this series of films from Alonzo King’s Lines Ballet shows the company answering their calling, even if there are no stages on which to perform. There’s a sense of the spiritual in these films of dancers alone, out in the natural world or in empty cityscapes, moving slowly, lovingly and meaningfully among the elements. Three films have been released so far, with two more to come.From the Coronet theatre’s recent Electric Japan season, a music video from dancerchoreographer Kentaro!! and his company Dayonashiik. It’s a Japanese take on hip-hop that he calls datsuryoku-kei, translated as ennui-style. The routine is filmed in a park with a few special effects thrown in, and its DIY aesthetic looks like something you might have seen on The Chart Show, but there’s a definite appeal to its naive stylings."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57a54de45813fdc084ea9a6874a0c9cdc5fb11b3/395_387_4486_2692/master/4486.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=752c41ac3b589ad4bbace1eb80683280","title":"garmin fenix 6 pro solar review the solar powered super watch","story":"An everyday smart sports watch that goes anywhere and tracks everything while lasting a week and charging from the sunGarmin’s latest go-anywhere, do-anything Fenix 6 Pro Solar multi-sport watch recharges from the sun, marking an important step towards the smartwatch you never need to charge.The £739.99 Garmin Fenix 6 Pro Solar is one of the US firm’s top-of-the-line devices, capable of lasting weeks on a charge and tracking practically any stat you’d want, plus it’s able to guide you out of forests when you’re lost.The watch is available with either a 42 or 47mm case, and in various colours and materials, here reviewed in slate grey with red accents and a 47mm case.By every dimension the Fenix 6 Pro Solar means business. At 15.1mm thick and 47mm across your wrist, it dwarfs most other smartwatches. It doesn’t feel enormous when worn, still fitting under shirt cuffs and doesn’t catch on things.It weighs 62g, which is reasonably light – the smaller Fossil Gen 5 weighs closer to 100g. With the included 23g silicone strap, the watch feels well balanced on the wrist and doesn’t slide around once done up. It is comfortable to wear with plenty of adjustment. The 22mm strap can be swapped out for either a quick-release band made by Garmin or any standard 22mm third-party strap.The 1.3in non-touchscreen is a colour transflective LCD display that is clearly visible in direct sunlight and has a backlight for seeing it in the dark. The screen is protected by scratch-resistant Gorilla Glass 3 DX and is big and clear enough to see at a glance. It is more animated than Garmin’s similar displays on watches such as the Forerunner 245, but isn’t as slick or as good-looking as the OLED screens on most smartwatches.Five physical buttons take care of controls. Most things are quick and easy to do using the up, down, select and back buttons. If you think of it operating a bit like an old-school or retro Nokia, then you get a rough idea of how it works.Scroll up or down from the watch face for a series of customisable widgets. I have smartwatch notifications first, then a series of health stats including heart, stress and sleep, temperature, solar intensity, a series of running performance widgets and so on there are loads to choose from.Each of the buttons has a press-and-hold shortcut too. I have it set so holding the down button opens music controls, up for settings and holding the light button takes you to a rotating bunch of quick settings, including timers, alarms and Garmin Pay.The Fenix 6 Pro Solar is much less dependent on your phone than most smartwatches you don’t even need to pair a phone to set it up.Pairing with the Garmin Connect app enables alerts of calls, texts and other notifications, control of music, and activity syncing, all of which worked great with a variety of phones. The watch has wifi for syncing directly to the internet, downloading updates or music too. It can be plugged into a computer to sync and update via Garmin Express, which is a requirement if you want to update the built-in maps.Sans-phone, the watch will continue to track your vitals and activities for weeks with a large amount of internal storage, including fairly comprehensive analysis. You could head off into the wilderness for a week without a phone and still do everything, including mapping, which can’t be said of most smartwatches.The Fenix 6 Pro Solar lasts at least quadruple the length of most smartwatches between charges. Used just as a smartwatch with phone notifications and all the health tracking features activated it, the watch lasts nine full days and nights between charges. If you cut down on some of the health tracking, such as the pulse oximeter, wrist heart rate or other bits you can extend battery life by days (up to 14 according to Garmin). A power manager allows you to select from various pre-sets or make your own with certain features turned on or off.However, that’s all without employing the watch’s hidden talent – the Power Glass covering the screen doubles as a solar charger. It works all the time, even indoors, but requires bright sunlight to meaningfully top up the battery. On a week where I spent two hours walking (with tracking and maps) and three 25-minute runs on bright British summer days I got an extra day’s battery from general smartwatch usage.The beauty is that, other than the added cost to the watch which is a not-inconsiderable £140 over the version without the solar charging, there’s no downside to the Power Glass as it’s fully transparent to the eye. You just see the screen and a slim strip that looks like bezel.Garmin offers trade-in schemes for some lines and complies with WEEE and other local electronics recycling law.The Fenix 6 Pro Solar has comprehensive health tracking features. An excellent optical heart rate monitor on the back works continuously through the day, alerting you to abnormally high or low beats per minute and recording your resting and active heart rates. It measures Pulse Ox (oxygenation of the blood) both during the day and while asleep, respiration rate, stress, body temperature, fall or incident detection and many more. The only thing it doesn’t have is ECG for tracking heart arrhythmia.Garmin’s body battery system helps you make sense of it all, combining stress, sleep, heart rate variability and other data into a simple in-out system. You charge up your body with good sleep and deplete it with stress, activity and daily life. If you’re about balanced you’re doing a good job, but it’s easy to spot when you’re struggling or not doing enough exercise.Sleep tracking is extensive, including light, deep and REM sleep stages, respiration and Pulse Ox tracking, which together can show signs of issues such as sleep apnoea. The data is presented in easy-to-read graphs on the phone or a widget on the watch.Then there’s your standard step, calories, floors and so on, including move reminders.Comprehensive sport tracking covers a list of over 30 activities, but the main ones are running in its various indoor and outdoor forms, cycling, swimming, walking, hiking, skiing, golf and gym sessions of various activities with on-screen animations showing you how to do them.The watch will handle triathlons, but as a runner I focused on hitting the pavement. The Fenix 6 Pro Solar’s outdoor running tracking was first class. It got a GPS lock within seconds, monitored every stat I could want, had a clearly readable display with only the info I wanted on it, gave me pace and lap alerts, performance analysis after 1.5km and handled intervals and more advanced training plans with aplomb. The watch is noticeably larger and heavier on your wrist than something like the Forerunner 245, requiring me to tighten the strap to stop it sliding around.At the end of each run it gives you an aerobic and anaerobic training score, plus an analysis of your training load over the last seven days. The recovery, Vo2 Max and race predictor functions were more accurate than other Garmin watches I have tested too. PacePro allows you to map out a race course and get pace suggestions in real time on the watch adjusted for elevation and other factors to help you hit your desired time, once races are open again.Walking maps were very useful too, providing maps with trails and other features that weren’t visible on Google Maps, making it more effective than a phone. Moving the map around can be a bit tedious with buttons, but is straightforward with practice.The altimeter, barometer and compass, plus maps of the whole of Europe mean you can go hiking just about anywhere. If you need maps for other regions you can buy them and upload them through Garmin Express.The Fenix 6 Pro Solar can run third-party apps downloaded from the Connect IQ store. There are plenty of small utilities and widgets, apps such as Uber and Strava, music services including Spotify, Deezer and Amazon Music, and buckets of watch faces.The Spotify app works well. It can download up to 2,000 songs for offline playback via wifi or control music on your smartphone. Not many smartwatches have offline Spotify playback, so having it for runs is a big plus for subscribers.Garmin Pay is also available for contactless payment on the go. It is not supported by many banks in the UK, but does support Curve, which allows you to bind most credit or debit cards to it. Payments are secured by pin and could be a lifesaver for use on public transport or buying a drink when running without a phone or credit card.The Garmin Fenix 6 Pro Solar has an RRP of £739.99 and comes in either 42 or 47mm sizes.The watch is also available without solar charging as the Fenix 6 Pro costing £599.99, with solar charging but without music, maps and wifi, as the Fenix 6 Solar costing £649.99 or in a larger 51mm version called the Fenix 6X Pro Solar costing £849.99.For comparison, the Garmin Forerunner 245 Music costs £299.99, the Forerunner 945 costs £519.99, Suunto 9 Baro costs £539, the Coros Vertix costs $599 (£460), the Polar Vantage V Titan costs £519, the Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 2 costs £269 and the Apple Watch Series 5 costs £399.The Garmin Fenix 6 Pro Solar is the do-anything, go-anywhere watch for those that need a smartwatch while stuck to a desk during the day, but then dump everything and go climb a mountain, do a triathlon or simply trek into the middle of nowhere at the weekends. Or aspire to do those things.It is very much the kitchen-sink of multi-sport watches, which means most of it is total overkill if you’re just a runner, just a cyclist, just a swimmer or just looking for a long-lasting smartwatch. But if you do more than one thing, or like the idea of being able to jump out of an aeroplane in the middle of Europe and still find your way home, this is the watch for you.It is really easy to live with and looks the part. A rugged, yet stylish sports watch that states to the outside world: “I do more than just the day job”. Those with smaller wrists will struggle with the 47mm version, but the 42mm version is smaller than many smartwatches.Garmin’s Power Glass offers a glimpse of the solar-powered future. It’s not quite the holy grail of a smartwatch you never have to charge, but made a small but material difference to the battery life. Having to charge it less than once a week is still a killer feature for everything this watch can track and do. It is worth noting you’re paying an extra £140 for the solar-charging technology versus the same watch without it, which is a fair sum.It is certainly not cheap, and definitely overkill for most. But if you want the ultimate outdoor adventure smartwatch, the Garmin Fenix 6 Pro Solar is it.Pros: tracks everything under the sun, long battery life, solar charging, phone notifications, Garmin Pay, full offline mapping, offline Spotify, Bluetooth, wifi, 100m water resistance, real buttons, accurate GPSCons: expensive, big, limited Garmin Pay bank support, limited smartwatch features compared to Apple WatchWear OSGalaxy Watch, no touchscreen, screen fairly basic compared to the best smartwatches"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ddb891d87ee93da5f979614c091b8cb2c7d21735/0_85_4496_2698/master/4496.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02d6218a0b8504da712a0991d4da109c","title":"google giving user data authorities documents reveal","story":"Exclusive: in some cases Google did not necessarily ban users who were often threatening violence or expressing extremist viewsA little-known investigative unit inside search giant Google regularly forwarded detailed personal information on the company’s users to members of a counter-terrorist fusion center in California’s Bay Area, according to leaked documents reviewed by the .But checking the documents against Google’s platforms reveals that in some cases Google did not necessarily ban the users they reported to the authorities, and some still have accounts on YouTube, Gmail and other services.The users were often threatening violence or otherwise expressing extremist views, often associated with the far right.The documents come from the so-called “Blueleaks” trove, which hackers acquired from the servers of a hosting company in Texas which had been used by several law enforcement agencies. It contains hundreds of thousands of documents from more than 200 agencies, dated between 1996 and June 2020.The leak has been authenticated by cybersecurity experts.The Google documents containing subscriber information are signed by the company’s CyberCrime Investigation Group (CIG). CIG has been mentioned in coverage of criminal proceedings based on their reports, but its raw output to law enforcement agencies has never been exposed to public view.In the Blueleaks trove, the documents are associated with the Northern California Regional Intelligence Center, part of a nationwide network of fusion centers, which were created after 911 to facilitate information sharing between state, federal, local and tribal law enforcement agencies.Steven Renderos, executive director of MediaJustice, a nonprofit campaigning for a more just and participatory media wrote in an email: “In a moment of reckoning on the failure of police to keep people safe, it is reckless for Google to hand off private user information to law enforcement.”Renderos added: “While the prevalence of hateful activities across Google owned platforms is a real problem, deflecting responsibility to police is not the solution.”The Google documents retained by NCRIC highlight the activities of inidual users, providing detailed subscriber information, which often includes real names, street addresses, credit card numbers, Gmail and recovery email addresses, YouTube channel addresses and the time and IP addresses of recent logins.Many of the documents also include copies of comments users have made on Google services like YouTube.One user whose comments Google passed onto police appeared to threaten racist and terrorist violence.On a now-deleted video on the mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton by Canadian white nationalist, Stefan Molyneux (whose channel YouTube has now banned), the user wrote: “Hi guys, i need your help, i cant help but look at those shooters and think, that could be me. I watch Stefan, and black pilled and many others on the right. I think i should do the same thing they are doing.”The user then went on to discuss methods of making explosive devices.But the same user also discussed making explosives in other comments which were still visible on YouTube at the time of reporting, along with the user’s account.On a video alleging acts of brutality by local police, the user appended comments urging others to “kill them, when you go to trial i wouldn’t find you guilty for shooting these criminals. Kill them all”.According to Google’s reports, the same user appended racial slurs to videos reporting crimes which Google has since removed.A second user who still has an account on the site made threats of racist and anti-police violence on a number of videos.On a video of an incident where police appear to run a woman down with their car in Tulsa, Oklahoma, the second user writes, “Thats vehicular homicide. Need to walk into his house inhis sleep amd shoot his children” (sic).On another video, a report from Russian outlet RT on the coronavirus, the same user writes: “I want the name of the Asian doctor that let the coronavirus outbreak happen. Im going to shoot his daughter in the face”.Google also reported three videos by a third user – who is identified by name, address, phone number, email address, IP address and alternate account – all of which remain on YouTube.The reports contain detailed descriptions of the three videos, including “At around 1:10, the words ‘Muskets would be glowing RED” appear on the screen. Assault weapons are visible in the background. At 3:28, subject asks: “Where is your line in the sand? When is enough, enough?’”, and “Video is titled ‘A Toast to the Few \u0026amp the BooGaLoo.’”While many of the comments appear to threaten other users, law enforcement, or Google employees, and many of the users appear to share far right extremist ideologies, many of those users and their comments remain on Google’s services.Other users are identified by more sophisticated methods, and while some are banned from YouTube, they appear to retain access to other Google services.One user was identified by matching two separate Gmail addresses to a single Android device, which yielded the user’s name, age, address and phone number.That user had posted YouTube comments making anti-Jewish comments, praising white supremacist terrorists, including mass killers, and suggesting he may emulate them.But the report indicates that the user still has two Gmail accounts.While many of the reports sent by Google feature violent or racist threats, some are more indicative of thoughts of suicide or self harm, or simply mental distress.Google did not immediately respond to detailed questions about its reporting system, user privacy and the company’s relationship to law enforcement.Mike Sena, the Executive Director of NCRIC, said in a telephone conversation that the Google reports came through a common reporting facility on the site’s front page that “the public, law enforcement, and any other organization” can use to pass information to the fusion center.Asked about how such reports are used, Sena said that any action from reliable reports “is usually in the form of a welfare check”, and that “our role is to find the best resources to help that person”.Sena said that reports that meet criteria like reliability “in triage” are stored for 12 months.But equality and privacy advocates were concerned about Google’s role in voluntarily passing on user data to law enforcement.Saira Hussein, a staff attorney at the Electronic Frontiers Foundation, said in a phone conversation that EFF was concerned about the “vast amounts of user data” Google appeared to be voluntarily passing on to law enforcement, but questioned Google’s goal in doing so.“Are they expecting law enforcement to do something, or is this just a way of covering themselves? Does Google see its responsibility as simply reporting this to law enforcement and moving on?” Hussein said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60901d10061e7c75e0f6b090449312dcc1913d7e/0_54_5100_3060/master/5100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1fa6ff348dda3fe2e3c9a07c46b57932","title":"how much do you know about hybrid cars take our quiz","story":"From better batteries to regenerative braking, test your knowledge on these low-emission vehiclesHonda has raised the ambition of its Electric Vision strategy to ensure that all European mainstream models feature electrified powertrains by 2022, three years earlier than originally planned.

For extra storage space, comfort and reduced emissions, a hybrid SUV is worth considering for a variety of lifestylesAdam Smith identified Britain as a nation of shopkeepers, but these days it might be more accurate to say we’re a nation of small businesses. There are almost 6m in the country, of which 3.5m operate as sole traders.Many of those people, whether they work at home or from a small office, need transportation that is reliable, spacious, cheap to run and that can double as a family car. Whether you’re a caterer transporting cakes, a fitness trainer carrying weights or a maker selling craftwares at small markets, you need a vehicle that can adapt effortlessly to your needs and budget.A hybrid’s combination of petrol and electric power means those short delivery runs are more cost-effective and you never have to wait on a recharge. Emissions are reduced, meaning a small reduction in car tax but also reductions when certain types of low-emission vehicles are registered as a company car for tax purposes – useful when you’re watching every penny.There are plenty of other reasons to buy a large hybrid if you run a small business, of course, not least a huge amount of storage to stow goods away in. The latest Honda CR-V hybrid, for example, features a wider, deeper boot than in previous models, and can be opened by waggling your foot underneath, ideal if you’re loaded down with goods. A smart, flexible “company” car that’s tax deductible and cheaper to run? Sounds like good business.Face it, when you become a parent, you sign up to run a taxi service for the best part of 20 years. Factor in a twice-daily school run, regular shopping trips, weekend jaunts and holidays with two or three kids, perhaps a dog, too, and the attraction of a big car such as an SUV is undeniable. But there’s a major downside: emissions.Many schools in urban areas suffer from high pollution, exacerbated by parents depositing their kids at the school gates and waiting around when they pick them up later with engines needlessly idling. Fearing the effects, headteachers are calling for car bans and schools are leafleting parents to stop parking nearby. The city of Bristol is even discussing a potential diesel car-free zone, because of the dangerous particulates they emit. The UK Energy Research Centre recently revealed the surge in SUV sales was jeopardising the UK transport sector’s ability to meet EU emissions targets. That’s not a good look for a parent, even if an SUV is.The ideal solution is a more efficient, cleaner version that can still meet the needs of a busy parent – a hybrid that can run on pure electric around sensitive zones such as schools and in town.When you combine the other benefits a modern, large hybrid car brings to the party – such as high safety ratings, masses of room, plenty of storage and parking assist features – they begin to make a compelling case again.There are many downsides to a long commute, not least the grinding tedium of heavy traffic, the slow crawl and tailbacks with repeated stop-starts. Add to that stress and musculoskeletal disorders from sitting in an uncomfortable position, and public transport starts to seem a whole lot more appealing. However, if commute time, connectivity or the price tag make public transport difficult to justify, a low-emission vehicle might just be the next best thing, especially with today’s petrol and diesel prices.A hybrid with a stop-start system automatically shuts down and restarts the engine to reduce the amount of time it spends idling, reducing both fuel consumption and emissions. And you may just end up spending less on maintenance as well. Because of the regenerative braking system, you won’t use your standard brakes as much, resulting in less wear and tear. The batteries in hybrids are also designed to last the lifetime of the car, and have solid warranties to reflect this. The Honda i-MMD battery, which is used to power its new CR-V hybrid, is covered for five years or to a distance of 100,000km, whichever comes first.We all have many factors to consider when choosing which transport option best suits our lifestyle, but for some of us, a hybrid could tick quite a few boxes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1c2fe19fd67bca653c753499a8cadf6d48eaffd/0_0_4893_2936/master/4893.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8a66804da8d76926a240da37d432a04","title":"hybrid cars have to be plugged in and five other common misconceptions","story":"Complicated and costly? Think again. Driving a hybrid vehicle is a practical way to reduce emissions while being economical and fuss-free, say expertsAs awareness of the climate crisis grows and urban pollution levels creep ever higher, we’re all starting to think more about our carbon footprints. For those who are considering buying a car, which one to go with requires careful thought and research.Should we stick with petrol or diesel, take the plunge to buy an electric vehicle or maybe opt for a hybrid? Of these options, there tends to be the most confusion around hybrids. There are a lot of myths about these vehicles, many of them based on the early, less sophisticated versions that entered the market about 20 years ago. But it’s worth busting through these concerns and getting to grips with what hybrids can offer, as for many of us they can be an excellent choice for greener, more economical and fun motoring.“We were early to market with hybrids back in the late 1990s with the Insight and then the sportier CR-Z,” says Phil Webb, deputy general manager automotive at Honda UK. “These were arguably ahead of their time and are now modern classics. Fast forward 20 years and, while hybrids have changed drastically, the concerns around owning and driving them have not.”Here are some of the most common misconceptions.Myth one: hybrid technology is complicated and difficult to understandThere are different types of hybrid cars, and hearing terms such as “mild”, “full” and “plug-in hybrid electric vehicle” (PHEV) bandied around can be confusing. But it’s quite straightforward. A hybrid car is one that uses two forms of energy to maximise efficiency and reduce emissions. Usually this means combining electrical energy contained in batteries with the combustion energy of petrol or diesel fuel.“Hybrid cars were developed to reduce CO2,” explains Nick Molden, CEO of Emissions Analytics, a global emissions testing specialist. “They do it via two means. Firstly, there’s regenerative braking. When a vehicle brakes there’s a lot of wasted energy. Hybrids capture this energy into the battery and it can then be used to power the vehicle. Secondly, hybrids help the engine work at optimal efficiency as much of the time as possible. Electric power is suited to lower-speed stop-start driving such as you might do in a city. And petrol and diesel engines are more suited to driving at higher, constant speeds – for example, during motorway driving. Hybrid technology means that the two parts work together in harmony, each doing what it’s best at.”“We have deliberately made our hybrids incredibly easy to drive,” says Webb. “Our new CR-V hybrid has three driving modes pure electric, hybrid and engine-only – but what makes it easy to drive is the fact that the car will select the most fuel-efficient way of powering the car, so the driver doesn’t have to.”Myth two: hybrids have to be plugged inSome hybrids are plug-ins, while others are not. Plug-in hybrids have batteries that can be charged from a power outlet and can run on electric power alone for between 30 and 40 miles, before needing the petrol or diesel engine to kick in. But hybrid technology is also available in cars such as the CR-V hybrid, which does not need to be plugged in. And with both types of hybrid, “range anxiety” isn’t something you need to worry about – if the electrical energy runs out, they will shift over to the petrol or diesel engine.Myth three: hybrids are a cop-out. If we care about climate change we should be driving electric carsIn an ideal world, more of us would be driving electric cars. They have zero tailpipe emissions, so in terms of reducing CO2 and combating climate change they’re an excellent choice. But the fact is that electric vehicles aren’t practical for many people – especially those who live in flats or terraced houses and don’t have access to a charging point, or anyone who does a lot of long-distance driving.Tim Anderson, head of transport at the Energy Saving Trust, says: “For motorists who don’t have access to charging points, hybrids can be a worthwhile stepping stone towards reducing their CO2 emissions. They are more energy-efficient than their petrol and diesel counterparts and are easy to buy, drive and live with.”Myth four: hybrids aren’t fun to driveMotoring journalist Tim Barnes-Clay doesn’t agree. “Early hybrids used to feel quite different from ‘regular’ cars, with a lack of connection with the driver’s input and the vehicle’s road behaviour. But now hybrids can be a joy to drive on any road, including motorways. For example, the Honda CR-V hybrid uses CVT automatic transmissions, giving a continuous flow of smooth power.”Myth five: hybrids aren’t very stylishWhen hybrids first came out about 20 years ago they did look quite quirky and different. “However, designers have responded to what consumers want and hybrids are now styled to look as attractive as any other car,” says Keith Adams, editor of car-buying website parkers.Myth six: hybrids are too expensive“Although hybrid cars cost a bit more than their petrol and diesel counterparts, their fuel economy means that savings can be made in running costs,” says Adams. And with minimal running costs and excellent reliability, hybrids are in demand on the secondhand market and their resale value tends to be strong.Misconceptions about hybrids mean they can be seen as the worst of both worlds – not as green as electric cars, and less stylish and enjoyable to drive than conventional petrol or diesel vehicles. But for many motorists, they are the opposite, offering a practical and accessible way to reduce emissions while also being economical and fuss-free."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9f2191029e5033edacd0e10f21cc1f48d654563/1386_1800_3526_2116/master/3526.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dcd005d88e378c8b805305f897f38f6b","title":"quiet as a deserted chapel test driving a hybrid car","story":" Mike Pattenden and his wife Andrea Walker take the Honda CR-V hybrid out for a spin. Here’s what they discover …Despite being the self-conscious subjects of a photoshoot in the busy car park in Bedfordshire’s Dunstable Downs, no one paid a blind bit of notice to us. Clearly, as a couple, my wife and I were as commonplace to the families, walkers and kite flyers up there on a breezy Sunday morning before lockdown as the Honda CR-V hybrid that was actually the quietly unassuming star of every shot.There were plenty of SUVs in view, even a few other Honda CR-Vs – hardly surprising, given it’s the world’s most popular SUV. More than 9m have been sold since it was launched back in 1995.When it comes to cars, “popular” is a good thing. It means dependable, safe and cheap to run and, consequently, as eye-catching as denim. And yet, this fifth-generation model of the CR-V is remarkable in its own way. It’s a hybrid with an engine that combines the best aspects of petrol combustion and electric to power it.Our CR-V is powered via a combination of a 2.0-litre Atkinson-cycle engine and two electric motors via Honda’s integrated motor assist (IMA) system, meaning it runs in three modes: EV, hybrid and petrol, constantly defaulting to electric at speeds below 30mph. In this mode, the electric motors are used to drive the wheels, using energy from the battery that was previously harvested from the petrol engine while driving at higher speeds. This means the petrol engine is generally used at lower revs, making it more fuel efficient and quieter.And, golly, is it quiet. Honda’s noise-cancelling system makes it feel like a deserted chapel as we drive around this Sunday morning, albeit one with heated pews.“You’d hear a squirrel squeak if you ran over one,” observes my wife as we drive stealthily over to Ivinghoe Beacon, where we like to walk at weekends. Luckily, no such tragedy occurs. Honda’s cross-traffic sensor warns me of a jogger as I begin to reverse (I spot him a moment later in the handy rear camera), and the CR-V hybrid has a collision detection system that prevents a rear-end shunt by slamming on the anchors for you. Having recently endured a trip to Bristol in horrendous stop-start motorway traffic, aggravated by a succession of these infuriating incidents, I’d make this feature mandatory in every car.As for efficiency, the car shifts modes seamlessly, meaning it’s incredibly thrifty, capable of 56mpg in town. You can have fun stretching its electric running, too, through regenerative braking via two paddles behind the steering wheel that slow it like changing down gears in a manual, although, given its powertrain, the CR-V hybrid is an automatic. And because of the way it tops up the batteries, there’s no recharging, so no “powernoia” on long journeys.“You don’t really have to do much, do you?” says my wife approvingly, when she takes the wheel. “I could get used to this.”On the motorway, the car switches to petrol mode at high speed and proves adept at eating up the miles in comfort. There’s a suite of driver-assist features including adaptive cruise control that will adjust distance to the car ahead, lane-keep assistance, in case you wander, and a speed limiter that will automatically maintain a specified speed – handy for the inevitable 50mph surveillance sections. For someone who views a future of driverless cars as dystopian, this level of autonomy feels perfectly acceptable to me.Inside, it’s roomy and well supplied with storage points. The centre console swallows my wife’s chunky handbag whole. There are cup holders for coffee addicts and bottle racks in the door pockets, along with charge points for phones.The boot is roomy enough for a dog. Put the rear seats down and you could probably fit a Shetland pony in. Shell out for the top-of-the-range EX model and it’s also automated, meaning you can open it by waggling your foot underneath, handy for the big shop. All but the most basic models boast a centre console with a 7in touchscreen. I had the radio set to 6 Music within a couple of minutes and the sound from the nine speakers was impressive. You can use its Garmin navigation system or set up a smartphone instead, if you wish.CR-V stands for “compact recreational vehicle”, but perhaps “considerately reinvented vehicle” is a better fit?Honda has raised the ambition of its Electric Vision strategy to ensure that all European mainstream models feature electrified powertrains by 2022, three years earlier than originally planned. On the path to this goal, they’ve released their first hybrid SUV, the CR-V, which features Intelligent Multi-Mode Drive (i-MMD) technology, enabling it to shuffle seamlessly between power sources.

I am on the sand at Santa Maria del Focallo in southern Sicily. Around me, a few clusters of friends and families are huddled under umbrellas or cooling off in the sea. Dunes coloured green and pink by evergreen shrubs and bougainvillea stretch in both directions: west towards the port town of Pozzallo and east towards Portopalo, Sicily’s most southerly tip, where the Ionian Sea meets the Mediterranean. There’s an end-of-season feel, as if the stragglers are soaking up the final rays of summer. In reality, the season has only just begun.On 4 June, the travel ban between regions in Italy was lifted and beach resorts began reopening, relying heavily on holidaymakers from their own region and hoping to make ends meet despite the new mask-wearing, socially distanced normal. In this particular corner of Sicily, however, finding space to sunbathe at a safe distance has evidently never been an issue. It has endless kilometres of beach free from the privately run lidos that clutter most Italian resorts, with their tightly packed, uniform rows of sunbeds and parasols.“It’s always like this,” says Ettore Lorenzi, a kitesurfing instructor, from the porch of his whitewashed wooden shack overlooking the beach.Ettore runs the Floripa Yoga and Kitesurf  House (doubles from €70) alongside yoga teacher Ameriga Giannone. Just over the road from the beach, it’s a modernist, low-key space, with bold-coloured walls and a lush garden. The vibe is more like a stay with friends than a hotel holiday. I’m barely been there five minutes before Ettore puts a tumbler of red wine in my hand and invites me to join the other guests – either old Sicilian friends or repeat visitors – at a long table on the jasmine-shaded terrazzo for a vegetarian dinner. I quickly realise I could happily spend the week flitting between the beach and the grounds of Floripa.But I have a large unspoiled region to explore and a long list of “unmissable” places to eat at along the coast. Gennaro del Pino, a not terribly busy beach barman, tells me: “Though excellent cooking can be found almost anywhere nearby, A Valata, on the seafront in Pozzallo, 8km away, is where pozzallesi locals choose to dine.” And so off I go.Unlike the beach, A Valata is rammed. Part-suspended on wooden decking, the restaurant hangs over now-obsolete concrete tracks that used to guide boats into the water. “The kitchen was formerly a boathouse,” the restaurant’s owner says. “It was one man’s job to row out across the bay to the lighthouse to top up the lamps with oil each night.” Now succulent platters of house speciality pesce crudo – Sicily’s answer to sashimi – fly out of the former boathouse kitchen. Michael La Pira, who works as a waiter in summer and in the merchant navy in winter, says the fish is brought in daily on small boats that have been the bedrock of this local economy for centuries.On the table next to me, a young woman finishes a huge portion of linguine with fresh tomatoes and sardines. “Tourism is surplus to fishing and agriculture here,” says Erika Modica, whose choice of dish reflects the two pillars of the area’s economy. Erika runs a boat chartering business, and appears unfazed by the impact of coronavirus. “We live very much in the present here,” she says. “We are happy people.”Indeed, as I walk back through the town to the car, a heady atmosphere prevails as locals pack the boardwalk enjoying their evening passeggiata. The only sign of a pandemic is the odd mask slung over an elbow, to be worn when entering a bar or shop. Holidays are still happening here, just without the influx of foreign tourists.In the opposite direction to Pozzallo, east along dusty roads flanked by polytunnels growing Pachino tomatoes, is Portopalo di Capo Passero. Once the centre of the tuna trade, and now on the verge of being run-down, it feels real, compared with touristy Marzamemi further up the coast. Not far away, off Italy’s southernmost tip, Isola delle Correnti is a tiny island just above sea level, with a 200-year-old octagonal stone lighthouse. It’s an ideal swimming spot, and groups of friends clutching lilos are wading out through the shallow water to swim in the small coves.Staying on shore and in the shade, I chat to a family on holiday from Emilia-Romagna, the first non-Sicilians I come across during my stay. “We were lucky to have booked our flights in January because now they are expensive,” says Sabrina Corbino, as she tucks into scaccia – a traditional layered pizza-pie filled with tomatoes and aubergine. She blames the airlines for the lack of tourists – including Italians – though she admits she already knew the area through having family here.Inland, the hilltop towns built in Sicilian baroque style offer a side helping of sophistication. I enjoy an aperitivo in the chic town of Noto, but nearby Modica and Scicli are equally beguiling. Noto’s architecture is high baroque, and the pale stone reflects the sun in ever-changing pink hues on the wide cobbled streets. In Cássaro Cafè-Bistrot on the main drag, two friends have a drink at the table next to mine. They are a fashion PR and a stylist who moved from Milan several years ago to transform an 18th-century apartment into a B\u0026ampB. “This is the type of place where you could be standing next to a famous film director in the queue for an ice-cream and no one would even realise,” says Edoardo Marchiori as he sips his margarita. “Those in the know come here to get away from the crowds.”Back at Floripa, the other guests are baffled by my decision to skip the daily yoga classes, but with such a seductive and unpretentious corner of Sicily on the doorstep, yoga is going to have to wait.• Car rental was provided by Avis (from €200 per week)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/817c262fe09ceb91e72fc5176ca18a4576459e72/0_16_2420_1453/master/2420.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=25bc3f2619a0a69b6df31b68919cc56c","title":"democratic national convention joe biden kamala harris","story":"Four-day event where Biden will formally accept the presidential nomination begins today and will take place from remote locationsThe Democratic national convention begins on Monday with a star-studded lineup and heavy emphasis on unity aimed at presenting Joe Biden and Kamala Harris as the US’s best hope for healing a deeply ided nation reckoning with the parallel crises of a global pandemic and racial injustice.The party’s four-day presidential nominating convention has been entirely reshaped by the public health crisis. Originally planned for Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in mid-July, it has been forced into a compacted, virtual affair, renamed the “Convention Across America.”The event, which usually draws thousands of the party faithful to a single city for days of celebrating, deal-making and politicking, will now take place from remote locations across the US. There will be no roaring crowd, bespoke thunder sticks or oversized balloons.Biden is scheduled to formally accept the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday, delivering the most consequential speech of his decades-long career from a mostly-empty ballroom, near his home in Wilmington, Delaware.The Democratic National Convention (DNC), and its Republican counterpart (RNC), are traditionally two of the most high-profile weeks of the US election cycle – a mix of political business, theater and party, in both senses of the word.Tens of thousands of people usually attend the week-long events. Party delegates from across the country converge on a city to hold meetings and events. They fill a big arena to say something prideful about their state and cheer wildly for the party\u0027s candidate for president, who officially receives the nomination here.During the convention, politicians andor celebrities give speeches in support of the party’s candidate, who gives a rousing speech to cap it all off.This year, due to the coronavirus pandemic, the DNC will be completely different. Almost all aspects have moved online.\u0026nbspBillie Eilish\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspJohn Legend\u0026nbspare among the celebrity performers, and key speakers will include presidential nominee, Joe Biden, his running mate, Kamala Harris, political power couples the Obamas and the Clintons, and progressive superstar Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\u0026nbsp“There’s no doubt about it – it will be different,” Tom Perez, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee (DNC), said last week.The programming, reduced to just two hours each night from 9pm–11pm ET, was arranged to reflect the depth of Biden’s political coalition, aligned in opposition to Donald Trump. It stretches from the Republican former governor of Ohio, John Kasich, to the democratic socialist senator from Vermont, Bernie Sanders, both of whom are scheduled to speak on Monday night.It also includes two of the most famous couples in American politics: the Clintons and the Obamas as well as “everyday Americans”.Biden enters the final stage of the campaign in a strong position, though Democrats are bracing for the race to tighten. Biden leads Trump by wide margins in national and battleground surveys.According to the survey, Biden holds a wide advantage over Trump on nearly every issue except the economy, which voters say is a priority this election.Democrats anticipate the excitement around Harris’s historic candidacy as the first Black woman nominated for national office by a major party, will build momentum around the convention – and the new Democratic ticket. Harris will address the nation on Wednesday, 100 years and one day after the ratification of the 19th Amendment, which guaranteed American women the right to vote.“I think people are feeling every bit of that historic reality,” said Adrianne Shropshire, the executive director of BlackPac, a super Pac focused on Black Democrats. “I think there is also real relief that there is a ticket people can believe in, and get behind and push over the finish line.”Amid a national reckoning on racial injustice, Biden’s team has devoted significant primetime space to prominent Black leaders. Barack Obama will deliver the keynote address on Wednesday, after Harris speaks. There will also be a tribute to the late civil rights leader and congressman John Lewis.Celebrities and entertainers such as Common, Billie Eilish, and John Legend will perform, alongside teachers, factory workers, frontline healthcare workers and business owners who have been asked to share their stories, which are intended to emphasize the impact of Trump’s failure to contain the pandemic on working class Americans.But converting what is traditionally a high-octane production into what has effectively become an evening Zoom conference, has posed significant logical and technical challenges for organizers.The convention will still be “anchored” at the Wisconsin Center in Milwaukee, but speakers will deliver remarks, many of them pre-recorded, from various locations, as delegates cast ballots remotely.The event is not only an extraordinary logistical test for the Biden campaign, but a critical piece of the mission to galvanize supporters and unify Democrats, four years after bitter infighting between the moderate and liberal wings of the party erupted in protests and jeering on the convention floor in Philadelphia.This year, Democrats head into the convention with a shared sense of purpose, said Jeff Weaver, a top Sanders adviser who was involved in an effort to forestall protests at the convention in 2016.More than 30 speakers will address the country virtually over four nights - Monday 17 August to Thursday 20 August from 9pm to 11pm ET - in the lead up to formally nominating Joe Biden and Kamala Harris for the Democratic presidential ticket. The theme for the week-long event is Uniting America.Speakers include: former first lady Michelle Obama, Vermont senator and Democratic socialist Bernie Sanders, former Republican governor of Ohio John Kasich, congressman Jim Clyburn of South Carolina, New York governor Andrew Cuomo, Nevada senator Catherine Cortez MastoSpeakers include: former President Bill Clinton, former second lady Jill Biden, congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New YorkPresidential nominee and former vice-president Joe Biden, California governor Gavin Newsom, Atlanta mayor Keisha Lance BottomsThrough the weekPerformances from:\u0026nbspBillie Eilish, John Legend, Leon Bridges, Common, The Chicks, Stephen Stills, Jennifer Hudson, Billy Porter, Maggie Rogers, Prince Royce and more.“All of us – and by that I mean the people who were in the Bernie campaign, the people in the Biden campaign, and people outside of both of those campaigns – have really worked hard to create an effective and genuine popular front against Donald Trump,” Weaver said, adding: “Trump is a very unifying factor.”The curent mood within the party is a testament to those efforts. As late as March, political strategists were openly fretting the competitive Democratic primary might result in a contested convention. Concern dissipated when Biden decisively won the South Carolina primary and his former competitors aligned behind him.Still, progressives were angered by the decision to give virtual podium to billionaire Michael Bloomberg and not Julián Castro, both of whom ran against Biden in the Democratic primary. The relatively few speaking slots reserved for Hiic politicians further frustrated activists, who have warned that Biden must do more to appeal to Latino voters, especially younger ones.And California congressman Ro Khanna, a national co-chair of Sanders’ 2020 campaign, announced that he would vote against the Democratic party platform because it does not include support for Medicare for all.Though isions linger, the virtual format affords little opportunity for public displays of dissent. Democrats met remotely to hammer out the details of a lengthy platform, which draws heavily from the policy recommendations issued by the joint Biden-Sanders taskforces.The opening night will conclude with a keynote address from the former first lady Michelle Obama, considered one of the most compelling speakers in Democratic politics after her soaring speech in 2016 when she introduced the maxim: “When they go low, we go high.”Jill Biden is the headline speaker on Tuesday night, after convention delegates formally nominate her husband in a “roll call” vote of all 57 US states and territories.Former president Bill Clinton will also speak on Tuesday, and Hillary Clinton, the 2016 Democratic nominee, will give remarks on Wednesday.Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the progressive New York congresswoman who once observed that she and Biden would probably belong to different political parties if they lived in another country, was allotted 60 seconds on Tuesday night, a clipped appearance some supporters viewed as a slight.The convention culminates Thursday evening with Biden, who will deliver a speech he has been trying to make since he first ran for president in 1988.Howard Dean, a former chair of the DNC who has attended every party convention since 1980, said the new format could work in Biden’s favor.Unlike Trump, who feeds off the energy of crowds at rallies but can look wooden and uncomfortable when reading from a teleprompter, Biden, Dean said, “does better on television than he does at a podium”.“This helps him because he will be on TV projecting calmness, reasonableness and thoughtfulness,” he said. “And that’s what people are desperate for right now.”Democrats began downsizing their convention months ago, when it became clear the virus would continue to be a threat throughout the summer. What started as a 4-day event with 24 hours of programming was eventually scaled back to just eight hours total.By contrast, Trump forced party officials to move the Republican presidential nominating convention to Jacksonville, Florida, from Charlotte, North Carolina, after state leaders there said they would require participants to abide by social distancing rules.A month before the event, Trump abruptly cancelled the in-person portion of the event amid a deepening coronavirus outbreak in Florida and across the region.Now Trump says he plans to deliver his re-nomination speech from the White House lawn, an unprecedented use of federal property for a partisan political event that critics say may violate ethics laws.For viewers at home, the virtual nature of the convention will be a reminder of the stakes in November, with the economy in tatters and nearly 170,000 Americans dead from the coronavirus, said Leah Daughtry, who ran the party’s Democratic conventions in 2016 and 2008. She said the occasion presents an opportunity for Democrats to demonstrate a sharp contrast in leadership with the president.“We didn’t want to endanger anyone – not just the delegates, but the people who are working in the hotels and the restaurants and the airport workers who would have to be on duty in order to help our convention run,” she said. “I think that’s a key talking point, as we have a president who seems to still not understand the depth and the breadth of this virus.”Joan E Greve contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2555792d63ee852b6bd9e655317d1f57f56e4f4/0_0_5626_3378/master/5626.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2686575bb686dbab23e97dacab0b1a6f","title":"louis dejoy usps postmaster general election","story":"Sine taking office in June, Louis DeJoy has executed sweeping changes at the struggling USPS, leading to delays in mail delivery – and fears mail-in ballots won’t arrive on timeAbout a month ago, a United States Postal Service (USPS) mail carrier named Mark arrived at his post office in central Pennsylvania and got some shocking news from his station manager. Mark and his coworkers were told they would have to depart the office for deliveries a few hours earlier each day, even if that meant leaving behind much of the day’s mail.In the weeks that followed, higher-ups at the station instructed carriers to abandon hundreds of pieces of mail in order to depart a mere 10 or 20 minutes earlier. As the days went on, the excess mail started to pile up, and now Mark estimates there are thousands of undelivered letters and packages sitting in his station.“The supervisors are cracking the whip, making sure we leave,” Mark told the . “Meanwhile carriers are walking by and saying, ‘Look at all this fucking mail we’re walking past, it’s just sitting there.’”When Mark and his coworkers confronted the station manager he said he was only following orders from the new USPS postmaster general, Louis DeJoy. Since taking office in June, DeJoy has executed sweeping changes at the struggling US Postal Service, shaking up agency leadership and rolling out policies that have led to delays in mail delivery. These changes, which DeJoy has said are designed to cut down on labor costs, have angered advocates and Democratic politicians, who have accused him of trying to tamper with the election just weeks before millions of Americans start casting their ballots through the mail.Now, the controversial logistics executive and Trump mega-donor arguably has more power than any other official in the country to affect the outcome of this year’s presidential election.Donald Trump has maintained a public obsession with the USPS, which he has called “a joke”. In particular he has fulminated against the agency’s business relationship with Amazon: despite studies showing that the USPS makes a profit by shipping packages for the e-commerce giant, Trump has repeatedly insisted that the agency should charge Amazon higher rates.To stanch the bleeding, congressional Democrats have proposed giving the agency up to $25bn in aid money as part of their second coronavirus relief package, but Trump on Thursday again came out against that proposal on the grounds that it would help the USPS handle mail-in ballots, which he wrongfully believes would lead to voter fraud.Without an aid package, the USPS has faced unprecedented challenges with staffing and scheduling due to the impact of the coronavirus on its already stretched thin workforce. Customers in more than a dozen states have reported delays of days or even weeks in mail delivery, including for essentials like prescription medicine. And a number of recent primary elections have been marred by postal failures: numerous voters in Wisconsin and Michigan never received absentee ballots they requested weeks in advance, while New York postal workers inadvertently disqualified thousands of ballot envelopes for not having proper postmarks.Amid this turmoil, DeJoy’s appointment represents the culmination of a years-long attempt by the Trump administration to gain control over the USPS: earlier this year the president also filled two vacancies on the agency’s board of governors with agency outsiders, giving him complete control over the regulatory body.DeJoy is only the fifth postmaster general in history to come from the private sector. He has never worked for the USPS, but he benefited as CEO of New Breed Logistics from a long business relationship with the agency. In the late 1980s the shipping company signed an equipment contract with the USPS and over the next 20 years the agency became one of the company’s biggest customers alongside private companies such as Sony and Estee Lauder. A North Carolina newspaper later referred to the USPS contract as the New Breed’s “big break”.But DeJoy’s tenure at New Breed was marked by controversy: the National Labor Relations Board ruled that the company’s interactions with its workers were “motivated by anti-union animus”, and the company paid out more than $1.7m in fines for labor law violations between 2001 and 2015, according to the Intercept. In early 2000, DeJoy’s younger brother, Dominick, sued Louis and a third brother, Michael, accusing them of defrauding him out of a one-third stake in the company, according to a news article at the time.As he grew his logistics empire, DeJoy also made a name for himself as a prolific Republican fundraiser, hosting lavish dinners out of his home in Greensboro, a $5m mansion compound. Former president George W Bush held a $1,000-a-plate event at the home in 2006 ahead of that year’s midterm elections, while former vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin held another closed-door event at the home two years later.DeJoy, meanwhile, is not the only member of his family to enter politics: his wife, Aldona Wos, served as ambassador to Estonia under Bush and later headed the North Carolina department of health and human services, where she faced criticism for hiring a number of Republican campaign aides and former New Breed employees. In 2014, the USDA discovered a pattern of shoddy bookkeeping and an enormous backlog in the state’s database of food stamp recipients in her agency. This year, Trump nominated Wos to serve as the US ambassador to Canada.It took about 30 years, but leading New Breed eventually paid off. In 2014, he sold the company to logistics conglomerate XPO for a reported $615m, and became CEO of XPO. When DeJoy retired in 2015, he told local newspapers he was spending some time at his beach house, eating meals with his two children, and “actually reading” his Wall Street Journal. He also launched a holding company, LDJ Strategies, that he planned to use to deploy his money in real estate and private equity investments.According to financial disclosures obtained by CNN, DeJoy still maintains a large stake in XPO Logistics, and owns large amounts of Amazon stock, creating two glaring conflicts of interest for a man leading a government agency that competes with both companies in some areas. Outside ethics experts called the disclosures “shocking”.But DeJoy’s principal activity during his short retirement turned out to be kicking up fundraising efforts for the GOP, especially Donald Trump. Beginning around 2016, DeJoy donated more than $1.2m to pro-Trump Pacss, making him one of the president’s largest single donors. He hosted a $15,000-a-seat fundraiser for Trump at his home in late 2017, noting in the invitation that while “the president and his team have had some missteps … it is hard to deny the extreme and unreasonable challenges he faces from the political establishment”.Last year the Republican National Committee (RNC) chairwoman, Ronna McDaniel, named DeJoy chairman of fundraising for the Republican national convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, and he hosted Mike Pence to kick off his money-raising efforts. In an interview ahead of the event, DeJoy said he planned to raise around $70 million using a strategy of “nationwide begging”.The RNC last month decided to scale down the Charlotte convention due to concerns about the coronavirus, but DeJoy’s ample fundraising for the event paid off, nonetheless, in the form of his appointment to the position of postmaster general.In his short tenure at USPS, DeJoy has already orchestrated risky changes to the agency. In interviews with the , postal workers said DeJoy’s new policies have introduced further confusion to an agency already hampered by the coronavirus pandemic. They worried the inconsistent and sporadic changes could cause serious harm to people and businesses and prevent the agency from ensuring every ballot is counted in the upcoming election.Sasha, a mail carrier in Massachusetts, said USPS leadership has slashed hours for the clerks who sort the mail. This has resulted in a backlog of multiple days for residual mail including heavier packages from Amazon and other delivery services, a delay that has already affected a small-business owner along his route.“This kind of delay of service is voter suppression, plain and simple,” Sasha said. “Not a single person in my station of around 50 employees believes this is anything other than active sabotage, and that includes supporters of the president.”Another carrier in rural North Carolina said his station has started to receive each day’s mail from the sorting plant a few hours earlier than usual. According to the carrier, who spoke under the condition of anonymity, this change almost certainly means that some letters and packages are being left at the plant each day, cutting off some of his most remote customers from supplies or medicine.These issues mirror backlogs that are accumulating around the country: even small post offices are reporting backlogs of up to 10,000 mailpieces, while some postal union officials have also reported that senior leadership are taking away their mail sorting equipment.DeJoy has also enrolled about 400 post offices in a pilot program that prohibits postal clerks from hand-sorting the morning’s mail before letter carriers leave the station to deliver it. Any letters that were not automatically sorted by the station’s machinery are simply left at the station and delivered on some future day, if the carriers get around to it. The union that represents letter carriers has filed a national-level grievance against the program, saying the program unduly restricts carriers’ ability to get the mail out.In response to a request for comment, a USPS spokesperson referred the  to a set of remarks DeJoy released last week in which he said he was “vigorously focusing on the ingrained inefficiencies in our operations” and promised to “aggressively monitor and quickly address service issues”.But for employees like Mark, the postal carrier in Pennsylvania, whose station is taking part in the pilot program, the changes have only led to the massive mail buildup and weeks-long delays.

But the ones that did best had shut themselves off from the world to varying degrees. And a fresh outbreak of cases in New Zealand last week suggests coronavirus can evade even tight controls.Experts say the lack of special border measures in the UK ahead of lockdown was a “serious mistake” that significantly increased the pace and scale of the epidemic. Even now, the UK’s quarantine measures – for selected countries and with limited enforcement – appear to be nowhere near as comprehensive or effective as those used by other island nations.Stringent border controls helped New Zealand eliminate Covid within three months. Prime minister Jacinda Ardern sealed its borders to all but its own citizens in March and has kept them closed with a handful of exceptions. All new arrivals have to spend two weeks in quarantine, originally paid for by the government but now self-funded.The country declared itself Covid-free in June, and until this month the few new cases identified were among travellers in quarantine. Last week, though, a new cluster emerged in Auckland, with 37 cases reported so far. Authorities have not been able to trace its origin tests so far show it is not linked to either the March-April outbreak or the known imported cases.477 cases 7 deathsTaiwan’s experience of Sars meant it was prepared to act fast. In February it banned visitors from China, and in March from the rest of the world. It was one of the first places where life returned to something like normal. Now, all new arrivals spend two weeks in quarantine – non-residents in designated hotels, where they stay in one room, with a “digital fence” monitoring their location, and regular check-ins about health and temperature required. Fines for breaching quarantine are up to a million Taiwanese dollars. Business travellers can apply for a shorter quarantine period if they get a negative Covid test.344 cases10 deathsMauritius is one of the few countries that hasn’t seen a local transmission for months, thanks largely to an extremely strict quarantine regime. Borders were sealed in March, and apart from Mauritians stranded abroad, remain closed. Every new arrival has quarantined for 14 days. The shut-down devastated the tourism industry, and authorities are working on reopening, possibly with airport testing for all.After borders closed in late March,Cuba’s underfunded but well-staffed healthcare system helped with track and trace, and controls were strictly enforced. The island has been largely Covid-free since June and in July, in need of foreign currency it reopened hotels on off-shore islets, promising a virus-free holiday. Few visitors have yet returned."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e38dc0d91cc80284cf37eeed5673a6545515141f/84_190_4827_2896/master/4827.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d207d3299f2976d9ebe8ace4c0b0fff0","title":"by delaying the new zealand election jacinda ardern appears magnanimous and conciliatory","story":"Keeping the date while her own party’s polling was sky-high would have looked like self-interest instead she has been praised for her leadershipAt its heart, democracy is about participation. And yet, there have been serious questions about the quality and quantity of public engagement expected in this year’s general election, given the Covid-19 crisis overshadowing everything at the moment in New Zealand. Prime minister Jacinda Ardern has therefore made the right decision to delay the election by a month.The problem is that with Covid-19 restrictions in place due to the re-emergence of community transmission, together with the increased public focus on the health crisis, a normal election campaign cannot adequately take place. Yes, it’s possible that the mechanics of voting may have been able to be offered next month, but elections are supposed to be about more than just ticking a box.A full democracy also needs a free and fair exchange of political ideas and debate.These are suppressed when the public and political parties cannot legally participate in such longstanding electoral activities as door-knocking, public meetings, and generally having face-to-face contact. Moreover, the inclination to pay attention only to the immediate health crisis means that politics takes a distant second place, which is not useful when we also need to be talking about crucial issues such as climate change, economic inequality, or the housing affordability crisis.With voting due to start soon, the legitimacy of the election was likely to be questioned, especially because a number of political parties – including the main opposition party, National – have suffered from the government soaking up all the attention in their management of the health crisis.Shifting the election by four weeks was a relatively easy task for the PM, given that the date had not yet been officially actioned (it had merely been pencilled in). In choosing 17 October, Ardern has cleverly gone for the “Goldilocks option” – as three dates were suggested to her by the Electoral Commission (19 September, 17 October and 21 November).Keeping the election date early, when her own party is polling sky-high would have looked like self-interest. By pushing it out she appears magnanimous and conciliatory and, as a result, she’s receiving plaudits. The decision reiterates Ardern’s strong decision-making and leadership skills that have helped the country get through the health crisis.In reality, she had no choice but to go to a later date, especially with her own deputy prime minister informing the governor general that the majority of parliament was demanding a later election. So, by shifting the date by only a month, Ardern has blunted all criticisms, while yielding the least possible ground to opponents.Will the delayed election create more room for Ardern’s Labour party to fall in the polls? After all, the government now has more time to experience problems with their management of the health crisis, as well as an economic recession that is expected to be more advanced by the time the new election date arrives.Ardern’s political capital and reputation are such that a month’s delay is unlikely to change anything at all. Even an erosion of the government’s health management reputation probably won’t reduce their chances of winning the election. And the declining economy won’t be blamed on the government.It’s too early to say how their fortunes might change as a result of the new date, but a shift of a few percentage points is highly possible and could still make a huge difference. Hence, while the extra month of campaigning might not change the fact that Labour looks almost certain to be governing after election day, it may end up affecting whether they will need either of their current coalition partners to stay in power, or if they can finally achieve the historic first of being able to govern alone.• Bryce Edwards is a senior associate at the Institute for Governance and Policy Studies at Victoria University, Wellington, New Zealand"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ee83c99d70e6f54a5898fb0e395a3b94b9f95ae/0_8_5472_3286/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3574f0b8d7562abda0552bd790efe3e5","title":"israel and uae open phone link after historic deal","story":"Connection of phone service represents the first concrete sign of the agreement made last week to establish diplomatic ties A telephone service between the United Arab Emirates and Israel has begun working as the two countries opened diplomatic ties, part of a deal brokered by the US that required Israel to suspend its contentious plan to annex the West Bank.UAE foreign minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan called his Israeli counterpart, Gabi Ashkenazi, in what Israel hailed as an important step.Congratulating the UAE on “removing the blocks”, Israeli communications minister Yoaz Handel issued a statement on Sunday saying: “Many economic opportunities will open now, and these trust-building steps are an important step toward advancing states’ interests.”Associated Press journalists in Jerusalem and Dubai were able to call each other from both landline and mobile phones registered to Israel’s country code +972 from around 1.15pm.Also on Sunday, Israeli news websites that had previously been blocked by UAE authorities, such as the Times of Israel, the Jerusalem Post and YNet, could be accessed without using means to bypass internet filtering in the Emirates.In the UAE, a federation of seven sheikhdoms on the Arabian Peninsula, a recorded message in Arabic and English would typically play prior to Sunday saying calls to +972 numbers could not be connected. The advent of internet calling allowed people to get around the ban, although these too were often interrupted.Some in Israel used Palestinian mobile phones with +970 numbers, which those in the UAE could call.The connection of phone service represents the first concrete sign of the deal between the Emiratis and Israelis.Israel and the UAE announced on Thursday they were establishing full diplomatic relations in the US-brokered accord.The historic deal delivered a foreign policy victory to President Donald Trump as he seeks re-election and reflected a changing Middle East in which shared concerns about arch enemy Iran have largely overtaken traditional Arab support for the Palestinians.Palestinians say it puts a just resolution of the Middle East conflict even farther out of reach by undermining an Arab consensus that recognition of Israel only come in return for concessions in peace talks. That removes a rare source of leverage for the Palestinians.The agreement will make the UAE the third Arab country, after Egypt and Jordan, to have full, active diplomatic ties with Israel. The UAE and Israel announced it in a joint statement, saying deals between the two countries were expected in the coming weeks in such areas as tourism, direct flights and embassies.Early on Sunday, the Emirates’ state-run WAM news agency announced a UAE company had signed an agreement with an Israeli company for research and study of the coronavirus pandemic.The move has sparked anger among some who see it as a betrayal of longstanding efforts to establish an independent state of Palestinians. In Pakistan, hundreds of Islamists rallied on Sunday to denounce the Emirati-Israeli deal. The Jamaat-e-Islami party chanted slogans against the US and burned effigies of Trump. They also set ablaze American and Israeli flags.The deal also has enraged Iran and Turkey, regional rivals of the UAE.On Sunday, the chief of staff of Iran’s armed forces called the UAE’s decision a “disaster”. Mohammad Hossein Bagheri urged Abu Dhabi to “revise” its position.“If an incident happens in the Persian Gulf and violates the national security of the Islamic Republic of Iran, even a tiny bit, and we see it from the UAE, we will not tolerate it,” Bagheri said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c485c9c2fed98924384ed6aff6b25d1ed88b9e9/0_1_4666_2801/master/4666.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0127764cd36264adaef95672f910dcf9","title":"coronavirus live news new zealand postpones election italy closes nightclubs","story":"In New Zealand, Bryce Edwards, a senior associate at the Institute for Governance and Policy Studies at Victoria University, Wellington, writes that Jacinda Ardern’s move to delay the election is smart politics:Keeping the election date early, when her own party is polling sky-high would have looked like self-interest.

Macron had brought forward the (re-)opening of Puy du Fou (after coronavirus lockdown). Now they are allowed to create coronavirus clusters,” Greens party national secretary Julien Bayou wrote on his Twitter feed.Culture Minister Roselyne Bachelot denied that Puy du Fou owner Philippe De Villiers, a conservative former cabinet minister who has made two presidential bids, had received special treatment. “No favours were given at Puy du Fou,” Bachelot said on BFM television on Monday.She said open-air events for more than 5,000 people could get the go-ahead provided they apply inidual seating, strict social distancing and mandatory mask-wearing.In China, partygoers in Wuhan packed out a water park over the weekend for an electronic music festival that is part of the region’s efforts to revive its economy as it recovers from coronavirus. The park - which local media says has capped attendance at 50 percent of normal capacity - is offering half price discounts for female visitors.A performer in a stage show at the front of the water waved at the crowd, packed close and waving their arms back, some snapping photos on phones protected in plastic pouches round their necks.Another performer on a water jet board entertained his audience by hovering above them with sparks shooting from his back.Some of the crowd had donned life jackets, but none of the tightly-packed partygoers were seen to be wearing face masks as a DJ in bright yellow headphones played on stage.The first known cases of COVID-19 emerged in Wuhan late last year, a city of 11 million people, before the virus spread across the world, killing hundreds of thousands and crippling economies.Now, to try and boost the local economy, the Hubei government has been offering free entry to 400 tourist sites across the province.China has largely brought its domestic epidemic under control, but sporadic outbreaks and a summer of severe flooding have exacerbated the economic fallout.In the US, Alexandra Villareal has been reporting from Austin on how Covid-19 has highlighted the city’s homelessness crisis and presented support workers with an agonising dilemma:At the Austin Resource Center for the Homeless (Arch), visitors seeking day services – restrooms, showers, internet – couldn’t just walk into the facility anymore, a “heartbreaking” tradeoff to shield the men sleeping there, explained Amy Price, director of development and communications at Front Steps, which manages the Arch.“You don’t want to have barriers that keep people from getting help.

But AFP reports that Abe’s own ill-health may be behind his absence.Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, whose first term in office ended in part for health reasons, sparked fresh speculation Monday about his well-being with an unexpected, hours-long hospital visit.Abe emerged from the Tokyo hospital where he was previously treated for ulcerative colitis more than seven hours after he entered, and left by car without saying anything, according to TV footage of local media.His previously unannounced visit to a hospital in Tokyo on Monday morning prompted a local media frenzy and comes after weeks of speculation about his health...While Japan has seen a comparatively small coronavirus outbreak compared to the world’s worst-hit countries, Abe has been criticised for several policy flubs in handling the crisis.His programme to distribute cloth masks to each household was widely mocked, and he was forced into an embarrassing U-turn on distribution of stimulus funds.His approval ratings have sunk during the crisis, though the country’s ided opposition have regularly failed to capitalise on falls in Abe’s ratings.Hi. That’s all from me, Caroline Davies. Handing over to my colleague Archie Bland now. Thank you for your time. Hong Kong reported 44 new cases on Monday as the government announced an extension to social distancing measures aimed at controlling further spreading of the virus, which has seen a resurgence in the Asian financial hub since early July.While the number of daily cases have come down from triple digits in recent weeks, authorities have cautioned residents from becoming complacent, warning that the situation remained “severe”.Restrictions including a ban on dining at restaurants from 6pm and the mandating of masks in all outdoor public areas are set to remain in force for a further seven days until August 25, the government said in a statement on Monday.Out of the 44 cases recorded on Monday, 31 of them were local transmissions, Reuters reports.Since late January, over 4500 people have been infected in Hong Kong, 69 of whom have died. Monday’s figure was down from Sunday’s 74 cases.In Ireland, the health minister said he has had no conversations with his public health team about implementing other local lockdowns and the government’s intention remains to lift two-week restrictions in the counties of Kildare, Offaly and Laois.The country’s health officials will meet today to decide if further measures are needed to slow a sharp increase in the spread of coronavirus that the government and officials have described as deeply concerning.“Nothing like that has been proposed at the moment... The plan is for the restrictions for the three affected counties to be lifted midnight on Sunday. That’s still the intention,” Stephen Donnelly told national broadcaster RTE. Indonesia reported 1,821 new coronavirus cases on Monday, bringing its infection total to 141,370, data from government’s COVID-19 task force showed.The Southeast Asian country also added 57 new deaths, taking its fatalities to 6,207, the highest death toll in Southeast Asia. Here is a handy explainer on New Zealand’s first locally transmitted coronavirus outbreak in more than three months, put together by Reuters. Almost a week after the discovery of the outbreak, its origin remains a mystery.Genome testing of the latest batch of infections, called the “Auckland August cluster”, has confirmed it is a new strain, probably from Australia or Britain.The major question is how it entered a country that has been largely closed off for months.The earliest case authorities have identified to date is a 50-year-old man who works at an Auckland cool store owned by U.S.-based Americold Realty Trust, who became ill around July 31. The man’s case, along with those of three direct family members, was made public by prime minister Jacinda Ardern on Aug. 11. Family members had travelled to other cities, including Rotorua and Hamilton, and visited an aged care centre while symptomatic. There are now 78 active cases, of which 58 are linked to the Auckland family cluster. The remaining 20 cases are people in mandatory quarantine facilities after arriving in New Zealand from abroad.How Covid-19 returned is the major question still facing authorities, given the international border has been closed to foreigners since March and all returning New Zealanders have been forced into mandatory 14-day quarantine. Contact tracing and genomic testing found no links to the country’s border entry points or managed quarantine facilities yet.The government earlier suggested that the virus may have entered the country through freight, with a focus on the Auckland Americold facility where several infections have now been reported. Surface testing is underway at the facility. Australian authorities are conducting genome testing on workers from a Melbourne Americool facility, seeking any connection. New Zealand’s health chief Ashley Bloomfield has since said said human-to-human transmission is the most likely culprit, with surface transmission “unlikely”.Opposition parties and government critics have pointed to a breach at one of New Zealand’s quarantine facilities as the likely conduit for the virus.Ardern has locked down the country’s biggest city, Auckland, and brought back social distancing restrictions more widely for two weeks. She has also delayed a national election due next month. Testing has been ramped up in the community to record levels and Aucklanders and others have been strongly advised to wear masks in public. Border testing at airports and ports has increased and quarantine staff are being tested more regularly.Thousands of members of a church linked to a coronavirus cluster in Seoul have been asked to quarantine, South Korean authorities said on Monday.Over the weekend the capital and neighbouring Gyeonggi province banned all religious gatherings and urged residents to avoid unnecessary travel after a burst of new cases sparked fears of a major second wave, AFP reports.South Korea reported 197 new infections on Monday, taking its total to 15,515, its fourth consecutive day of triple-digit increases after several weeks with numbers generally in the 30s and 40s.The largest current cluster is centred on the Sarang Jeil Church in Seoul, headed by Jun Kwang-hun, a controversial conservative pastor who is a leading figure in protests against President Moon Jae-in.A total of 315 cases linked to the church had been confirmed by the end of the weekend, officials said, making it one of the biggest clusters so far, and around 3,400 members of the congregation had been asked to quarantine.A Philippine government minister has tested positive for coronavirus five months after an initial diagnosis, authorities said on Monday, as experts investigate whether he had been re-infected.Interior Secretary Eduardo Ano, who is helping to spearhead the country’s virus response, said he returned a positive test on Saturday after experiencing flu-like symptoms last week, AFP reports.He was first diagnosed with COVID-19 in March, but did not show any signs of the disease at the time.People infected with coronavirus build up antibodies starting about a week after infection or the onset of symptoms, research has shown.But scientists are still unsure whether the body systematically builds up enough immunity to ward off a new attack by the virus or, if it does, how long such immunity lasts.Some studies have shown that patients who recover from the virus may lose their immunity within months, or even weeks.Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said experts were analysing Ano’s symptoms, his previous positive test, and laboratory results to see if this is a second infection.“Let’s not call it a re-infection. The scientific community has not yet accepted that a re-infection occurs,” Vergeire cautioned.The country’s virus caseload has surged above 160,000 - the highest in Southeast Asia - with more than 2,600 deaths. More than a quarter of the infections remain active."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4331538.1597589597!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"schools have no legal basis to force students to attend religion classes","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tCampaigners argue that children in State-funded schools  face obstacles exercising their right to opt out of religious instruction. Photograph: iStockSchools have no legal basis to compel students to attend religious instruction classes, according to a report to be published this week.Atheist Ireland has sent a 21-page legal opinion to the Department of Education on the right to opt out of religious instruction under provisions contained in the Constitution.The group has long maintained that children in many State-funded schools are either forced to attend religious instruction or face obstacles in exercising their right to opt out of these classes. The legal opinion by barrister James Kane states that pupils have a right to not attend religious instruction, under article 44.2.4 of the Constitution.Mr Kane’s view is that schools are obliged to use their State funding to facilitate this right which encompasses, at the very least, the right to leave the classroom during religious instruction while remaining supervised. The document states that there is “decent legal argument” that these pupils must be taught another subject.The legal opinion also says that the State-approved religion course for Junior Cycle students was shaped with input from religious bodies who, in turn, designed guidelines for the supplementation of this course with Catholic faith formation and development. “It is impossible in those circumstances to see any justification whatsoever for withholding the right of a student to opt out of such a course,” it states.“Teaching Catholic instruction during the State religion syllabus, without offering a supervised opt out, represents an unlawful, systematic and stark attack on the right to not attend religious instruction in State-funded schools.”Jane Donnelly of Atheist Ireland said the legal opinion will empower atheist and secular parents to exercise their right for their children to not attend religious instruction classes.“In the past, most Irish schools simply coerced children to attend these classes. Since Atheist Ireland highlighted the right to not attend, many schools have instead put obstacles in the way of not attending,” she said.Ms Donnelly said in many cases Catholic schools say students can sit at the back of the religion class due to resource shortages, while Education and Training Board schools maintain that students must attend religion class if they are teaching about more than one faith.“This legal opinion shows that these excuses have no legal standing. You have the right to not attend religious instruction, whether it is about one religion or many religions, and your school must at a minimum supervise you and ideally give you another subject within their existing resources,” she said.“This is a constitutional right. It is not up to schools or even the Department of Education to decide how you exercise it. Your child does not have to attend classes that you reasonably believe are inconsistent with your atheist or humanist convictions.”Principals in a number of Catholic schools, however, insist they are highly inclusive and seek to integrate students from all faith traditions and none.They point to the Economic and Social Research Institute which has found an “overwhelming majority of parents and students find their schools to be well-managed and welcoming”.The department has also said that under the Constitution and the Education Act of 1998, parents have a right to have their children opt out of religion classes if they wish. However, State-run secondary schools are refusing to implement a department directive aimed at protecting the rights of students who opt out of religious instruction by offering them alternative tuition. These schools say they do not have resources to provide alternative tuition.Atheist Ireland said it will continue to assist parents to exercise their constitutional rights in Irish schools as part of its campaign for a secular education system."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"\u0026lsquoExtensive Irish commitment to data centres\u0026rsquo could cause cost to consumer, study findsBuyers may want to go green, but for those travelling long distances the range is smallReform needed to safeguard \u0026euro6bn income while promoting electric vehicles, economist warns"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: North Atlantic\u0026rsquos top predator now shares island with 13 other speciesMichael Viney: The wayside ashes of the west stand as defiantly healthy emblems of their kindInidual ants are certainly not smart, but their group wisdom may exceed our ownMichael Viney: Irish numbers have more than doubled since the counts of Operation Seafarer in 1970Michael Viney: A predator denning in parks, gardens and wasteland gets mixed responsesA beefed-up, independent National Parks and Wildlife Service would be just the ticketMichael Viney: Wild grasses have loved the mood swings of our climate this yearAnother Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 target"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

When family or groups of friends who know each well have met up after not seeing each other for a long time, many have forgotten the need to keep their distance, not shake hands or kiss on the cheek. I cannot over-emphasise that it is imperative for everyone to keep following the rules.”The gradual easing of France’s strict lockdown from May 11 triggered a feeling of over-confidence, Mr Véran said. Beach parties and revellers packing into crowded bars set off local surges of infections, especially on the Mediterranean and Atlantic coasts, and several big cities.Paris and Marseille are now on the French authorities\u0027 high-risk “red” list and Britain has re-imposed a two-week quarantine on travellers arriving from France from Saturday.If the surge in infections continues, Jean Castex, the prime minister, has warned that France could be forced into a second lockdown which it could ill afford.The government is renewing appeals for people to observe social distancing and wear masks. Masks are compulsory in indoor public spaces throughout France, and most cities, including Paris and Marseille, have now made them obligatory in the most crowded outdoor areas.Some doctors have suggested that the rise in cases is misleading because France has ramped up testing. Of the roughly 3.5 million tests carried out in the country since the start of the epidemic, some 2.5 million were done in June and July alone. In May, only hospital patients were tested. Now, anyone can get a free test, even without a prescription. However, Mr Véran stressed that increased testing did not explain the surge. “This is a real increase, the signs are worrying and cannot be attributed to testing alone,” he said.France now has more than 330 clusters of infection, more than 30 of which were detected in the past two days. About half of the clusters have been linked with workplaces, according to a report by the Public Health Directorate.This suggests that many infections are being transmitted in factories or offices. A smaller proportion of French people are working from home than in the UK.About a third of the clusters have been linked with public or private gatherings, especially “extended family get-togethers,” according to the report.The number of coronavirus patients in French hospitals is creeping up and now stands at 4,864, including 374 in intensive care. More than two-thirds of intensive care patients are on the Riviera, in the Paris area, in northern France and in French Guiana, which borders Brazil.Pascal Crépey, an epidemiologist at one of France’s largest public health colleges in the western city of Rennes, said: “It is undeniable that the situation is becoming gloomier, but it isn’t dramatic yet. We are better equipped now than we were in March to monitor the epidemic and act in consequence.”   More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"britains universities have become indoctrination camps reckoning","story":"The Institute for Fiscal Studies recently announced that 13 universities in the UK face a very real prospect of going bust. Like all such announcements in the higher education sector the news was clearly meant to be received with a gasp of fear. Worse, the IFS warned that it is our least prestigious universities that are most at risk.I don’t know about you, but on reading this news I immediately put my head in my hands and cried, “Oh no. Not our least prestigious universities. Take anything but that.”There are many oddities about our higher education system. Oddest is the presumption that the more universities there are and the more people go to them, the better our country will be.Tony Blair was merely the most notorious proponent of this idea. His target of 50 per cent of young people going to university was achieved last year. Is our country noticeably smarter or more successful as a result? Many would say not. In some ways I would say it is noticeably stupider.One clue as to why lies in the old truth identified by Kingsley Amis. Which is that in certain areas – and universities are the most pronounced – more means worse. You may expand the sector, certainly, but at some liminal point everything you get is worse.Visit the universities at the bottom of the league tables and you will see this for yourself. Universities in towns you knew had a cathedral but are surprised to learn also have a campus. These are full of students being charged top-dollar to learn ‘international relations’ or ‘journalism’ at best. That is to be trained in non-disciplines for careers that barely exist.There might be some excuse if they were, as a by-product, being trained to be open-minded, perceptive and creative iniduals. But for many people university is an indoctrination-camp, not a place for mental stimulation.Those who attend them are being factory-farmed to have the same boring and malevolent views. For example, you have to have been educated at a British university to go home and inform your parents that “gender is a social construct”. Or that the whole curriculum is “colonial” and needs to be “decolonised”.Rather than improve British societies, the automatons churned out by our universities are merely clogging up our country with bad thinking which becomes (when the graduates are employed) massive bureaucratic distraction-techniques. That British universities expand and make money out of this venture does not endear them to all of us.And that is before you get to the racket of ‘international students’. The loss of foreign students in the coming academic year is one of the threats to certain universities that the IFS has identified. But those who warn of this fail to acknowledge what this ‘threat’ reveals.Certainly there are some universities and courses where the presence of international students is a recognisable boon. Historically it has been a magnificent form of ‘soft-power’ among other things.Of course the unions and other spokespeople for the university sector rarely talk of it in such terms nowadays. They suggest that their love of foreign students is simply an expression of their personal liberal internationalism.In fact, for most universities foreign students are a piggy-bank. Their eyes grow beady at the opportunity to charge fees above the cap imposed by the government on British students.Nor is this avarice limited to the universities at the bottom of the league tables. Look at the experience given to many postgraduate students at universities like Cambridge and you will hear a familiar story.Sky-high fees, and the expectation of a full immersion in university life translates into a foreign student being rinsed for cash with the rarest imaginable meetings with a supervisor.Behind the scenes many university staff are embarrassed by this. But the finance departments and overpaid vice-Chancellors love to use the resulting charts to prove that their university is growing.Many could do with contracting, or simply disappearing altogether. And the era of Covid has put some of this into a newly imaginable perspective. Just as the likely diminishment of foreign students in 2020 has exposed UK universities’ over-reliance on this as an income stream, so the necessity to go online reveals a deep question about the nature of the modern university experience.Today if you have access to the internet you can follow a university course at any of the great universities of the world. Many of these – including from American Ivy League schools – are free online. Many other lectures – often far more cutting-edge and free-thinking than those found on our increasingly doctrinaire campuses – are free at the click of a button.Once students begin shelling out fees for a virtual university experience, questions will be raised. “Is this really the best education I can buy?” and “Is such an education worth ‘buying’ in the first place?” Traditionally the greatest universities have given an experience which is about so much more than just lectures.As one retired academic friend said to me recently, the real secret of university education is that the students educate each other. That is one of the ideals of the true, genuinely liberal university system. The lecturers provide the impetus, and the students cogitate amongst themselves.But as the universities have become greedy they have also become more cautious. Not just more cautious – indeed reluctant – about academic freedom (see the seemingly endless restrictions on this at Cambridge). They have also become more cautious in every other way about protecting themselves, certain of their employees and specifically their freedom from litigation.So in their precautionary Covid-aversion they are organising virtual freshers’ weeks, support bubbles and more to try to pretend that the class of 2020 will be a normal one. But it won’t be in any of them. And for some it may be the last.If that is so then we should not mourn the fact. The problem would not have been that 2020 was the year when the students dried up. The problem would be that 2020 was the year that the students saw through the universities and wondered – like everyone else – whether what they get for the down-payment is returned in any currency of value.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"conservatives determined drive natural supporters revolt","story":"The barricades are going up, but it’s those who oppose them who are restive. Under a scheme backed by millions of pounds of government grants, councils have been given permission to close off streets, narrow roads, widen pavements, and impose cycle lanes, all without the need to consult residents. The aim was to relieve pressure on public transport, which at the time the Government was desperate to dissuade people from using.Now, amid the general wreckage of lockdown, not only are we left with bankrupt rail, bus and tube services - still largely empty, propped up with billions of taxpayer subsidy - but state-mandated road congestion, and crazy schemes that are inciting a slow-burning revolt across the country.In Islington, the council plans to turn a third of its roads into “people-friendly streets” by the end of the year. Residents have staged multiple demonstrations complaining of the increased congestion and pollution they say has resulted from road closures. In Welwyn, the constituency of Grant Shapps, the Transport Secretary, locals were furious that road-narrowing and new one-way systems put visitors off coming to the high street, turning the place into a ghost-town.“Vigilantes” had taken to dismantling overnight the grim plastic barriers that now seem to line half the streets in the country. Hundreds have signed petitions against road closures in Cambridgeshire, local Tories have joined the resistance in Lambeth, and seemingly everywhere there is frustration, even fury, against local authorities that have failed to foresee the consequences of their arrogant and poorly thought-through measures.It should have been obvious that the pandemic would result in an increase in the use of cars relative to other forms of transport, although cycling has become more popular too. I can’t be alone in having used the opportunity of lockdown to buy a new car: when spontaneity is crushed by the diktats of social-distancing, driving offers the freedom to go anywhere you like without having to mask up or lather yourself with hand sanitiser.Yet on my road, the council has decided to erect a “bus gate” - not a gate, but a camera to ensure only buses go through - forcing all traffic onto a gridlocked major road. In the London suburbs, where my parents live, anti-car measures are being foisted on places where cycling is impractical because the distances are too great.It is tempting to blame councils for this fiasco. They are the originators of inappropriate 20mph zones, excessive bus lanes, sign clutter, and many of the other absurdities that have conspired to make UK roads among the most congested and confusing in Europe. But this is a mess of the Government’s making. Mr Shapps determined that Covid was an emergency that necessitated significant changes in road layouts, implicitly endorsing the ideology of anti-car fanatics. Yet most people need their cars to get around: indeed, drivers are natural Conservative supporters.

Spinning off from those discussions, here are four things to watch for at this year’s Democratic National Convention. This year there will be no arena packed with tens of thousands of cheering supporters, no ticker tape and balloons falling down onto the anointed presidential nominee. Thanks to coronavirus the convention will be almost entirely virtual, a made-for-television spectacle that will see delegates tuning in remotely and speeches made to camera.The core of the convention will be two hours of broadcasts on Monday to Thursday, programmed to catch the prime time TV audiences from 9pm to 11pm on US eastern time. Some strategists believe that by ditching the archaic full-day schedules of conventions of old and focussing on engaging films and short speeches voters may actually be more engaged. The start of the year seems like a lifetime ago in today\u0027s US news cycle but the first three months of 2020 saw a bruising set of primaries as candidates tussled for the presidential nomination which laid bare a party split.The race dynamics soon settled into a leading light on the party’s Left, Bernie Sanders, squaring off against the flag carrier for the moderates, Mr Biden, the former US vice president. Since Mr Biden pulled into an unassailable delegate lead in the spring lots has been going on behind the scenes to make sure progressives fall in line and vote for Mr Biden. Mr Sanders takes to the stage on Monday and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the 30-year-old congresswoman and left-wing icon, speaks Tuesday. How fully will they embrace the centrist Mr Biden? Or will the splits still be on show? The polls, for whatever they are worth, make for dire reading for Donald Trump right now. Behind in national polls. Behind in the swing states. Viewed poorly on his handling of the pandemic.But consistently when Americans are asked in surveys who they trust more to lead the country out of this economic slump Mr Trump comes out on top against Mr Biden. One of their big messages the Biden camp will be trying to land over the convention is that Mr Trump’s mismanagement of the pandemic equals mismanagement of the economy.They are seeking to pin the blame for the staggering economic drop-off - more than 55 million people have filed for unemployment benefits since Covid-19 struck the US - on the Trump administration’s failings. The Democrats are all too aware that Mr Biden is facing ruthless attacks from the Trump campaign about his age, 77, and whether his mental acuity is not what it once was.An endless stream of clips of Mr Biden tripping over his words is being pumped out by his opponents online, alongside nudge-nudge comments about his mental sharpness. The convention and his acceptance speech on Thursday is a chance for Mr Biden to bury the ‘Sleepy Joe’ image being pushed by Mr Trump and project strength in office. An energetic, free-flowing address at a moment when more voters than usual are tuning in would help undercut the Trump camp narrative ahead of the November 3 election. You can listen to The \u0027s weekly political podcast, Chopper\u0027s Politics, on the audio player above or subscribe for free on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or your preferred podcast app.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 17th august 2020","story":"Belarus opposition supporters raise their mobile phones with flashlights during a symbolic minute of silence near the State TV and radio company during a protest rally against police violence recent rallies of opposition supporters, who accuse strongman Alexander Lukashenko of falsifying the polls in the presidential election, in central MinskCoronavirus latest: Oxford and German vaccine trials in race for jab this year, says UK chairTravel updates: Greece and Croatia at risk as travel map shrinksPolitics latest news: Minister Penny Mordaunt warns that generation has  \u0026#39lost out\u0026#39 as she seeks meeting on exams debacleComment: We need to re-examine our exam systemItaly shuts down nightclubs as coronavirus cases rise among youngGovernment facing Tory rebellion as MPs demand U-turn on A-level exams assessmentWorld\u0026#39s largest naval exercise sparks more friction between US and ChinaChina administers coronavirus vaccine to volunteers before clinical trials concludeHong Kong police commander no longer travelling to UK for training after programme suspendedComment: Trusting a bizarre algorithm over teachers like me is a terrible mistakeTemperatures in America\u0026#39s Death Valley reach 54.4C -

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Japan\u0027s economy shrank at its fastest pace on record between April and June as trade and consumer spending dropped off sharply in response to the coronavirus pandemic.The world\u0027s third largest economy saw output drop 7.8 per cent in the second quarter, official data released on Monday showed. At an annualised rate, the fall was 27.8 per cent, the worst ever recorded in Japan.However, it is not as severe as the economic hit taken in a number of other countries.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesLast week the UK reported its own record slump, with gross domestic product (GDP) shrinking 20.4 per cent in the second quarter alone.Spain, which implemented a stringent lockdown, saw its economy contract by 21.8 per cent over the same period.France, Germany and the US are among other wealthy nations to have reported large falls in GDP this year as millions of people stayed home and businesses shut down to slow the spread of the virus. The Eurozone economy shrank by a record 12.1 per cent and the wider EU by 11.9 per cent in the second quarter of the year.Unlike many other countries, Japan has not implemented a lockdown, instead relying on an effective contact tracing system and government advice to limit social contact.The country had experienced relatively few cases and deaths but a recent increase has prompted the government to introduce some restrictions.Japan\u0027s economy was already struggling before the pandemic, shrinking 0.6 per cent between January and March, following a 1.8 per cent contraction in the previous quarter.The latest figures show that exports fell at an annual rate of 56 per cent between April and June, while private consumption dropped at an annual rate of just under 29 per cent.Japan\u0027s economy is heavily reliant on exports which dried up as trading partners shut down their economies. Experts predicted that Japan\u0027s recovery will be slow.Expect to see a GDP bounce-back in the current quarter to the tune of 6 perc ent, thanks in large part to the very low base set in Q2, said Miguel Chanco, senior Asia economist at Pantheon. The recovery, overall, will be more gradual than the steepness of the downturn, due to the second Covid-19 wave having over domestic demand and the still-uneven relaxation of restrictions globally.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But I just couldn’t get into the groove.”However, the Welsh actor revealed that she has since got back into writing and will write with Corden again in the future.“It may not be Gavin \u0026amp Stacey, but it’ll be something,” she said.Lovecraft Country author: ‘The whole of the US was incredibly racist’How I Met Your Mother shows what happens when TV finales go wrongLove letters from comedians to comedy clubsReturning on Christmas Day 2019, the Gavin \u0026amp Stacey special was the most watched TV episode of the decade after 11.6 million people tuned in.The episode’s cliffhanger final scene, which saw Nessa (Jones) propose to Smithy (Corden), won the Must-See Moment award at the 2020 TV Baftas.Since then, the cast have been asked whether the show would come back with more episodes, with actor Larry Lamb, who plays Mick Shipman, saying that the comedy would return.“I think it would be pretty cruel to leave us on that cliffhanger,” Lamb said. “After the response it got at Christmas, you can more or less be certain that, sooner or later, there will be more.“I’m sure the BBC can persuade Ruth and James to write more, so it’s a question of when, not if.”Gavin and Stacey\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Japan\u0027s economy shrank at its fastest pace on record between April and June as trade and consumer spending dropped off sharply in response to the coronavirus pandemic.The world\u0027s third largest economy saw output drop 7.8 per cent in the second quarter, official data released on Monday showed. At an annualised rate, the fall was 27.8 per cent, the worst ever recorded in Japan.However, it is not as severe as the economic hit taken in a number of other countries.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesLast week the UK reported its own record slump, with gross domestic product (GDP) shrinking 20.4 per cent in the second quarter alone.Spain, which implemented a stringent lockdown, saw its economy contract by 21.8 per cent over the same period.France, Germany and the US are among other wealthy nations to have reported large falls in GDP this year as millions of people stayed home and businesses shut down to slow the spread of the virus. The Eurozone economy shrank by a record 12.1 per cent and the wider EU by 11.9 per cent in the second quarter of the year.Unlike many other countries, Japan has not implemented a lockdown, instead relying on an effective contact tracing system and government advice to limit social contact.The country had experienced relatively few cases and deaths but a recent increase has prompted the government to introduce some restrictions.Japan\u0027s economy was already struggling before the pandemic, shrinking 0.6 per cent between January and March, following a 1.8 per cent contraction in the previous quarter.The latest figures show that exports fell at an annual rate of 56 per cent between April and June, while private consumption dropped at an annual rate of just under 29 per cent.Japan\u0027s economy is heavily reliant on exports which dried up as trading partners shut down their economies. Experts predicted that Japan\u0027s recovery will be slow.Expect to see a GDP bounce-back in the current quarter to the tune of 6 perc ent, thanks in large part to the very low base set in Q2, said Miguel Chanco, senior Asia economist at Pantheon. The recovery, overall, will be more gradual than the steepness of the downturn, due to the second Covid-19 wave having over domestic demand and the still-uneven relaxation of restrictions globally.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We’ve decided to attack things head on. Very proud of @ThisIsUsWriters.”He also confirmed that the series would adhere to the “same planned ending”, and would use the “same route to get there”.This Is Us focuses on the lives of the Pearson family across different timelines.

All money raised from the auction will go to The Independent’s appeal partner, The Felix Project, London’s largest food surplus distribution charity.

This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Swindon is now the fourth worst affected area in the UK when measured as a proportion of population, having seen a 200 per cent increase in new cases over the last seven days.It has nearly as many new cases per person as Leicester, which was the first place to see tougher local restrictions put in place after the nationwide lockdown lifted.The UK as a whole remains a long way off its peak levels from April and May, when daily new cases frequently reached above 5,000.Yet local spikes could see the recent upwards trend continue if not brought under control, as has been the case in other countries like France and Spain.Having endured a big surge in cases during the early stages of the pandemic, London has since seen its number of daily cases drop at an even greater rate than the rest of the country.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama. Their simplicity belies their seductiveness velvety and intense, they draw you in, never quite revealing their secrets.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”. You can’t sit on them, but look at them.

Several roads were closed and the surrounding area was cordoned off“I feel my life has been completely ruined, I can’t get into any universities with such grades or progress further in my life,” the New College Stamford student said. “I would like to know how this has happened.”In response, Mr Gibb, the schools minister for England, who was also appearing on the programme, said: I do feel for you. This should not have happened to you. We don\u0027t want you to have to go through this stress of having to go through an appeal to find out what’s going to happen to your career.“None of this is satisfactory, the best system is for people to take their exams – that’s what should have happened. It’s what we wanted to happen, but we had to take a very difficult decision in March to cancel exams and what we didn’t want was for young people like Nina to have to delay a year.”Starmer urges government to scrap ‘injustice’ of A-level results“The reason for the standardisation model is to ensure we have consistency between schools and we don’t have grade inflation.”Mr Gibb was then challenged over why the system was not working by BBC presenter Chris Mason, as the student told the minister “you have ruined my life”. But the education minister added: It won\u0027t ruin your life, it will be sorted I can assure you. The trouble with these models – when you have a model that standardises grades across the country there will be imperfections in it.”“That’s why we have introduced very robust appeals processes that schools will trigger for candidates like Nina. Those appeals will happen very swiftly and universities have said they will hold offers open until 7 September and we’re working through that now.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIt comes as a new analysis of grades in England shows that marks awarded to A-level pupils at sixth-form colleges this year were sent below their average in recent years.There are concerns that the algorithm for awarding A-level grades penalises pupils at larger institutions, such as colleges, by moderating their grades more harshly than smaller institutions.How the government’s ‘chaotic’ approach to A-level exams unfoldedStarmer calls on ‘invisible’ Boris Johnson to take responsibilityStudents protest against A-level grades fiasco for second dayHaving received advice from CCEA and listened to the concerns of school leaders, teachers, parents and young people, I have decided that all GCSE candidates will now be awarded the grades submitted by their centre, Northern Ireland education minister Mr Weir said.Standardisation is normally a key feature of awarding qualifications in Northern Ireland and across the UK. However, these are exceptional circumstances and in exceptional times truly difficult decisions are made.But the Northern Ireland executive has so far resisted reversing its decision to award A-levels based on algorithmic moderation. Stormont is set to be recalled from its summer recess to debate the issue.In England, the government has said it is drawing up an appeals process for A-level students who feel they have been given the wrong grade. In Scotland education secretary John Swinney reverted all grades to those recommended by teachers after days of protest.Explaining his decision to make changes for GCSEs but not A-levels, Northern Ireland\u0027s Mr Weir added: I am conscious that for GCSEs, unlike at A-level, we do not have system level prior performance data for this group of young people.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I am also mindful that unlike A-level, many GCSE pupils will not have access to previous public examination outcomes to inform any appeals process.I have, therefore, acted now in advance of the publication of GCSE results to ease anxieties, reassure young people and their families and ensure that every inidual candidate receives a grade that recognises the work they have done.He added that with regards to A-levels and AS qualifications, unlike GCSEs, they were standardised on the basis of candidates\u0027 prior performance in public examinations.I would encourage those pupils dissatisfied with their result to contact their school or college to work through the appeals process, which is free this year.In England, almost 40 per cent of A-level grades were cut to below teachers\u0027 productions. Research by the the Sixth Form Colleges Association shows that colleges were hit hardest, with concerns that independent schools with smaller cohorts benefited the most from the system.The SFCA said it looked at 65,000 exam entries in 41 subjects from colleges and determined that grades were 20 per cent down on the most recent three years for comparable students in those colleges.The organisation says its analysis of 41 subjects did not find any where the results were above the average from the previous three years.Ofqual, the exam regulatory, not only failed to produce broadly similar results, but has in fact produced worse results in every single subject the association said. Ofqual says the objective of its standardisation process is to ensure that national results are broadly similar to previous years. Opposition leader Sir Keir Starmer has told Boris Johnson that he needs to take personal responsibility and fix the situation.

A Department for Education spokesperson said on Sunday night that Ofqual continues to consider how to best deliver the appeals process to give schools and pupils the clarity they need.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Help is desperately needed to support wildlife rangers, local communities and law enforcement personnel to prevent wildlife crime. Donate to help Stop the Illegal Wildlife Trade\u0026nbsphere.\u0026nbspThe Independent employs reporters around the world to bring you truly independent journalism. To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.A new study has revealed that one of the world’s most endangered species of elephant is under greater threat than previously thought. Africa’s forest elephants have been decimated by the illegal wildlife trade, with more than two thirds killed in the last decade. There was estimated to be around 90,000 left, with about half of that population believed to be in Gabon.However, a study by a 10-member international research team fears that the total remaining population could be between 40 to 80 percent smaller. The study, published in PLOS ONE, shows the urgency of The Independent’s Stop The Illegal Wildlife Trade campaign, which calls for an international effort to clamp down on the illegal trade of wild animals.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFunds raised will pay for vital wildlife protection projects implemented by the campaign’s partner charity Space for Giants. This will work to help stop the poaching and illegal trafficking of animalsThe illegal trade of wild animals is the world’s fourth largest criminal enterprise, after arms, drugs and human trafficking.The forest elephant has been ruthlessly hunted by poachers in the rainforests of Democratic Republic of the Congo, Cameroon and Gabon. The ivory is smuggled to Asia where it is in high demand for intricate carving. However the full extent of the bloodshed has been hidden from the world’s gaze.Professor Lee White, Gabon’s Minister of Water, Forests, Oceans, Environment and Climate Change, welcomed The Independent’s Stop The Illegal Wildlife Trade campaign and said that the world must act now to end wildlife crime, to both protect forest elephants but also for greater global security.“The illegal trade of wildlife wreaks havoc in Africa and even threatens to destabilise whole countries,” White said. “The ivory trade is linked to terrorists and criminal syndicates who also smuggle gold, guns and people at Gabon’s border with Cameroon.”White says some poachers in Gabon “take a ‘shoot on sight’ approach” to confrontation with law enforcers, and have become “much more violent and threatening” in the past five years. “It is partly because we have become more professional and aggressive, but also because there’s now much more involvement of organised crime.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe new report provides insight into the species’ devastating decline. Biological anthropologist Nelson Ting co-led the study, which revised the population size by using a method known as genetic capture-recapture, which involves assessing dung piles. Ting said “Gabon was thought to be a population stronghold, but even our most optimistic results suggest a smaller population size. Our research shows how endangered they really are. “Forest elephants are among the most threatened animals. More information is key to figuring out the best ways to prevent extinction.”Forest elephants are the smaller, rarer cousins of the giant savannah elephant, and their densely wooded habitat makes them harder to study and count.White, a biologist born in Manchester, spent his childhood in Uganda where he developed a passion for elephants. “Tragically, nobody had noticed that Gabon had lost about a third of its forest elephants. You can’t fly over and see the carcasses because they’re hidden”As poachers continued to empty the country of its forest elephants, White spearheaded a war against them - and against ivory trafficking in particular.The threat to forest elephants has been greatly reduced, but danger still looms large. Gabon has maintained its usual level of frontline protection throughout the Covid pandemic in case of any upturn. Elephants can also be killed during conflict with local people, often after trampling or eating crops. Space for Giants is working with the National Parks Agency and Assala Energy over three years to build 23 miles of electrified farm boundary fences to keep elephants from danger, and to protect people’s livelihoods.Several fences have already been completed. These types of projects provide local communities with a sustainable way to earn a living, and are designed to incentivise the communities to help protect their primary source of undeveloped wealth capital, Gabon’s rich bioersity and forest elephants.White was appointed to Gabon’s cabinet by President Ali Bongo Ondimba, whom he calls “one of the planet’s greenest heads of state”, and today he works to not only save forest elephants for their own sake, but to also protect the health of the whole planet.Space for Giants Founder and CEO Dr Max Graham explains: “Forest elephants are incredibly important for the health of our whole ecosystem and in fighting global warming. “They play a role in the dispersal of seeds, which have to go through their gut to germinate, and the unique way in which they forage creates a forest canopy structure that is perfect for carbon sequestration. “They take out the young growth and leave what is longstanding, which has been attributed to creating carbon stock worth billions.”The survival of forest elephants is a human issue, inextricably linked to issues around environment, poverty, law enforcement and finance.White believes that international effort is needed to end the poaching war being waged against Africa, and that wildlife crime needs to become a new global priority in order to protect species and prevent another global pandemic.“If we don’t deal with the illegal wildlife trade we’ll have criminal and terrorist groups rampaging across the continent, destabilising countries,” says White. “But we also cannot continue to aggress nature and think there will be no price to pay. “If we continue to cut down forests, kill animals and destroy ecosystems the consequences will be catastrophic. We must be stewards of nature if we want it to keep being friendly”.Stop the Illegal Wildlife Trade\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

People are rightly sickened by these scenes. The reckless actions of a small few can have huge repercussions on everyone else.”The event at the bar was publicised online as a “very boozy Baked Brunch with your buds” and the €25 tickets included a free shot, with the party starting at 1pm.According to the person who filmed the viral video, when he and his wife arrived at 3pm tables were spaced apart and food was being served directly to people, in line with the Irish government’s social distancing guidelines.But over the afternoon as the music got louder “social distancing disappeared” and “the atmosphere started to be crazy”, he told RTE, prompting the couple to leave for fear of catching Covid-19.The same day, 200 new cases of the virus were reported across Ireland, the largest daily increase since the start of May. A further 66 cases were reported on Sunday, and two-thirds of the new cases over the weekend were people aged under 45.The acting chief medical officer Ronan Glynn is due to meet with the Taoiseach and other senior government ministers on Monday to discuss the situation and to consider re-imposing some lockdown restrictions.“The phased reopening of the country has afforded people the opportunity to socialise with each other again,” Dr Glynn said. “However, some are doing this recklessly and undermining the efforts of the majority of people around the country who are following public health advice.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This pandemic isn’t over just because we are tired of living with it.”Restaurateur Jay Bourke, who is involved with running the Berlin D2 venue, told RTE he was “absolutely mortified” by the scenes on Saturday.However, having checked CCTV, he said he was satisfied most customers were following the rules and the venue was observing Covid-19 rules, including running at 20 per cent capacity and maintaining social distancing.But the chief executive of the Restaurants Association of Ireland, Adrian Cummins, said the video was a “slap in the face to front-line workers who are putting their life on the line during this pandemic”.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.It was a particularly cold June morning in northern Kenya when rangers working in Loisaba Nature Conservancy first spotted a large male elephant limping near a watering hole. The rangers began monitoring the elephant, a large bull with enormous tusks, who was nicknamed Alan. Max Silvester, a Conservation Volunteer in Loisaba, said “the injury was likely the result of a botched poaching attempt. Alan had some of the biggest ivory I have seen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesA wounded animal is liable to attack anything that comes close to it, and the elephant charged at the team who assembled to help him. “I was very afraid because he was huge,” said Loisaba’s Security Assistant Rita Orahle, who assisted KWS vet Dr Dominic Mijele.“He was trying to scare us by trumpeting because he knew he could not run away due to his injury”, said Dr Mijele. “I darted him and it became obvious that the wound was caused by a bullet which had entered the animal’s right foot, having first grazed the trunk.“After cleaning the injury and administering antibiotics I gave him an antidote and he walked off. If the elephant had been left untreated he would have been dead within a week.”All hunting is illegal in Kenya, a nation that has led the war against the plundering of wildlife, and ivory trafficking in particular. The Independent\u0027s Stop The Illegal Wildlife Trade campaign was launched to call for an international effort to clamp down on poaching and the illegal trade of wild animals.Funds raised will to pay for vital wildlife protection projects implemented by the campaign’s partner charity Space for Giants. This will work to help stop the poaching and illegal trafficking of animals.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The communities around Loisaba understand the value of wildlife, and the happy result is the conservancy is a zero poaching zone - a fact that even pachyderms themselves might understand. Silvester told The Independent “it’s likely that Alan the elephant was shot elsewhere, but the intelligence of this bull, in moving quickly to a place of safety Loisaba Conservancy, allowed the rangers and the vet team to assure his wound was treated quickly and successfully.“He continues to roam Laikipia as a testament to his forefathers, the huge tuskers before him.“Orahle adds “the rangers continued to monitor the bull, and he was last spotted in early August looking happy and not limping at all.”Alan was not the only animal to be rescued in Loisaba that day. The ranger team rushed off to treat a giraffe with a split hoof. In the midst of a raging global pandemic Loisaba’s wildlife operations continue to protect endangered species, preserving bioersity and supporting local communities in the process.The wildlife veterinary unit that saved the elephant is sponsored by Sheldrick Wildlife Trust, working in collaboration with KWS, to attend wildlife cases in Laikipia.

I am proud to “confess” that I have been on two foreign holidays in the past month, utilising legal air bridges, and I am far from ashamed.The myth in coronaphobic Britain is that overseas trips are for the elite, rich and powerful: If you dare get on a plane to low infection-rate locales such as Italy or Greeceyou’re not showing solidarity to the Covid cause and risk spreading the damned virus.That rhetoric hasn’t been helped by the Government’s feeble air bridge policy, which puts any country with a region experiencing a minor outbreak at risk of being added to the quarantine list.The reality is the total opposite. If you and me are shamed into staying home now, travel WILL soon be limited to the elite, rich and powerful.The democratisation of tourism has been one of the most pleasing developments of this new millennium, with the explosion of budget airlines causing price wars and a move towards all-inclusive package deals.Yet our ability to keep seeing the world is now in real peril.Airlines are on their knees. Hotels are closing at an alarming rate. Many popular European tourist destinations remain ghost towns.Goons in the Extinction Rebellion movement have already talked weak parties including Labour into backing the introduction of more travel taxes.All for a virus that, albeit nasty, killed just a fth of the number of people who died from run-of-the-mill flu and pneumonia in the final week of July in the UK.If you’re one of the many people currently tormented over whether to take the risk and book that break, I implore you to go for it.On a practical level, both my week-long trips to Europe were pure ecstasy, with responsible and reassuring safety measures that never came close to overshadowing the glorious experience of being overseas again, something unimaginable just a couple of months ago.Yes, the airport is a little more torturous than usual and you do have to keep the mask on at all times.When I arrived on the Greek Island of Mykonos last week, I was random Covid tested at immigration, causing a touch of nervousness while I waited -hours for the result.  And you’re not going to be able to dance or listen to loud music at night.But the benefits are endless. Your favourite tourist destinations are emptier than they’ve ever been during peak season, you’ll always get into your favourite restaurant, and the staff on British Airways have never been happier to see you on board.Most importantly,more of us choose to fly now, we will help keep affordable travel and tourism viable for years to come.I was one of just three people in total in a gym this week for a pre-booked, hour-long session.When we were booted out the moment our  minutes were up, the entire fitness centre was shut for a -minute deep clean.While we should, of course, encourage cleanliness, these types of self-imposed and over-the-top rules will make it impossible for most businesses to survive long-term.A healthy dose of common sense should be required, too.THE Prince of Woke emerged from his latest multi-million pound Calornian mansion this week to preach to the world, yet again, about racism.In an online conversation with Rashad Robinson, president of US civil rights group Colour Of Change, the usual clichés and judgy mumbo jumbo were out in full force.He spoke of “acting, rather than just saying”, going to “the root of the problem” and charity being “like bringing a bucket of water to a forest fire”.But what Harry didn’t talk about was his own notorious past of racist language and cultural insensitivities.After all, this was the Duke who was forced to undergo racial sensitivity training in the Army after using the P-word to refer to an Asian soldier.And this was the Duke who wore a Nazi unorm to a friend’s birthday party.If Harry wants to help spark real change and debate, it would be much more effective for him to stop the meaningless platitudes and talk publicly in some detail about his own journey.How did he realise that using the P-word as an adult is unacceptable in any circumstances How did he learn that larking about with a swastika around your arm as a member of the Royal Family is just plain wrong The Duke does have a valuable contribution to make about the need to stamp out everyday racism in society – one that will involve less pious preaching and more examination of his own notorious follies and foibles.LIKE Emily Maitlis, Naga Munchetty has become such a powerful BBC News presenter she believes the rules of the public service broadcaster no longer apply to her.First, the Breakfast presenter threw impartiality out the window to express a negative view about the US president Donald Trump.Now this week she has been caught pocketing cash to appear in corporate videos for the troubled car company Aston Martin.The Sun’s TV Editor Andy Halls revealed Naga didn’t follow protocol by seeking approval from her Beeb bosses and did not declare the fee she received either.That would be a sacking offence for most Beeb newsreaders.But Naga received the most minor slap on the wrist, with BBC bosses saying, “She has been reminded of the risk of conflict of interest when undergoing external engagements”.No wonder other BBC news presenters don’t want to follow the rules either.The corporation’s weak approach is asking for trouble.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I’m a pretty young woman, lots of red hair, and everyone expects me to be stupid when I walk into a meeting for the first time.“I’m not stupid and most people know that now, but I still like to be underestimated because it gives me an edge. It gives me a bit of stealth.”Since September , Ms Rayner has declared £, worth of cash donations and support from unions including GMB, RMT, Unite, CWU, Usdaw and Unison, some of whom supported her successful deputy leadership campaign.Tory MP Tim Loughton, a former education minister, said: “The cat’s out of the bag about Labour’s deputy leader. She sees no evil, hears no evil and speaks no eveil when it comes to unions messing up.“It is no wonder the unions are happy to continue funding the Labour party when as far as they are concerned they can do no wrong. Welcome back to the s.”A source close to Ms Rayner said: “This is a desperate and embarrassing attempt by the Tories to distract from their disastrous handling of the coronavirus, the economy and exam results.“Angela is immensely proud of her long record of standing up for undervalued and underpaid keyworkers against bad bosses and a Tory government that doesn’t care about them.”GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She was tall, bleached blonde and had big boobs. They shared a room and spent most of their time on the beach windsurfing, sailing or doing other water sports.Andrew is claimed to have one day told them his guest had stepped on a sea urchin and he had urinated on her foot as a remedy.Cathy said Andrew joked the royal member has done its duty - adding the Duke was great fun and very undemanding.Andrew is said to have stayed on the island for two weeks and left a tip of £, being one of the only guests to do so.Cathy said Andrew would visit at least once more along with Epstein and Maxwell, and he would also fly over the island on his way to Monserrat.

He added: Lots of people came and went.The couple claim they were warned by Maxwell never to disturb Epstein while he was in his bedroom - adding it was absolutely forbidden. They explained Epstein would have daily massages, which victims have since explained were just a guise for sexual abuse.Cathy and Miles became increasingly concerned about the number of young looking girls coming and going from the island, many parading around topless or naked when Epstein was in residence.Cathy explained they were suspicious but didnt have any proof of wrongdoing - and claim never to have seen any of the sex parties described by victims.Miles said: I took the view that what went on behind closed doors was not my business and it is not my place to judge. If anything was going on we didn’t want to know.He added they also turned down some requests by Epstein to smuggle guests onto the island by boat, but Maxwell allegedly told them what Jeffrey wants, Jeffrey gets.The couple quit in  after Epstein was arrested in Florida the previous year - later being sentenced to  months in jail for solicitation of prostitution.The couple also claimed during their very first visit to the island during an interview they had to leave due to a VIP guest arriving, later being told that it was also Prince Andrew.Prince Andrew is claimed to have first met Andrew in  after being introduced to him by Maxwell, who he knew from her time in the UK.Little Saint James is the centre of many claims about Epsteins revolving door of young girls who Maxwell and others are alleged to have procured for him to abuse.Andrew strongly denies any allegations against him and said he had no knowledge of any wrongdoing while friends with Maxwell and Epstein.The Duke of York is accused of sleeping with Epstein sex slave Virginia Roberts at Maxwells townhouse in London in March  when she was just .The infamous picture allegedly showing Andrew, Ghislaine and Virginia together was taken on the same night.Andrew has said he has no memory of the photo being taken - and has suggested it could be a fake.She also claims to have had sex with Andrew at Epsteins mansion in New York and on his private island of Little Saint James.Andrew has admitted visiting the island once, but former staff and victims have claimed they saw him there on multiple occasions. Maxwell has been accused of taking part in the grooming and abuse of dozens of underage girls by Epstein.She is currently in prison awaiting her day in court after being arrested by the FBI in July and strongly denies all allegations.The current charges against her relate to allegations by three alleged victims in particular.She has pleaded not guilty, and her lawyers have accused the victims of trying to turn her into a scapegoat since the death of Epstein.Epstein killed himself in his cell at a New York prison in August last year while awaiting trial on charges - depriving many victims of justice.Victims allege they were duped with claims she was recruiting models of masseurs - only to them be abused by the Epstein and Maxwell.Cathy and Miles claim that Maxwell bragged to them she was the queen bee and the one in charge - describing her as being very friendly, but rather arrogant.

Its completely wrong that the Gov, DFE and Ofqual are not singing from the same hymn sheet, especially on appeals.Ofqual have got to get their act together and be much more visible.Just days before they are meant to get their results, politicians in Northern Ireland announced they would ditch the computer model for GCSEs, after the huge fallout from A-level results last week.Peter Weir, the education minister, said the decision would not delay the results and that there wasnt enough data about GCSEs in order to use the computer model.He said today: These are exceptional circumstances and in exceptional times truly dficult decisions are made.I am conscious that for GCSEs, unlike at A-level, we do not have system level prior performance data for this group of young people.I want to encourage as many young people as possible to remain in education or training post- and to know they have another opportunity to engage with education.I am also mindful that unlike A-level, many GCSE pupils will not have access to previous public examination outcomes to inform any appeals process.I have, therefore, acted now in advance of the publication of GCSE results to ease anxieties, reassure young people and their families and ensure that every inidual candidate receives a grade that recognises the work they have done.Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham is to write to Englands exams regulator to initiate legal action over the A-level results process.He tweeted on Monday: So it looks like the Government ARE digging in and standing by their deeply flawed system.In that case, I will be taking legal advice this morning and have instructed leading Counsel. I expect to be writing to Ofqual later today to initiate action.Scorned students have mounted a flood of legal challenges against their botched A Level grades too.Curtis Parfitt-Ford told the BBC today: We are confident that what this algorithm is doing is grading schools and not students.Which we think goes outside of Ofquals statutory remit.We are confident we have a strong case. We hope we wont have to take it to court, butwe do, we are ready to do so.They have also raised £, through crowdfunding to help with the case.And Labour big beast and ex Education Secretary Alan Johnson told The Sun that Mr Williamson should be sacked.He said: “This job was totally beyond his capabilities. He should go. They may try to blame it all on Ofqual, but this was Gavin Williamson’s mess and he has to take the bullet.”The Department for Education has insisted that results had to be moderated to stop grade inflation going off the scale.A Downing Street source insisted the PM does still have confidence in Mr Williamson.It comes as some Ofqual board members reportedly want controversial algorithm results overturned and replaced with predicted grades, the  reported.Sources said some members of the Ofqual board believe the algorithm has caused a haemorrhaging of public opinion on qualications.The board members reportedly want to U-turn and use teachers predicted grades for students, as happened in Scotland.MPs have also called for Prime Minister Boris Johnson to step in and end the unfairness related to grades, The Times reported.Using the predicted grades instead of the algorithm is reportedly seen as the least bad option.We are in a position where it is politically unacceptable to continue with the algorithm - this is the view of some people on the Ofqual board, a source told the .Bill Watkin, chief executive of the Sixth Form Colleges Association, told BBC Breakfast that, according to a study by the organisation, the algorithm has failed.He said: Weve just done a study and we looked at , entries, which is almost half of all the A-level entries in sixth-form colleges, across  A-level subjects - every single A-level subject.In every single one of those , entries in  A-level subjects, they came out lower than the previous three-year average. So the algorithm has failed.Steve Chalke, founder of the Oasis Academy Trust, has called for GCSE results to be postponed.Mr Chalke told the BBC:: I think there should be a delay. I think there should be an apology for the A-levels, a humble apology, and I think that there should be a delay around the GCSEs because it is better to reflect on what has happened, for Ofqual and for the Government to reflect and then respond having consulted with people outside of their own systems, with senior educationalists, rather than react and then regret, and then withdraw and then put a plan forward etc.After reflection, it may be decided it is the best possible answer that were left with, but lets not make all the same mistakes over the GCSEs.Grammar school headteacher Kay Mountfield said schools like hers have seen % of their student cohort downgraded.The head of Sir William Borlases Grammar School in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, told BBC Radio s Today programme that most of their kids had their grades marked down.She said:Only  students out of  have kept their grades. Eighteen were downgraded by three grades,  by two grades and theyre scrabbling about for university places that just arent there.Seventy of my students have not had their first choice of university - normally that would be about five, or  maybe, students. But I have  grammar school students, from a range of backgrounds, who have worked very hard for their grades, struggling to get into universities.A Department for Education spokesperson said last night: “Hundreds of thousands of students have received a calculated grade that will enable them progress to the next stage of their education or into work.“We have been clear that we want to build as much fairness into the appeals process as possible to help young people in the most dficult cases and have been working with Ofqual to achieve that.Ofqual continues to consider how to best deliver the appeals process to give schools and pupils the clarity they need.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A -page study by the Learning and Work Institute and Carnegie UK Trust – shows % support the Government’s policy of increasing the legal pay floor to two-thirds of the average median pay by .The investigation – based on a survey of more than , businesses and carried at the start of the coronavirus crisis – found captains of industry believe a higher minimum wage could help boost productivity.But they said ministers should support firms with extra help for investing in skills and training, or offering a temporary cut in national insurance contributions.  However, % of employers with higher levels of low pay said planned increases would have a negative impact on their business. Employers in sectors hit hard by the Covid- pandemic such as hospitality and retail were also more likely to fear a negative impact on their business. Learning and Work Institute deputy director Joe Dromey said: “Increasing the minimum wage could eradicate low pay and help to tackle in-work poverty. “Our research has shown that not only is a higher minimum wage popular among workers, it is supported by most employers too. “The Government can still deliver on their commitment to increase the minimum wage. “But with higher unemployment as a result of the coronavirus crisis, we need to ensure that employers are supported to adapt.” Carnegie UK Trust head of advocacy Douglas White said: “That most employers support a higher minimum wage is encouraging: even before the onset of the pandemic, there were too many workers struggling on low pay. “The economic challenges caused by Covid- mean it is even more important that future decisions around the minimum wage are ambitious in delivering better pay for low-paid workers, while recognising the real challenges that many businesses are experiencing and providing them with essential support.” Fair pay campaigners welcomed the study. Living Wage Foundation director Katherine Chapman said: “This report shows that despite the challenges businesses face, many are still willing and able to commit to fair wages.  “In recent months we’ve continued to see employers sign up to pay a Real Living Wage that covers the cost of living, because they recognise that supporting workers now will allow them to emerge stronger from this crisis.” Shadow Business Minister Chi Onwurah said: “The coronavirus pandemic has exposed the deep inequality in this country, with far too many people still underpaid and in insecure work, and the number of people on zero hours contracts at a record high.

The ex-frontbencher, who led Labouraposs economic policy for four-and-a-half years, called for a long term shakeup to “end landlordism and restore housing as a right”. Companies and trusts should be blocked from buying homes and there should be a legal limit on the number of properties inidual landlords can own, he demanded. Mr McDonnell, who was at Jeremy Corbynaposs side at the top of Labour from September  to April this year, outlined the plan in his aposClaim the Futureapos project, which, he says, offers a “radical and optimistic vision of what we can build together”. Landlords were banned from booting out tenants to prevent a surge in homelessness at the height of the Covid- pandemic, but the halt is due to end on August . Mr McDonnell said: “Many people are becoming desperately worried that they will now face evictions. Many cannot rely upon the goodwill of their landlords to prevent them losing their homes. That’s why it is premature to end the ban on evictions, especially with so many jobs being lost and incomes drying up. Councils will face a torrent of people turning up on their doorstep as homeless. The ban on evictions must be extended for as long as the risk of Covid persists. The reality is at least another year but we also need a reform of the law to end the ease by which landlords can deprive a family of their home.  He highlighted Claim the Futureaposs recommendations to restrict greedy property tycoons buying up homes during the virus crisis. He added: Questions also have to be asked about why companies should be allowed to make large scale profits from people’s need for a roof over their heads. “Housing should be a right for all, not an investment opportunity for a few.” ,],totalVotes:,votesToShow:,mentometerId:,publicationId:,callbackUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  status,voteActionUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  vote,closed:true,closedMessage:This poll has been closed!,hideResults:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : #

According to reports, some members of the Ofqual board want to ditch the system for moderating the predicted grades awarded by teachers so results are standardised across the country.Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has consistently argued moderation was essential to prevent rampant grade inflation after actual exams were cancelled amid the coronavirus crisis, insisting there can be no reversal.However, critics have complained the algorithm used by Ofqual to make the adjustments had penalised pupils in schools in more disadvantaged areas, while benefiting those in private schools. For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE.  The Dailyreports that some Ofqual board members believed it had resulted in a haemorrhaging of public trust in the results, and reverting to teacher assessments - as the Scottish government had done - may be the least bad option.Those concerns are likely to strengthen the hands of teaching unions who are pressing for teacher assessments as the only fair way forward. In all, almost % of all A-level grades in England were marked down as a result of the standardisation process, and ministers are now braced for another backlash when the GCSE results - which are moderated using the same algorithm - are released on Thursday. It comes as Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer called on the Prime Minister to take personal responsibility for fixing the issue, accusing him of having been invisible throughout the turmoil.While the Conservative former education secretary Lord Baker of Dorking urged ministers to delay the publication of GCSE results, until the problems with A-levels had been resolved. Boris Johnson had been expected to be in Scotland this week on a camping holiday with his fiancee, Carrie Symonds, and their baby son Wilfred.But with Labour demanding he hold a press conference to explain how he intends to right the historic injustice suffered by pupils who had had their grades marked down, Downing Street was unable to say whether the trip would go ahead. The Department for Educationhas said it is continuing to work with Ofqual to build as much fairness into the appeals process as possible to help what it described as the most dficult cases.  Ofqual continues to consider how to best deliver the appeals process to give schools and pupils the clarity they need, a DfE spokesman said in a statement issued late on Sunday. However, the position was not helped by the decision of the exams regulator to issue guidance over the weekend on students using the results of mock exams as the basis for an appeal, only to withdraw it hours later. No explanation was given for the move, although Labour said that it undermined assurances given to pupils by Mr Williamson about the appeals process. Mr Williamson last week gave a triple-lock commitment that pupils could use the highest result out of their teacheraposs predicted grade, their mock exam, or sitting an actual exam in the autumn. But the Ofqual guidance saidthe mock result was higher than the teacheraposs prediction, it was the teacheraposs prediction that would count. Meanwhile, the former Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable, who served in coalition with the Conservatives under David Cameron, warned the issue would cause the Government lasting harm. Speaking on BBC Radio aposs The Westminster Hour he said one act of ill will in particular could rebound on ministers.

The MP said he got this wrong after the Sunday Mail revealed he was running the line as assistant referee  miles from his Moray patch. The Tories insisted he will carry on with his part-time job - but will avoid future clashes like this, our sister paper the Daily Record reported.In a statement, Ross said: I was selected to officiate a game before I was invited to the VJ Day event, and I offered apologies in advance that I could not attend.I had not anticipated there being an official VJ Day event given the current restrictions due to Covid, but when it became clear there was a conflict, I should have asked to be taken off my game. I got this wrong and I apologise. Ross was selected to officiate the Kilmarnock v St Johnstone game at Rugby Park, a job which comes with a fee of around £. The decision to go ahead with the game was branded absolutely extraordinaryand piled pressure on the MP who has only just been appointed leader of the Scottish Conservative party. Ross, who represents an areas with strong military links, will donate his fee to the Help for Heroes charity. Ross continued: I am a proud and passionate supporter of the Armed Forces and our veterans. I represent a constituency with a signicant military presence and have worked with local and national charities supporting veterans throughout my time as an elected representative. I made an error of judgement here and apologise to any veteran who was offended.  I will be donating my match fee from the game to Help for Heroes, a charity that does so much across the country supporting our veterans every day of the year.Moray SNP MSP Richard Lochhead said: The reason why Douglas Ross failed to turn up at the VJ Day th Anniversary ceremony in Forres was deeply disappointing and very disrespectful especially given Morayaposs long association with the armed services. I am glad that, upon reflection, he has apologised.A pattern is emerging with Mr Ross who repeatedly fails to understand the impact of his actions and in this case he failed to grasp the signicance of an event that was attended by civic leaders, local serving personnel and veterans.

Furious teenagers yesterday demonstrated in Westminster after the exam system was plunged into chaos when two in five A-level marks were lowered. And England’s Education Secretary Gavin Williamson was urged by a Tory predecessor to delay this Thursday’s GCSE results amid fears pupils face the same “unfair” fate. About , teenagers in England, Wales and Northern Ireland should receive their marks. Scotland’s results came out on August . Schools assigned grades to pupils after exams were scrapped amid the pandemic. But A-level results day ended in farce as .% of teachers’ estimates were adjusted down by one grade or more by a computer algorithm. According to regulator Ofqual’s analysis, pupils in disadvantaged areas were marked down the most harshly. Labour leader Keir Starmer accused Boris Johnson of being “invisible in this crisis” and demanded action to right the A-level wrongs and stop GCSE results going the same way.And deputy leader Angela Rayner said: “Where is the Prime Minister hiding  He must take personal ­responsibility for the A-levels results crisis and in the next  hours he must explain to students, parents and teachers precisely how he will end this historic injustice.” National Association of Headteachers union general secretary Paul Whiteman said time was running out to prevent a second scandal. He said: “The Government needs to get a grip and take rapid action to restore confidence, fairness and stability, for young people who received A-level grades but also those receiving GCSEs in days to come.” Former Education Secretary Lord Baker, who oversaw the launch of GCSEs in the s, insisted the results should be postponed. He said: “I urge the Education Secretary to instruct Ofqual not to release GCSE results on Thursday as their algorithm is flawed. The A-level results have produced hundreds of thousands of unfair and barely explicable ­downgrades. They have helped smaller private schools but hit the brighter students in a poorly performing state school.” He added: “If you are in a hole, stop digging. The results should be postponed for two weeks.  “The Government can then decide either to accept predicted grades or invite heads to resubmit new predictions.” There was further disbelief in Westminster after guidance for students in England seeking to appeal against their grades was suddenly withdrawn without explanation. Ofqual said on Saturday students could challenge the outcome on the basis of mock exam results, but the advice was taken down hours later. It said the policy was “being reviewed” by its board and details would be released “in due course”. The Department for Education declined to comment.  Shadow Education Secretary Kate Green blasted Government “chaos and incompetence” adding: “The Tories’ results fiasco is turning from tragedy to farce. “A credible appeals system should have been the Government’s first priority, but three days later there is absolutely no clarity on how young people can challenge unfair grades.” It came as hundreds of furious ­teenagers marched on the Department for Education, with dozens sitting on the ground at the front door. Protesters chanted “vote them out”, with many holding signs referencing the next election. Tom Loach, , retook his A-levels hoping to improve on the three Bs he got last year.

Playing fast and loose with the aspirations of hundreds of thousands of teenagers is another kick in the teeth for pupils. Cancelling exams and shutting schools to most students to halt the spread of the virus undoubtedly harmed teenagers’ education but most people understand that big decisions had to be taken in a hurry. What most people do not and will not forgive is the resulting chaos. Teachers often get it wrong when predicting grades yet they still know far more about inidual children than a criticised, controversial, condemned computer model. Every child is supposed to matter. It’s unforgivable that this Tory Government is writing off so many of them. Plane stupid Easing lockdown restrictions in areas where the virus rate falls is a recognition the danger ies between communities. And that exposes the unpopular contradiction in the Government’s blanket approach to other countries: Huge nations are treated as single threat zones, with visitors required to quarantine for a fortnight on ing eventhey stayed in places with few or no cases.

Connie Yates and Chris Gard feared they might never have another chance to be parents following their heartbreaking legal battle to save their son. But little Oliver Gard, known as Ollie, was born on August  weighing a healthy lb oz. Care worker Connie, , said their new son means they can smile again. Connie and her -year-old fiancé Chris became embroiled in an emotional legal and medical fight over Charlie, who suffered from a rare genetic condition. He was born on August ,  but became ill at just two-months-old. The pair tearfully gave up their legal battle to keep him alive in July  as his condition had deteriorated. At the time, they said Charlie had been able to live normallyhe had received experimental US treatment earlier but too much time had been wasted.  Charlie died on July , , a week before his first birthday. Ollie had a one-in-four chance of being born with RRMB mitochondrial depletion syndrome like his older brother. He had tests in the womb to seehe had the rare genetic condition, which affected Charlieaposs muscles and organs, but he was given the all clear. Chris, a postman, said losing Charlie was like someone had thrown a hand grenade at us and our lives.  He added: Ollie has lit up our lives. We are so, so lucky.Connie told the Daily Mail : It’s like we can smile again now and truly mean it, rather than just plastering on a smile to get through the day.The couple marked the third anniversary of Charlieaposs death this year by releasing butterflies at his graveside. However one refused to fly so they ed the following week and released it on what would have been Charlieaposs fourth birthday. As they stood at graveside, Ollie let Connie know he was ready to enter this world as she had her very first contraction.  Connie said it made her realise Charlie has a hand in their le and he’s still looking out for his mum and dad. Little Ollie made his entrance into the world at Queen Charlotte’s and Cha Hospital in West London which is one of the oldest maternity hospitals in Europe. Connie was in labour but ended up having a caesarean after her unborn baby’s heartbeat suddenly disappeared from the monitor. She thanked the amazing team who looked after her throughout her pregnancy.  They went above and beyond for us, from the geneticist who carried out all the tests to the midwe who stayed on after her sht ended so she could be with us. They were all wonderful and we are so grateful, Connie said. The familyaposs flat in Bedfont, south west London, is filled with mementoes of Charlie such as casts of his tine hands and feet, photographs and sketches. But Connie and Chris said Ollie will be his own person and not just Charlie Gard’s brother. They have also said they are lucky as some parents have been through the same turmoil never have another baby.

The swirling watery vortex was spotted at around pm today near Portishead. The liquid whirlwind was caught on video by Liza Manners who shared it online, Bristol Post reported. It was also captured by Russ Turneraposs nine-year-old son Will. Russ wrote on Twitter : Exciting stuff, caught the #funnelcloud over the estuary off #redclfebay between #Clevedon and #Portishead this afternoon at :. This was a big one, smaller one formed a bit later as the #thunderstorm moved away. Waterspouts are whirling columns of air and water mist caused by strong winds which extend from the base of the cloud to the water below. BBC Points West weatherman Ian Fergusson, a fellow of the Royal Meteorological Society, said: Itaposs an impressive sight. Iaposve seen a handful reported over that area in the past decade and this is certainly one of the most spectacular. Mr Fergusson said aposheavy showersapos grew quickly across North Somerset as they approached the Portishead shore from the southeast.  In doing so, these were quickly boosted by a localised wind pattern that created some aposspinapos in the lower atmosphere above Redclfe Bay, he added. As the shower grew, these winds created a vortex - the funnel cloud visible in photos. In turn, it reached to the sea surface, where a ring of spray confirms the apostouchdownapos. This means itaposs a phenomenon called a waterspout: a tornado over water. Keen weather fan Olly Ewers noted that the aposBristol Channel can quite often see funnel clouds due to sea breezes and winds from dferent directionsapos.

They were no longer allowed to use their HRH titles, had to close their popular Sussex Royal Instagram account and were forced to say goodbye to many of the charities and organisations they were passionate about. But while Meghan turned her back on a two-year stint in the Firm, it was all Harry had ever known and he left behind an entire letime of tradition and duty. There were reports that the couple were upset and disappointed by many of the Queenaposs demands when it came to working out the logistics of their non-royal futures, but a new book about the couple, Finding Freedom, claims there was one thing in particular that really hurt Harry. Authors Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand write: If his grandmotheraposs validation of his experiences served as encouragement, the most demoralizing aspect of the new deal was his being stripped of his honorary military appointments that had been awarded to him as a senior royal. As a retired serviceman, Harry would always be able to wear his medals, but no longer could he wear unorm as Captain General of the Royal Marines, Honorary Air Force Commandant of the Royal Air Force Bas Honington, and honorary Commodore-in-Chief of the Royal Navyaposs Small Ships and Diving Operations.  These roles had come to an end. A source told the authors: Thataposs been a tough pill to swallow, and the one that has been most painful to Meghan witness him go through. Itaposs the one that made Harry emotional. Shortly after the announcement was made Harry was allowed to wear his unorm for the last time when he attended the Mountbatten Festival of Music.

It struck me as odd, an adult engaging in a childhood pastime. Was I wrong! Adult colouring books have flooded bookshops everywhere in the last few years with their empty patterns of mandalas, animals and floral designs. But what makes them so popular  Colouring can help you channel your inner artist, de-stress and bring a sense of peace. But is there truly a benefit of colouring for adults  And does this pastime please and calm our brains  According to ­clinical psychologist Scott M Bea at ­Cleveland Clinic, Ohio, US, it’s all about refocusing our attention. “Adult colouring requires modest attention focused outside of self-awareness,” Dr Bea says. “It’s a simple activity that takes us outside ourselves in the same way as cutting the lawn, knitting or taking a Sunday drive.” How  Dr Bea cites three reasons why adult colouring can be calming. Attention flows away from ourselves with a simple absorbing act such as colouring. Your attention concentrates on the present moment. “In this way, it is very much like a meditative ­exercise,” Dr Bea says. It also relaxes the brain when thoughts are focused on a simple activity like colouring. “The dficulties of le evaporate from your awareness, and both your body and your brain may find this rewarding.” Low stakes make it pleasurable, especially colouring inside the lines.“It is hard to screw up colouring, and, evenyou do, there is no real consequence. Adult colouringcan be a wonderful escape, rather than a demanding test of our capacities,” he adds."},{"url":null,"title":"mirror newspaper tablet offer promotion","story":"NewsGet The Mirror free on tablet for two months*Its packed with breaking news, sport and entertainment - and is perfect during lockdownShareByDave Masters:,  APR Updated:,  APR News\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"News, views and top stories .

Lucy Ogilvie,  – whose bowel cancer spread to other organs – believes doctors “need to keep up to date” because a higher proportion of younger people are being diagnosed than ever before. She is now fighting for the right to use a treatment which is currently unapproved in Europe. Her rare stage four cancer is highly mutational and the mum-of-two was told at diagnosis she would live no longer than December but is determined to prolong her le for her daughters.  And having taken part in a targeted trial, as well as radiotherapy and multiple rounds of chemotherapy, Lucy, of Muswell Hill, north London, said sheaposs “running out of options”. “The problem is a lot of young people get fobbed off and donapost get the right diagnosis until itaposs too late,” she told the . Since her eldest daughter Aoe – whoaposs now  – was two, Lucy said sheaposd been going to her GP saying “I had blood in my stools and every single time I was told itaposs just haemorrhoids, go away”. “The last time I did that was December  – he gave me this stool sample test to do but he was so convincing it was haemorrhoids I just thought I wonapost bother doing that, which was really annoying in the end,” she said. The following April, Lucy began suffering from bad bloating, as well as pain in her lower abdomen, before doing a stool sample test which triggered a colonoscopy when the primary tumour was discovered.  “Either the GPs just totally donapost believe young people could get it or thereaposs some cost thing going on because it seems silly to not just let people have tests at the right time,” she continued. “When things change, like in the last five years itaposs grown exponentially the number of people getting diagnosed with [bowel cancer] – they need to keep up to date.” Having paid for a special type of molecular testing at Harley Street clinic Leaders of Oncology Care , not available on the NHS, Lucy is aware her tumour mutational burden is intermediate to high, and her oncologist believes immunotherapy could work for her. Itaposs a treatment which has seen people with stage four cancer cured – the trouble is itaposs not approved for use by the European Medicines Agencyfor her type of cancer. This means she would have to come up with the funding herself – which comes out at around £, every two weeks and she may need to be on it for as long as three yearsit works. Last week she set up a GoFundMe page and was blown away after raising £, in just  hours.She admits the chance of the therapy working is a long shot, but she is given hope by successful cases across the world and due to how much work her oncologist has put in to her cause. To prescribe someone unapproved medication, an oncologist must take results and research to the EMA board and fight their patientaposs corner to be allowed to even use it. Itaposs been a rocky road for Lucy over the last  months, and sheaposs already made it beyond the average time span for patients with her diagnosis. “At first you are just in shock and thereaposs a period of coming to terms with what youaposve been told,” she said, remembering May last year.  “Before I started treatment, I was really down for ages because everything felt like it was taking a really long time to start anything and I was starting to get really symptomatic. “My liver grew so large that I looked six months pregnant. “And I felt awful for a few weeks. Once you start treatment thereaposs that sense of purpose that youaposre doing something.” She said for the first year she was lucky because treatments “were kind to me, I didnapost really get bad side effects – they were effective and I felt really good”.  However, since lockdown and having left her job in advertising after her diagnosis, sheaposs seen “lots of hyper progression and now Iaposm starting to feel a bit symptomatic and thataposs harder because you want to do things”. “After a while of walking around or standing around, itaposs a bit like being pregnant, you just get really tired and need to lie down and thataposs how I feel at the moment.” In the meantime, sheaposs become something of an expert in everything around her disease and has found great support on social media.Through Facebook groups she has been in contact with not just patients but also oncologists in the US who have given her the latest reports and even trial write ups that she sends to her own oncologist in the UK.She said no matter how great your doctors are, an inidual patient is not their only focus, and “no one is going to advocate for you as much as you are”. “You have to be really proactive and understand the disease and what the options are and just be challenging and questioning the whole time. “I see people who arenapost like that and I can see that theyaposre not getting as good of care as they could be and thataposs just heartbreaking.” In July , Lucy was put on a trial which involved a “triplet of drugs” which reduced her cancer signicantly but her body built up resistance mechanisms and she switched to chemotherapy that October. She said for her first two rounds of chemo her oncologists were “pleasantly surprised” and by January  she was in “such a good place compared to last June”. At that point, she and doctors “took a gamble” with radiotherapy which proved “a disaster”. Lucy had been taken off chemo to see how quickly her tumours grew back to determinesurgery would be an option – but the test saw her cancer quickly expanded. While selective internal radiotherapy sees the disease kept stable or shrunk for  per cent of patients but for Lucy it saw hyperprogression and the cancer spread to other organs.

The -year-old was dragged to his death after he was caught in a crane strap as he tried to stop three thieves fleeing after they stole a quad bike in Stanford Dingley, Berkshire, on August  last year.

They were laughing and joking. She said as soon Judge Andrew Edis and the jury came into court the atmosphere changed and they wiped the smirks off of their faces and behaved like model pupils.Yet the second the jury left the court, the charade left, too. They were nudging each other, messing about, their shirts became untucked and they looked again like the excuse for human beings they were, continued Mrs Harper. Whenever they left the court room we could all hear them shouting, like football fans on the terraces. They looked over at us a lot, but not with any kind of sorrow I could see.The trial had initially begun in March but was suspended due to the coronavirus pandemic and a re-trial was held from June .After the three teenagers were found not guilty of murder on July , she said they patted each other on the back astheyaposd won a football match.

There have been many reports about a fallout surrounding which glitzy band the future Duchess of Sussex would wear on her big day, and the authors of a new book have claimed Harry was forced to step in. It was originally believed that the Queen wouldnapost allow Meghan to have her chosen tiara, but the new biography Finding Freedom claims the Sussexesapos row was actually with her dressmaker and close friend Angela Kelly. Speaking in an interview about the book, one of the authors, Omid Scobie, claims Angela made things very dficult - resulting in a heated phone call between the Queen and Harry. Speaking to True Royalty TVaposs The Royal Beat, Scobie explains that the meeting where Meghan picked her tiara was actually a huge success. He said: The tiara selection went wonderfully. The Queen was very happy, Meghan was very happy. In fact Meghanaposs words when that story came out were aposhow sad, I love my tiaraapos.  The drama took place afterwards, when Meghan wanted to try that tiara on with her hair stylist, because there is a lot of tech that goes into this. They had to do an experiment with that before the wedding day. The hairstylist came in from overseas, there was an appointment at Buckingham Palalce, but nobody was there. Scobie claims that Meghan kept trying to book in a day to do the trial run, but struggled to pin Angela down. He said: Each time Angela Kelly isnapost available to arrange this, to facility this, despite agreeing to. It got to the point where staff around Harry and Meghan were tearing their hair out because the wedding was a couple of weeks away, months had passed at this point. Harry had to intervene. He called his grandmother and said, aposI donapost know what the hell is going on, but this woman needs to make this work for my future weapos.  We can see kind of see now where this aposwhat Meghan wants, Meghan getsapos narrative came from. He goes on: Harry felt that there were those within the institution that would stop at nothing to at the very least to make Meghan’s le dficult. “Meghan didn’t get to try the tiara on again until a few days before the wedding.” "},{"url":null,"title":"uk weather forecast storm kyle","story":"NewsUK weather forecast: Storm Kyle to batter Britain as early autumn ushered in with mph windsThe thunderstorms that have gripped Britain for days are due to end by tonight, only for Storm Kyle to arrive and blow the last remaining remnants of summer awayShareCommentsByRyan Merrield:,  AUG Updated:,  AUG Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video storm-kyle-hit-uk-torrential-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

Forecasters say the thunderstorms that have blighted the UK for days are set to come to an end tonight - only to be replaced by a four-day battering from the -mile-wide tempest. Despite summer not officially finishing until September , Thursday will see the introduction of strong wind and downpours - with August to then remain wet and windy, according to The Met Office. Meteorologist Marco Petagna said: “Remnants of tropical storms can get caught in the jet stream and bring premature autumnal weather to the UK. “Computer models show tropical storm Kyle doing just this. It’s a big change in the weather.” Thunderstorms are expected throughout today and as the week goes on there will be highs of C to C, a sharp drop from the record sixday C sizzler last week. It was the longest “extreme heatwave” since Met Office records began in .The Weather Outlook forecaster Brian Gaze warned: “It’s payback time after the heatwave.” He added: “The storm will bring us back to reality, with a taste of early autumn seeing washouts for families on holidays, with gusts around mph in the west and up to mph in exposed parts of the south.” Netweather forecaster Paul Michaelwaite said: “Energy from the remnants of tropical storm Kyle will merge an unseasonably deep low approaching the UK from Wednesday, with effects felt right through into next weekend.  “There will be strong winds, longer spells of rain and heavy, blustery showers.” Thunderstorms will not affect all areas today, meanwhile, but parts of the country that are struck will be exposed to some intense conditions. While the scorching weather is slowly to be replaced with more cloud, though humidity is set to remain high for now. Isolated thunderstorms could bring sudden surface-water and river flooding, with the Environment Agency having issued nine alerts across England for Monday.

Thousands of visitors came to see the lb silverback at the US shopping centre where he spent  years. But deprived of any physical touch or fresh air, his behaviour was disturbingly unnatural for such a majestic endangered animal. Despite his years in captivity, Ivan’s story had a happy ending and it has been made into a film released on Disney + on Friday, The One and Only Ivan which features Bryan Cranston. Born in  in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the western lowland gorilla and his twin sister Burma were two years old when they and six others were captured by wildle traders.All but Ivan died in the eight-week transit. Ivan was sold to businessman Earl Irwin, who owned the BI shopping mall in Tacoma, Washington State, and he arrived in America as a lb bundle of black soft hair and skin. Ivan spent his first couple of years living with the Johnston family, who owned the pet shop at the mall. Their -year-old son Larry became his best friend who slept, ate and visited the shops with him. Larry said: “Ivan became like a little brother. Gorillas are very family-oriented, and for some reason he chose to bond with me as his alpha. “The connection I had with this wonderfully intelligent creature. He was very instinctive, loving and trusting. “Once we bonded, we were inseparable. We rode motorcycles together – he would just hop on top of my shoulders. If he got excited he would tap my helmet and I’d have to concentrate to keep control of the motorcycle. We did everything together.” After three years as a family pet, Ivan grew too big and boisterous for the Johnston family home, where he would swing from light fittings and curtains. “There was not a stick of furniture left in our house that was even worthy of re-upholstering,” said Larry. “Things were literally shredded down to the frames. We had just bought a new house, new furniture, and he ransacked everything.” Ivan rolled a bowling ball down the stairs into the washing machine. And, unhappy at being left alone one day, he upended a -gallon aquarium full of fish, ran down the street and rushed into a neighbour’s home. “He scared the lady to death,” Larry said. “It’s a wonder we never got sued.” The Johnstons decided something had to change, albeit reluctantly. “You don’t cast off family members easily,” said Larry. “And as much as Ivan was a pain in the rear, he was a joy to have around.”  Ivan was transferred to a dim ft by ft cement cage in the mall, next to a T-shirt shop. Earl Irwin’s son Ron made the decision not to let anyone into his cage, based on advice from so-called experts who said he could get ferocious and might attack. It meant Ivan not only had no contact with gorillas, but lost all physical contact with humans. He could only stare at shoppers from behind unbreakable glass. The closest thing he had to vegetation was a painted jungle mural on his wall. He was deprived of fresh air and sunshine. He had a mundane existence as a solitary exotic exhibit. Ivan earned his keep by featuring in mall promotions and ads: riding a tricycle over the Narrows Bridge, holding a baby in his arms and posing for a postcard. In his early years, he delighted and terried shoppers by pounding his glass cage with his fist and laughing uproariously as they jumped. But as the years rolled by he became quieter. And as people became more aware of animal welfare, his matted fur and depressed demeanour were noticed.  Bradley Henderson said: “I grew up with Ivan. Every time I went to Tacoma he would be my first stop on my way to my grandmother’s house. “I used to just sit at the window with him for a couple hours and he was really fascinated with my wheelchair. If someone got close to me he would bang on the window and the other people would freak out.” Various keepers tried to keep Ivan happy. They organised surprise ways to feed him by dangling bananas on a string. They played with him through the bars and hatches of the cage, like tug of war. They fed him celery, peeled apples and an occasional sip of Coke. Animal rights groups protested at his “barbaric imprisonment” in  and urged the owners to re-home him somewhere more natural.  But for years, Ron Irwin resisted, saying: “He’s probably the healthiest gorilla in America. Moving him across the country would kill him. Nobody seems to care about that.” The campaign to release Ivan pressed on. The Progressive Animal Welfare Society, or Paws, collected thousands of signatures petitioning for his re-homing. In , National Geographic Explorer aired a documentary narrated by Glenn Close called The Urban Gorilla, which put Ivan’s plight in the headlines. In , after years of legal wrangling, Ivan set foot on grass for the first time in  years at Woodland Park Zoo. He soon found a permanent home at Zoo Atlanta in Georgia. Ivan was tentative about socialising with other gorillas at first. And despite flirting with females, he never fathered any offspring. While other gorillas preferred to stay far back from the glass separating them from zoo visitors, Ivan sat right in front of them, just as he had done at the mall. He amused visitors with his paternal antics and tendency to cover his head with a sack when it rained. By August  Ivan had been losing weight and, after  years at the zoo, started to show signs of aches and pains. Later that month a large tumour was found in his chest and Ivan died aged . He was one of the oldest gorillas in captivity. Fans sent Ivan birthday cards all his le, and also sent flowers and condolences after his death.

Trials of the test were part funded with half a million dollars contributed by the NBA and playersapos union. The process is favoured by some sports teams because it is cheap, non-invasive and can use readily available reagents. Nathan Grubaugh, assistant professor at Yale School of Public Health, told Mail Online: We simplied the test so that it only costs a couple of dollars for reagents, and we expect that labs will only charge about  per sample. Prior to the leagueapossNBA players were tested with the saliva tests and nasal swabs. Almost all of the results matched when compared. SalivaDirect can have results back with the subject within  hours and can cost up to less than nasal swabs.  The ease, speed and relative low cost of the test has been a cause for optimism within the world of sports.As well as it providing an easy way for teams to test their players, it may also allow members of the public to find out whether they caught the coronavirus before attending games."},{"url":null,"title":"mum caught guard shes told","story":"NewsMum caught off guard as shes told swimsuit isnt appropriate for baby classA mum has shared her surprise after a fellow parent complained about her swimming costume at a baby swim class, saying it showed off too much skinShareCommentsByCourtney PochinAudience Writer:,  AUG NewsA fellow parent complained about her swimming costume \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"News, views and top stories .

Some parents might get pretty anxious about putting their little one in the water, but one mum has really been enjoying going with her six-month-old son to a baby swim class. Or at least she was having a good time until she had an unpleasant conversation with a fellow mum.She recounted the negative experience in a post on Reddit, explaining how most of the other people in the pool with her during the class were dads and their wives sat on the side to watch.She claimed everything was going swimmingly at the last session, until the very end. As she was getting ready to leave the pool, one of the fellow mums who had been watching came over to chat. The woman proceeded to complain about the mumaposs swimming costume, suggesting it wasnapost appropriate attire for the class.Writing on Reddit, in a post which has since been deleted, the stunned mum explained what happened, saying: Today, there was a new baby at swim class! He looked to be about the same age as my son. As the father got into the pool, he said hi and I ed the greeting. I then asked him how old his son was and we made about  seconds of small talk before the class started. After class was over and my son and I were leaving the pool area, this man’s we approached me and said, aposYou know,you are going to continue to swim with husbands and fathers, you should really dress more modestlyapos.  The mum in the pool had been wearing a tankini, a two-piece swimsuit with a tank top and high-waisted bottoms.She described the swimming costume and shared a link to an identical one which is for sale on Amazon. You could see maybe three inches of my stomach, she said. And not that it matters, but I am completely flat chested with no butt, so it’s not like my voluptuous curves were a distraction or anything. The mum added that she was caught completely off guard by the womanaposs comment and didnapost know how to respond, so just thanked her for her opinion.

The state prosecutor said: Her eyes were not gouged and tongue was not cut. The claim is not true. There is nothing in the post-mortem report to suggest this. There were scratches near the eyes, likely due to the sharp sugarcane leaves where the body was found. The district police chief said: The girlaposs post-mortem has confirmed rape.

The -year-old actor was told a school teacher who was also visiting the gym with some of her students had complained to staff over worries the children could see aposso much skinapos.Gabi shared a photo of her a outfit on Instagram, stating it was in no way gratuitous and was worn during  degree heat in a sun-soaked gym with no air conditioning.She wrote: Today I was asked to leave my gym because a school teacher had a problem with this outfit and complained. Itaposs a hot day, the air con was not on, but apparently this government teacher was concerned about the children seeing so much skin. She then posted the complaint she had sent to the head of the school in , stating that one of the teachers had asked that she shouldnapost be allowed to workout at the gym due to the shorts she was wearing. The letter read: My heavy lting workouts require me to use a signicant range of motion meaning that fitted  stretchy clothes are necessary. Due to the heat today and level of energy used, I was wearing the most practical thing: workout shorts. Gabi said she was horried the school had a sway over her clothing choices and that the behaviour of the teacher was perpetuating that we live in a world where -year-old boys are given priority over women - where women are punished for boysapos and mensapos propensity for objectying women.  As a government institution, what right do you have to be representing such values  she asked. I would like to reiterate that the outfit I was wearing today was in no way gratuitous. It was very appropriate for the situation, and violated no dress codes. I have worn such outfits in many gyms and never had a single complaint. It is discouraging that this particular complaint came from a person charged with moulding our next generation into well-round adults ones who respect women and shun rape culture. She added thatthe teacheraposs goal was to teach her female students to be ashamed of ever showing their body, even in the pursuit of a healthy body and mind, she did an awesome job by publicly shaming her in front of them. Gabi then shared the response from the school, which said the complaint didnapost come from their member of staff and the matter was between you and the gym management.

It is also alleged that on another occasion the boy put his hands inside her tights in the classroom, Mail Online reported. Young allegedly instigated the action by putting a hand on his thigh - an act police say may have been seen by another student.

He argued that CCTV merely showed the boy with his hand under the table, rather than in her tights as the lawyers suggested.  Mr Lloyd said a Snapchat she sent him with the caption aposIaposm waiting for himapos beside a picture of her on a bed did not show any sexual activity. Prosecutor Scott Jaegar argued Young posed a risk to the alleged victim, Mail Online reported. He said the boy did not want her released for fear she would target other children.  When the teenageraposs mother became suspicious, Young allegedly changed her Snapchat identity to that of a boy to avoid suspicion. Supreme Court Justice Stephen Campbell granted the teacher bail on the conditions her family put up ,AUand that she remain under house arrest. She had previously spent a month behind bars at Silverwater Womenaposs Prison.

It should be pretty easy to know what you need to do to get back playing again.“We’re either going to be allowed to get back playing or we’re not and that’s not going to change, coronavirus isn’t going to go away unless there’s a vaccine.“So does everything just get put on hold  If that’s what we’ve got to do then that’s what we should be doing now, because what is going to change by October ”For lower league clubs, revenue generated from fans attending games is crucial.The Scottish Government set September  as a tentative date for when limited crowds couldto sporting events.Balmoor boss McInally says lower league clubs need to knowsupporters will be allowed to attend when their seasons start to make it financially viable.Scotland’s longest-serving manager added: “I feel like football is caught up in a political thing now and I’ve always hated politics because you never seem to get anywhere.“And in football it’s bad enough trying to get a sensible decision, particularly when you look at recent months and what’s gone on, without being caught up in a game of politics with people who probably don’t understand part-time football.“There’s no sense to some of what is happening.“They must knowthey’re going to allow us to come back, they must knowthey’re going to let limited crowds in.“If they’re going to do it then tell us now andthey’re not then tell us and the game can be stopped.“It feels like we’re waiting on a political decision which I think has probably already been made, why  Coronavirus isn’t going to go anywhere between now and a couple of months.“There’s got to come a time when we’re toldwe’re getting crowds or not.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t tMonthly n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through. They pass multiple residential entrances with limited sight lines with no care for risk. The offensive noise seems to come from two actions modying motorbike exhausts and extreme acceleration in legal bikes.If a car made a similar noise, spewed out the same polluting omissions, or did the same ridiculous speeds they would be pulled over by the police, but bikers appear above the law.As technology reduces the noise pollution of cars, planes and other forms of transport, it seems motorbikes are exempt. Bikers claim #loud pipes save lives# but is safety really the motivation for deliberately creating excessive noise Noise counts as a statutory nuisance it either unreasaonably and substantially interferes with the user or enjoyment of a home or other premises or is likely to injure health.The problem on A is known to all the statutory agencies, but nothing is done.If this is a national problem, what action needs to be taken Concerned Loch Fyne-side resident Sir,I am not qualied to judge economic competence, but considering the party he represents, I think that Councillor Redman might find it advisable to be wary of the phrase #colossal mismanagement# .For my part, I would consider a degree of incompetence to be preferable to the great damage caused over the last decade to  per cent of the UK’s people, as well as to its institutions and its reputation by the cruel, self-serving, xenophobic, elitist, dishonestregime currently in Westminster.Name supplied, LochgilpheadSir,Our charity#s support for blind and partially sighted people affected by the coronavirus lockdown has received a £, boost from the Scottish Government#s Wellbeing Fund.With this extra funding we will be able to support an additional  people and respond to the increased demand for more in-depth, one-to-one emotional support.The practical and psychological effects of losing your sight can have a signicant impact on people’s well-being, and this current situation has exacerbated the anxiety and isolation felt by many.Access to essential services such as food and medicines is more dficult as is social distancing, vital information on staying safe isn#t always in accessible formats, and many of our older members aren#t always confident about using new technology to stay in touch with others.Everyone accessing RNIB#s confidential counselling service will receive eight weekly sessions with an accredited counsellor, delivered via telephone and online, with each session normally lasting an hour.The funding will enable us to reduce the waiting list for emergency mental health sessions and also let existing clients access additional sessions.The RNIB helpline is available on   .James Adams, RNIB Scotland directorSir,Every pub across Scotland should be allowed to stock and sell beer from local independent brewers, to help them recover post-lockdown.CAMRA, the Campaign for Real Ale has launched the #Cheers for Choice# campaign.The campaign wants these arrangements to be relaxed, and MSPs are also being urged to support the Tied Pubs Bill being put forward in the Scottish Parliament by Labour MSP Neil Bibby. The legislation would give tied pub tenants protections in law, including a right to be able to sell guest beers in their pubs.Allowing small and independent brewers to sell into all pubs will also improve consumer choice and allow pub-goers to support local brewing businesses.It also makes business sense, with  per cent of pub-goers saying they would be less likely to go back to a pubit doesn’t have a range of brews from small and independent producers.Sarah Crawford, CAMRA Director for Scotland, Kirkcaldy"},{"url":null,"title":"could a two way conversation transform scotlands health","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSome of us have learned in lockdown the importance of other people, and have been longing for these first personal contacts.There have been surprises in discovering just what is important in le, and the comfort of knowing you are not alone in your likes, as your favourite brand of chocolate is again sold out.We have also been made aware that the way we behave makes a dference to the future. It has taken a national emergency to get the government to acknowledge that it needs our compliance and, for that, must give us the information we need.Suddenly the choices we make are seen as vitally important, and we have a part to play in achieving success for ourselves and our community. Can this be a foundation for a future partnership that could transform the health of Scotland and the pressure on our services As a physiotherapist I became aware that there was little that one could do to impose solutions there had to be a relationship that involved two way listening, mutual trust and support to do what was necessary. In this pandemic Nicola Sturgeon has said that we have behaved in a way that saved lives and protected the NHS.When this is over we could be at the beginning of another le-altering journey.It will demand a huge sht in expectations. There is an amazing bias in society towards the idea of decrepitude and dependency in old age, when in fact encouraging dependency increases a slide into that very state. During past months many of these attitudes have been exposed and caused outrage but they are long standing and deep seated.If you have been trying to escape into fiction you might have no better idea of what is possible. Alison Flood interviewed crime writers about their work, and this is what she found.Ian Rankin is now writing about a John Rebus who has health issues, James Lee Burke has his detective Robicheaux meditating on mortality in his early s and Mark Billingham has slowed his Tom Thorne down a bit because he is in his s. Michael Connelly does not believe that it is credible to have his Harry Bosch with a badge and gun and still working for the LAPD, this in a country where the President is  and one of the presidential hopefuls .Worst of all, Sara Paretsky created a feisty, strong woman for her books, only to succumb to popular misconceptions and stop her age at  because she didn#t #want Vi to be helpless#.These fictional creations battle the evils they see in their society. Now that it is realised how our inidual decision making makes a dference, whatever our age, we have no need to feel helpless.It is time to ask for the information and support we need."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures july 3 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSimon Macdonald from Kilmichael Glassary submitted this week#s featured image.

Perhaps for the first time in their lives they have heard the bark of deer or spotted something in nature that is totally new to them. And many will have seen footage of the animals and creatures that tentatively stepped into urban settings whilst humankind remained under lockdown.But that is changing as we ease back into a new normality.Economics and peoples’ livelihoods are, of course, firmly entwined with modern day living, human survival and wellbeing it is extremely important that we find a route to recovery and many are suffering deeply. But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased. All have grave consequences for wildle and nature.The result is the burning, choking, strangling, trapping or poisoning of animals, birds, plants and aquatic le.Taking care of our surroundings and appreciating nature is a real joy. Teaching children the beauty of the outdoors and how to care for it can bring a lelong love for natureyou love something you usually wish to protect it.And learning never stops for any of us. Sometimes it is the basics that are needed before we move on to the complexities of natural navigation or learning our stars.So for this month here is one tip : learn how to go to the toilet in the outdoors!Doing this responsibly and teaching your children makes for a lelong enjoyment of walking and exploring without the bane of wondering where the next toilet is.

It is now one of the most beautul drives in the place, and as a drive it would be destroyed.#The line from Glasgow to Oban took  years to build and finally opened in , proving extremely popular with holidaymakers for many years. The proposed branch line from Dalmally to Inveraray was never built, despite plans to #hide# the railway from the duke’s view. A plan from  shows a proposed tunnel to carry the line through the duke’s policies near to the castle. This proposal, like many others, was defeated in the House of Lords.Instead, provision was made at Dalmally for a waiting room, the #Duke’s Room#, at Dalmally Station where visitors arriving by train could await the arrival of a carriage in comfort.This is just one of innumerable fascinating stories stored within the Argyll Papers, the family and estate archive of the Campbell family, dukes of Argyll.The Friends of the Argyll Papers was established to support the development of the archive and to promote its use and enjoyment by a wide audience.It has been described as one of the most important private archives in Britain, offering a rich resource for Scottish and British history from the th to the st centuries.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry. Recovery will require our collective efforts and we must act as one to ensure the best possible outcomes for the whole of the visitor economy.Malcolm Roughead, VisitScotland chief executive"},{"url":null,"title":"the time for change is is now july 17 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThis isn’t really a campaign, it’s just the things that we should all be thinking aboutwe want Argyll # and the world – to be a recognisable place for our children and grandchildren to live in.The economic crisis could be seen as an opportunity to get started on the work that we know needs to happen.I think that many people in Argyll could continue to work from home people who have lost their jobs could be retrained, or use their existing skills, to do the work that is necessary for Argyll to become carbon-neutral. Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

But it has also been a time of positive change and reflection, prompting people to be more creative. Writing, be it poetry, song writing or short stories, for example, has given many a way of making sense of this time, of sharing their feelings and looking after their mental health.For those who have found it dficult to know where to begin, Seil author Kenneth Steven offers this advice to help you start your creative writing journey.For me, there are two essential ingredients when it comes to setting out as a creative writer: time and space. By creative writing I mean poetry, short stories, novels and children’s writing: everything involving the use of the imagination.When someone claims they don’t have time to write, I don’t believe them as it’s a question of making time.PD James started writing when nursing a dying husband: he needed care all through the day. There was a part of the night when finally he went to sleep and she had the chance to put pen to paper, so that was what she did. If we are serious about wanting to write, we will make time.For many years I lived in Dunkeld, close to the entrance to the cathedral. When friends heard my address they would roll their eyes and say: ‘What a place to be. And you’re lucky enough to be a writer.’Except it wasn’t that easy. The truth is the modern world invaded even that idyllic corner of Scotland.First, there were thousands of pilgrim feet and voices. I was driven mad by not being able to find sufficient quiet. My former we watched a great deal of television. It was a tiny flat and the distant murmur of low voices maddened me because I couldn’t concentrate.It was she who suggested # probably to stop the grumbling # that I should have a cabin built in my mother’s garden in Aberfeldy, a place where I could hide away to write. After considering the idea for a few days, I realised she was right.When finally I sat down to start working in that simple shed among the trees, the words poured from the pen. I will never forget those first days. Poem after poem appeared as though by magic on the page. For me # and after many years of leading creative writing sessions, I would suggest for the vast majority of others too # finding real quiet makes all the dference.But it doesn’t have to be a hideaway in a garden it can be a living room or a bedroom or an attic – just at a time when others in the household are asleep or absent.There are few rules for creative writers, but one I have discovered is that we are all larks or owls. We’re either attracted to early morning or late evening.I have yet to meet anyone who has said they’re drawn to the mid-afternoon # what I term # hammock time, though that’s when I wrote in the Aberfeldy cabin. I’ve come to believe strongly you will use the time you are given. If that’s what you have, you will adapt to that rhythm.But I quickly came to realise in my cabin that I couldn’t simply turn on good writing like a tap. We go into our creative space weighed down by the modern world. We live lives beset by emails, phone calls and text messages. We are all expected to respond quickly.I think creative writers are generally poor when it comes to practice writing. The creative lives of visual artists, actors, singers and musicians are dominated by practice. Why should it be dferent for those from the writing community What do I mean by practice writing  Describing the view out of the window going back into memory to capture a moment as evocatively as possible imagining a dialogue between two characters. There’s no end to the possibilities. What practice writing provides is creative grounding. It brings us from being all over the place in our minds to give us creative focus.What this practice allows us to do is to start, then to pour ourselves into what I like to call deep writing. It creates a kind of doorway so the real writing can begin.Kenneth Steven is best-known as a poet. Sixteen of his collections have been published and he writes and presents poetry-related programmes for BBC Radio. He is also a Scottish novelist and children’s author. He’s written two handbooks on writing and led workshops and worked as writer in residence at home and abroad. www.kennethsteven"},{"url":null,"title":"if walls could talk","story":"Susan WindramUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsStrachur Smiddy opened its doors again on Saturday, August , after an uncertain few months due to Covid-.The museum will only be open on Saturdays and Sundays, until Sunday September , but for now families can again enjoy stepping back in time in the th-century blacksmith’s smiddy, which has been carefully repaired and restored to its original state and now acts as a working museum with with forge, bellows and anvil, cobbled floor, tools of the trade and beamed ceiling.Browse through the Smiddy’s collection of fascinating artefacts and tools.

joining the Borders Book Festivals online audience to talk about his latest book, Hope In Hell: A Decade To Confront The Climate Emergency.Porritt, , is one of the UKs leading environmental activists, whose roles have included chair of The Ecology Party , director of Friends of the Earth, and co-founder of Forum for the Future, a sustainable development charity.Author of nine other books, Porritt hopes his latestwill reach \"a combination of dferent audiences\", the most important of which, he says, is the young people who are inheriting the impacts of manmade climate change.\"My sense today is that young people are the ones who are really going to suffer most from the accelerating climate impacts that we are now witnessing,\" Porritt tells the Border , \"and every single day for the whole of the rest of their lives will in one way or another be impacted by climate change.\"He adds: \"I talk a lot in the book about what I call intergenerational injustice how one generation has basically made it practically impossible for the next generation to have the same prospects, the same expectations, the same hopes as previous generations have had.\"The book, which stresses the urgency of fighting climate change, is also aimed at the \"weary environmentalists\" who have \"been plugging away\" at campaigning and those, says Porritt, \"who have no pre-existing knowledge or deep understanding of climate change, who I hope will be able to get stuck in really quickly and pick up everything they need to know within the first four chapters.\"Porritt has little time for the idea that human activity might not have had an impact on climate change, or that the subject is over-egged by the media or environmental activists.He says: \"I dont believe there is any serious continuing debate about whether climate change is happening or whether its caused by our lestyles or our economy and I think theres less and less of a debate about it not being serious.\"I think thats symptomatic of a change going on in peoples minds because they can see the impacts of climate change.\"The veteran campaigner believes that any failure of iniduals to change their behaviour is not down to climate change denial but what he calls \"disavowal\" ndash \"As in, I see this is happening but perhaps Im not the person who can make a dference, so I will continue to be a bystander rather than an active participant in addressing this challengersquo,\" says Porritt.\"The story of the next decade is getting more and more people to come away from that bystander role and to be prepared to get stuck in.\"And Porritt believes this \"disavowal\" is part of the reason governments can be slow to enact policies to combat climate change.\"Thats what makes it possible for the politicians to go on downgrading the signicance of climate change,\" he says.ldquoOur politicians are not in denial but they are absolutely not addressing it as the emergency that the science now tells us it is.\"And you can see that in the policies they brought forward in response to the pandemic ndash the build back better movement has actually just become build build build.\"The UK governments \"classic failure of deeper political understanding\" is one reason the countrys economy struggled during lockdown, believes Porritt.He says: \"Instead of using this as a fantastic opportunity to show how we could have an economy that is prosperous but very low carbon all were doing is defaulting to exactly the same kind of policy growth band positions that we were in before COVID.\"Having had this shock, this really traumatic impact on our expectations of what a good le looks like, its incumbent on us to learn that lesson, and use it to help shape a more resilient and compassionate economy, one that is more mindful of environmental stewardship obligations for ourselves as well as future generations.\"And it is the future generations who Porritt sees pushing for change.He says: \"It was so interesting when Greta Thunberg was here in the UK. I think it was Michael Gove who said, Your example gives us hope.

Reduce light from the hall. Make sure there are no electronics sending out light e.g. a digital alarm clock with a lit display, sleep buttons on equipment etc.\"You may want to put black curtains at the window or wear an eye mask to limit the light getting into the eye.\"Sleep Scotland suggests wearing an eye maskOn the other end, you should also get lots of light in the morning to help you feel awake and alert.They added: \"Exposure to light at the right time helps keep the circadian clock on the correct time schedule.\"Make sure you open the curtains and turn on the lightsyou need to. Going for a walk is a great way to start the day.\"RoutineIt is only natural that during lockdown many of us have found that we have lost our routine and have been staying up later and lying in bed longer in the morning.Sleep Scotland said: \"Your body clock works best when you stick to a schedule.\"In an ideal world, yoursquoll go to sleep and wake up within a half hour of the same time each day, even on weekends.\"The routines of the day also give us powerful signals and demands that the body remain alert for certain tasks and events.\"Regular waking and bed times, alongside regular meal times are very important for regulating your body and its s.\"Sleep PressureSleep pressure is the term used to describe the feeling of tiredness we have, due to the activity we undertake through the day.,params: .pushSleep Scotland say it is important to be active in order to make sure we create the sleep pressure and drowsiness that will help us to fall asleep.They argue that having a nap can relieve our sleep pressure, meaning we find it harder to fall asleep at bedtime.Take a tech breakNaturally during lockdown many of us have resorted to using screens to help keep us entertained,to work and to socialise with friends.And while most modern tech has a blue light filter, it does not filter all light.More importantly, the things you do online are usually things that stimulate your brain and make it harder to turn off when you get into bed.Therefore, Sleep Scotland say you should unplug from all screens at least an hour before bedtime.They added: \"In the hour before bed, ensure you focus on doing things that are calming.\"Now is the time to read, draw, do some calming exercises, have a warm bath etchellip\""},{"url":null,"title":"selkirk-needs-20mph-speed-limit","story":"A MPH

of cometary dust - producing up to  meteors every hour.If skies are clear, the display of celestial fireworks should be visible across the UK from about midnight tonightuntil .am UK time on Thursday, August  - according to astronomers at Royal Observatory Greenwich.What are the Perseids The astronomical event is associated with the dusty debris left by Comet Swt-Tuttle, which orbits the sun once every  years.The meteoroids from the comet, mostly no bigger than a grain of sand, burn up as they hit the Earthrsquos atmosphere at  miles per second to produce a shooting stream of light in the sky.Peak temperatures can reach anywhere from ,C to ,C as they speed across the sky.The meteors are called Perseids because they seem to dart out of the constellation Perseus.The meteor shower began on July  and will continue to be visible until August .What have astronomers said Anna Ross, an astronomer at the Royal Observatory Greenwich, said the best time to spot the meteors is between midnight and .am on Thursday, when up to  meteors or ldquoshooting stars will be visible per hour, which is more than one every second.She told the PA news agency: ldquoThis makes the Perseids one of the most impressive meteor showers of the year.ldquoDuring the peak night of the shower, you will be able to find it in the north-east of the sky, getting higher throughout the night.ldquoYou donrsquot have to be able to see Perseus to spot meteors, however, as they will be moving away from the radiant across the whole sky in every direction.To make the most of the meteors, Ms Ross said observers should avoid well-lit and built-up areas and try to find an unobstructed view to the east.She added: ldquoFind a dark area and allow around  minutes for your eyes adapt to the dark.ldquoAs meteors move quite fast across the sky itrsquos best to look up without using telescopes or binoculars so you can see as much of the sky as possible.How regular will the meteors be The Perseids are one of the more active meteor showers on stargazersrsquo calendars, producing an average of between  and  shooting stars an hour at their peak.The shower in rsquos was especially active, delivering up to  meteors an hour at its height.While the shooting stars this year wonrsquot be quite as regular, stargazers can still expect to see around  of them an hour.Do I need special equipment to see the Perseids Meteor showers are typically visible with the naked eye, so no special equipment is needed, but those in rural areas with minimal light pollution will have a clearer view.Heading out to a dark spot is the best plan of action, but stargazers should allow around  minutes for their eyes to become accustomed to the dark.Patience is also a virtue, with shooting stars tending to appear in clusters, followed by a lull.The meteors will appear to come from the direction of the Perseus constellation in the north eastern part of the sky, although they should be visible from any point.A cloudy night could still scupper your chances of spotting any meteors, however, so keep your eye on weather forecasts."},{"url":null,"title":"confident-borders-schools-safe-says-council-chief","story":"THE leader of Scottish Borders Council says she has \"every confidence\" that schools have been made safe

With food storage at a premium, you dont want to let anything go to waste.Wersquove done the legwork to figure out the right ways to store your food so that it tastes best and lasts the longest.Here are the answers to ten common kitchen storage mistakes.. Youre throwing out your lsquoexpiredrsquo foodCertain expiration dates have less to do with safety than they do quality. Credit: Getty   FangXiaNuoItrsquos important to know the dference between food that has passed the lsquoBest Beforersquo date and food that has passed the lsquoUse byrsquo date. You should never eat food that has passed its lsquoUse byrsquo date, but lsquoBest Beforersquo dates often reflect quality control, not safety or nutritional value. In determiningthe food that has passed the lsquoBest Beforersquo is safe to eat read up on Food Standards Agency guidelines, use your eyes and nose, and follow your gut.Smell:If it smells fine and it was stored properly, its likely okay to eat.Sight:Donrsquot let your eyes fool you when it comes to fresh food like produce. Bumps or bruises donrsquot mean something is ruined.Dont can the cans:Canned goods can last for decades. Even a can thats started to rust should still be okay, as long as it isnt bulging and the seal is intact.Check the packaging, use your senses, cook food thoroughly, and donrsquot let the perfect become the enemy of the good. A proper understanding of expirationdates could drastically cut down on food wastemdashnot to mention wasted money out of your pocket..

Surprised . You dont know how to store your cooking oilsSome cooking oils are best stored in the cabinet, while others can be refrigerated. Credit: Getty   Angelina ZinovievaCooking oils sourced from fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds each have dferent storage needs. Exposure to oxygen, light or heat will subject oil to oxidation, eventually turning it rancid. While some cooking oils can be stored at room temperature, others do best when stored in the fridge.Corn and rapeseed oils:These do just fine stored in a cool, dark cabinet, or you can refrigerate themit takes more than a year to get through a bottle.Olive oil:Leaving olive oil out on the counter or a table, especiallythe bottle gets direct sunlight, or storing it on or near a stove are surefire ways to turn it rancid quickly. Place it in the coolest, darkest place in your home or use a smaller glass bottle in the kitchen.Peanut oil:Can be kept for as long as two yearsstored tightly capped and away from heat and light. Keeping peanut oil in the fridge may extend shelf le even further.Coconut oil:Very stable andhas a shelf le of two years or more.Avocado, grapeseed, hazelnut, sesame, truffle, walnut, safflower and sunflower:Delicate oils that are especially prone to rancidity, especiallyexposed to too much light or heat. Refrigerating after opening is recommended. Kept cold, these oils will remain viable for six months or more.. Youre using the wrong containers to store your foodWe tested the best-selling plastic and glass food storage containers on the market to find the best of the lot. We dropped them onto a linoleum floor, froze them, microwaved them, stained them, pried them apart, stacked them back together, and lots more.Best glass container:Pyrexs Cook and Eat Glass Storage Setisa great choice.

No plastic container is oven-safe, but the set is marked dishwasher- and microwave-safe and carries a letime warranty. You should avoid freezing this set, as expanding food may pop the lid.. Youre incorrectly storing fruits and veggiesDo you know which vegetables should stay at room temperature, which should be kept inside a salad drawer, and which should never be stored together  Are you sure Do not refrigerate:Potatoes, onions, garlic, winter squash, tomatoes, bananas, peaches, plums, avocados, mangoes, melons, apples, pears, kiwis, and citrus. Exceptions include freezing for smoothies, or refrigerating for brief periods when theyre close to spoiling.Keep separate:Produce that emits high levels of ethylene gas, including ripe bananas, apples, stone fruit , cantaloupe, honeydew melons, mangoes, pears, ripe kiwis, tomatoes, onions, and leeks.Store alone:Ethylene-sensitive produce, including aubergine, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, carrots, caullower, cucumber, leafy greens, peas, peppers, squash, sweet potatoes, strawberries, and watermelon.,params: .push.

Youre letting the food in your fridge accidentally freezeFoods in your fridge shouldnt be freezing. Credit: Getty   IssaurinkoBiting into frozen food thatrsquos merely supposed to be refrigerated isnrsquot just annoying: Freezing can completely alter the taste and texture of your food. And itrsquos probably because yoursquore probably arranging your fridge the wrong way.Check your fridges temperature settings:The ideal temperature range for the interior of your fridge is degC and below.Determine problem areas:According to appliance manufacturer GE, the most common problem areas are the top shelf, the bottom of the fridge , and door shelves.Avoid vents:Most fridges have a cooling vent above the top shelf. This is where most of the cold air comes from, so keeping food away from here may prevent freezing. Adjust your freezer:Turn up your freezer temperature settings, but nothing north of degF, which will facilitate bacterial growth and accelerate food spoilage.Check your ice maker:Make sure that your ice maker is not constantly running. This could make your freezer too cold and subsequently cause your refrigerated foods to freeze.Stock up your fridge:Refrigerators need to be well-stocked to absorb all of the cold air being vented into the cavity. If it is relatively empty, all of the cold air will sink to the bottom of the cavity and freeze your food. A fully stocked fridge will help maintain temperatures and, as a result, use less energy.. Youre not fixing a door that wont shut properlyIf your fridge door wont close, its probably due to an old, dried-out gasket, the rubber seal that runs along its edge. Luckily, the fix is simple: wash the gasket, and apply petroleum jelly to the rubber to revitalize the old rubber.. Youre not regulating your fridges temperatureA full fridge will help keep the temperature consistent. Credit: Getty   Group StudioDid you know your fridge could actually be making you sick  To keep food out of what the Food Saftey Agency calls lsquothe danger zonersquo, it needs to remain below degC. The freezer should be set to -degC to keep freezer burn at bay. If your fridge and freezer are regularly warmer than those temperatures, yoursquore risking faster spoilage. Here are a few things you can do to keep your fridge properly chilled:Invest in a fridge thermometer.To use, place the thermometer in a cup of water. Why  Your refrigerator measures the temperature of the air around your food, but you want to simulate the temperature inside your foods. Check the thermometer after  hours and then, adjust the temperature of each appliance based on the results.Check to make sure the gasket is in good shape, and seals well.If you can open the door with one finger, your seal isnt tight enough. A leaky seal is an energy waster, and may be a risk to your food.Dust your refrigerators cooling coils,theyre visible. You can use a long, skinny brush made for this purpose.Cover your food.For example, leave eggs in their carton, not in the door.Keep a full fridgeto retain the cold, but leave enough room for air to circulate.The product experts at Reviewedhave all your shopping needs covered.

Keep your wall colours neutral, like white and grey, but use your curtains, bedding and cushions to inject splashes of colour.Buying new bedding and hanging a new set of curtains can cost a lot less than a few tins of paint once you factor in all the rollers and brushes yoursquoll need to buy, plus it will take less time too.Once yoursquove bought the cushions, next time yoursquore thinking about changing the colour, just buy new covers and match the size of the cushions. That means you can store the others away, pass them on to a friend or use them in another room.Donrsquot forget about artwork. You can find some really trendy prints online and IKEA is great for cheap frames too. Make sure you buy the same size prints each time, meaning you can keep the same frames. You can update the frames easily too with a cheap can of spray paint.Canrsquot afford a new carpet  Yoursquoll be amazed at what a good deep clean and adding a colourful or patterned rug can do.If your furniture is looking a bit tired, upcycle with a lick of paint and new door handles. You can pick up a tin of furniture paint from most hardware stores or online and you can buy cute, quirky doorknobs from eBay or Etsy, or even just try spray painting the existing ones.Metal accessories like curtain rods and light fittings can benefit from that spray paint too!Upcycling is a great way to keep costs low, give a much loved item a new lease of le and is good for the environment by cutting out waste.Living roomMoving on to the most used room in the house, this can be the most dficult to update as it no doubt has many uses. From the TV room to the playroom to the dining room, your living space probably needs to be more practical than anything . But you can still add some style along the way.Your sofa likely dominates the room and can be the most expensive piece in the room ndash with the exception of the TV! So replacing this often can be costly. But have you considered replacing the covers  If your sofa is in generally good condition but itrsquos looking a bit off-colour, you can buy covers that fit over the top.IKEA do a range of these covers that are made for their sofa ranges, but you can find places online that offer made to measure services. This can be more expensive, but definitely cheaper than buying a whole new sofa and are machine washable! Alternatively, adding a new throw and some scatter cushions can have the same effect.Many of the tips for the bedroom can be used in the living room too.

Perfect for keeping clutter off the floor.Shelves above radiators are a great way to use otherwise wasted space.If the kids are desperate for some space, a reading nook or kids study area can easily be achieved under the stairs or a window. A simple storage box with a couple of cushions on top will create a comfy seat and can double up as extra storage.Hooks can be attached to pretty much anything like bedroom doors and inside cupboards ndash again keeping items off the floor will create the illusion of more space. In the kitchen, using hooks to hang pots and pans and magnets for knives can free up cupboard space and make a statement.Knowing where things are is half the battle when considering storage options, so think about clear plastic boxes or bags that are easy to see into and can be labelled.Flexible furniture like extendable dining tables, sofa beds and even clothes rails are ideal as they have multiple uses and can be stored away easily when not in use.Let there be lightLighting and mirrors are your friends when it comes to making a smaller room feel bigger. Change large floor lamps for smaller wall lights and when it comes to wall colour, stick to pale colours and swap out heavy curtains with blinds. Luckily, a big tub of value white paint goes a long way. Let in as much light as possible, give the windows a good scrub and update yellowing lightbulbs to bright white.OutdoorsIs it time to rethink that huge sofa set and professional sized goal posts  When buying furniture, think small, light and foldable so that they can be stored away in a shed or cupboard or easily moved around. Updating your garden furniture doesnrsquot need to cost the earth, yoursquoll find some really great bargain sets in supermarkets like Aldi, Asda and Tesco and homeware stores like BM.Another way to make it feel bigger is to simply give it a good tidy. Yoursquoll be surprised at how much space you do have after clearing out those unwanted flowerpots, cutting the grass and trimming back the hedges.Your home is an investment, to be enjoyed for a long time and with these simple but effective ideas, you can enjoy the space you have for longer."},{"url":null,"title":"young-people-scotland-can-get-250-free-starting-new-job","story":"Young people across Scotland could be in line for as much as pound free from the Government for starting a new job, thanks to a new benefit.Its hoped the payment, which is open for applications from today, will help young people with the financial dficulties of starting a new job - including buying new clothes, travel and get childcare.It is estimated around  young people will benefit from the new financial support in its first year.What is the benefit The Job Start Payment is a one-off sum of pound for  to -year-oldsthey have been unemployed for at least six months.The upper age limit rises to  for care leavers and the payment increases to poundthe person has a child.How can I qualy for the payment To qualy for the payment, which will be delivered by Social Security Scotland, the person applying must have received a job offer for paid employment.They must be out of paid work and must have been receiving one of the qualying benefits for six months or more at the time of the job offer:Income-based Jobseekerrsquos AllowanceIncome SupportIncome-related Employment and Support AllowanceUniversal CreditWhat has the Scottish Government said Social Security Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville said: ldquoI am delighted that our Job Start Payment is today now open for applications it really couldnrsquot come at a better time to support our young people to take up job offers.ldquoYoung people are among those whose job prospects have been hardest hit by this pandemic.

year for students because of the coronavirus pandemic and teachers were asked to submit expected grades for each senior pupil based on prelim results and course work.However, the Scottish Qualications Authorityreviewed the submissions and using a lsquostatistical modelrsquo, which took into account the historic exam performances of schools, downgraded thousands of submitted grades, causing a national outrage.In East Lothian, , pupils received some grades which had been marked down.Only  of the , young people who were due to sit SQA exams had any of their final grades increased.The results dropped through letterboxes last Tuesday and sparked a furious backlash from students who received lower grades than expected.Erin Campbell, , Member of the Scottish Youth Parliamentfor Musselburgh, said many friends had been left worried and scared after the initial results came out, warning that the fiasco had been ldquobad for their mental health.Erin, who was a sixth-year student at Musselburgh Grammar School, said: ldquoOn a personal level, I was lucky to receive the results that I needed in order to move on to university however, I am aware of a lot of young people, including close friends, who were left scared and worried after not receiving a conditional offer to uni that was reliant on these results.ldquoThis badly impacted their mental health, particularly during the period of uncertainty before [Education Secretary] John Swinneyrsquos announcement [on Tuesday].Student protests were held in Glasgow and Edinburgh and politicians piled on pressure for the Scottish Government to step in and overturn the results.East Lothian MSP Iain Gray, Labourrsquos education spokesperson, called on Mr Swinney to resign after he initially backed the modied results before bending under pressure and telling the Scottish Parliament on Tuesday the Scottish Government had got it wrong.Mr Swinney said it was ldquodeeply regrettable we got this wrong and ordered the SQA to amend awards which had been marked down back to the submitted grade provided by teachers and reissue them.Mr Gray said Mr Swinney had spent five days defending the results before changing his position on Tuesday, asking him: ldquoWhy did he defend the results of this moderation for five days  Why did he leave these young people twisting in the wind for a week, hopes and aspirations in shreds Speaking after the decision, Mr Gray said: ldquoGiven the scale of the exam results scandal, it was inevitable that many local students would have been affected. I have certainly had a number of young people and parents contacting me over the last week to express their concerns about their grades being adjusted down by the SQA and the impact it might have on their futures.ldquoThe Scottish Governmentrsquos u-turn will bring relief to these worried young people and their families as they will now see their estimated results reinstated.ldquoHowever, the fact remains they should not have had to experience this worry and uncertainty in the first place. The Education Secretary has let them down and should be held accountable for this fiasco.Schools in East Lothian were yesterdaycontacting pupils who had been affected to let them know they would receive new awards.Across the county, , grades were submitted to the SQA for pupils at the end of May across National , Higher and Advanced Higher level by their teachers.In total, , were acceptedwith  adjusted upand ,adjusted down.In terms of pupils who were due to sit the exams, the council said just over  per cent saw at least one grade marked down.Councillor Shamin Akhtar , cabinet spokesperson for education and childrenrsquos services, said: ldquoIrsquom delighted that John Swinney has finally decided to do the right thing for pupils on the exam results fiasco.ldquoYoung people have faced a very tough and stressful time already and this is something they should never have had to go through.ldquoSchool staff worked extremely hard to submit grades for their pupils to the SQA and the adjustments undermined their professional judgement.ldquoThis u-turn is a victory for young people who have led the campaign against the unfair results and should be commended for standing up for their rights.And Councillor Craig Hoy , a member of East Lothianrsquos education committee, said: ldquoI am delighted that grades have been restored to hardworking pupils in East Lothian who faced huge uncertainty over the last week for no good reason.ldquoEveryone can see that John Swinney has presided over a litany of failures, any one of which could have been a resignation issue on its own.ldquoThe SNP defended their appalling grading system to the hilt, even after it became clear that pupils, parents and teachers had no confidence in the system.On Monday, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon issued an apology to students across the country who had been marked down by the SQA.She said: ldquoOur concern, which was to make sure the grades young people got were as valid as in any other year, perhaps led us to think too much about the overall system and not enough about the inidual pupil.ldquoThat has meant too many students feel they have lost out on grades they should have had, and that that has happened not as a result of anything they have done but a statistical model or algorithm.ldquoDespite our best intentions, I do acknowledge that we did not get this right and I am sorry.A spokesperson for East Lothian Council welcomed the u-turn, adding: ldquoThroughout this process our schools have sought to represent the academic achievements of our young people in a way that provided a fair and accurate reflection of attainment using the guidance and methodology provided by the SQA.ldquoThe announcement by the Education Secretary will be welcomed by young people who saw their results downgraded, and by our teachers and schools who used their professional judgement when providing grade estimates.East Lothian MP Kenny MacAskillpledged his support to headteachers in a letter at the end of last week after the original results came out.He said: ldquoI welcome the Scottish Governmentrsquos announcement.ldquoAs I said last week in a letter to East Lothianrsquos headteachers, I believe the people best placed to know about pupils are those overseeing and working alongside them during their academic journeys.ldquoThis decision is the right one, and I want to send my congratulations to all students in East Lothian for the work they have achieved both before and during this pandemic, as well as a huge thanks to the teachers and school support staff who have worked so hard over the last few months."},{"url":null,"title":"betrayal-claim-mcdonalds-musselburgh-recommended-approval","story":"In a letter to the Courier, Fraser McAllister hit out at their ldquoillogical recommendation which,approved by councillors at an online meeting next week, would grant permission for a restaurant to be created in the car park of the Tesco store off Olivebank Road.He claimed that the drive-thru, which would operate  hours a day, seven days a week, would be ldquonext to the most congested roundabout in the county.The former SNP councillor for Musselburgh West said: ldquoTragically,  local objectors and , petitioners have less value than the share value of these gigantic corporations.He called on councillors on the planning committee, which will debate the proposal on Tuesday, to halt the ldquobetrayal.Mr McAllister also lodged a formal objection, citing a range of concerns including traffic congestion, pollution, litter, obesity, residential amenity and economic damage.He claimed: ldquoThe custom predicted for this -hour McDonaldrsquos drive-thru and the intensity of the declared deliveries needed to service it are on an industrial scale.

Nor does it contain any policies relating to unhealthy eating or the health consequences of proposed developments.

The officer advised that, whilst it was acknowledged that additional traffic would have an impact upon queuing and reduce traffic speeds, the composition of the increased traffic would be from passenger cars, which are less polluting than HGVs and buses.The officer concluded that the proposed development would have ldquono harmful impact on air quality nor on the objectives of the AQMA and would not harm the amenity of the area.A McDonaldrsquos spokesperson said: ldquoWe look forward to progressing with this application and believe a new McDonaldrsquos would bring signicant investment to the local community, as well as create at least  new jobs.A supporting statement from the company added: ldquoThere are few restaurants in the country who can claim to have made so many positive changes to support healthier lestyles. McDonaldrsquos believe that the lessons they have learned in making these changes can be used to support a wider drive to reduce obesity.Planners are recommending the plan be approved with a number of conditions, including submission of litter and pest management plans.A council spokesperson declined to comment, saying the planning committee would consider the application next week."},{"url":null,"title":"wavegarden-scotland-surf-resort-takes-step-closer-reality----looks-unreal","story":"Artists drawings of the plans for Wavegarden Scotland show the extent of the project - which is hoped to create  jobs and generate up to poundmillion for the local economy every year.The visitor attraction is planned for the disused Craigpark Quarry near Ratho on the outskirts of Edinburgh.Artist impressions for the food and retail hubsThe project will involve the installation of underwater technology that can create , waves per hour, from slow moving white water for beginners through to powerful barrels up to two metres high for experts.Yesterday, the teams developer confirmed it had been backed by planners to include a food and retail hub, as well as glamping pods for accommodation.Tartan Leisure Ltd, developers of Scotlandrsquos first articial surf park, Wavegarden Scotland, received planning permission today.

Essentially, this means there should be no way of telling yoursquove been there ndash no litter, no signs of fires, no damage to trees or other elements of the environment.This is a good example of wild campingSome very conscientious campers take this further by removing litter left by others, i.e. the site looks better for them having been there. Hats off to these heroes.If it can sometimes be dficult to define what wild camping is, itrsquos easier to say what it isnrsquot.It isnrsquot pitching a tent in a car park, and it certainly isnrsquot turning up with your entire family and friends and a car full of glamping kit and or lager.It may also surprise some people, but responsible wild camping would not include an open fire at least not in certain areas. SOAC states that you should ldquonever light an open fire during prolonged dry periods or in areas such as forests, woods, farmland... So, fires in the woods are in breach of the code, as are fires anywhere during dry periods.If yoursquore desperately in need of a fire, the place to have it is on the beach.Itrsquos also a good idea to bring your own wood. Collecting fuel on-site isnrsquot a good thing, as dead wood is a valuable part of ecosystems. Cutting branches from trees may constitute vandalism and anyway, green wood burns really badly.Perhaps itrsquos also important to think about the ethos behind wild camping.As mentioned, truly wild camping should have an intrinsic respect for, and minimal impact on, the natural environment.At some of our sites, wersquove seen a huge increase in camping in recent years.Many of those involved are reasonably responsible campers, fires aside, that is, leaving little or no litter.However, the cumulative effect of such a high density of campersis to slowly degrade the natural environment.Then, of course, therersquos the issue of where all these people are going to the toilet, but letrsquos not dwell on that.So, perhaps it just needs a little more thought on the part of the campers.Some sites are simply inappropriate ndash Aberlady Bay and Traprain Law, for example, being a nature reserve and scheduled monument respectively.Others may be OK sometimes, but not when busy.Under these circumstances, it may be that prospective campers should think about choosing another venue.Right, rant over normal service will be resumed next month."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-clifftop-castle-tales","story":"I have always wanted to visit it, but never seemed to get the opportunity then suddenly, a day of sunny weather last week combined with some free time made a trip possible.The walk to the castle was stunning, with purple heather-clad braes and a sparkling sea. To add to the magic, we saw dolphins as we approached the ruins.There is actually little left of the castle itself: small chunks of masonry jutting out like broken teeth are the only obvious evidence to the existence of the clf-top fortress.But itrsquos the location, and the stories attached to it, which tingle the spine.Itrsquos a steep descent to it, and care needs to be taken as you near the castle, for the path veers dangerously close to the edge of the clfs.We took it gradually, with a distant view of the ruins enticing us. A solid cement walkway now links the promontory to the mainland, where once a drawbridge gave access to the castle. The kids crossed it, one by one, with help from me and my we Kate. Itrsquos at this point, as you enter the historic remains, that the power of the location is truly revealed.Itrsquos like walking into lsquothe godsrsquo of a giant natural amphitheatre, with clfs looming on both sides, and sheer drops below. The sound of the open sea and gulls swamp your senses, and I was thankful we had visited when it was calm, for I can imagine a visit on a windy day would give the precipitous edges an almost terrying character. We settled down for our picnic where once the great hall stood, with breathtaking views.Whenever I visit such places, itrsquos not just what is seen that inspires me itrsquos the stories of the place. Here the ghosts of the past wait to tell you their tale,you have an ear to listen. And what tales are sewn onto this rocky top!The castle gets its first mention in the early s, but for sure human habitation predates that. In , the English captured it and it remained in English hands for the rest of that century a stone in the shoe of south-east Scotland. It was finally retaken in  by the forces of Patrick Dunbar but later it became a rebuilt stronghold of the Home family.History records that they hosted the young princess Margaret Tudor here in  as she headed north to become Scotlandrsquos queen, with her marriage to James IV and thus change the destiny of both countries.She will have shared the views we had while we ate our picnic, although I suspect her banquet may have been a little more indulgent. Who can say what impressions this wild view gave her of her new homeland.Her granddaughter, Mary Queen of Scots, would visit the castle  years later in , in what for her was a very turbulent time.How I wished the few stones of the castle that still stood could tell a story of these remarkable women, who had to navigate their royal privilege through misogynist contempt.After being abandoned, the castlersquos windswept ruins were the haunt of smugglers and wreckers, who would set a light amongst the old stones, making it look like a welcoming port.But it was the story of Madge Gordon that was foremost in my mind as I sat amongst the ruins of the castle that, according to the tale, she helped liberate from the English.The story is called the lsquoGuid We of Coldinghamrsquo and it is to be found in Wilsonrsquos Tales of the Borders. These were a fantastic collection of stories written by John Mackay Wilson in the early th century. Today, the Wilsonrsquos Tales Project promotes his work, which was prodigious.It is a tale set in the grim times of the Rough Wooing in the s, when English forces were using force and terror to persuade the Scots to agree to the marriage of the young Mary Queen of Scots to Edward Tudor.Madge was a widow with an abiding hatred of the English occupiers, who had killed her husband. Her daughter Janet was in love with a young man called Florence, but Madge would only agree to their marriagethe young man showed his loyalty and mettle by helping her to take Fast Castle, which had been occupied by English forces.This he agreed to do, and raised a force of over a hundred local people. Madge hatched a plan to attack the castle, but both she and Florence kept it secret from Janet. She feared for her loversquos le, and felt strongly that war was pointless for it mattered not who occupied the castle as the poor folk would be oppressed either way.Madge led the attack, entering the castle in the guise of being a seller of local produce, then plunging her husbandrsquos sword into a guard. The ensuing fight was short and brutal. The young Florence fought bravely and the castle was won.After this, Madge proudly agreed that the brave Florence was worthy of her daughterrsquos hand in marriage. Janet, who had heard the commotion of the fight and rushed to the scene, desperately looked for her Florence.When she saw he was alive, she rushed joyfully to him and held him in a tight embrace. He held her likewise, saying her name ldquoJanet.But this was to be his last word spoken, for his hold on her began to weaken and his legs gave way. He had been mortally wounded in the fight. Janet screamed for help and he was carried into a room in the castle, where frantic attempts to revive him were made but he was gone.Janet plunged into inconsolable grief. She blamed her mother, and the unbearable loss sent her to the grave only two years later. Her mother followed the year after, and all three rest in Coldingham kirkyard.ldquoWhat a sad story, my we said after I had finished telling it. ldquoIs it true ldquoMaybe not in the sense you mean, I said, ldquobut it is a story with real truth: how war spawns hatred and loss, and as Janet said, the poor folk lose out whoever rules the castle.On such a sunny day, it was dficult to leave this beautul place, but the kids wanted a swim and the sun was already lowering in the sky.The walk back is a hard slog up the brae, but it gives moments to rest and catch your breath while turning to view the ruins.Here, surrounded by millions of years of geology, with the view of the tumbled remains of a castle in which lives now long forgotten were lived, a whisper is heard in the wind.ldquoWhatever your woes, whatever your joys, yours is a tiny speck in time, so use it wisely and with gratitude.On that day, I think we did just that."},{"url":null,"title":"msp-column-ensuring-river-esk-remains-clean","story":"For too long now, the river has been a point of concern for many of my constituents, and I wanted to start a forum where it would bring together those who are working to clean the river, as well as those from the community with an interest in the river, so that we could all work together to find a resolution.In my view, it is important that we look at the cleanliness of the river as a whole, tackling the issues from the sewage spillages and the coal mine discharge in Midlothian, right down to the poor water quality at Fisherrow.The meeting was productive and I am looking forward to seeing progress on this matter.

But a coastal branch line didnrsquot even have that fallback. By the s, golf and seaside holidays were booming in resorts. With only horse-drawn transport available, Aberlady and Gullane both felt disadvantaged without access by train.So the Aberlady, Gullane and North Berwick Railway was launched as a private venture in . It soon ran into problems.Landowners denied access, requiring a detour, putting Aberlady station half a mile from the village. NBR fought any extension past Gullane to avoid competing with their own line from Drem.Such problems delayed opening until April , , when a service of nine trains a day ran between Longniddry, which had three s, and the Haddington branch. Trains ran one and a half miles to a junction at Spittal, where the line curved north, then veered east to what is now Aberlady Caravan Park. The track bed has been ed to farmland, but incongruous over-bridges on the Ballencrieff and Fenton roads mark where it once ran.Just north of the Peffer Burn, a wooden  was added in  for the exclusive use of Luffness Golf Club members.

The line was kept open to ship local sugar beet to Cupar for processing, but even that ended in .The line does have little-known claims to fame: when King George VI visited Scotland during the Second World War, his royal train was parked here as a safe location in , drivers were trained on their new diesel multiple units on this soon-to-become Beeching branch line casualty.If only NBR had foresight to build the ECML direct through Tranent and Haddington to East Linton, they could have built a truly scenic Lothian Coast Railway from Musselburgh to North Berwick ndash and ALL towns and villages between."},{"url":null,"title":"ormiston-couple-jenny-harry-runciman-toast-70th-wedding-anniversary","story":"Jenny and Harry Runciman celebrated their th wedding anniversary at their home on George Crescent.The couple married in Pencaitland Parish Church on August , .

Keep your wall colours neutral, like white and grey, but use your curtains, bedding and cushions to inject splashes of colour.Buying new bedding and hanging a new set of curtains can cost a lot less than a few tins of paint once you factor in all the rollers and brushes yoursquoll need to buy, plus it will take less time too.Once yoursquove bought the cushions, next time yoursquore thinking about changing the colour, just buy new covers and match the size of the cushions. That means you can store the others away, pass them on to a friend or use them in another room.Donrsquot forget about artwork. You can find some really trendy prints online and IKEA is great for cheap frames too. Make sure you buy the same size prints each time, meaning you can keep the same frames. You can update the frames easily too with a cheap can of spray paint.Canrsquot afford a new carpet  Yoursquoll be amazed at what a good deep clean and adding a colourful or patterned rug can do.If your furniture is looking a bit tired, upcycle with a lick of paint and new door handles. You can pick up a tin of furniture paint from most hardware stores or online and you can buy cute, quirky doorknobs from eBay or Etsy, or even just try spray painting the existing ones.Metal accessories like curtain rods and light fittings can benefit from that spray paint too!Upcycling is a great way to keep costs low, give a much loved item a new lease of le and is good for the environment by cutting out waste.Living roomMoving on to the most used room in the house, this can be the most dficult to update as it no doubt has many uses. From the TV room to the playroom to the dining room, your living space probably needs to be more practical than anything . But you can still add some style along the way.Your sofa likely dominates the room and can be the most expensive piece in the room ndash with the exception of the TV! So replacing this often can be costly. But have you considered replacing the covers  If your sofa is in generally good condition but itrsquos looking a bit off-colour, you can buy covers that fit over the top.IKEA do a range of these covers that are made for their sofa ranges, but you can find places online that offer made to measure services. This can be more expensive, but definitely cheaper than buying a whole new sofa and are machine washable! Alternatively, adding a new throw and some scatter cushions can have the same effect.Many of the tips for the bedroom can be used in the living room too. Like adding a nice feature wall for a splash of colour or why not try adding a nice gallery wall with lots of family pictures  A great way to add a personal touch to a room. You can even get the family involved to pick out their favourite pictures.Plants are a great way to brighten up a room and fill any unused corners. Donrsquot worry, it doesnrsquot mean another mouth to feed, there are plenty of really great looking fake ones to buy.Have you tried shopping from other rooms in your house  Yoursquod be surprised at how much you can change your rooms by simply swapping the accessories about.HallwayTherersquos nothing nicer than a warm welcome so donrsquot forget your hallway when yoursquore giving your home a makeover.If itrsquos on the small size then good advice is to keep it nice and bright to give the illusion of space and add colour by adding some prints to the wall, some useful hanging hooks and even a funky doormat.Everything in your hallway needs to have a practical use, but that doesnrsquot mean it has to be boring.You can add plants here too butyoursquore limited on floor space, why not try some hanging baskets or small potted plants on shelves.Maybe go the extra mile and paint the doors in your hallway  This trend is becoming more popular, with people opting for painting their doors and skirting boards, from pink to yellow and even black.Hopefully, these tips have given you some DIY inspiration to give your home a little low-cost makeover."},{"url":null,"title":"online-edinburgh-festival-12-must-see-shows-events","story":"Thats exactly what has happened.You cant generally hit pause and play at the same time, but the Edinburgh Festival has managed it for its  iteration, with a rich, brave and pioneering programme of mostly digital and online events with here and there a visual treat for capital residents and those tourists who have decided to come anyway.The theatres may be dark but, as the programme makes clear, the artistic light burns bright regardless.My Light Shines On DisplayAs well as being the umbrella title for much of the digital offering from this yearrsquos Edinburgh International Festivalndash Kirsty Wark fronts the programme, which features a performance by Scottish Chamber Orchestra cellist Su-a Lee ndash My Light Shines On is also a light display project which will illuminate the cityrsquos famous festival venues.Using beacons of light which will be visible from vantage points across the capital it has been created by Scottish lighting designers Kate Bonney and Simon Hayes, the duo behind Pitlochryrsquos Enchanted Forest and the Electric Glen in East Renfreshire.The inspiration is the tradition of the so-called lsquoghost lightrsquo in which a light is left on in a theatre even when the venue is lsquodarkrsquo, as all theatres currently are.

With recycling centres and charity shops open again therersquos no excuse. Spend the weekend sorting through any unwanted items and donate where you can.For storage solutions, you need to think outside the box ndash literally. Vacuum bags are ideal, they normally come in multipacks of ious sizes and are really cheap. Great for anything soft that is taking up a lot of space. Winter clothes, quilts and blankets can be reduced to a tenth of the size and slide under the bed nicely.If floor space is a problem, then the sky is the limit, literally. Consider storing items that arenrsquot needed on a regular basis above units or wardrobes. Think about shelving units that are tall and slim, rather than long and bulky.Cheap and cheerful plastic, canvas or cardboard boxes can help to keep everything in place while adding a splash of colour and style. Perfect for keeping clutter off the floor.Shelves above radiators are a great way to use otherwise wasted space.If the kids are desperate for some space, a reading nook or kids study area can easily be achieved under the stairs or a window. A simple storage box with a couple of cushions on top will create a comfy seat and can double up as extra storage.Hooks can be attached to pretty much anything like bedroom doors and inside cupboards ndash again keeping items off the floor will create the illusion of more space. In the kitchen, using hooks to hang pots and pans and magnets for knives can free up cupboard space and make a statement.Knowing where things are is half the battle when considering storage options, so think about clear plastic boxes or bags that are easy to see into and can be labelled.Flexible furniture like extendable dining tables, sofa beds and even clothes rails are ideal as they have multiple uses and can be stored away easily when not in use.Let there be lightLighting and mirrors are your friends when it comes to making a smaller room feel bigger. Change large floor lamps for smaller wall lights and when it comes to wall colour, stick to pale colours and swap out heavy curtains with blinds. Luckily, a big tub of value white paint goes a long way. Let in as much light as possible, give the windows a good scrub and update yellowing lightbulbs to bright white.OutdoorsIs it time to rethink that huge sofa set and professional sized goal posts  When buying furniture, think small, light and foldable so that they can be stored away in a shed or cupboard or easily moved around. Updating your garden furniture doesnrsquot need to cost the earth, yoursquoll find some really great bargain sets in supermarkets like Aldi, Asda and Tesco and homeware stores like BM.Another way to make it feel bigger is to simply give it a good tidy. Yoursquoll be surprised at how much space you do have after clearing out those unwanted flowerpots, cutting the grass and trimming back the hedges.Your home is an investment, to be enjoyed for a long time and with these simple but effective ideas, you can enjoy the space you have for longer."},{"url":null,"title":"young-people-scotland-can-get-250-free-starting-new-job","story":"Its hoped the payment, which is open for applications from today, will help young people with the financial dficulties of starting a new job - including buying new clothes, travel and get childcare.It is estimated around  young people will benefit from the new financial support in its first year.What is the benefit The Job Start Payment is a one-off sum of pound for  to -year-oldsthey have been unemployed for at least six months.The upper age limit rises to  for care leavers and the payment increases to poundthe person has a child.How can I qualy for the payment To qualy for the payment, which will be delivered by Social Security Scotland, the person applying must have received a job offer for paid employment.They must be out of paid work and must have been receiving one of the qualying benefits for six months or more at the time of the job offer:What has the Scottish Government said Social Security Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville said: ldquoI am delighted that our Job Start Payment is today now open for applications it really couldnrsquot come at a better time to support our young people to take up job offers.ldquoYoung people are among those whose job prospects have been hardest hit by this pandemic.

Both hills can be climbed in one expedition but we didnrsquot arrive in Falkland until early afternoon and the short daylight hours of winter didnrsquot give us a lot of time to climb both hills and visit the Palace, so we opted for East Lomondand a wander down a fascinating little glen called Maspie Den.We parked in the village and made our way up Cross Wynd towards the hill that towered above us, completely dominating the village. It looked like a very steep climb and it was. At the top end of Cross Wynd with a rather dilapidated factory on one side and houses on the other we reached the beginning of the lsquoofficialrsquo path and the start of several long sets of wooden steps.I guess these steps were built with the best of intentions but it was obvious that most folk walk up the side of them. Whatever the merits or not of wooden steps it wasnrsquot long before we could gaze back through the beech trees and see the amount of height we had gained in a very short time. We were surprised how quickly we reached the top of the woods where the angle of the path eased sufficiently to let us get our breath back, but it wasnrsquot long before it steepened again as it climbed the final dome to the summit and its view indicator.From here we could begin to get an impression of the whole of the Lomond Hills Regional Park, a precious  square mile area of moorland, hills, lochs and farmland. The area was designated as Scotlands first Regional Park in  in recognition of its importance for recreation and conservation.As we dropped down towards the Craigmead car park we appreciated the conservation value of such parks as we watched a hen harrier quarter the moorland in search of prey. The ghostly movement of the bird was impressive, a fine raptor that is sadly being victimised by so-called sportsmen in many other areas of Scotland.The car park at Craigmead is also the starting point for climbing the slightly higher West Lomond , but we were intent on something a bit dferent ndash a walk back to Falkland by the impressive Maspie Den, finishing with a wander through the policies of the House of Falkland.Leaving the car park we crossed a field and passed through young woodland before dropping down into the Den, and what a surprise that was. The path suddenly steepens to the right and you drop into what could be described as a mini-cavern with the footpath going behind the waters of the Yad waterfall. Not really the kind of sight yoursquod expect on a walk in rural Fe!The path continues to drop down beside the burn with little sets of waterfalls to keep your interest alive. You cross several bridges before you enter woodland again. Ignore ious turn-offs to the right and continue through another unexpected feature, a dark winding tunnel that takes you into the grounds of the House of Falkland.This rather grand Jacobean-style building was the former home of the Marquess of Bute and today is a school for boys with special needs. The whole estate is still pretty impressive and the long private drive back into Falkland passes a number of interesting looking buildings, including the old stables which today house the offices of the Falkland Heritage Trust. It makes a fine ending to a great short walk.Cameron McNeishROUTE PLANNERMap: OS :, Landranger sheets and  Start Finish: Car Park in Falkland Distance:  miles kmTime: - hoursInformation: St Andrews TIC,  .

Perhaps more importantly, it is also among the prettiest. Even the graveyard is appealing, with its beautully engraved and embellished th-century headstones, their coating of moss as useful as a compass for telling which way is north. Until Covid , passers-by were always welcome to enter. The day the kirk door is once more unlocked at all hours wersquoll know all is well again.Early last Sunday we had gone only a few yards when a friend stopped her car to chat. The last time we spoke she apologisedwe were catching a whf of venison liver, as a package had leaked on the passenger seat. Her collie was sitting beside her in the front, butthere was any lingering aroma she was the only one to catch it. Our friend is a boon to local butchers, as is Alan. The previous day he had queued behind a woman ordering lambrsquos liver for herself and her dog. When quizzed she revealed that she also gives him ham rolls with salad, although he always leaves the salad.The path we often take on Sundays is a regular circuit, whose interest never wanes. In good weather, the view over the Cheviots is like a Van Gogh, the foreground filled by fields of wheat or stubble, the hills a smudge of dark blue in the distance. Even in torrential rain the canopy of trees that hangs over the track acts as an umbrella. It would be possible to cover these short miles with only a few minutes entirely without shelter. Given recent downpours, though, those minutes make the dference between dry or squelchy boots.The previous Sunday we encountered a Geordie disconsolately smoking by a stile. He had been walking for a couple of hours after waking, in his tent, to find himself in two inches of water. His sleeping bag was soaked.His companion, who had held them back by stopping too often ldquofor a beer and a tar, had already abandoned the expedition. Even though the sun was shining, he seemed on the verge of doing the same. We pointed him towards Jedburgh, beyond which lay his destination of Holy Island, but will never knowhe made it.The path we usually take goes past a couple of farms. The main attraction lately is to catch a glimpse of a foal, which is only a few weeks old. Before we reached the paddock, we caught sight of him between the trees, ginger, spindly-legged and stuck to his motherrsquos side like a barnacle on a keel. A friend saw him one morning shortly after he had been turned into the field, galloping at full speed, legs out front and back.We stood by the gate, watching the older bay foal reclining on the grass, while the mares grazed. Then a renegade sheep made an unexpected appearance. It hirpled towards the horses, one foreleg dangling, but making good speed with its three ing limbs. In a moment, the young bay was up, putting its mother between him and the intruder. The sheep skirted them and went its way, and moments later, with danger passed, both foals were suckling. The little ones stumpy tail whirled asbattery operated.Continuing down the track, we were approached by horses on every side. Around here they are so used to people that they consider every passer-by a friend. Occasionally they have thundered along the field side to say hello.In one pasture, our steps startled them into galloping off, but when we leaned over the fence they cantered back, doubtless hoping for snacks. Like so many horses in summer, one was wearing a mesh hood as protection against flies. Its an idea hill-walkers should consider.Not long after reaching the old drove road, the sound of baying reached us from a farm where hounds are kennelled. It was so frenzied you might have thought a fox was taunting them from beyond the fence. It is always an unnerving noise, a throw-back, perhaps, to the howling of wolves.By the time we reached their farm, they had quietened. Its always a relief. I like dogs, but the prospect of being surrounded by an excited pack is worrying. Ive had more than enough run-ins with Alsatians and nippy sheep dogs to know how scary they can be when chasing you off their land.My sister was once bitten by a dog on a farm in France, and had to be given an anti-rabies injection in her stomach. Impressively stoical when it comes to medical matters, she still shudders at the memory. It was possibly even worse than the day she caught her fingers in the blender.The road past the farm leads to wooded hillside, beyond a lake. This morning two swans faced each other, creating the love heart shape so beloved of hoteliers as they contort hand-towels for your arrival. Three deep grey cygnets swam beside them, with no hint yet of white. Two have disappeared in recent weeks, feared to have fallen foul of foxes.Near the lake is a verge where last month we came across a family of newborn voles. One had been trampled, and its siblings were either in shock or simply too young to realise what had happened. I prodded them with a frond of grass to urge them back into the hedgerow, out of sight of passing predators.On our final mile, we encountered a creature that would have swallowed them like Coco Pops. In the cool green shade of an avenue of beeches, a heavy bird suddenly launched itself onto the air and disappeared deeper into the trees. As we got closer, it moved further again. Each time we were too far away to identy it. I thought buzzard, Alan an owl. The rest of the walk was spent trying to settle the matter, although like so much in the countryside, it will forever remain a mystery."},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary-back-school-giggles","story":"WITH youngsters back behind their desks and le settling into the unormity of the school unorm, wersquore recalling classic tales involving kids of all ages .

Sometimes you start the day, and you feel like yoursquove got no direction or sense of urgency, because yoursquore missing some of the lab work and data.For me, personally, my slump resulted in changes in mood and behaviour. I was sleeping more, eating junk food and moving very little. All of this added to the feelings of worthlessness that were rising within me because, especially in lockdown, there really wasnrsquot anyone to bounce ideas off and share experiences with.Since labs started to re-open, I have found that some of the social aspects of PhD study are starting to come back into my le, and commuting to and from the lab by bike has boosted my mood because itrsquos got me moving again.But research was lonely before lockdown.

The dference is due to the peculiarities of the two electoral systems, the one guaranteed to produce an overall majority in Westminster on as little as  per cent of the votes, the other designed to prevent an overall majority under any but the most unpredictable circumstances. The result has been shameless opportunism by the Unionist parties in proposing a vote of no confidence in John Swinney, when he did what any education secretary should do in protecting the value of the qualications awarded to candidates, as all candidates suffer when their awards are devalued. Had the SQA awarded a % pass rate based on teachersrsquo inflated estimates, he would have been castigated by these same parties. Tory MSP Jamie Greene even called for the resignation of Fiona Robertson for, effectively, not only following the instructions of her employer, the Education Secretary, but also of protecting the value of SQArsquos qualications as she was bound to do in her contract of employment.

Nicola Sturgeon stands up daily to answer questions, and is regarded as trustworthy all over the UK in a way that Boris Johnson is not.You donrsquot require weasel words like ldquosaintly to describe competence. Impartial news and journalism is important. The media that operates in Scotland, not least the BBC, have allowed themselves to be exploited as a conduit for attacks on the governing party in a way that does not happen in England. The public arenrsquot daft they can see this bias in the dferent emphasis placed, for example, on the education ldquoshambles on both sides of the Border. You can see it on any health issue, where the BBC in Scotland immediately escalates every story to a government ministerial responsibility. That never happens in England, in spite of repeated serious health scandals over decades.Why does this matter  It seems that repeated, and context-free, SNP-bad stories have inured many in the public into regarding much of the news as Unionist ldquodisinformation, and increasingly easy to ignore. An interesting project for universities to evaluate. The latest wheeze is to badge every spending commitment to Scotland with a Union flag asScots did not pay taxes.

It has nothing to do with the competence or otherwise of any political parties or inidual politicians but has everything to do with my perception of the competence of the Scottish nation.

The political make-up of the Scottish Parliament may not meet with Dr Edwardss approval, but he and all of Scotlands voters will be able to have their say next May and we will get the government we elect, unlike the situation at Westminster where we get not only the government England elects, but an unelected second chamber, where the already excessive numbers are due to be swollen still more by a Dame who is currently ensconced in Holyrood as a Tory MSP. Wheres the democracy in that Dr Edwards need have no fear that \"independence will be foisted upon us\". Scotland will regain her independence when Scotlands voters make that choice, and as there has been a \"signicant and material change of circumstance\" since  and as opinion polls increasingly indicate that voters want to make that choice, there should be no obstacles put in Scotlands way to prevent the choice being made. That would be a real travesty of democracy.Ruth Marr, Stirling.A NEW poll shows that four in  Scots, including a majority of SNP voters, do not want English tourists to be admitted to Scotland .

The tourist industry has been very hard hit by the coronavirus, and consists of far more than BBs and attractions of ious kinds.

It just happened by chance to be the cloth on my fatherrsquos old briefcase and the prince said lsquothatrsquos just what Irsquom looking for,rsquo said Sugden, who has just been announced as a textiles programme ambassador for The Princersquos Foundation.ldquoThe majority of stag horn buttons come from Austria. The prince is very open and both fastidious and passionate about craft. So he insisted that the buttons had to be Scottish stag horn. He does care about the detail. It really matters to him that he promotes British craftsndash even with the smallest of things.ldquoWe were actually both a little concerned that it would be the Austrian buttons that went on the jacket because we couldnrsquot find an alternative at the time. But the princersquos fastidious nature drove us to look into sourcing Highland stag and we went to great s to do so. Now we have a gamekeeper who makes them for us.ldquoWhy do we have to ship stag horn buttons from Austria at all that extra cost  It does not make sense. It also fits in with the princersquos philosophy about carbon footprint with the distance goods unnecessarily travel to market.The cost of the jacket and waistcoat has not been revealed, but a similar bespoke pair of the garments made by Campbellrsquos retails at around pound,.Sugden said the princersquos insistence on Scottish stag horn buttons was one important example of why it was important to promote British crafts.Through his role as an ambassador, he will use his expertise of working in the textiles industry to support the princersquos charity in its vision, mission and strategy.He is also co-chair with Patrick Grant ndash from the BBCrsquos The Great British Sewing Bee ndash of the Dumfries House textiles school in Ayrshire.The Princersquos Foundationrsquos Future Textiles programme aims to address a skills gap within the UK textiles industry by offering practical workshops and advanced training courses to school pupils, teachers and those looking to gain employment in the industry.

Sugden is too discreet to name other famous clients but admitted: ldquoI often see our clothes being worn by people gracing the pages of Hello, Country Le, and Harperrsquos Bazaar.ldquoI saw the movement towards craft coming. I try to push and promote British-made products. We use British cloth every time we can. We have some of the finest fabrics in the world. Fast fashion will have a downward spiral.Sugden has worked with the prince for five years. ldquoI have always had a passion for clothing and for making things in Britain ndash and so does the prince, he said.People are starting to care more about provenance. But I was struck by the lack of skills in the industry that were in danger of dying out and that it was imperative to build them up.ldquoThe problem is not really in design ndash lots of people want to be designers ndash but there is a worrying age gap in making things in such skills as cutting, tailoring and working as seamstresses. If the demand is coming back we need to make young people feel valued in the industry again.ldquoWe need people to work on the shop floor of the mills again ndash it is not like the days of Jerusalem and dark satanic mills. They are modern working spaces. A weaving job is a skilled job. We all canrsquot be designers. We have to enthuse people to be involved in the whole process. Even the skills to darn socks are being lost.Sugden recognised that the fashion industry had to do more to cut down on its environmental damage from such things as microfibres polluting the ocean.He said: ldquoWe need to drive down the use of plastic in the industry. I know its a great passion of his highness as well to get its usage down. Itrsquos a huge challenge for the fashion industry, but in the UK we are specialists in natural fibres. I would rather buy natural fibres ndash why do we need polyester  Itrsquos just the price.

Incidentally, I expectBrand had been challenged to name another famous woman from history, he would have had to concentrate really hard before coming up with \"the Queenrsquorsquo.Getting to the crux of his argument, he declared that Margaret Thatcher was more of a \"woman-manrsquorsquo because she was \"a very powerful personrsquorsquo but didnrsquot do much to advance womenrsquos equality.

Thatrsquos not in any way what the SQA are doing. What they are looking at is the comparison of assessment of performance or estimation of performance with final performance.But a document outlining the approach it was takingfrom the SQA clearly contradicted this.In a portion related to the awarding of results, it said that schools and colleges would provide them with their estimates of the grades, bands and rank order for each learner, for each course at National , Higher and Advanced Higher.\"We will then check and validate that information. We will moderate it,necessary, to ensure consistency across schools and colleges and with results from previous years,\" it said.\"We will use the information from these estimates, in addition to prior learner attainment, where this is available. For example,learners achieved National  or Higher courses, in a previous year.\"We will also look at schoolsrsquo and collegesrsquo previous history of estimating and attainment in each subject and level. We may moderate these estimates, up or down,that is required.\"In further guidance it said that the moderation would \"ensure consistency across centres and fairness to candidates. This will include analyses of centresrsquo estimates and outcomes, prior attainment, progression statistics, and grade distributions.\"Scotlands biggest teaching union EIS said there was a \"bigger question\" to be asked about changing the system that \"routinely disregards\" teachers assessments.It said the current \"high stakes assessment system\" regularly fails children through operating \"notional quotas\" for the awarding of As, Bs, and Cs. It said they \"inevitably\" impact most on pupils on the cusp of achieving pass grades, the majority of whom are more likely to be from disadvantaged backgrounds\".The union believes that planning for next years exams \"on the basis of business as usual\" appeared \"woefully complacent\".It said this needs to \"be addressed urgently\" through a review.EIS general secretary Larry Flanagan said the concern surrounds that fact the SQA assessments which hit pupils in disdvantaged areas happens every year, although normally they are founded on exam results rather than teachers estimates as in this pandemic-hit year.\"Every year pupils on the cusp of passes are potentially pushed into a lower category,\"he said.\"Returning to the injustice aspect ndashteachers have classroom evidence over the course of a year which indicates pupils ability and competence at a certain level but a high stakes exam system routinely disregards that ndash is that fair \"Based on this yearrsquos outcry, most people would say not.\"Barry Black, a researcher at the University of Glasgow specialising in educational inequality, said it had been clear from the start that the SQA moderation would further disadvantage already disadvantaged young people - and said there should be a rethink for next year.\"This whole process has been one that brought about signicant levels of uncertainty,\" he said.\"It is more frustrating as it could have been avoided from the start had the SQA and Scottish Government listened to the warnings from Parliament, experts and academics from as early as April which continued through the summer.\"He said there was scope for an alternative assessment model which would have predominantly been based on the performance of the inidual pupils.A range of options open to the SQA included the collection and submission of evidence of pupilsrsquo work, which \"could have been a system that was fairer to the inidual students, rather than the system wide statistical moderation that was used\".He added: \"The changes announced earlier this week to accept all teacher estimates would not make for an ideal alternative methodthey were planned from the start, but are fairer than the methodology that was used. It will be of huge relief to the impacted young people and it is a welcome change.ldquoAn urgent review is the right thing, including looking at the role of assessment more generally, especially since we know that there is an even bigger risk of a hugely widened attainment gap in the next school year.\"An analysis from the Equality Impact Assessment, reveals that the  estimate from students in the most deprived areas was at an .% pass rate but the actual result reduced that number down to .%. A . percentage point reduction. For pupils from the richest areas, the  pass rate estimate was at .% with the actual result at .%, a . percentage point reduction.The changes announced on Tuesday mean that this years Higher pass rate will now sit at .%, up . percentage points on , while the Advanced Higher pass rate is at .%, up . points from the previous year.But Mr Swinney in apologising, continued to insist that young people from deprived backgrounds had not in fact been disadvantaged by the SQA methodology that was used.He focused on the overall pass rate which he said had increased by . per cent among pupils in the most disadvantaged communities, while it rose by . per cent among pupils in the least deprived communities.While the education secretary has apologised for what happened, the SQA has so far failed to.Mr Swinney made it clear on Tuesday that he was not criticising the SQA saying it undertook the task \"that I set and did so in good faith\" and said he was \"grateful...for the professional approach that they have taken\".The chief executive of Scotlands qualications authority Fiona Robertson insisted it had done its best to carry out the instructions of the Scottish Government.She had told Holyroods education committee on Wednesday that she was \"keenly aware of the strength of feeling\" about the results - but said it felt \"essential\" to \"maintain standards\" between dferent schools and years.She said the SQA treated teacher estimates with \"utmost respect\", but there was a \"clear and unequivocal case for some moderation\" because they were \"not always accurate\".Mr Swinney has said on Tuesday that the SQA action \"emphasised heavily the importance of maintaining standards from previous years to this year\".But he said he had changed his mind after listening to the \"heartfelt pleas\" and \"anguish\" from young people who had been affected.An independent review is to be led by Professor Mark Priestley of the University of Stirling.An initial report is expected within five weeks.A Scottish Government spokesman said. ldquoAfter listening to the concerns of young people, Ministers are clear that there was a risk of young people from working class backgrounds, and others, losing faith in the education system and the value of their hard work. That is why the Education Secretary has apologised and taken action to ensure that education can still be seen as a route out of poverty.ldquoWe have taken the decision to rely on teacher judgement as the basis for this yearrsquos qualications, but are also clear that this year is and must be seen as unique and cannot be compared to previous years and nor can it set an automatic precedent for future years.ldquoWe have already commissioned an independent review of Curriculum for Excellence, and we will work with them on extending the remit of this review to include recommendations on how to transform the Scottish approach to assessment and qualications, based on best practice globally.Barry Black analysis in fullI think there is a really interesting question in the data from results day around why professional teacher judgement - which we put so much onus on in Scotland - is seemingly at odds with the results an exam model would expect to produce. That is why a review into the role of assessment more generally is encouraging.Ideally there would be some level of moderation within any alternative assessment model.Ideally, this would have predominantly been based on the performance of the inidual pupils and not the historical attainment of pupilrsquos schools - which is where the issues we saw stemmed from, and what were warned about and against. As for next year, I think the potential for more disruption this school year needs to be considered ahead of the assessment diet. It also needs to factor in that those sitting qualications have already lost class time before the summer, and that lockdown will have almost certainly impacted upon attainment and the attainment gap signicantly.The moderation process was explicitly designed to replicate consistent results with previous exam diets, and produced wholly dferent results to the teachers estimation. Which brings about the questionwe currently assess in the best way to reflect young peoplersquos abilities.What the SQA tried to do with moderation, as they have set out, was maintain what they would describe as national standards in the assessment system this year - broadly seeking to get consistent results with previous years exam diets. That is why the predominant feature of their methodology was tolerance levels of grades at a school based on results it had achieved previously.To all intents and purposes, their moderation aimed to pattern what would happen in a normal year. But such statistical system-wide adjustments were always destined to impact more disadvantaged inidual students the most.Plainly, although exam results are socially patterned in normal years, iniduals still have control over the process - through coursework and exams. This year they clearly didnrsquot have that, and were assessed not by their inidual performance, but the past performance of their school.Thatrsquos why the interesting question around teacher judgement being seemingly at odds with what an exam diet would expect predict to happen arises."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11704186.jpg?type=article-full","title":"scots-complicit-slavery-long-act-union-says-academic","story":"Professor David Worthington, a reader in history at the University of Highlands and Islands, has been involved in researching Scotlandrsquos involvement in the slave trade pre-.He found evidence Scots were involved in several European markets in countries, including the Netherlands, that had links to South American plantations that recruited African and indigenous slaves.While recent condemnation has focused on major cities and the statues of iniduals who profited from colonialism, he says merchants from rural parts of Scotland, including the Highlands were also profiting from lucrative sugar plantations owned by slavers, decades before.: Plaques on Scotlands statues do not go far enough, says anti-racism groupHe said: ldquoItrsquos fascinating to take itback to the s, which often people donrsquot do, and to see that these entanglements have deep roots.ldquoIf we go back before the Anglo Scottish Union of  ndash which is such a feature of our lives ndash I think people would often think Scottish involvement in the slave trade would be in connection with the British Empire, which is when Scots have the chance to be involved in the overseas empire.ldquoOf course Scotland had its own empire before  with the Darien project [an unsuccessful attempt to gain wealth and influence by establishing New Caledonia, a colony on the Isthmus of Panama, in the late ] but the involvement of people in Scotland in the slave trade was not actually dependant on the Union.ldquoThere were several overseas empires which were very happy to engage in slavery and thatrsquos something that we have to consider.One of the main trade centreswas a Dutch colony in Rotterdam,says Mr Worthington but records of Scots involved at that timeare scare.: Without slavery Glasgow wouldnt exist: Thebrutal truth of Scotlands slaving pastHe said: ldquoI think theywere a bit more slippery. The numbers arenrsquot that great from the Highlands but they were exploiting the fact they were on the margins.In the period before the th century, Mr Worthington says Scots travelling abroad were more likely to go toa European country than North America, which led to imperial connections.The key industries, pre , were tobacco and sugar and it was not uncommon, he says, for Dutch merchants to trade sugar for horses, which were shipped to plantations in South America.He said: ldquoWe think of the tobacco lords of Glasgow and rightly so because they have left a massive imprint on the city but the involvement of sugar in slavery tends not to get as much attention and that was happening very early.ldquoThe whole system in the Highlands of importing sugar was distinct and I noticed when I was looking at the customs records for Inverness the majority of shipping and shipments were coming from Rotterdam.: Pheona Matovu: To abolish slavery in Scotland we need to address the structures that perpetuate itldquoThat made me think, where were they coming from to get to Rotterdam because obviously the Dutch werenrsquot growing sugar cane.ldquoThe Dutch were expanding their colonial enterprise in the th century and led me to think about the major sugar producing plantation in the Dutch colonies at that time, whichwas Suriname.

In the lowlands it was sent to sugar refineries, there were two on the Clyde and one in Edinburgh.ldquoIn the highlands it was just being taken direct from the Netherlands.ldquoIt was certainly coming into places like Glasgow and Leith in large quantities too.ldquoWe often think of the diet as being very basic in the highlands and that was probably the case but there are even references to sugar in the Western Isles at this time.\"Tea was becoming very fashionable and putting sugar in your tea was something that was marketed.ldquoIt was a prized commodity and there was a lot of crime around it.ldquoThere was a case of a guy being put to death in Inverness for stealing sugar. They were importing these liquorice products and sugar candy and bizarrely named confections.After the Act of Union, Scotland began to import its sugar from the British Empire., from areas including Barbados and the West Indies.ldquoSugar has seeped across the whole of Northern Europe by , itrsquos a part of peoplesrsquo diet and thatrsquos quite sinister in a way.

This will require the Scottish Government to invest in lower emission modes of transport, including more fuel efficient ferries.“Orkney’s internal ferry service is a perfect example. This leline for our island communities is operated by ageing vessels, which are costly to run, damaging to the environment and no longer fit for purpose.“Scottish Ministers should therefore be looking to agree on a replacement programme with Orkney Islands Council that would introduce more fuel-efficient vessels that cut emissions, cost less to operate and provide our island communities with the service they need and deserve.“If the Scottish Government is genuinely committed to meeting its climate change objectives, and treating our islands with fairness, replacement of these vessels must now be a priority.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Meanwhile, teachers and other staff will have to maintain a distance from the children, while working hard to provide a safe and supportive learning environment.In a staggered approach, helmed by Orkney Islands Council, bairns have begun toto school, today, while pre-schools and nurseries are expected to resume, next week.As we caught up with some of the parents and pupils on this morning#s school route, #nervous but excited# was the phrase on most people#s lips. While children are happy to be reunited with their friends and teachers, and parents are pleased to see ato routine for their little ones, some admitted that they were just a peedie bit nervous about how it would all go.As Scotland remains in Phase Three of the lockdown exit route, the threat of coronavirus is still very much in the minds of us all. But OIC has assured parents that rigorous measures have been taken to help keep children and staff safe.The council has put together a Frequently Asked Questions list to help answer the common queries and concerns of parents and carers.

In these extraordinary circumstances we have seen the value of rapid and collaborative research in supporting our response to the crisis.ldquoThe findings published today from a study led by researchers at the University of Edinburgh and co-funded by UKRI support the growing body of evidence that face coverings reduce Covid- transmission via respiratory droplets.ldquoResearch into Covid- is obviously a relatively new field, with the science still evolving. New information about the virus plays a crucial role in informing policy makers and the public.The study was funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, the European Commission and Japan Student Services Organisation.copy -.

DaoineNow there is much within the machinations that occupy the precious time of our Comhairle officers that could well be regarded as relatively ‘trivial’, although I will fully concede that even the most improbable deliberations might well form the centre of somebody’s entire universe.But when we, as a community, or section of that community, continue to press for answers and resolutions to a subject that has already been explained fully to us, then we should ask ourselves one important question: “Are we doing this for the greater good, or because we are trying to promote our own agenda ”. about some of the material that was included in the Scottish Government’s RSHPguidelines and how I felt that some of it was completely over the top for inclusion in any classroom.Several concerned parents had written to me, asking what on earth was going on.I enquired of both the Director and Chair of Education and Children’s Services as to the validity of these concerns.I was happy to note that the ‘plot’ wasn’t as sinister as had been portrayed by some ‘concerned’ groups both within the counciland on anti-social media.Some alleged that the Comhairle were somehow, through the back-door and under the cover of the Covid- crisis , trying to sneak through an agenda which went against the “moral values of this community”.An inflammatory accusation, one that was sure to ignite passions and ring yet another Pavlovian bell.Except that, far from being subject matter that was about to get rammed down our children’s throats, not just ‘promoted’ it was simply an extreme example of what was included for reference, should anyone wish to avail themselves of it.Yes, some of it was fairly graphic stuff and, as I’ve said before, I was hugely alarmed that it was even considered for anything to be found in our classrooms.But, as is the case with material which has been taught in our schools for at least a couple of centuries the devil is in the detail .Luckily we have seen teachers, historically, opt to use the message of love, forgiveness, compassion and mutual understanding from this particular tome ignoring the more sinister aspects where death, retribution, punishment and all kinds of nastiness are very much front and centre.Choosing your testaments wisely is what this is primarily about.We are lucky to have an educational framework where common sense prevails, otherwise there could be very many distractions in the subjects of Biology, Geology and quite possibly Physics.I attempted to be amusing about a topic which has very legitimate, obvious, and serious, implications for our most impressionableyoung people.I hoped I was taking a cue from people who think that a banana dipped into a jar of Nutella is a suitable metaphor for something.Possibly the obesity crisis I think a jar of Bovril might have been funnier.If people wish to identy as a Unicorn and have sex with the pavement, then that’s fine too, but not surely for inclusion in ‘guidance’ material.Yes, I have to admit that I also jumped onto the bandwagon, until I had the situation clearly explained to me and was told to trust the teacher’.They will be given the ultimate discretion and they know best what’s appropriate for their young audience.We do ‘much ado’ well here.When ‘Ironside’ and ‘Bob the Budget Builder’ steered the Comhairle and helped many local businesses through the worst of the effects of the ongoing pandemic, we turned inward and focused on upholstery.With Bernie, Angus and the Education Department, all under immense pressure to get a hugely problematic school year underway on time, we are more focused on what won’tbe getting taught, rather than what will, and how.Andour kids come home from school with a penchant for strange combinations of fruit and nut sandwiches, then it will have been discussed with the Head Teacher and Parent Council first.A lot of the contentious issues which occupy us here in the Western Islesare perceived to exist somewhere between a conservative, culturally protective, radically Christian, ‘right’, and a somewhat more progressive, more liberal, secular, bunch of left-wing snowflakes.Most of us are somewhere, far more certainly and squarely, in the middle trying to make sense of it all.If we cannot empower and trust our teachers to do what’s best for the most vulnerable amongst us, then we will have failed both.The man of the week, last week, certainly in the northern half of this county, was the irrepressible David Black.Three rounds crammed into  hours saw him claim the Thompson Bruce Trophy at Stornoway and take an early lead in Scarista’s  ‘Blue-Riband’ event.Rounds of +  around Lady Lever Park on Friday and Saturday saw him edge out Eddie Rogers,  +  by just a single shot over  holes.A further shot adrt saw Murdo ‘Griddy’ MacLeod,  +  in third slot.Iain ‘Juke Box’ MacKay won the handicap trophy with two excellent rounds of nett  for a  total.In between his Thompson Bruce exploits, Davie also posted the leading score in the, two-round, Harris G.C. Club Championship.His  was  shots ahead of nearest challengers, Billy Fraser and Cal Robertson, both on .Starting with six straight pars, he succumbed to bogies at the ‘amen’ of corners, the deadly-deceiving brace of par-s at   .Naturally he bounced straight back birdies at the new th, and the th brought him back to level.He swapped a birdie for a bogey at  and  to see him home safely.Only a sht in plate tectonics will see him throw away this lead.Midweek at Stornoway saw the Glennie Trophy claimed by Iain Moir on  Stableford Points. Starting his opening four holes, five-over par, couldn’t have been good for his confidence.He was just one-over for the next .In the Junior section, Calum Gbounced back from his recent humblings at the hands of brother, Geordie H in the Par Bogey competition.Six ahead of the course, he demolished the rest of the field by  clear shots.In the Scarista midweek competition, Billy Fraser kept up his, season-long, decent form, partnering Chris Sutton to a fine win in the Pairs Greensomes.Their  was two ahead of Russell Tennant and Alan Gunn’s, .Benbecula’s finest continue to battle it out for their season-long Order of Merit, Dami Steele ing a semblance of normality, bouncing back from a week out of the top spots to consolidate his lead at the top.His round wasn’t, however, good enough to claim the full points last Tuesday evening, Domhnall MacKay storming to a -pointer and the maximum Point haul.Apparently Donald has been keeping his powderdry and intends, after a decent sabbatical, to make a strong charge over the coming weeks."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TOURISM-2-copy.jpg","title":"litir do luchd ionnsachaidh","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine.’.

These have been in the following council areas: Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council , Ards and North Down Borough Council , Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council , Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council , Mid and East Antrim Borough Council , and Newry, Mourne and Down District Council .In addition, there have been  clusters across Northern Ireland with fewer than five people.These figures are up to pm on th August . Cases in a smaller cluster may also be associated with a larger cluster, for example a common geographic location or common social setting.The PHA will be publishing cluster data on a weekly basis each Thursday until further notice.A cluster is currently defined as two or more laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID- among iniduals associated with a key setting, with illness onset dates within a  day period.Key settings which have seen clusters to date since May include workplaces, retail or hospitality premises, domestic gatherings, and sporting settings. COVID- transmission risk is highest in a household setting, and it is to be anticipated that a signicant number of linked cases within households will be identied by efficient contact tracing. It is for this reason that household-linked cases are not reported as clusters.The PHA’s Contact Tracing Servicecontinues to engage successfully with the vast majority of identied contacts and provide appropriate advice to help prevent any onward spread.Over the week up to pm on th August , the number of positive tests reported to the CTS was  – the number of positive cases requiring contact tracing was . There were  positive cases that completed contact tracing, and  contacts identied. There were  contacts successfully contacted and advised. [see Notes to Editors for further explanation of these figures]Since July, the average number of close contacts linked to cases has more than doubled. The rise may be attributed to the gradual easing of lockdown measures, but may also be explained by relaxing of attitudes to social distancing.Dr Gerry Waldron, Head of Health Protection at the PHA, said: “Cases are occurring in communities across Northern Ireland. This is an important reminder that we must not become complacent – coronavirus remains in circulation, so each of us has a responsibility to take steps to help keep ourselves and those around us safe.“Maintain social distancing, wash your hands regularly, and get testedyou display any symptoms of coronavirus. You can also download the StopCOVID NI contact tracing app.“This disease has the potential to make its presence felt in any community, as we have seen with clusters appearing across a number of council districts.“Everyone should act on the basis that it might potentially be in your neighbourhood right now, rather than waiting for it to emerge in your local area or for rumours to circulate before taking steps to help protect yourself and others. That’s why following the public health advice remains vitally important. You can spread the virus evenyou dont have symptoms, so taking these steps and exercising good hygiene practices will help prevent cases and reduce the number of clusters.Our analysis of clusters to date has shown that they have been associated with both workplaces and in the community, such as domestic gatherings and in hospitality and sporting settings.“Clusters are managed through the contact tracing programme, and where we need to advise or inform the public of any increased risk to public health we will do so in a timely manner.Dr Waldron added: “Speculation around current clusters of COVID- across Northern Ireland is not helpful.“We will not be commenting on inidual cases of COVID- or going into the detail of every incident that emerges, as this could lead to people being identied, create stigma and focus attention on iniduals, families or groups, and therefore deter others with symptoms coming forward to be tested.”Everyone with symptoms of coronavirus can book a free test. If anyone is concerned that they are experiencing any of the symptoms of coronavirus, they must self-isolate and arrange a test as soon as possible. For further information on the virus, its symptoms and how to book a test, visit www.pha.site coronavirusWe must be aware that COVID- is still a threat and we need everyone to play their part in helping to stop the virus spreading.If you receive a positive test result you will be contacted by the PHA’s Contact Tracing Service from .Members of the public are also encouraged to download the StopCOVID NI contact tracing app on Android or Apple, which complements the work of the Contact Tracing Service.

I am conscious that for GCSEs, unlike at A-level, we do not have system level prior performance data for this group of young people.The standardisation system used by CCEA dfers for A-levels and GCSEs. The A-level model took into account pupils# previous exam results, while the GCSE model used the past perfomance of GCSE classes in the schools the pupils attended.How A-level results were calculated has come under fierce criticism after it emerged that more than a third of grades issued last week were lower than those predicted by teachers.Read More Northern Ireland exams chaos heads for the courts as MLAs face recall from summer breakThe majority of Stormont parties have backed a move to recall the Assembly to debate the controversy, with many politicians, teachers and students calling on Peter Weir to use teacher assessments to determine A-level and AS level grades.Sinn Fein MLA Karen Mullan said the professional judgement of teachers should be respected and implemented.Read More Students plan protest over Northern Ireland A-Level exams debacle“The sensible approach being taken on GCSEs should be extended to A-Levels results, she said. “The Education Minister should scrap the flawed standardisation process and restoring student grades based on teachers’ predictions.SDLP education spokesperson Daniel McCrossan welcomed the move in regards to GCSEs, but said many A-level students feel their futures have been stolen from them and had been awarded grades that do not accurately reflect their ability or work ethic.“We have successfully recalled the Assembly this week to hold the Minister for Education to account and we will not be giving up until we secure a just solution for our A-level students, he added.“The Education Minister now needs to urgently change course to meet the needs of our students. He must scrap the flawed standardisation process and trust the judgement of our teachers. His move today has shown that it can be done and it must be done.”The chair of Stormont#s Education Committee, Alliance MLA Chris Lyttle, said Peter Weir should implement the triple-lock approach for A-level students - meaning pupils would receive whichever is highest of their AS-Level, teacher-assessed or CCEA calculated grade.“With each day that passes, those A-Level students with incorrect grades have been caused more distress, with university places at risk. It is a distress the minister is effectively choosing to ignore, while the appeals process cannot deal with this matter in the time available, he added.“The minister must act decisively and detail how he will implement the triple lock proposal without further delay, so we can ensure our young people get the grades they deserve.”When questioned as to why the new system announced for GCSEs cannot be applied to A-levels, Mr Weir said there is effectively an internal market for GCSEs in Northern Ireland, while more A-levels are set by outside bodies where in the UK, so there is a need to ensure there is comparability with the rest of the UK market.“We’ve got to ensure that whatever is happening in the wider context, particularly between ourselves, England and Wales, have a level of compatibility between each other, or we’re going to be advantaging some pupils at the expense of disadvantaging others, he told the BBC.“Clearly,a national decision was taken, I would want to make sure that our pupils are not disadvantaged and therefore I think that would lead inevitably to a level of change and I think that would also result in terms of the issue of comparability between those students who are doing English board examinations and Northern Ireland board examinations.So there’s got to be a very close link between what we do in Northern Ireland and what happens particularly at an English level.Belfast Related ContentEducationCarrick mum#s anger over impact of NI exams uncertainty on childrenThe chaos of the exam results has been twice as stressful for Carrickfergus mum-of-four Gillian Brownnutt .Education PremiumJamie HarkinOpinionFarcical exercise in statistics has put our futures at stakeDid Education Minister Peter Weir and Justin Edwards, who heads up the Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment , study their model like I studied the A-level syllabus, often into the small hours every single evening EducationA-Level results: Devastated NI pupils look to appeal results decision Puplis and parents have demanded action after A-Level results left many students in limbo yesterday.EducationNorthern Ireland GCSEs students to be awarded grades predicted by teachersGSCE students in Northern Ireland are to be awarded the grades predicted by their teachers, Stormont’s Education Minister has announced..\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland fd .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fabe-a-dfd-b-affd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland fd .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fabe-a-dfd-b-affd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland fd .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fabe-a-dfd-b-affd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland fd .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fabe-a-dfd-b-affd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland fd .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fabe-a-dfd-b-affd_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  .\"GalleryEducation PremiumNorthern Ireland exams chaos heads for the courts as MLAs face recall from summer breakThe Education Minister is facing a High Court battle over the chaos being experienced by thousands of A-level students across Northern Ireland.

Now Foden plans to head to the same spot at Six Mile Water during the off-season and try his luck.Foden#s biggest catch was a lb catfish in Spain and Barry - a lelong Manchester United fan - said he would be happy to show the English U World Cup winner the best fishing spots along the Antrim river.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClosePhil Foden in action for City FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappPhil Foden in action for CityFoden may be heading here a bit sooner than he#d hoped, after City#s Champions League dreams were ended by Lyon in Saturday night#s quarter-final.It finally brought their season to an end, with the players now free to enjoy some downtime before the action resumes in September.And according to sports website The Athletic, Foden is planning to head to Antrim to fish the same spot where the record trout was caught.Meanwhile, Barry, who is a member of the Antrim District Angling Association, promised thatFoden does come to Six Mile Water, he will not wear his United shirt.It has to be me to show him about the river after my catch, Barry said.

He#s maybe heard that this was a rare catch.He can give me a shout because I#ll guide him along the river.A lot of people don#t like to boast about our river because it#ll bring more people to it but I think it#s a great thing because it brings people to Antrim and it#s some good news.The Six Mile would probably be the best brown trout river in the UK.I fish in the river four nights a week. I went fishing one night last week at eight o#clock to about half-three but I didn#t get one bite.Recalling his record catch, Barry explained that wild brown trout would generally reach lb in a letime but to catch an lb specimen was a pretty special moment.Barry, who is a barber, was night fishing at his regular spot on July , with friends Rory Whiteand Neilson Wilson , when he caught the trout at am.The specimen weighed lb and was  inches in , which is a rare size and weight for a fish of its kind in its natural habitat. After posing for a photograph, Barry released it back into the water.That#s unheard of and there was one caught  years ago by a fella on a dferent river system and he has it stuffed in his living room, Barry added.This is a resident brown trout that lives in the river. It has obviously gone to Lough Neagh at some stage and has gotten bigger.There was one caught in Antrim  years ago about lb and it was in the fishing shop my whole le.My scales were a bit dodgy too, so mine may have even been bigger than lb!

A body which represents the industry, Hospitality Ulster, has told the Executive that non-food or ‘wet pubs’ have been left ‘without any hope’. A financial package from the Executive is now ‘urgently needed’ to save many businesses employing dozens of people in Derry despite hotels, restaurants, and pubs serving food operating safely since July , says Hospitality Ulster Chief Executive Colin Neill. Pubs were set to reopen on August  but a decision has now been pushed back for a number of weeks. googletag.cmd.push However, further easing of the lockdown - including the reopening of pubs - depends on the rate at which the virus is spreading in the community. Mr Neill said the Executive needs to support pubs: “Although we have an indicative date of  September, that is an eternity away and there is no guarantee that this date will even be met. “I have pressed the case for non-food pubs to be open as soon as possible, andnot, then a bespoke financial package must be delivered immediately. “The consequences of no support will mean that many jobs will be at risk, on top of those who have already been made redundant. googletag.cmd.push “We now need to take a pragmatic approach and raised with the Executive Office Ministers, a number of ways in which we can get non-food pubs open in a safe way, just like the rest of the hospitality sector.” As preparations were made to come out of lockdown in May ideas were floated such as making use of Guildhall Square and outdoor spaces in the city centre, however, those plans for the most part have not come to fruition. Derry City and Strabane District Council said it continues to meet with representatives from ious government departments and key stakeholders to proactively bring forward a number of positive initiatives aimed at assisting with the ‘safe recovery and reopening’ of the city centre. SAFE SPACES A council spokesperson said stakeholders have looked at a number of new creative and innovative ways at providing more space and a safe environment that will enhance the city centre visitor experience. She continued: “Council is very supportive of Department for Infrastructure’s desire to put measures into place within the Walled City to reduce traffic and to improve conditions for pedestrians. “We believe that this will provide assurance to the public and will assist our businesses in planning for social distancing as part of their recovery plans.” They say work is ongoing to assist with this process and to also look at how such pilot schemes could possibly be extended to Strabane and other parts of the district over time. In terms of street trading and licensing, the council is looking at ways of resolving the challenges that exist and ensuring that government guidelines and health advice are being adhered to. A temporary Pavement Cafeacute Licencing scheme has been introduced to assist hospitality retail businesses and agreed to temporarily waiver all fees associated with granting a temporary licence for a period of six months. Although pavement cafes may not be suitable for all businesses or streets, it is believed that pavement cafes may help some hospitality retail premises during the recovery phase and assist with adhering to current social distancing guidelines when they reopen. The council is currently processing  pavement cafeacute licence applications. A spokesperson added: “The council will continue to work in partnership with the department in the coming weeks to engage with businesses and the public to ensure that whatever measures are put in place are reflective of the needs of all our local stakeholders.” The council added that any changes in relation to the pedestrianisation of streets would have to be agreed by the relevant government departments and key stakeholders and in consultation with the local businesses. NEW SCHEMES The Department for Infrastructure said the minister is committed to working towards reimagining and reshaping spaces as part of an ambitious Executive recovery plan. As part of this recovery phase, there is a need to provide additional temporary pedestrian space in urban centres to accommodate social distancing. The department is working to identy where measures to re-allocate road space may be appropriate to facilitate local footway widening and social distancing. A spokesperson commented: “The department has been working closely with Derry City and Strabane District Council to devise projects in order to adapt to a new way of living, driven in part by the ongoing Covid- emergency. “Together we have already initiated a project to provide widened and pop-up cycle lanes on the Foyle Riverside in the city centre. “The department is also a member of the City Centre Economic Stakeholder Group, which is chaired by Derry City  Strabane District Council, and is focused on co-ordinating the phased and safe recovery of Derry’s city centre. “The group is exploring schemes such as footway widening, timed traffic exclusions, temporary traffic management measures and streetspace repurposing. “Further details will be announced in due course.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Entering the school foyer you’re struck that John Hume sits alongside illustrious company in what must have been a golden age of thinkers and creators. A bust made in the Derry man’s honour rests between two gentlemen who excelled in their own fields in Seamus Heaney and Brian Friel.  Each of these men attended the former Bishop Street school around the same time and went on to become giants in their respective disciplines. googletag.cmd.push John Hume’s own journey at the college began in  . “He told his mother he was going to the College and she said, ‘no you’re not, we can’t afford that’, but he passed his Eleven Plus and got in,” current principal Finbar Madden said. Hume was part of the first generation to avail of opportunities through the introduction of the Eleven Plus. It allowed more young people to continue their post-primary education which may go some way to explaining why men like Hume, Friel and Heaney grasped the opportunity with both hands. There was obviously ‘huge talent and ability’, Mr Madden said, as Hume left the school with a scholarship to study at university. googletag.cmd.push He had ambitions of joining the priesthood at the leading Catholic Seminary in Ireland, St Patrick’s College, Maynooth. Hume didn’t complete his clerical studies but instead opted to serve his community in another way. He graduated from the National University of Ireland in  with a bachelor’s degree in French and history and went on to receive a master’s degree. Returning to Derry, Hume would became a teacher at St. Columb’s. Mr Madden said that career lasted from -. At the time, the history curriculum was limited in schools and Hume taught the subject in a broader sense, keen to instil his vision of Ireland’s place in Europe. As he departed, transitioning into a career in politics, some of the key developments in the civil rights movement were starting to unfold. That, however, wasn’t the end of his journey with the school and his legacy endures. The colleges former pupils association present an annual award - the Alumnus Illustrissimus Award - to a past-pupil who has achieved something of major signicance or has made a considerable contribution in his own field. In , the Most Reverend Dr Edward Daly received the inaugural award and the following year John Hume would be recognised for his contribution to politics and peace in Northern Ireland. Mr Madden said: “The school is able to boast of many exceptional students who went out and made their mark locally, nationally and internationally. “The award recognises achievement whatever the field may be sport, science politics, religion and so on.” A proud College boy, Hume maintained connections over the years and wouldfor prize giving ceremonies. “He presented a facsimile of his Nobel prize to the school,” Mr Madden pointed out next to the assembly hall, “and our politics A-level prize is the John Hume prize in government and politics.” “And for as long as he could, he would come every year to prize-giving, he usually turned up unannounced but we always expected him to come, until unfortunately he wasn’t able to. “He had a very, very clear sense of his connectedness with this school and he never lost that right throughout his le. “In a way that many others weren’t able to do, by his connectedness here, by his presence, he was making it clear that St. Columb’s College meant a huge amount to him. “He recognised what the college had helped him to become.” The school’s principal believes that pupils have looked up to Hume over the years and used him as a source of inspiration in their own studies. Mr Madden concluded: “I think Colum Eastwood said it last night, John Hume was Ireland’s Martin Luther King and we recognise that Martin Luther King had a dream and did all he could to achieve it. “I think John Hume did exactly the same thing here.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I once heard an U manager talking about needing an extra session per week to prepare for a big game. The fixture in question was a Feacuteile group game. For the love of God, people need to take a step back. If you have a team talented enough to reach a final, then go all out to win it. As a general rule, dont listen to the doting parents chirping over the wire about getting the perceived strongest team out. Most of the time, they only have their sons or daughters interest in mind and not the clubs overall health  years down the tracks. All underage leagues and group games should be treated accordingly, a chance to develop. In any  of players, there will be many dferent levels of skill and physique. Any club serious about underage, will have enough helpers with their teams to cater for it. Set them targets. Condition players to work on their weak sidethey have mastered a skill. Or better still, encourage them to improve the pace of its execution and challenge them to make better decisions when in possession. For players that are struggling with a skill, thats the dficult part. That is real coaching, requiring both patience and dedication, with very little instant satisfaction. The earlier in the players coaching journey, the easier it will be. Break down the skill into manageable chunks.

As well as his involvement with the GAA, Fr McGavigan told the congregation that Dan contributed greatly to parish and community le in Banagher. “Parish and community were central to his le,” he said. “He lobbied the council for a footpath from Feeny village to the chapel, ensuring access for the local primary school, and was an early member of Feeny Community Association. “Helping to establish the parish bingo, he was involved in the renovation of the parish hall and ably served for many years as a sacristan in this church.”  Dan’s most loyal commitment, though, was to his family and his we Anne. Fr McGavigan told mourners how the couple encountered each other long before they were married. “The story is told of how he, as a young boy, watched a christening pass his mother’s shop on the way to the chapel,” he said. “The baby was a certain Anne Conway, who was brought here to be christened. “He recalled how he wasn’t much interested in a baby at eight years old, but recounted how a neighbour remarked, ‘this could be the girl you marry’. “Years later, they met again at a dance in Aghabrack and they soon married and settled down to begin a family. So began the McGrellis dynasty. “Dan and Anne patiently, generously and faithfully raised their twelve children, instilling in them their own virtues of hard work, kindness, generosity, respect and good humour.” Fr McGavigan concluded by encouraging Dan’s many children, grandchildren and great grandchildren to be inspired by his le. “Dan was a powerhouse of prayer and work and an inspiration for all of the McGrellis family,” he said “To his children, grandchildren and great grandchildren be inspired today by the holy le and death of a good man, and see in his le the virtues you would like to see in your own. “If you do this, Dan will live on in you and future generations. Woven into your sadness, there is a deep gratitude to God for all that this man has been to us. “We are happy, because we know deep down that his le was complete and that he, in the end, was ready for God.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Aoibhine McFlynn, from Ballyronan, was chosen for the role of ‘Cassie’ in the film, which was produced in East Susseux, England and released in cinemas on July . The plot follows a reclusive writer who forms a relationship with a young London evacuee named Frank after adopting him during World War Two. Her mum, Edele, says rubbing shoulders with stars like Gemma Arterton and Sir Tom Courtenay, has left Aoibhine keen for more acting experience. “She enjoyed it. She says she wants to do more and that’s what she wants to get into. Hopefully, on the back of this, something  might pop up,” she told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “I don’t think people thought it was going to be such a big movie. Aoibhine got into it through Alison Campbell models, who put her in for it. Aoibhine with Sir Tom Courtenay. “They flew us over and set us up for four or five nights. The crew and all had been filming for about six weeks, so we were over on the second last week for her scene. “Her role is ‘Cassie’, an evacuee child. It’s a small role, but she features three or four times, so we’ll have to go to the cinema and see her.” Despite her new-found fame, mum Edele says the -year-old has remained grounded after initially filming the scenes almost two years ago. googletag.cmd.push “She’s actually a shy wee thing, a very modest wee girl. She wouldn’t tell anybody that she’s in anything,” she said. “We obviously had to get confirmation from school to let her go, so before she left, Mr Scullion at the Loup called her up in front of everyone and I think she nearly died! “She’s just taken it in her stride. She was a bit younger when we went and did it and it was amazing to see the whole set up and how it was all done.” Pictured with the films lead, Gemma Arterton. Aoibhine’s family are hoping to get together over the next few weeks to watch her on screen, but in the meantime, cinema goers may unknowingly find themselves sharing a room with a film star. “I’ll make them all aware, I’ll roar at the screen,” said Edele, who was planning on visiting the cinema at the weekend with Aoibhine and her husband, Shane. “We might be able to get it here streaming with the family next weekend,we don’t get to the cinema.” Edele says Aoibhine, who also features on a current Phoenix Gas television advertisement, didn’t have to abandon her Loughshore tone for the role. “They wanted the Northern Irish accent, so she didn’t have to change it or anything.” Summerland is in cinemas now and can also be streamed on Amazon Prime Video.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Conor Cahill, a native of Cloyne in the Rebel county, began his trip in Belfast and will make his way down Ireland’s west coast before ing along its eastern seaboard. The walk, which Conor has branded the ‘Camino d’Ireland’ is a huge personal undertaking, but his chosen charity, the Ethiopian Deaf Project , is the priority. “I’m walking anyway, sosomeone  can get the benefit of it then it’s a great story for me,” he told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “I do this because it pushes my body and resets a lot of my batteries. It’s just like hard training, the benefits are fantastic.” The EDP is a committee of voluntary fundraisers dedicated to supporting deaf children in Ethiopia gain access to formal education. They place a particular emphasis on assisting deaf children from poor rural families or those who are living isolated lives. Fundraising activities, in particular their child sponsorship program, have facilitated the development of a school that is transforming the lives of the children who attend. Miriam ORegan Miriam O’Regan, secretary and founding member of the EDP, said all donations, no matter how small, are helpful. googletag.cmd.push “The money is so hard to raise that we are extremely careful on how it is spent, we know where every cent goes,” she said. “We started my chance I suppose. Myself and my husband, Patrick have two children adopted from Ethiopia, one of whom is deaf. “We then heard of a Dublin priest, Fr. Stephen Monaghan who was trying to do something to help the deaf in Ambo. “We contacted him and said we’d like to help, maybe have a coffee morning or something, the rest is history. “We raised enough to buy land, then with matched funding from Misean Cara to build and extend the school, set up a sponsorship program to support the children and their families. “Now they come with their families once a month to learn sign language and in the next few years we are hoping to get one of the bigger organisations or group to help us establish a much needed boarding house.” Conor stayed in Dungiven while travelling through Derry. Conor feels the experience of being deaf can be a lonely one, but while staying in Dungiven, he was able to meet and talk to a deaf person from the town. “Caroline, my host, took me down to the GAA club and I started talking GAA with a few lads who were down there,” he said. “With social distancing, I was kind of sat in the corner and a deaf lad was brought over by a few of the lads. “I knew straight away he was deaf, so we were signing back and forward and it’s a lovely experience to have. “The other experience I had of that was in a place called Matera, in the south of Italy. I went into a restaurant last year and there were two people signing. “Eventually I went over and introduced myself and signed my name to them. We spent an hour and a half, between signing and texting and talking - communicating. “They told me that, over the three weeks they had travelled from Hamburg, I was the first person that had made any attempt to engage with them. “It’s a tough way to live. Three weeks on holidays and no one making any effort to communicate with them.”  Having already been to Derry City, Conor was keen to experience what rural County Derry had to offer when he was planning his trip. “I had been to Derry [City] before so I decided I didn’t want to go back through the city again, and I wanted to see rural Northern Ireland as much as I could,” he said. “It was great to come through the county and put places to the names, like Slaughtneil from the GAA side of it. “I loved the shared community spirit as that’s dferent in the north. The word ‘community’ is used a lot more. “I did have a chuckle, though, coming through some towns and seeing the signs from winning the  Tidy Towns’ award in . “When you walk Italy, you get an ancient sense of history. When you walk Ireland, our history is a more recent history.” Conor, along with the EDP, is running a ‘Guess the Steps’ competition. Entry is via donation and can be accessed on the EDP website - www.edp-ambo.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Phil Gordon, who works at Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry, says the ‘milk float’ stereotype is outdated and inaccurate. “There are fantastic cars to drive. People have an image that they’re like a milk float, but they’re very powerful cars and fantastic to drive,” he said. “I’ve been saving about pound, a year since I went electric.

People look at the price of the car and compare it to their petrol or diesel, but you have to factor in the fuel that you use,” he said. “You could easily spend pound, on diesel in three years and then there’s the service costs. The servicing of an electric car is very minimal. googletag.cmd.push “Most of your breaking is regenerative, so it recharges the batteries and brake pads have been known to last , miles on an electric car. “There isn’t as much wear on brakes or tyres, it doesn’t need serviced as much and when you go to sell it, the residual value of the car will be so much more than any combustion engine car. “People have to look at the bigger picture. I would love to see every car become electric.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

To date, that remains the only such cluster in the Causeway Coast and Glens area identied since contact tracing began on May , which is one of eleven identied across Northern Ireland. A Public Health Agencystatement revealed that Newry, Mourne and Down District Councilhad the highest number of identied clusters, while Mid and East Antrimis next highest. Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council,Ards and North Down Borough Council andArmagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council all have one identied cluster of over five people. googletag.cmd.push There have been no large clusters identied in the Derry City and Strabane or Mid Ulster districts, that cover the remainder of County Derry. However, the PHA have also said they have identied  smaller clusters, of less than five people, across Northern Ireland, and said they would continue to publish data each Thursday. A cluster is currently defined as two or more laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID- among iniduals associated with a key setting, with illness onset dates within a  day period. Key settings which have seen clusters to date since May include workplaces, retail or hospitality premises, domestic gatherings, and sporting settings.  googletag.cmd.push COVID- transmission risk is highest in a household setting, and it is to be anticipated that a signicant number of linked cases within households will be identied by efficient contact tracing. It is for this reason that household-linked cases are not reported as clusters. Since July, the averagenumber of close contacts linked to cases has more than doubled. The PHA say the rise may be attributed to the gradual easing of lockdown measures, but may also be explained by relaxing of attitudes to social distancing. Dr Gerry Waldron, Head of Health Protection at the PHA, said: “Cases are occurring in communities across Northern Ireland. This is an important reminder that we must not become complacent – coronavirus remains in circulation, so each of us has a responsibility to take steps to help keep ourselves and those around us safe. “Maintain social distancing, wash your hands regularly, and get testedyou display any symptoms of coronavirus. You can also download the StopCOVID NI contact tracing app. “This disease has the potential to make its presence felt in any community, as we have seen with clusters appearing across a number of council districts. “Everyone should act on the basis that it might potentially be in your neighbourhood right now, rather than waiting for it to emerge in your local area or for rumours to circulate before taking steps to help protect yourself and others. That’s why following the public health advice remains vitally important. You can spread the virus evenyou dont have symptoms, so taking these steps and exercising good hygiene practices will help prevent cases and reduce the number of clusters. Our analysis of clusters to date has shown that they have been associated with both workplaces and in the community, such as domestic gatherings and in hospitality and sporting settings. “Clusters are managed through the contact tracing programme, and where we need to advise or inform the public of any increased risk to public health we will do so in a timely manner. Dr Waldron added: “Speculation around current clusters of COVID- across Northern Ireland is not helpful. “We will not be commenting on inidual cases of COVID- or going into the detail of every incident that emerges, as this could lead to people being identied, create stigma and focus attention on iniduals, families or groups, and therefore deter others with symptoms coming forward to be tested.” Everyone with symptoms of coronavirus can book a free test. If anyone is concerned that they are experiencing any of the symptoms of coronavirus, they must self-isolate and arrange a test as soon as possible.

Stendhal Festival Presents: Unlocked, due to take place in Limavady in the last week of August, would have been the first ever series of socially distant outdoor music gigs in Northern Ireland. However, after receiving advice from the Chief Medical Officer and Chief Scientic Advisor, organisers have had no choice but to cancel the event. The advice said the festival was likely to cause a signicant risk to public health. A statement from the festivals Board of Directors said they were disappointed with the decision, but that it left them with no choice. googletag.cmd.push As a result of this advice from the CMO and CSA and due to the fact that the R rate is on the rise along with the number of localised clusters and confirmed cases across Northern Ireland, we have no alternative but to make the decision to cancel all of the proposed events, a spokesperson said. From the outset we said that while we would do everything within our power to get the events approved, we would always put public health first and act on guidance provided by Government. We are disappointed for all the acts on the bill who were hoping to get back on stage doing what they do best, for the people who supported us and believed in us by purchasing tickets, for those who were to be involved in the production element of the festival, the traders and the event staff who were hoping to secure some income from the events. googletag.cmd.push We would like to thank everyone who supported us on this quest to get festivals back on the agenda post lock-down, in particular our amazing team of volunteers and our local Councillors in Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council, who made a brave decision to support our endeavours in June. We await more detailed feedback on our Risk Assessment and Event Plan from the Department of Health in the hope that further clarity can be gained on the specic threats outdoor gatherings may pose to the public. These documents can still help be a factor in getting outdoor gigs back on the agenda,not for us now, for others in the arts and music industry going forward. The organisers said refunds for tickets would be available on the website by the end of the week.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

She is currently an Access student at the college en route to a new career.ldquoI heard about the Nuffield Foundation placements through the careers and lecturing team at the College, she explained.ldquoHaving read the requirements I thought I would make an application. It was during lockdown and I needed to remain mentally active.ldquoI had no idea how prestigious a placement it was prior to applying but now realise that it is a fabulous opportunity to upgrade the skills I gained at the College and increase my science and research skills.Ms Morgan has recently been on a four-week placement at Queenrsquos University Belfast working with its psychology team, researching dyscalculia, its effects, and possible intervention methods.Dyscalculia is a condition that can have a signicant impact on a personrsquos ability to understand maths in early years, and also to manage many le situations in adulthood, such as remembering your left and right, managing money and understanding budgets.ldquoI personally was affected by an inability to comprehend maths but my brilliant math tutor at the College, Patricia Rooney, was excellent in recognising inidual learning styles and the need to see maths in dferent ways, said Jackie. ldquoShe was instrumental in helping me pass my GCSE maths.Jackie is now hoping to study an undergraduate university course in the UK.She added: ldquoMy aspiration is to be able to work beyond retirement age, most probably in the public sector.ldquoI would like to thank my tutors who were fantastic in enabling me, a mature student, to learn new skills and to remember what I enjoyed about learning when I was a teenager.ldquoOverall, it was a great experience and one I would recommend to anyone wishing to re-engage in education, no matter what age you are..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th August 2020 Call.jpg","title":"Call for removal of republican banner  ","story":"A CALL to remove a banner in Drumaness opposing the extradition of alleged Omagh bomber Liam Campbell from the Republic of Ireland has been made by Slieve Croob councillor Alan Lewis.The Ulster Unionist councillor Alan Lewis said he was ldquoshocked but not surprised at the display of a banner opposing Campbellrsquos court-ordered extradition to Lithuania.Campbell, from Dundalk, was found by the High Court in Belfast to have been civilly liable for the Omagh car bombing carried out by the Real IRA in  which killed  people and two unborn babies.Talking about the ldquodevastating loss of le on August ,  years go, Cllr Lewis said: ldquoThe bomb was claimed by dissident republicans, the Real IRA, a group opposed to the peace process and supposedly opposed to Sinn Feacutein.

Parking restrictions will also be in place around the working areas.Ni Water says the investment is part of a programme of work to improve the existing sewers in Downpatrick, which will enhance the local sewerage infrastructure and reduce the risk of out of sewer flooding.It has confirmed that the essential work will involve repairing existing sewers and will mainly be undertaken using underground trenchless techniques, which will signicantly reduce the duration and disruption of the programme.But NI Water is warning that it will be necessary to undertake lsquoopen-digrsquo repairs at some locations due to the condition of the existing sewers.The organisation says that this particular aspect of the work is expected to last just one or two days with contractors also working in the evening, with every effort being made to minimise disruption.ldquoAppropriate traffic management and signage will be in place as the work progresses, said a NI Water spokeswoman.ldquoThe majority of the works will be undertaken during normal working hours. However, to reduce disruption to businesses and the public, some night-time works will be required at key locations.The work will take place at ious locations around the Downpatrick area, including some of the main streets within the town centre.NI Water has confirmed that the contractor working on the Downpatrick scheme mdash Geda Construction mdash will liaise with any affected businesses and properties.The spokeswoman added: ldquoWe appreciate that this work is disruptive and would like to thank the public in advance for their patience as we complete these essential improvement works.ldquoWe are all practising social distancing and our priority is to keep customers and colleagues safe. Please keep your distance and our workers will carry on with their essential work for you.South Down MLA Colin McGrath has met with NI Water officials ahead of work starting in Downpatrick, highlighting the need for communication with the community and the need to complete the scheme quickly.He said it was imperative that consideration was given to the works being done in the evening and at weekends to ensure that the level of public disruption was kept to as low a level as possible.ldquoI canrsquot think of a time in recent memory when Downpatrick has suffered road works after road works than has happened over the past few years, the MLA continued. ldquoIf the public is frustrated by this, it is entirely understandable and entirely justied.ldquoThe past few months have been incredibly worrying and stressful and people are finally able to step out of their homes. Shielding finally came to a end last week and the most vulnerable in our society are able to take those first tentative steps out of their homes again. It would have been altogether unacceptable for them to have to navigate this with works going on in their town.Mr McGrath said that having raised these issues with NI Water, the organisation is planning to use underground trenchless techniques, with contractors also working in the evening.He added: ldquoI will be in regular contact with the project manager to ensure that these works are completed as quickly as possible and due consideration given to the public.Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran has appealed to residents and the business community to remain patient as the work progresses.ldquoThis is an important scheme for Downpatrick and, as such, there will inevitably be disruption. NI Water intends to keep this to a minimum and it is important that this is the case, he continued.ldquoThis is a signicant investment in a much-needed scheme to not only upgrade the existing infrastructure, but also prevent so-called out-of-sewer flooding.

The original proposal was to end the scheme on August .Downpatrick councillors Gareth Sharvin mdash who initially proposed the free parking initiative ndash and Oonagh Hanlon have welcomed the extension of the free parking scheme.Cllr Sharvinrsquos suggestion was tabled at the June meeting of the local authorityrsquos Strategic, Policy and Resources when it was also agreed to review the

heartened by the usage, admitting that he did receive some feedback that there were some all-day parkers taking up vital spaces which would have had a negative impact on our local businesses.Agreement to extend the free parking initiative was accepted by the local authority on Monday following a proposal by Cllr Sharvin.ldquoThe near eight weeks of free car parking have been a great benefit to

not hesitate to call on the council to reconsider the car parking charges again,traders feel it is impacting on them signicantly during this continuing pandemic.Cllr Hanlon said while free parking had been extended, it was important that the public remembered that charges would be introduced shortly.However, she expressed disappointment at the lack of signs informing people that parking is free which confused some shoppers.Cllr Hanlon said a number drivers contacted her regarding the issuing of enforcement tickets whilst using the car parks for minor offences.She continued: ldquoThis, in my

We believed him, because of how radically he believed in those ideals and lived them.Mr McGrath said that through his work, Mr Hume offered ldquoyoung and old alike a vision of a future in which the gun would be removed from Irish politics, no matter how hard terrorists would and continue to resist this.Council chairperson Laura Devlin, praised Mr Hume as ldquoa man of peace and a ldquotrue hero who left a ldquolasting legacy as one of the highest profile politicians on the island of Ireland who was highly respected by all communities.Addressing the councilrsquos full virtual monthly meeting on Monday, she asked: ldquoHow do you put into words a fitting tribute to the contribution this man has made to the landscape of Ireland ldquoHow do you put into words a fitting tribute to this man who stood beside his community through Northern Irelandrsquos most terrying and dark days and walked proudly beside them as we ushered in together the days of peace Cllr Devlin added that from his example, she entered politics to ldquorepresent the needs of the community and added: ldquoIn all of his years, in all his roles, whether as an MLA, an MP, an MEP, a teacher, a family man, a friendhelliphis people came first.Respect was shown to Mr Hume and condolences to his family came from right across the political ide in the council chamber.Councillor Billy Walker, on behalf of the DUP council group, paid his respects to Mr Humersquos family and to the wider SDLP group.He said the death was a ldquosad loss to politics and paid tribute to Mr Humersquos determination to peace-making and ldquoremoving the gun out of politics in Northern Ireland, even sometimes when his own party did not support him during the Hume-Adams talks.He added: ldquoI also had the greatest admiration and respect of how the three then MEPs, John Hume, Ian Paisley and John Taylor, despite their political dferences, worked together to bring millions of European money into Northern Ireland for the benefit of us all.Alliance councillor Andrew McMurray said: ldquoIf it wasnrsquot without the hard work and sacrice of people like John Hume, we wouldnrsquot live in the Northern Ireland we do today.ldquoHis enormous contribution to the peace process, the end of violence and the determination to deliver a society built on peace and equality for everyone which be his lasting legacy along with a le well-lived.ldquoAs a young man growing up it was very obvious to me that John Hume was not only a man who stood for things but stood against things.Councillor Pete Byrne, leader of the SDLP council group, thanked his council colleagues for their kind words and said that the level of international tributes being made about Mr Hume reflected the ldquohigh level of esteem he was held in.ldquoItrsquos very hard to overstate the importance of John Hume to this island, he said. ldquoThrough the most dficult times, John fought for justice, equality and peace.ldquoHe taught me to have respect for dference and ersity and I think thatrsquos a message thatrsquos really important today.ldquoI want to thank John for delivering the institutions that we have today, they may not be perfect, but it brought peace to our streets and I want to thank John for leaving the blueprint for us all to build upon.SDLP councillor Dermot Curran called his former party leader as being ldquoa man of the people, for the people in his tribute.He said: ldquoAlong with the late Eddie McGrady, we worked with John a lot over the years, particularly when he was an MEP in Europe over fishing interests.ldquoI always remember he would tell me that he never sought to be a leader, only to help people. That stuck with me and it was something that I carried with me in my work.ldquoHis unstinting work for peace and what he did for us all cannot be understated.Due to Covid- restrictions, the Book of Condolence is now available online at https:www.newrymournedown.org chairpersons-book-of-condolences until Monday, August .All messages in the online book will be recorded by Newry, Mourne and Down Council and sent directly to Mr Humersquos family..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th August 2020 Saintfield.jpg","title":"Saintfield Horse Show success  ","story":"THIS yearrsquos Saintfield Horse Show on Saturday at Eugene Milliganrsquos ldquomagnicent venue in Castlewellan was hailed as one of the best shows and attracted a large number of entries mdash despite the impact of the coronavirus lockdown.Competitors came from all over the island and were delighted with the huge, flat rings and the well laid out ground.Show director Joan Cunningham said: ldquoThere was sun, fun and something for everyone who attended.

Most of Europe was basking in a heatwav and race morning arrived with temperatures already at  degrees.The race statistics were scary with , metres of climbing to be covered in only .km race distance. The lsquowallrsquo to the finish line had a maximum gradient of an eye-watering %..In the early stages Hanna found himself in the leading group of five with the cream of the Italian mountain racing scene.Included in the quality field were lsquovertical kilometrersquo specialist Henry Aymonod, Davide Magnini, one of the best uphill and sky runners in the world, former European mountain racing champion Martin Dematteis and Frenchman Sylvain Cachard.At around half distance Aymonod put in a surge and Hanna tried to follow with Dematteis being ped from the group.On to the upper slopes and Hanna was at the back of the group of three in fourth place. Then with less than m nearly vertical metres to go, he surged past Cachard to move into thirrd place and crossed the line in  minutes and  seconds. The winner, Aymonod, was home in : with Magnini second in :. Hannarsquos training regime, which included running upwards of  miles a week near his home on the Slieve Croob, gave him the strength to tackle back-to-back races.So after the lung-bursting steepness of Saturday, Sunday morning at :am brought the challenge of the Fletta Trail over close to half-marathon distance with climbing and descending back to the starting point in the village of Malonno.Francesco Puppi, the local Italian favourite and second in the World Long Distance Championships in Patagonia last November and world champion in , was in the race, fresh after not racing on Saturday.Seasoned Italian international Cesare Maestri was also in the field and he too had not raced the day before.As the race set off, these two were joined at the front by Francersquos Sylvain Cachard. Hanna settled into the next bunch, finding his climbing legs quickly and reached the summit in fourth place over half a minute clear of Martin Dematteis.One of the best climbers in the field, Hanna continues to hone his descending skills too and he held on for a long time on the descent in fourth before being caught by Dematteis.However, he achieved a brilliant fth place finish, taking the scalp of the Aymonod, the winner the day before, and many other top runners..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th August 2020 United.jpg","title":"United front in drive to restore Downe services  ","story":"HEALTH campaigners have welcomed the new united front in the campaign to restore key services to the Downe Hospital.Politicians, trade unions and the Down Community Health Committee worked alongside each other in lobbying the South Eastern Trust to restore emergency services at the Downpatrick hospital which is scheduled to happen on October .In a throwback to previous campaigns, all of the districtrsquos political parties and trade unions are now working alongside hospital campaigners to secure the future of the Downe and to argue for a range of new services.Campaigners say while they will be keeping a watching brief to ensure that the hospitalrsquos AE reopens in October as planned, they are also conscious of the ongoing province-wide review of urgent and emergency care.The review mdash commissioned by the Department of Health ndash aims to establish a new regional care model for Northern Ireland with any future proposals subject to public consultation.At a socially distanced meeting of the community health group in Killough last week, campaigners said that future proposals for the Downe arising out of the review could be crucial and potentially be the launchpad for a major new battleground.Confirmation of theof emergency services in October comes after it was revealed that over the past five years there has been a % increase in AE attendances at hospitals across Northern Ireland.Signicantly, Department of Health figures reveal that the biggest increase mdash .% mdash was at the Downe, with the number of patients increasing from , to ,.Health campaigners say the figure represents another ldquostrong, persuasive reason why they must continue to fight for a local emergency department which is valued and needed.They are delighted with the plannedof AE services, suggesting that with the fastest growing emergency department in Northern Ireland, there is a ldquostrong, logical statistical argument for not only retaining the service, but enhancing it.Health committee chairman Eamonn McGrady,revealed that analysis of increased attendances at emergency departments shows that the growth area is not Belfast, but at hospitals in the Southern , Northern , Westernand South Easternhealth trusts.He added: ldquoWe know we are not home until the Downersquos emergency department is reopened in October and and we will all be keeping a watching brief.Mrs Anne Trainor said she was ldquomore prepared than ever to work harder for the Downe as she will never be able to repay the debt of gratitude that she owes the hospital and its excellent staff for helping her ill husband.She also described a recent meeting with senior officials from the South Eastern Trust to discuss theof emergency services to the Downpatrick hospital as ldquorobust and revealed she was left perplexed when health minister Robin Swann said health officials would ldquoexplore the feasibility of reopening the department.ldquoThis particular service has been part of the Downe Hospital for years. Its need has been proven. There was no need to explore the feasibility of anything, she said.Mrs Trainor said the outcome of the meeting with health officials was that politicians, the community and trade unions stood together in demanding theof AE provision.She added: ldquoThis very much reminded me of the early days of the hospital campaign where everyone was saying the same thing. We won the case for the Downe but, from day one, administrators started to strip services from it.ldquoOver recent days what has given me the greatest heart has been the reaction of the politicians, the community and trade unions on the Downe Hospital issue.Mrs Trainor said she hopes that the unity will continue, insisting that when it comes to hospital services, the people of Downe are asking for nothing more than parity with those in other areas.ldquoThere has been substantial underfunding in this district for many years and we need parity with everyone  alongside rural proofing as, for those in authority, the centralisation of services is still very much alive. Their attitude is that everything stops in Belfast, she continued.ldquoBut everything does not have to be centralised in the city. The Downe is a beautul hospital but is being totally underused, yet it is one of the most modern of its kind. There is room to expand to increase service provision and we also want more consultants and staff alongside increased investment for student nurses.Mrs Trainor added: ldquoThere is total unity across the community on these issues and a strong defence of the Downe Hospital.ldquoThe hospital is the single biggest issue in our district. There is strength in our unity and togetherness.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityAs reported in the Penarth Times on Thursday, the town councilsaid the results show ldquowidespread backing for changes.The survey, which attracted  responses, showed  per cent of people thought there should be more outdoor space for pedestrians and businesses.Seventy-five per cent thought parking arrangements needed to change, and  per cent said the town needs to ldquoprepare for the future.Some traders, who oppose the changes ndash specically a one-way traffic system around the town and making Windsor Road and Lower Glebe Street a traffic free zone, have said the questions in the survey were too generalised and misleading.As a result of the survey, Penarth Town Council have proposed the following changes to the original ideas:Windsor Road from Arcot Street to the roundabout as a ldquoshared space for delivery vehicles and buses, with a mph speed limit.Lower Glebe Street as a ldquoshared space for delivery vehicles and disabled bays. Other vehicles should not use Lower Glebe Street as a through road.Bus stops will remain as they are. There were concerns over the impact of a bus stop on Hickman Road for traders, due to air pollution, noise pollution and congestion.A two-way system to remain on Stanwell Road from the library to the traffic lights, to allow easy access to the bus stop on Rectory Road and to prevent congestion and ldquorat running through Hickman Road and Arcot Street. A two-way system to also remain from Windsor Road to Railway Terrace.The number of parking bays has also changed. There will now be  extra bays proposed, with  of them on Plassey Street.The leader of the town council, Cllr Rhiannon Birch, explained the findings and what happens next.ldquoEven before Covid-, town centres across the country were facing issues, including the need to modernise infrastructure, and the impact of online shopping, she said. ldquoThe current pandemic has added to the scale of the challenge.ldquoThe consultation shows that a clear majority recognise the need for a degree of change in the town centre, both for it to survive in the present and to thrive in future.ldquoThe results call for the establishment of a greater degree of safe space and proposals which increase a degree of pedestrianisation whilst also increasing parking spaces.ldquoThe results show substantial agreement on these aims. Reflecting this widespread and clear response, Penarth Town Council calls on our partners in the Vale of Glamorgan Council to embrace the results and recommendations.ldquoSpecically, Penarth Town Council believes that creating a safer environment through the closure of Windsor Road to traffic for part of the day, between Arcot Street and the roundabout, including the Lower Glebe Street, would be the best way to ensure that people can feel confident about shopping safely. It would allow safe use of the space in front of shops, bars, cafes and restaurants.ldquoIt also lessens the need for one-way systems on pavements for pedestrians, which are perplexing for many and hard to implement. These proposals can be achieved in a way which also increases the amount of parking spaces available.The results will now be put to the Vales Planning Committee for consultation.For more information, visit https:www.penarthtowncouncil.gov.uk news survey-results Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
