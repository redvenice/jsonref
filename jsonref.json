But devolved Scotland adopted the plans.In July 2009, Labour vaunted a \u0027National Care Service\u0027 – which never emerged. It was to be funded by compulsory payments, which led the Tories to describe it as a \u0027death tax\u0027.But then-PM Gordon Brown nixed the plans by delaying them for another five years – in which Labour lost the next election.Earlier this month, Defence Secretary Penny Mordaunt admitted it was \u0027fair criticism\u0027 to say the Government had kept the public waiting too long for it to carry out its plans on social care.\u0027People have been waiting for promises on care for a long time,\u0027 she said.The comment came after a report by the Lords economic affairs committee, chaired by former Cabinet minister Lord Forsyth.It stated billions of pounds must be spent to restore quality and access in the social care system to an \u0027acceptable\u0027 standard.It suggested introducing free personal care so those with \u0027substantial and critical\u0027 needs can receive help with daily activities. Eventually, by 2025, all elderly people should receive free personal care.Under the Coalition government, a study commissioned led by economist Sir Andrew Dilnot called for a cap on the amount people have to pay for care, proposing that the state step in to pay the rest.

It was then shelved entirely.And Theresa May faced a nationwide backlash during the 2017 election after her plans for social care were branded a \u0027dementia tax\u0027.The party\u0027s manifesto unveiled unpopular proposals ensuring no one has to sell their home to pay for care, and a pledge to protect the final £100,000 of pensioners\u0027 assets.But the blueprint also revealed that the she planned to use decades of rising property values as a way of funding social care.The Manifesto bluntly stated that the elderly should not expect current and future taxpayers to pay for their care, adding: \u0027Many older people have built considerable property assets due to rising property prices.\u0027In addition, thousands of people who rely on home helps would have been asked to contribute towards the cost of their care for the first time.Jeremy Corbyn described the rise as a \u0027tax on dementia\u0027, saying it was unfair that cancer sufferers got free NHS care while those with dementia racked up huge bills.Sir Andrew Dilnot himself said the sky-high costs would leave pensioners \u0027helpless\u0027.  "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b206016c4877f34dc5bb97000d1205b83ecde5ed/0_57_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b715a61dbb3526d069ebb3534ebb4071","title":"zack seckler best photograph wild iceland from the air","story":"‘The pilot flew me around the volcanic coast in his tiny homemade plane – with the door open and me hanging out taking pictures’I shot this off the southern coast of Iceland, from a ultra-light aircraft, in the days before drones were ubiquitous. I love the stark nature of the Icelandic landscape and its contrasts. Deltas form from glacial meltwater running down towards the shoreline, picking up silt and different materials along the way to create these ribbon patterns. There’s all sorts of wildlife too – birds, beautiful wild horses, seals.So a few years ago after a lot of research, cross-referencing Google Earth with books and photography by others, I took a red eye from New York to Reykjavik. It was kind of funny to take a jumbo jet, have three hours upon landing to rent a car, check into my hotel and nap for 20 minutes and then turn around to meet a pilot and spend the day up in the air again in his homemade plane.You can do all the research you want for these projects, but nothing compares to actually seeing things in person. Being in an airplane above that landscape was really magical. Emotional, even.At first, when you’re flying around in a tiny plane, opening the door and hanging out to take pictures, it’s a little nerve-wracking. You see your life flash before your eyes. But I’ve become quite comfortable doing it and am able to be extremely focused.We were looking for the birds – they are Arctic tern, or sea swallows. They are small and quite difficult to spot. But we found this flock circling very fast. We were flying above them at a safe distance. I’ve come to realise animals are actually not that intimidated by planes. There have been countless times we have been flying over flamingos or buck, seals, turtles, 100 feet above them – which is really quite low – and they just could not have cared less. .I knew exactly which terrain I wanted to capture the tern flying over: that patterning of white pebbles against the black sand. We circled several times until finally they lined up as perfectly as I could have asked for and I was able to get several shots.I started working in this way in 2009. I had just finished a two-week commercial job in Botswana and had a couple of extra days to kick around the area. Somebody knew a bush pilot who had his own plane and said: “This guy wants something to do.” On a whim, I said, “Sure, that’d be fun.” I had seen the world from 30,000 feet up, but this was completely different – we were in this ultra light aircraft, flying low over a vast mud flat. When it rained, the water would pick up dirt and silt. And when it dried it created really interesting patterns, things I wouldn’t have been able to see if we’d been flying even just a couple of thousand feet higher. It was an incredible experience and set me off on this path.What attracts me to aerial photography is that point, at a certain elevation, where the line between abstraction and reality blurs. I never show the horizon because it’s an obvious giveaway, a point of reference. I want to create an image that works on multiple levels and at multiple distances. Some aerial photography looks like it could be a landscape, or something that you’re seeing under a microscope. I want you to know this was taken from the air.Animals are a good focal point. They’re recognisable, although I’m often showing them from a point of view people aren’t familiar with. Here, it’s a bit like a layer cake, you have the flat earth, the birds flying above it, and you’re above it all. I like playing with the way the lens flattens this multi-level, three-dimensional space – the sense of scale, the textures, the distance.The fact that I’m moving through the same space as the birds is one part of the story that the image doesn’t tell,. But it is important for me. Everything is at play, the movement of the ocean, the implied movement of the birds. There’s a connectedness between the living and the moving, to make a beautiful, harmonious image.Training: Photojournalism at the SI Newhouse School of Public Communications, Syracuse University.Influences: Jackson Pollock and Joan Miró.High point: “The shoot I did in South Africa in 2016: we covered about 2000 miles of ground, 45 hours of flying, in a week, never knowing where we would eat that day or sleep that night, landing on remote airstrips, following wildlife from tips from people we would meet along the way. It was a real adventure.”Low point: “Any time I’m not working.”Top tip: “Work your ass off. To be successful you have to put in a tremendous amount of hard work and not give up.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f43bf89989ed97632e6668367e124dc6620dc15/354_2678_3390_2034/master/3390.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca4e359b53c71711d30eda7487d057c6","title":"goodbye alan moore the king of comics bows out","story":"The pioneer of serious superheroes – who is retiring – has transformed the genre over 40 years of rebellious inventionOne of the most significant fiction writers in English is retiring, to the greatest fanfare of his singular and titanically influential career. Alan Moore has promised that the (extremely late) final issue of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen will be his last comic, and his final contribution to an art form he utterly transformed, sometimes to his chagrin. His work in the 1980s on Miracleman, a deconstruction of the superhero myth, inspired so many imitators to darken formerly kid-friendly heroes that Moore has apologised more than once for it.This dystopian graphic novel continues to be relevant even 30 years after it ended. With its warnings against fascism, white supremacy and the horrors of a police state, V for Vendetta follows one woman and a revolutionary anarchist on a campaign to challenge and change the world.\u0026nbspMoore\u0027s quintessential Superman story. Though it has not aged as well as some of his work, this comic is still one of the best Man of Steel stories ever written, and one of the most memorable comics in DC\u0027s canon.This introspective, stream-of-consciousness comic follows a successful ad man who begins to have a midlife crisis after realising the moral failings of his life and work.A love letter to the silver age of comics that nods to Buck Rogers and other classics of pulp fiction. Tom Strong embodies all of the ideals Moore holds for what a superhero should be.One of Moore\u0027s best known comic series, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is the ultimate in crossover works, drawing on characters from all across the literary world who are on a mission to save it.\u0026nbspMoore draws very rarely, instead he writes comics scripts, and at punishing length. Those can run to hundreds of pages, describing every layer of background and every tertiary character. The scripts themselves, occasionally enclosed in deluxe editions of his work, are as detailed as David Foster Wallace novels. Describing Batman’s home city to artist Brian Bolland in the script for The Killing Joke, Moore wrote: “The lower and seedier levels of Gotham are more inclined towards a territory somewhere between David Lynch and The Cabinet of Dr Caligari, all patches of rust and mould and hissing steam and damp, glistening alleyways. I imagine this strip as having an oppressively dark film noir feel to it, with a lot of unpleasantly tangible textures, such as you habitually render so delightfully, to give the whole thing a really intense feeling of palpable unease and craziness.” And Moore’s collaborators have always risen to his challenges, turning this overwriting into eye-popping set pieces.Before Moore, and the likes of Frank Miller, Dave Sim and the Hernandez brothers, the idea that serialised comics could amount to literature was laughable, and that adults could enjoy them without irony creepy. But Moore has had a preternatural grasp of the intricacies of a genre – superheroes – widely considered to be devoid of them.He asked troubling questions of superheroes, who had always appeared in stories that retroactively rewrote themselves and seemed to go on forever. Where was the end of these stories? Had we fully understood their beginnings? Was heroism even possible? The fates of silly costumed heroes became urgent in his hands: Krypto the Super-Dog, the shambling bog-monster Swamp Thing, a kid flying ace named Jetlad – each of these characters has moved me to tears.Moore can be tiresome – his digressions into the minutiae of Kabbalah in his Wonder Woman-style fantasy comic Promethea are insufferable – but he could also be delightful. Top 10, his affectionate send-up of cop shows, was a riot of sight gags, rendered by artists Gene Ha and Zander Cannon. Parody and melodrama keep close company in his work, especially in what is arguably his masterpiece: The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, created with the brilliant artist Kevin O’Neill. One character murders another with his magic penis at one point. It’s quite moving.This lurid streak can make Moore a tough sell. One Swamp Thing features an issue-length sex scene in which one participant is a plant yet the books’ central relationship hinges on the idea that Swamp Thing is the best man a woman could hope for, despite – or perhaps because of – his plant-ness.Moore as the saviour of superheroes is ironic in many ways. For one, his work suggests that they are at best feckless and at worst possibly fascis. For another, the process of working with DC Comics, which published his work during his two great fertile periods in the mid-80s and late 90s, so embittered him to the industry that he has often repudiated his own work on corporate superheroes, just as it acquired pop cultural success: video games, action figures, spin-offs. Recently asked about the real-world political influence of V for Vendetta, he was characteristically blunt: “From my position, if I have had one of my ideas stolen from me and turned into yet another cash-generator for some abhuman corporation, then if it has at least escaped into the wild sufficiently to be of some symbolic use to today’s protest movements, that makes me feel a lot better about having written it in the first place.”At the heart of this antipathy is DC’s hold on the legal rights to his co-creations Watchmen and V for Vendetta. Moore and Gibbons were promised that all rights would return to them when Watchmen went out of print, but it never did. Gibbons accidentally predicted what would happen in this arrangement back in 1986. “What would be horrendous, and DC could legally do it, would be to have Rorschach crossing over with Batman or something like that, but I’ve got enough faith in them that I don’t think they’d do that,” he told Neil Gaiman in a public interview preserved by the Comics Journal. Moore never got his rights back and DC has spent many years revisiting Watchmen with lucrative anniversary editions, prequels, a movie, the forthcoming TV series and indeed Watchmen II, called Doomsday Clock, a work in progress with script and art by a different creative team. This will merge the fictional world Gibbons and Moore created with the universe shared by Wonder Woman, Superman and Green Lantern. Moore’s efforts outside superheroics, such as From Hell, Lost Girls and A Small Killing, are often cited as proof of his literary worth. But his greatest contribution to English letters isn’t found in his additions to the growing canon of respectable graphic novels – a term Moore has said was invented to allow adults to “validate their continued love of Green Lantern or Spider-Man without appearing in some way emotionally subnormal”. It’s in his dazzling, quixotic overwriting, applied to trashy genre fiction with an ironic, but never cynical quality. This worked wonders on uncomplicated planet-tossers like Superman and Captain Marvel. And when he leaves behind the superhero hijinks, a lot of the fun leaves the writing along with them. Don’t get me wrong, the highbrow books are still brilliant they’re simply not as enjoyable as the pulpy stuff.Moore would be the first to tell you that seriousness isn’t always a virtue, but his was thoroughly transformative. And for many readers, myself among them, it was a great relief to be taken seriously as a reader of something supposedly sub-literate and stupid, to be treated with intelligence and care, and to be introduced to Moore’s rebellious brand of morality: his passionate feminism, his suspicion of authority and wealth, his love of normal people and veneration of togetherness, especially in the face of the hopelessness of the real world. His gifts for cruelty and horror inspired undistinguished competitors to enter the field, but his unexpected gentleness was what kept readers coming back to him."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/922db83363405cb92d382df4bf851f539d91dc13/0_91_1080_648/master/1080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fbdd1dcce15935a1af2f395d9e14734c","title":"tips links and suggestions what are you reading this week","story":"Your space to discuss the books you are reading and what you think of them Welcome to this week’s blogpost. Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.Good news from Kemster, who is “thoroughly enjoying” Frank Herbert’s Dune:World-building and story telling of the highest order and not the “hard” sci-fi tome I was expecting at all. It does require a certain level of concentration but that is a small price to pay (if any at all) for such a good book.It’s a rare book that moves me deeply, but even rarer than makes me cry, I’m ancient and male. Jokha Alharthi’s Celestial Bodies did just that. If the idea of a book about three sisters in practically medieval Oman in the 1970s sounds oppressive, it’s the opposite. Think of it more like an Ursula le Guin novel set in a dusty planet, it is that remote. The people are instantly recognisable, as they pursue love within a country in transition, one where slavery still exists. There is also a possible murder within the tale, a subtle strand amongst many. Plus an ideal beach read!I recently read and loved Emilia Pine’s Notes to Self, gobbled down in one sitting on a flight from London to Marseille. It made me realise that I very rarely read non-fiction these days, but I used to enjoy essay collections.Meanwhile, greenmill has just finished The Spy And The Traitor by Ben McIntyre:… having bought it on impulse during an airport departure lounge wait. Ripped through it in no time and even though I knew in advance how it turned out, the true story which is a jaw-dropping mix of narrowly avoided Armageddon, double dealing, death defying escapes and almost comical incompetence (mostly by the KGB) kept me turning the pages. Not my usual thing but thoroughly enjoyed it.Where the Sun Shines Out by Kevin Catalano has engrossed and challenged writeronthestorm:I’ve almost finished Where the Sun Shines Out by Kevin Catalano - this is one of the bleakest fiction books I’ve read for quite some time. Yet, it is strangely engrossing. The story centres on what happens to people involved with, or connected to, the abduction of two young boys. The immediate aftermath and also the years upon years that follow. It’s a heartbreaking and deeply uncomfortable read not for the faint of heart. This is challenging stuff!This Body’s Not Big Enough for Both Of Us by Edgar Cantero provides some good niche reading, according to pubbore:It’s a comedy thriller starring a private investigator who is actually two siblings in the same body, each controlling one hemisphere of the brain. I’m not sure if Cantero carries off the conceit entirely convincingly, but if you like gleefully tasteless violence and funny one-liners I can recommend it.Finally, Swelter has some tasty provocations from QD Leavis’ Fiction and the Reading Public:I’m enjoying it immensely. Leavis is a militant and unapologetic champion of the “highbrow”: ‘Those novels which have some pretensions to literary merit and can be criticised by serious standards (it is common even in literary circles to fling the epithet ‘highbrow’ at it).’In order to demonstrate the universality of the belief that, in the 1920s and 1930s, the most popular literature is invariably the worst, she quotes Arnold Bennett (Evening Standard July 19th, 1928):‘Nearly all bookish people are snobs, and especially the more enlightened among them. They are apt to assume that if a writer has immense circulation, if he is enjoyed by plain persons, and if he can fill several theatres at once, he cannot possibly be worth reading and merits only indifference and disdain.’Elsewhere she accuses Bennett’s literary column of being one of the forces, along with book-of-the-month clubs, that perpetuate and codify “middlebrow” literature.Nearly all bookish people are snobs? What kind of know-nothing would write that?If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

For many, it’s even worseCan you be lucky if you get something you deserve? I felt lucky last week as I read the letter informing me I’d been awarded personal independence payments (Pip). Like a couple of million other disabled people, for years I’d received Pip’s predecessor, disability living allowance, without any problems in order to pay for the extra costs of my disability – but it was recently reassessed in the name of “welfare reform”.It’s the oddest of things, “welfare reform”. You sit there, opposite a stranger, asked to detail the sort of intimacies you’d be reluctant to share with a lifelong friend. “Are there parts of your body you can’t reach to wash? Which ones?” “How do you put your bra on?” You wonder why exactly such lines of questioning are necessary, or how the tens of pages you filled out for hours beforehand weren’t enough, and then explain, as politely as you can, the extra painkillers it took in order to get dressed for this assessment this morning.The assessor tries – because she is polite and you are lucky she is kind – complimenting you on your nice home, even though you both know you’d like her to leave it as soon as possible. You also know that you are “lucky” that you were granted permission to be assessed at home you could just as easily have been forced to travel miles, exhausted, or sent in your wheelchair to a centre with steps and no ramp. You consider how exactly the employee of a private company is in a better place to judge your health needs than your own consultant who has provided evidence, and whether putting foundation on was a mistake in case you look “too well”.Throughout it all, there sits the elephant in the room: that this is all pointless. That by virtue of genetics, it is scientifically impossible that you have been cured since your last assessment. And yet you sit there, going through the motions, because non-disabled cabinet ministers told the rightwing media that people like you shouldn’t be “allowed to fester” on benefits.Pip is, of course, just one part of sweeping disability benefit “reform” in recent years, in which “reform” has become a euphemism for savage cuts. This week research by the Disability Benefits Consortium (DBC), a coalition of more than 80 UK disability organisations, showed changes to the social security system over the past 10 years have left disabled adults four times worse off financially than those without a disability. It has long been understood that disabled people have borne the brunt of austerity, but this is the first time a comprehensive study has laid it bare.The details of the report paint a picture of the government running a cruel game: the more health problems you have, the more you actually lose out – people with six or more disabilities are losing more than £2,100 each year on average, compared with someone with one disability, who loses £700 – while disabled children have been targeted too. Households with one disabled adult and one disabled child have had their support cut most, with average losses of more than £4,300 a year. This is a nation of distorted priorities, in which prospective prime ministers flex tax cuts for the healthy and wealthy, and the already poor and sick are pushed further into hardship.The DBC study details the way in which many disabled and chronically ill people put through “reforms” feel “highly stressed, distrusted, and constantly challenged”. One woman with multiple sclerosis told the researchers that she had had her Pip cut and was about to lose the Motability car she needed to get to work. The anguish brought on a severe MS relapse. She’s now lost all feeling in her left leg.I was “lucky”. Unlike some, I didn’t have to skip meals because my disability benefits had been removed. I wasn’t forced to go through a lengthy and exhausting appeal. I wasn’t, like the late Stephen Smith, forced to discharge myself from hospital in order to attend the tribunal to fight my case. But it is surely a sign of a broken system when disabled people relying on Britain’s safety net are grateful if it catches them without too much pain.In this way, “welfare reform” reinforces the narrative drilled into members of marginalised groups – that while for many the state is a vehicle to support them in times of need, for others it offers little more than abuse and disbelief.The DBC report offers conclusive proof of what disabled people have long known: benefit cuts are unjust, harmful, and widespread.

Fathers and same-sex partners want to be more involved and share parenting more equally – not just in the later stages of childhood, but right from the first second that their child is born.I firmly believe that mums and dads should be given the opportunity to do this and that’s why, back when I was shadow minister for women and equalities, I first set out to develop the shared parental leave policy we have today.This provides much greater choice over who cares for a new child in the first year and the flexibility for families to share the maternity leave period as they see fit. It has steadily begun to challenge and change societal attitudes towards who “should” stay at home and care for a baby.But all too often it is still mothers, not fathers, who shoulder the burden of childcare. So it is clear that we need to do more.The UK has some of the most generous maternity leave allowances in the world, but we only guarantee new dads and same-sex partners a fortnight off work – making it harder for them to bond with their child and care for their partner, and implying that it is the lot of the mother to be the primary caregiver.More often than not it is the mother who cuts her hours or opts to work flexibly the mother who decides not to go for promotion the mother who stays at home when the child is ill. Much of the gender pay gap can be traced back to the balance of childcare responsibilities, while the lack of women in senior positions is partly caused by the fact that mothers, much more than fathers, are too often expected to juggle careers with caring.This is not inevitable. Experience around the world shows that when fathers are primary caregivers in the first year, even for just a short period, they are more likely to be involved in childcare over the longer term.But we’re not sending fathers the correct message when our current leave allowances give women 26 times more leave than men.Evidence shows that for fathers to take more leave it needs to be dedicated leave for them, and it needs to be paid better. That’s why on Friday we will launch a consultation looking at how we can improve the current system – calling for views on whether paternity leave and pay should be increased or whether shared parental leave should be reformed.I believe that increasing paternity entitlements will not only give fathers more time to spend with their newborns, but will also be an important step towards equalising the roles of men and women both at home and in the workplace. It will help ensure from the outset that caring for children is a shared responsibility and means that employers will not be able to make assumptions about who will take on childcare responsibilities when a couple start a family.Our consultation will also address the current failing to provide specific support for parents who are already dealing with the unimaginable stress of their babies needing special neonatal care.When I visited Alder Hay children’s hospital earlier this year, I heard first-hand from parents whose babies had been born prematurely or suffered complications early in their young lives. They had more than enough on their plates without worrying about their jobs, but the fathers in particular were all too aware that their leave was ticking away, and that they would likely have to be back at work long before their partner and precious newborn came home.That’s not fair and it’s not right. So we will also be proposing a new neonatal leave and pay entitlement, for parents whose babies need to spend a prolonged period in neonatal care.Under our plans parents will be given a week of leave and pay for every week their child is in hospital, making our system fairer and more compassionate.These are issues close to my heart and I’m proud that Friday’s consultation – the next evolution of the shared parental leave policy that I started long ago – is one of my final acts as prime minister.• Theresa May is the prime minister of the UK"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/67ca43af20277eb9999b252cf238f4176f05874d/341_133_3311_1988/master/3311.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e254eeb5601813a02cadec0a31aaa66d","title":"love island fast fashion sustainable new outfit bikini","story":"The ITV show is fast fashion’s biggest advocate, but the planet can’t take any more £1 bikinisLike millions of viewers, I’m hopelessly addicted to Love Island in a way I never thought I would be.

UK consumers sent 300,000 tonnes of textiles to be burned or dumped in landfill in 2018.Without rapid reform, the fashion industry - of which fast fashion is the dominant player – could be responsible for\u0026nbspa quarter of the Earth’s carbon budget by 2050.Through omnipresent product placements and advertising, Love Island has turned into fast fashion’s biggest advocate. Every day, girls in the villa wear a new outfit, promoting the insidious idea that you cannot be seen in the same clothes twice. You can even shop for what the islanders wear in real time through the show’s app or via its partner I Saw It First, encouraging impulsive purchases. When Britons are already expected to buy 50m single-use outfits this summer, the show only adds fuel to the fire, or rather to the truckload of clothes that ends up in the landfill every second.The problem is our planet cannot take more £1 bikinis. When clothes are so cheap, they are usually made out of materials derived from plastic, such as polyester or nylon. These materials can take hundreds of years to decompose in a landfill, and release thousands of microfibres during each wash, which end up in our oceans.To keep costs down, the fast fashion industry has also been known for manufacturing in some of the lowest-wage countries, where labour and safety standards are particularly poor. Despite pledges for better working conditions in supply chains following the Rana Plaza collapse in Bangladesh in 2013, this model remains prevalent today.Love Island has an incredible platform and the potential to influence millions of people. I wish the show used it to be a force for good, starting with fashion. The good news is there are a number of opportunities to get on the sustainable fashion path.Reducing our consumption of virgin fibres by reusing garments is essential to tackle the throwaway culture fast fashion promotes. More and more influencers are embracing the slow fashion movement, turning to what’s already in their wardrobe rather than buying new. If Emma Watson and Livia Firth proudly re-wear outfits on the most coveted red carpets, surely islanders could do the same in the villa.Far from the stigma it was once associated with, thrifting and upcycling are also becoming fashion statements. With the comeback of crafting, doing new with old is no longer seen as an odd thing to do. Wearing clothes that have had a previous life is an opportunity to look fashionable with one-of-a-kind pieces while reducing the need for new resources. Rather than a hundredth kissing challenge, what about harnessing the creative potential of our islanders behind a sewing machine?After taxis and hotels, the sharing economy is on its way to disrupt the fashion industry. New business models have arisen in the past 10 years making it possible to rent, borrow or swap clothes. Their success in the market shows that clothes do not need to be brand new to feel new to consumers. When new is the only option, alternatives to fast fashion do exist. A number of ethical and sustainable fashion brands have emerged, shedding a new light on the importance of better materials and fair working conditions in the supply chain. Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, has subtly turned into a sustainable fashion champion. It only takes one wear from her to make the sales of brands such as Veja or Reformation skyrocket. Could you imagine what would happen if Love Island did the same?It’s no secret that brand partnerships generate significant revenue for reality TV. But the climate crisis we are facing is very real too, and we know for a fact that fashion plays a key role in it. So now may be a good time for Love Island to embrace its corporate social responsibility, and rethink its partnership strategy in the light of the emergency."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb7563f4ce81535c726a2f3fa54ceeb39ed39306/1768_0_2072_1244/master/2072.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=64d187e240f77ad582e161f95b2f5886","title":"the guardian view on ebola in the drc help needed and dialogue too","story":"Are we able to learn the right lessons when disaster strikes? Five years ago, a devastating outbreak of Ebola in west Africa claimed more than 11,000 lives, and sparked an international panic as it reached the US and Europe. The experience led to the vaccine and experimental treatments now being used in the Democratic Republic of Congo. But this outbreak has become the second most deadly despite efforts to combat it over the last year. More than 1,600 people in the north-east of the country have died. Now, with the virus flaring up again in places where it had been contained, reaching the major city of Goma on the border with Rwanda, and spreading over 500km, with cases identified in Uganda, the World Health Organization has declared it an emergency of international concern.This is a very different challenge from 2014’s. It is not only a public health but a humanitarian crisis, taking place in a conflict zone, with widespread malnutrition, a struggling health system, and deep suspicion hampering efforts to control the disease: this year has seen 174 attacks on health workers fighting the outbreak. The fear and distrust of outsiders has been compounded by Ebola’s high fatality rates. Vaccines cannot protect those who have already contracted the disease, and though people are more likely to survive with proper treatment, many delay because they do not trust those offering help: by the time they are finally seen, it is far harder to help them. Those around them may wrongly conclude that vaccines or health workers are the problem and not the cure. They see more international groups at work, and more deaths.The need for community understanding and engagement – made clear by the 2014 outbreak – is more critical than ever. That means dialogue, not instruction: “We need to listen with the ferocity with which we want to be heard,” says an emergency coordinator for Médecins Sans Frontières. With their most basic health needs unmet, a rapidly spreading measles outbreak, and ongoing problems with cholera, people may not see Ebola as a priority, particularly if their other concerns are not even acknowledged. Some experts believe that community leaders and local staff must take the lead in the response, and that supporting home care as an interim, if far from ideal, measure may be necessary.But if solutions must be implemented on the ground, they require proper support. WHO hopes that the designation of an emergency will push governments to respond. Its director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has warned that hundreds of millions of dollars are needed to fight this outbreak only half of the money pledged has been delivered. Jim Yong Kim, when president of the World Bank, said the west African outbreak could have been snuffed out in months with sufficient funding. But help only trickled in when western countries began to worry about the potential danger to their own citizens.The risk is that neighbours may close their borders – crippling the economy, increasing hostility and suspicion, and driving transmission chains further underground as people take unmonitored routes or mask their symptoms at crossings. In 2014, WHO’s advice against travel restrictions was ignored by governments and airlines. As the WHO chief said, the decision to call this an emergency should not be used to stigmatise or penalise the very people who most need help. The humanitarian case for backing the fight against Ebola is simple and undeniable. Mothers, fathers, siblings and children are dying, in communities that have already suffered so much. If that is not enough to compel greater action, perhaps self-interest will help. One lesson from the 2014 outbreak was that real international commitment can bring the disease under control. Another was that without such efforts it poses a far broader risk."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d011b9ba4b7dcd235cf95b4a48e98fb1272157de/0_88_1300_780/master/1300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=30c23d29cf5ead749878286378b79b80","title":"the impact is tremendous readers on wildflower verges","story":"Readers share how wildflowers are bringing colour and life to previously sterile green spacesCatastrophic news for insect life has inspired communities and councils around the UK to take action, generating splashes of summer colour which hope to have a lasting impact.After reporting a campaign by the conservation charity Plantlife to encourage the growth and planting of flowers on UK roadside verges, we asked you to share stories from where you are.Below, readers share some of their local successes, including thoughts about how leaving nature to run its course by standing back rather than taking action can help – and explain how they have been getting involved in community projects big and small.“Hengrove Way is a 1960s dual carriageway in the south of Bristol. The wide central verge was originally reserved for a tram system but was planted a few years ago with an avenue of purple beech trees. The meadow here is sown annually by the Bristol city council parks. Budgets are tight and so they try and make a little spread a long way – in this case there are over 300 metres of flowers: as a resident they give me much enjoyment.” Richard, Bristol“Three neighbouring families with five children grouped together to care for three unloved grass verges adjacent to our homes in Flackwell Heath, Buckinghamshire. We planted yellow rattle to compete with the grass annuals to provide colour in year one, and perennials from year two onwards. We lovingly named our patch Flack Wild Heath.“I was mowing the verges myself each week anyway, and over a beer with our neighbours, we decided we should give it a go. We’ve had lots of interest and look forward to new friends in the village extending the Heath from next year. More of us should do the same it’s easy to sit back and wait for the council or someone else. Actually though, there’s way more pleasure in seeing our own patch develop. Very rewarding. In fact, it’s ace arriving home each day to see what’s popped up.” Marcus Firmin, Buckinghamshire“I planted this wildflower bank earlier this year on the edge of a path which overlooks a meadow outside my home. The idea is to develop areas that give colour to the meadow as well as attracting different types of wildlife, while trying just to manage small areas and keeping things as natural as possible.” David Warr, Jersey“It seems that council cuts have resulted in random scalping of verges and open spaces, with what appears to be no real plan, but they seem happy when community groups such as ours, with some skill, take on their sites. We’re sure we can save them money, improve the environment, spread beauty and pollen – there are so many advantages there seems no reason not to!” Diana Cusack, Totnes“Taken this week whilst on my way into the town centre. One of many small urban spaces that have been planted by the local council.” James, Newport“As a gardener, I know the work involved in preparing and maintaining verges. As long as vehicle sight lines are maintained where necessary, I feel this verge on the Kegworth bypass is a superb example of how the natural environment is so much more attractive than the sterile, known alternative. I am a gardener at a nearby university where the campus has initiated a bioersity scheme to encourage wildlife within its grounds. A number of areas are being left unmown poorer ground is being seeded with suitable wildflower mixes. The study will try to identify any change in the number of plants animals and insects within campus.” Dave Bicker, Loughborough“This verge on both sides of a wide dual carriageway and on the central reservation was planted by nature. Each year, Surrey county council mows it all flat when the flowers are in bloom, citing safety, although the extent is clearly excessive by common sense standards. This deprives stressed motorists of an uplifting and soothing experience on their journey, as well as disrupting or terminating the lives of countless amphibians, reptiles and invertebrates. Planting verges is good: but don’t forget nature did it first, and all we have to do is respect and wonder.” Jenny Desoutter, Dorking“These are not planted – they’re wild native plants! I monitor two of our local verges for the Yorkshire Dales national park’s Orton Special Verges project: we don’t plant verges and do not think we need to do it.“We need to educate people about what we already have as our native flora. It’s better to conserve the flora that will naturally grow in meadows and verges, for example by not mowing too soon (apart from a safety strip if needed for visibility). Late mowing, to let grassland plants set seed, and taking off the mowings to keep fertility low will allow native plants to regenerate as well as being cheaper for the councils than year round mowing or trying to seed verges with plants that want arable conditions.” Sue Millard, Cumbria“Burleys, Lewes district council and Wildflower Lewes have been planting up verges across Lewes District for three years. There are several different types of meadows, those that are more bioersity rich – which are perennial wildflowers – are sown once and then left to get on with it, year on year. The other meadows are the annual wildflower seeds chosen for our pollinators – these are much prettier and have to be sown yearly. These mini-meadows are scattered across roadside verges, recreation fields, housing estates and cemeteries. This year all the meadows were teeming with butterflies, bees, grasshopper and crickets. It’s amazing just how many insects benefit from such small areas.“We want to improve the bioersity of our district, educate and inspire others to do the same and hopefully they will get closer to nature by visiting more green spaces. We plant chalk-loving plug plants in some areas to create mini-downland areas in the hope that residents will get out more, reducing social isolation and improving health and wellbeing. We receive many compliments about how the wildflower verges have make them happy on their way to work and school – the wider impact a small patch of ground can have on people is tremendous and shouldn’t be underestimated.” Karen Rigby-Faux, Lewes"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/497914851446032e8553550ac2a503276e3c3dbe/533_0_1997_1200/master/1997.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9a1177b0792a94c6cbdafe2eb449b4f1","title":"litter ally terrifying is cats the creepiest film of the year","story":"The first look at the star-studded big screen take on Andrew Lloyd Webber’s musical is trending for all of the wrong reasons“This Christmas, you will believe.” With these words, Universal sent its first trailer for Cats out into the Twitterverse – and if a cagier strapline has appeared in modern movie marketing, nothing comes immediately to mind. Don’t believe it now? Fine, you have until Christmas. One the one hand, it sounds a bit like a threat. On the other, maybe it’s more of a plea. “We know it’s a lot to take in right now, but give it a few months: you’ll believe, we promise!”To be fair, they have reason to, er, pussyfoot in their approach: a film version of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s eternally uncool but commercially deathless musical has been something of an industry joke for decades, most famous, of course, as a symbolic punchline in John Guare’s Upper East Side bourgeoisie satire Six Degrees of Separation. Since then, the essential naffness of Cats – the earnestness of its reconstituted TS Eliot poetry, combined with the clumsiness of its human-feline costumes – has served as satirical fodder in everything from The Simpsons to The Critic to Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. It’s easy to be cynical about a Cats movie, then, in large part because a Cats movie seemed an absurd impossibility for so long. For all the popularity of its artifice-heavy stage treatment, there didn’t seem to be a workable way of filming a show entirely about cats, but conveyed entirely through human emotion, expression and movement.Who could have guessed that 2019 would be the year to take up this challenge twice over? Tomorrow, Disney’s much ballyhooed “live-action” remake of The Lion King hits cinemas, with its photo-real but computer-generated big cats improbably shaping their mouths around Elton John’s rousing score score. In terms of online buzz, however, its thunder has almost been stolen this week by Cats, finally brought to the screen by the Oscar-winning British director Tom Hooper. It won’t be in cinemas until December, but a calculated one-two punch – yesterday, a gushing behind-the-scenes featurette, today the official trailer in all its gaudy neon-lit glory – has held the internet rapt in semi-morbid fascination.At last, in two short but overwhelming minutes, the question of “how the hell do you make a movie of Cats” has been answered: by slathering an all-star cast that seems to have been assembled through a particularly manic game of Mad Libs (Judi Dench! Jennifer Hudson! Taylor Swift! Idris Elba! Jason DeRulo?) in a generous coat of much-vaunted “digital fur technology” and building extravagantly outsize sets on which they leap and bound and perform thoroughly humanoid choreography. They’re people! But they’re also cats! So the cast member James Corden muses in wonderment in the making-of blurb – he believes, but will we?If the reaction to the trailer so far is anything to go by, the jury is not so much out as agog: in these difficult, polarised times, the internet appears to have miraculously united in a chorus of “what the hell was that?” Returning to the expensive mode of bombast that saw him make a smash hit out of another slow-to-the-screen musical, Les Miserables, Hooper appears to have fashioned the shonkily home-sewn aesthetic of the stage show into a lurid, gleamingly synthetic fantasia of distorted Victorian streetscapes and polis-like milk bars.Yet even the Blade-Runner-meets-Cath-Kidston production design recedes into the background when set against the cats themselves, an ensemble of famous faces eerily superimposed onto lithe hybrid physiques: distinctly human facial features crowned by jaunty cat ears, dancing human limbs and pert derrières disconcertingly giving way to long, snaking tails. Vivid but not tactile, they’re at first glance neither fish nor fowl, let alone feline. Indeed, they look no more persuasively cat-like than the elaborately face-painted stars of the stage show, however much more state-of-the-art their unsettling furry disguise – which is enough to make you wonder whether old-school costuming and makeup wasn’t the way to go on screen after all. Cue your best Jeff Goldblum impression: “Scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn’t stop to think if they should.”It’s a sight disorienting enough to distract you from the trailer’s soundtrack, Hudson’s typically full-blooded rendition of the show’s signature ballad Memory. A pretty, wistful reflection on ageing and dilapidation, it sounds beamed in from another universe to the bright, restless, look-at-this-stuff showmanship of the trailer, eager as it is to flash as much of its elaborate novelty as possible in 140 seconds. That’s the rub of trailer editing, of course: whether the film itself will successfully find feeling in its uncanny-valley spectacle very much remains to be seen, though it’s off to a bewildering, even creepy, start.This weekend, we’ll learn whether mass audiences will take singing digital lions to their hearts, despite a chorus of critics’ complaints that the film’s visual effects are almost too evolved for purpose: its wild beasts look so realistic, so animalistic rather than man-like in their facial movement and body language, that they can’t speak, much less sing a song as sappily human as Can You Feel the Love Tonight?, without setting the film’s meticulously constructed universe off-kilter. Cats faces a different challenge: can its deliberately stylised unreality let us in? Amid the general floaty plotlessness of the material – it’s no Les Mis, put it that way – will audiences emotionally invest in these abject, unearthly creatures, either as cats or as extensions of ourselves? Either way, in the words of Hudson’s oddly lipsticked Grizabella, a new day has begun."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6f174f73f2d15c71c2d024f1eaa747b6dcb0c57c/1_0_1333_800/master/1333.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=146b8fd277e836f83104ac7c1e345e5c","title":"cats movie trailer internet reacts horror demented dream ballet","story":"First glimpse of Taylor Swift, Jennifer Hudson and other stars mutated into cat-sized cats – some wearing fur coats – sparks concern for state of civilisationThe first, furry glimpses of the upcoming live action Cats remake have left viewers distressed and unhappy after its feline creatures were described as “cursed” and nightmarish.The transmogrified CGI human-cat hybrids were unveiled on Thursday night, to widespread horror.On Twitter, many found the mutated dancing forms to be troubling, describing them as “cursed” and “like a Doctor Who episode from 2005”.Cats is the story of a tribe of cats, called the Jellicles, that face a series of difficult life-altering decisions one fateful night.The live-action remake is helmed by Tom Hooper, the Oscar-winning director of The King’s Speech, and stars Jennifer Hudson, Idris Elba, Rebel Wilson, Jason Derulo, Taylor Swift, Sir Ian McKellen and Dame Judi Dench.But many fans did not appreciate what had happened to these beloved actors – namely, that they had become cats.Others complained about the size of the cats (too small), asked why they had visible breasts, and pointed out they appeared to be wearing the fur of other cats.It had already been revealed in April that the cats in the remake of Cats would be the size of cats.But on Thursday, many asked why such well-known actors of stage and screen had been deformed in such way, rather than just wear costumes like in the original 1981 Andrew Lloyd Webber musical.In May, the live-action Sonic the Hedgehog movie was immediately redesigned, after widespread revulsion at the CGI appearance of Sonic in its first trailer.Director Jeff Fowler announced “changes” would be made due to the reaction to the three-minute clip. ’s Keith Stuart described the main character as “a cheap knock-off Sonic toy your child might win at a fairground stand and then be terrified of”.“The message is loud and clear... you aren’t happy with the design \u0026amp you want changes. It’s going to happen,” Fowler said.Similar controversy erupted over the first trailer for Pokemon: Detective Pikachu, which eventually opened to good reviews.The original musical debuted on the West End in 1981, composed by Andrew Lloyd Webber and based on a T.S Eliot’s collection of fantasy poems, Old Possum’s Book of Practical Cats.Cats is scheduled for release on 20 December."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38d26aa46f59114f854d69959bf8d93f8a88e5d8/0_0_4288_2573/master/4288.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c4d579cee5c25955c14f3e530e76877c","title":"raising the steaks how to have a fancy barbecue","story":"Tired of guests taking you for granted while you slave over a hot grill? Try your hand at marinated goat, deconstructed ratatouille or boozy poultryThere is a lot to be said for barbecues, including smell, taste, poignant memories of summers past, licensed overeating and the ubiquity of coleslaw, but I have noticed one thing: the chef never gets any credit. It is a bit of reverse sexism: men usually take over, in what we can call “manflipping” or “pyromannia”, so if you praise the chef, you are shoring up the patriarchy, even if a woman did all the marinating or, for once, the chef is actually a woman. It is mainly the sense that he or she does jack-all, beyond opening some packets. Which is fundamentally unfair, since knowing what is what on an open flame that you use twice a year is far more technically demanding than using an oven. Maybe you don’t care about credit. But if you do, here are a few suggestions.Try interesting cuts of meat. Classic barbecue fare tends towards the banal (chicken breasts) or at best workaday (the sausage). What you want is meat round a complicated bone, to give it some structure and slow-release flavour against the suddenness of the heat, and what you get is a load of steaks that have very few defences. I would never barbecue steaks again, having discovered that you can cook them in an air fryer, which locks in flavour without leeching out moisture. The best barbie cut, meanwhile, flash-fried, perfect unadorned, is the Barnsley chop. The nubbly central bone that gives it that butterfly shape makes it unusually juicy, while the fat turns to lamb crackling, which you almost never see in domestic life.Better still, try an unusual meat. In an unassuming yet peerless book, My Bombay Kitchen, Niloufer Ichaporia King has a recipe for shoulder of kid, in which you poach it first, marinate it for two hours in a marsala mix that includes chilli, cumin, hoisin, ginger and garlic, then stick it on coals for a quarter of an hour until it has a reddish crust that could charm a hyena out of a rage. You can use the poaching liquor for some rice on the side, and if anybody doesn’t congratulate you on this, it will be because they’re vegetarian and they hate you for it.Arguably, a sweet-fleshed piece of fish is even more of a showstopper, since it has a curious alchemy with the charcoal that underlines rather than obliterates its delicacy. It is fragile, though: unless it’s mackerel, big clumps can go through the bars, and the better it tastes, the more you resent the waste. Plus it is expensive: at the weekend I was so resistant to barbecuing a turbot – it was 24 quid it would have been like feeding pound coins into a grabber at the arcade – that Mr Z made it a cage out of coat hangers. You can only do one side this way you have to put a lid on the barbecue and let the other side cook by convection. Also, do not make the mistake of thinking the handles won’t be red hot, even when they are not red. Otherwise, it is a brilliant fish fix, and also works for a skate wing.Or else, cook regular meat in an unusual fashion. Get a can of cider, open it, put it on the grill. Get a chicken – you’ll need to poach it for 20 minutes beforehand if you don’t like to live life on the wild side – and wedge it, by its butt cavity, over the can. This works best on a barbecue that is already cooling a little, because the chicken will be here a while. Put the lid down cook for 40 minutes. Basically what happens is that the can heats up insanely and cooks the bird from the inside, while the outside cooks on the grill. The cider evaporates into the meat and keeps it moist (you can try it with lager, too), and the whole thing looks quite tickling, like a tiny gangster being taught a lesson.Mr Z does a few things for vegetarians, including chalcots, a cross between a spring onion and a leek, which you char, then wrap in newspaper. The scorched outer skin slips effortlessly off, leaving them beautifully silky inside. And deconstructed ratatouille: grill aubergine, courgette, tomato and garlic chop or mash them as they come off, then season very liberally in the bowl, as if you are making the French classic backwards, and much faster. If I’m honest, if someone asked what you were eating, you wouldn’t immediately say “ratatouille”. But you would say: “This is an innovative and delightful gesture towards the typically uncatered-to vegetarian in these circumstances.”If you think people praising you doesn’t actually matter alfresco then, of course, don’t bother with any of this and go ahead with your burgers. But I sometimes think the reason everyone eats so much off a grill is that you don’t savour things unless you can taste the effort. What I want from food is the taking of infinite pains."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f98f681568c2feb47b1548ddf2ca08c95249936d/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1e61cb0249634e1262a73c7fecc31cee","title":"aberdeen could be whisky birthplace researchers claim","story":"City document of 1505 may be first record of a still for making aquavite to drink rather than use in gunpowderAberdeen could have been the site of the first whisky still, according to researchers who have uncovered a reference from 1505 mentioning apparatus in the city for making aquavite or “water of life”, as it was known in Middle Scots.The discovery – locating the still 85 miles north of mediaeval abbey ruins where some believe the spirit was first produced – was made during a digitisation project involving the city’s municipal registers.The reference appears in inheritance documents belonging to Sir Andrew Gray, an Aberdeen chaplain. Among his “moveable possessions” listed is “ane stellatour for aquavite and rose water”.The Aberdeen university researchers say a previously known reference from 1494 concerning the king ordering aquavite from John Cor, a monk at Lindores Abbey near Newburgh, could have related to use of the spirit for the preparation of gunpowder rather than drink.Jackson Armstrong, the university’s deputy head of inity, history and philosophy, said: “Some other early references to aquavite refer to the spirit used in the preparation of gunpowder for the king. The Aberdeen still being for aquavite and rose water may suggest, by contrast, that it was for making whisky to drink.“This is the earliest record directly mentioning the apparatus for distilling aquavite, and that equipment was at the heart of renaissance Aberdeen.“This find places the development of whisky in the heart of this movement, an interesting counterpoint to the established story of early aquavite in Scotland within the court of King James IV.”Other experts insist, however, that Lindores was the birthplace of Scotland’s national drink. Blair Bowman, a whisky consultant, said: “It sounds like they are trying to trump Lindores, but the abbey has still got a good 11 years on them. It is exciting that something like this has been found. But they can’t steal the crown from Lindores. This is very close, but it is still 11 years off.”He said history was crucial to marketing Scotch across the world. “You can’t mess with heritage. It is such an important factor in Scotch whisky’s status in the world. There are so many distilleries that claim to be the oldest in Scotland. People in Scotch whisky marketing departments are always trying to find their angle of difference in a crowded market.”Drew McKenzie Smith, managing director of Lindores Abbey distillery, which was built near the site of the abbey, said the Aberdeen discovery was thrilling but that the abbey remained the spiritual home of the drink.He said: “Last year, during an archaeological dig, we uncovered a physical structure which is believed to be one of the earliest stills in existence, so it is wonderful to hear of records of distillation less than 85 miles up the coast in Aberdeen, a mere 11 years after John Cor was ordered by the king to create his aqua vitae.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd8beb97e2ba226ac18af700f1933604120b8ab4/22_164_8059_4837/master/8059.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=46289aa7b8ef0ff2bb6c175c12fe62c6","title":"plant based milk the choice for almost 25 of britons now","story":"Almost a quarter of Britons are consuming plant-based milk alternatives as the popularity of vegan and vegetarian diets continues to grow.Emma Clifford, associate director of UK food and drink at Mintel, said plant-based milk was entering the mainstream as alternative products became more readily available on supermarket shelves. “This is part of a much wider plant-based movement, driven by concerns around health, ethics and the environment.”In a significant shift in the UK, the number of vegans – those shunning all animal products including dairy and eggs – has risen. According to the Vegan Society, there were 600,000 vegans in Britain in 2018, up from 150,000 in 2014.Oatly’s UK general manager, Ishen Paran, said consumers were thinking carefully about the environmental impact of their purchases, with alternative milks increasingly appealing also to non vegans. “We’ve seen the introduction of the plastic bag charge, the phasing out of plastic straws and now the growing popularity of oat-based products. Last year we found that younger consumers were choosing to spend more during their grocery shopping on more sustainable options.”At a time when many dairy farmers are struggling to make a living, Mintel said the 16- to 24-year-old group were the most likely to agree with the statement that dairy farming had a negative impact on the environment. The falling usage among this group was a “potential concern for the industry”, Mintel said.The same was true of hot drinks, where only four in 10 added plant milk, compared with double that figure for traditional milk. The survey of 2,000 consumers claimed, thought, that a fifth of respondents thought “nut milks added more flavour to drinks than cow’s milk”.Clifford said she thought the dairy industry needed to “rekindle interest in dairy products”.

At Everton, where SportPesa is the main sponsor, its name is prominent all over Goodison Park, the club have been in Kenya for a pre-season tour, and they promote SportPesa’s “Kits for Africa” initiative, with a donation bin in the club store.Everton’s chief executive, Denise Barrett-Baxendale, wrote in the club’s annual report: “We value our developing relationship with SportPesa, who have demonstrated a strong alignment with our values.” A spokesperson for Everton, who describe themselves as “the people’s club”, said Barrett-Baxendale was referring to the sponsor’s support for the club’s extensive community work, which she herself pioneered in the deprived areas around Goodison Park.Founded in Nairobi as a partnership of wealthy, politically influential Kenyans with Bulgarian investors, SportPesa mined its huge fortune exploiting an online gambling craze in the east African country. Kenya’s interior minister, Fred Matiang’i, warned recently of rising addiction and suicides, adding that gambling will “destroy the moral fabric” without strengthened regulation.In the UK, while SportPesa has promoted its brand through the Everton sponsorship and partnerships with Arsenal, Southampton and Hull City, it makes use of the “white label” system, allied to a company, TGP Europe, registered offshore in the Isle of Man, a tax haven. This structure, permitted by the UK government, means SportPesa does not require a licence from the Gambling Commission, UK bets are paid to the Isle of Man, and no SportPesa company appears to pay UK corporation tax on those revenues, nor contribute to UK gambling welfare programmes.Campaign groups including Gambling with Lives have criticised the English football establishment for selling its appeal so enormously to gambling, with many Premier League and Football League clubs – and the EFL isions themselves – sponsored by betting companies, and concerns are escalating about problem gambling and the game’s “gamblification”.SportPesa grew rapidly in Kenya to dominate online gambling by zealously exploiting the mass arrival of mobile phone technology from 2014, and sponsors the country’s Premier League. With little regulation and no welfare or research similar to even the UK’s limited industry-funded framework, serious problem gambling appears to have become entrenched among Kenyan young people, who are gambling and losing far more than elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa.Matiang’i, finally proposing new regulation in May, said $2bn was gambled annually in Kenya, mostly by low earners, and that 500,000 young people defaulted on loans to fund gambling. Last week SportPesa was among a number of gambling companies in Kenya whose licences were suspended because of reported concerns about non-compliance with regulations, although SportPesa said it did comply and is continuing to operate because of a court order.Ivaylo Bozoukov, SportPesa’s director of global strategy, told the  that SportPesa’s expansion into the UK, which includes offices in Liverpool’s Liver building where Everton are also based, was funded by the profits made in Africa. Well-placed sources have told the investigative website Finance Uncovered that SportPesa made more than $1bn revenues last year in Kenya, but the company does not make its revenues or profits, in Africa or the UK, public. A spokesperson described that figure as “a very significant overstatement” and said: “As is common with private companies, we have made a commercial decision not to publish our revenues in order to protect our competitiveness.”SportPesa does have a UK-registered company, SportPesa Global Holdings, formed in March 2017, which does declare its shareholders and accounts, but the brand’s structure means that its UK gambling revenues do not appear to be received by that company.The holding company’s largest Bulgarian shareholder, Guerassim Nikolov, a casino owner, moved to Nairobi in 1999 from Sofia, where he operated a casino, and he founded SportPesa in 2014. Described as the group chief executive, Nikolov wholly denies claims made in Bulgarian media in 2006 that he left the country after being questioned by police in relation to an alleged criminal incident.Asked by the  about these claims, a SportPesa spokesperson said: “Mr Nikolov vehemently denies the allegations contained within the stories you have highlighted to us and we strongly urge you to treat any claims – most of which are made in personal blogs and by anonymous sources – with extreme scepticism.Nikolov and other Bulgarian investors are said to have provided the gambling and digital technology expertise in the partnership that founded SportPesa. The largest Kenyan shareholder is Asenath Wacera, whose late husband, Dickson Wathika, was the mayor of Nairobi and a long-term friend of the country’s president, Uhuru Kenyatta. Paul Wanderi Ndung’u, another major shareholder, is a prominent entrepreneur in Kenya, having invested early in mobile telecommunications, and he is a major financier and fundraiser for Kenyatta’s Jubilee party.Kenyatta’s spokesperson did not respond to an inquiry from the  about whether the lobbying from SportPesa or the gambling industry had an impact on his change of stance. SportPesa responded by saying: “Our growth is attributable to outstanding customer experience and we refute any suggestion that the company has sought advantage through political connections.”“SportPesa is powered by TGP Europe Ltd of … Douglas, Isle of Man,” it notes. “TGP Europe Ltd is licensed and regulated by the Gambling Commission of Great Britain for provision of services to the United Kingdom.”The SportPesa spokesperson said of this minimal contribution: “We share your concerns about this and raised the issue with TGP directly. As a result, they have now agreed to increase their annual contribution to GambleAware to £10,000.”SportPesa’s spokesperson said TGP is responsible for betting duty payable to HMRC on UK bets, but did not respond to a question about whether SportPesa pays UK corporation tax on its profits.Isle of Man-registered companies do not pay UK tax or publish financial accounts, so there is no available record of how much money TGP or SportPesa are making from their expanding UK gambling operations. The owners of TGP Holdings are listed as three Isle of Man trusts and one trust based in the British Virgin Islands, another tax haven. There is no public information about who the beneficiaries are of these trusts.TGP Europe did not respond at all to questions about the structure of its operation, the revenues from SportPesa and whether any UK corporation tax is paid.In its statement, SportPesa did not respond to questions about the company’s UK revenues or whether UK tax is paid on them. Its spokesperson said: “We are a socially responsible business that puts tremendous emphasis on grassroots sport and community development. We are fully compliant with all UK and international legal requirements and, as a company that operates in highly regulated markets, we take our responsibilities extremely seriously.”In response to the wider question of how renowned English football clubs decide to partner their names so wholeheartedly with gambling companies, particularly where brands are linked offshore and their finances are not publicly transparent, none of the clubs would explain their decision-making process. Hull City declined to comment, as did Southampton, whose three-year partnership with SportPesa ended last season.An Everton spokesperson said in a statement: “As with all our partnership agreements, a due diligence process was carried out both by the club and external advisers. Through this, we obtained the assurances we needed in order to proceed with a partnership with SportPesa.”A spokesperson for Arsenal, whose partnership with SportPesa finished in May, said: “We do not discuss the details of any of our commercial partnerships, but would point out that we conduct due diligence checks via third-party organisations where appropriate before entering into agreements.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa4b2c1be4e2aa5073f495f0040ddd4897b423fe/110_0_1580_948/master/1580.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=52f301e84ecc3feb158d06dabb353a58","title":"apollo women man walk on the moon","story":"Numerous unsung women, from computer engineers and mathematicians to secretaries and seamstresses, helped put a man on the moon. Here are the stories of some of those womenAll 12 people who walked on the moon were men. But among the 400,000 people who made it possible, there were numerous unsung women, from computer engineers and mathematicians to secretaries and seamstresses. Today, as America contemplates a return to the moon, there is resolve to ensure women aren’t in the background, but are instead the astronauts leading the way. Fifty years after Apollo, David Smith tells the stories of some of the women who helped put a man on the moon.A 21-year-old woman from Texas was responsible for making sure that Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins were prepared and in the right frame of mind to make history on the moon.Jamye Flowers, who had joined Nasa straight out of school, was Apollo 11’s crew secretary, a position that required a troubleshooting all-rounder willing to work long hours.According to the Smithsonian Institution’s Air \u0026amp Space magazine, “Coplin wrote their frequent travel orders, ran interference when outsiders wanted access, traveled with them to the Cape for launches, kept their wives informed, and even babysat their children. When changes were made to the flight checklist, she had enough technical knowledge to see that they were made correctly.”Flowers recalled visiting the launchpad at night when the Saturn V rocket was lit up. “We would try to make a good luck trip to get as close to the pad as we could, and just sit there and soak it all in and say a few little prayers for good flights and everything. That became a ritual for us to do that. I remember being out there that night on 11. It was exciting.”Margaret Hamilton grew up in the midwest and says it was her British father who taught her to ask “what if” and “why not”. She started her career at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1959 but then got wind that Nasa was aiming for the moon. “The ad made it sound so exciting, I decided to go find out more about it,” she recalled in a recent interview with the .Hamilton became the lead programmer on the groundbreaking Apollo guidance computer, which had less capacity than today’s mobile phones, and worked on every crewed mission (she names Apollo 8 and Apollo 11 as particular favorites). She led the team that developed the inflight software for the command and lunar modules and came up with the idea to call her discipline “software engineering”.She was also a woman in a man’s world. “I didn’t even think about it at the time, but the culture was different,” she said at the headquarters of Draper, a Boston engineering company that received the Apollo program’s first major contract. “When I first got there I was the only one in that project. If you look at photos of the engineers back then, you can hardly find a woman in there.“People say, ‘Well, there were women’. Yeah, but they weren’t doing technical jobs,” she said. Hamilton, who often brought her daughter, Lauren, to work with her in the evenings and on weekends, recalled that as time went on, the women’s liberation movement asserted itself. “There was a whole thing that started, even at MIT, and they wanted only women around to join. I was curious because one of the people worked for me, and so I remember going and they were saying all these horrible things that men did.“Then they wanted me to speak up at this huge conference at MIT, to talk to the women I said, ‘Well, what about the men?’ ‘Oh, we’re not inviting them, this is only for women.’ I said, ‘If it’s only for women I’m not going to be in favour of another kind of discrimination.’ Either everybody’s involved or they’re not, and I didn’t give my talk because I thought it had to do with fairness for all.”Hamilton set up her own software company and received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from Barack Obama in 2016. Now 82, she uses email but does not have any social media accounts. She is encouraged by women’s advances in the workplace, and in space, but warns that a backlash is under way.“There are many problems in the culture today that are worse than yesterday because women are more of a threat to some people,” she added. “They weren’t a threat then they were an oddity. Because of social media and everything there’s a lot of good stuff and a lot of bad stuff. If the good stuff wins over then there’s hope. So how do we fight that? How do we make that work?”Future visitors to the moon can look for “Crater Poppy”, named after number cruncher Frances “Poppy” Northcutt.She went to the University of Texas and studied maths because, she once said, it would help her get “a man’s job”. She joined TRW Systems, an aerospace contractor that worked with Nasa on the Apollo program and designed and built the descent engine for the lunar lander.Northcutt was soon promoted, becoming the first female engineer to be part of mission control at Nasa. She worked alongside male colleagues to plan the trajectory for Apollo 8 to return to Earth. She was also involved in Apollo 11 and the epic struggle to bring Apollo 13 home after it got into trouble.“I felt a lot of pressure because I was the only woman,” she told PBS. “I started looking around at these dudes that were working with me and I thought, ‘You know, I’m as smart as they are.’”At one point she discovered one of Nasa’s internal channel cameras was focused entirely on her. She added: “I was sort of the trophy. I was blonde, I was young, I was thin, I wore the ladies’ fashion clothes.”But Northcutt learned to live with the attention. “Well, of course I was being used,” she told PBS. “My feeling was, you can play this both ways. The mere fact that a lot of women found out for the first time that there was a woman in mission control was a very big deal.”After Nasa, Northcutt became an outspoken feminist and, as the first “women’s advocate” in Houston, helped combat sex discrimination in the fire department. She went on to be a criminal defense lawyer and, now 74, is currently the president of the Texas chapter of the National Organization for Women.She endured obscene phone calls, lewd comments in the elevator and having to leave the building where she worked in search of a female bathroom.But on 16 July 1969, JoAnn Morgan was the only woman in the launch firing room for the Apollo 11 liftoff.A self-described “precocious little kid”, Morgan began working for Nasa in 1958 while still in college. The Nasa website recounts: “Morgan heard later from colleagues that when she was hired to join the team, her immediate supervisor, Jim White, called everyone for a meeting – except her. As the room filled with men, White explained to the crew:“‘This is a young lady who wants to be an engineer. You’re to treat her like an engineer. But she’s not your buddy. You call her Ms Hardin. You’re not to be familiar.’“‘Well, can we ask her to make coffee?’ someone asked.“‘No,’ White said. ‘You don’t ask an engineer to make coffee.’”It was therefore little surprise that Morgan usually got the overnight shift ahead of launches, making way for a male colleague a few hours before the grand spectacle.But when it came to the big one, she got her big break as instrumentation controller. Among the familiar rows of white short-sleeved shirts and dark ties, she is the solitary woman visible inside Nasa’s firing room for the launch of Apollo 11.She told the Nasa website: “It was just meant to be for me to be in the launching business. I’ve got rocket fuel in my blood.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f3ff73086336535c6e036d8780decd843614aef/0_104_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9cc60e031e387a32b228d3ec75ca6309","title":"we just clicked why i set out to find a new group of friends online","story":"Can a friendship app, a digital neighbourhood noticeboard or Facebook really help me discover a new bestie?This year started with a bang. It burst into life with fireworks and kisses, and then came the sound of a spoon tapping on a wine glass. “Since we’re all together,” said my friend, “I wanted to say it’s been an honour knowing you while I’ve been in London.”Another leaving speech. I have heard many over the past few years, watching loved ones leave in search of job opportunities or housing security, or as a cure for homesickness. Later, as I lay in bed, I thought about my rate of friend attrition. How long until I found myself totally alone? Five years? Ten? My new year resolution was a no-brainer: I must try to make new friends.To help me on my journey, I contact Kate Leaver, author of The Friendship Cure, a book exploring modern friendship. She was inspired to write it by an article in the Atlantic, in which journalist Julie Beck argued that we shed friendships as we age because our spouses (to whom we are legally bound) and our family (to whom we are biologically bound) fill our worlds. When that happens, friendships are the first to go. “That article essentially frightened me into a year-long research binge so I could make the case for reviving our interest and our investment in friendship,” says Leaver.She says we have “organised our modern lives so that we’re more isolated than we think we are”. Social media makes us believe we are surrounded by people, and we may mistake likes and comments for intimacy. Offline, meanwhile, we have been brought up to believe it is unacceptable to speak to strangers, even as traditional public spaces – libraries, sports centres – are being closed down. In the few spaces that remain, she says: “We’re left with all these grown adults not knowing how to make new friends or get close to people.”This rings painfully true. I go to the gym two or three times a week, yet my visits are silent. I don’t enjoy the gym I do it so I don’t drop dead in 30 years. I pass through, barely making eye contact, let alone exchanging words. Can the internet help me make friends there? I decide to follow my gym on Instagram, commenting on its posts alongside other members. Mostly, these are health fanatics and their comments are just fire emojis (a symbol that means exciting or excellent) – so I’m not sure how I could build intimacy. I try to get involved anyway, heaping praise and asking questions. Later, at the gym, I approach another user, a man who looks as if he is in his late 20s, and ask if he was the person I saw on Instagram winning a fitness challenge. He was. We swap names and talk about where we live. If we have lots in common, it is not immediately apparent. Perhaps it is our millennial inability to carry on a conversation, or perhaps we are both tired after exercise, but the chat dwindles. We don’t speak when our paths cross again, but I do get a wave now and then.I also download a friend-making app – Bumble BFF. I am already using Bumble for dating and it is easy enough to toggle between the friends and romance platforms. I even use the same bio: “lefty journalist from London, climbing the ladder of success wrong by wrong”. I think it is charming, but other women do not. My rate of matches in the friend setting is significantly lower than in the romance section. I initiate a conversation with every match I receive, but notice that potential friendships are not tended with the same energy as possible romances. Perhaps Beck is right – in the choice between love and friendship, pals always lose.The swipe functionality of Bumble BFF also makes me uncomfortable. Like the romance portion, you swipe right to say you like the profile, left to say you don’t. And you can make this decision based on one picture, rather than needing to take in the whole profile before you give your verdict. You cannot move on to another profile until you have cast your judgment, so you are primed to decide within seconds in order to sate your curiousity about who is next. Inevitably, I find myself judging other women based on their looks – on what I think their clothes communicate about their personality, or what the set up of their shots says about their interests – and no doubt I am being judged similarly. It hurts to be reduced to this, and more so than it does when it is by the opposite sex.Using an app for friendship rather than romance also drives home how chatting online with strangers is not a patch on talking face to face, when communication comes through many mediums – tone, body language, expression – all processed in an instant. Even a few words tell you so much. Perhaps we put up with it in our love lives because the “prize” of romance is put on such a high pedestal. Using the same tools to search for a friend reveals how truly blunt they are. I struggle to create any intimacy, or puncture the polite veneer of the chat box (“How are you today?” “I am fine. How are you?”). It makes sense: I am ultimately a stranger, no matter how many laughs we share, or how much we agree on Brexit. We all keep our guard up for strangers. They could be anyone, and so could I. Each conversation is taking a punt. And we may be more likely to do it for love than friendship.In the end, I manage to have proper conversations with a couple of women. They seem very nice, but live a bit too far away to meet. I lose momentum and feel frustrated with the app. I say my goodbyes and delete it.However, there is another number that Dunbar says is important to friendships: 30. One of the biggest barriers to meaningful friendships is distance, with 30 minutes being the longest time we would spend travelling to meet up. “It doesn’t matter whether it’s on foot, by bicycle or car, 30 minutes’ travel time is the tipping point. It is not our observation, but something that sociologists have commented on.”With this in mind, I prioritise making friends near home. I download a community app, Nextdoor, which is regularly listed as one of the best apps through which to make friends. It effectively acts as a digital noticeboard for your local area, including adverts for evening classes and book clubs, which both seem like prime buddy-making opportunities. But nobody is idly chatting on Nextdoor. It is not obvious how you can build online relationships when replying to posts about parking permits or moths giving people a rash. However, on another community website, the hyper-local Harringay Online, I notice a post from my neighbour – to whom I have never spoken, despite living next to her for several years. When I see her in the local pub, I strike up a conversation about her post. Success! We get on. We have a drink and become Facebook friends.It may seem daft to view nurturing an acquaintanceship with someone who lives next to you as an accomplishment. But it has forced me to challenge my own strict belief that people – above anything else, even above my desire to chat – have a right to be left alone. It simply feels rude to “bother” people I need a suitable reason. Even using an app such as Bumble BFF, which is designed to introduce people, does not help. After all, just because someone uses the same app as me does not mean they want to speak to me.However, research suggests we have a warped impression of other people’s reluctance to talk to us. The average person consistently underestimates how much a stranger has enjoyed speaking to them. This has been termed “the liking gap”, although, it is worth noting that it applies to real-life interactions, not digital ones.Still, I wonder if my existing social media connections may be the most fruitful source of friends. They have already expressed an interest in me as an inidual, and I should have some sense of them as people and be confident that we have something in common. Indeed, I met one of my closest friends on my favourite platform, Twitter.I return to the chasm of hyperbole and scroll through the lists of people I follow and who follow me, looking out for those I regularly engage with. I send direct messages to a few. Every single person replies. Shared interests spring up easily and conversation comes naturally, as does an offer to catch up in person.I also take to Facebook searching for something similar, but as I barely use the platform, it instead acts as a time capsule for a past version of me. I joined Facebook in 2006 and used it actively (pointless statuses, pokes, and all), but from 2011 my interaction with it slowed. Now I check in periodically, but barely engage. With a large proportion of Facebook friends being people I met more than 10 years ago, I am not sure I still have anything in common with many of them. But perhaps Facebook’s supposed aim – to keep us connected with people we might otherwise lose contact with – will come in handy. Jeffrey Hall, a researcher from the University of Kansas, found that you need 80-100 hours to become friends with someone, or 200 hours to become close friends. But what if you have already racked up those hours? This is why one of the easiest ways to make friends is to reconnect with old ones. And there are plenty of old friends on Facebook.I contact Paul, my BFF from sixth-form college. He went to a different university and, although we tried to stay in touch, our paths erged over time. We chat briefly online, opting to meet for dinner right away. The dinner is like old times and there is no distance between us even though so much has changed. We discuss our respective new partners and what happened to the old ones, our new jobs and where we hope to go, as well as our old hobbies, which remain the same (writing and film-watching). The shared sense of humour and curiosity about the world makes for a joyful meal. We arrange to meet again, and remain in touch.In some ways, it is comforting to assume we lose touch with people because we grow apart. The alternative is that our own idleness or inattention slowly separates us from those we once connected with. Perhaps friendships are more elusive than we think, and so delicate they will die unless actively nurtured. The internet is not a silver bullet for loneliness – indeed, it may distort our natural behaviour and our understanding of what friendship is. But it can at least signpost where meaningful meetings may happen, and it can keep you in the loop of existing relationships.Leaver tells me about the twentysomethings she interviewed for her book. “One of them said she felt like the TV show Friends had lied to her because she grew up expecting to get this neat group of friends. I think loneliness in young people is partly explained by the gap between their expectations and the reality.”As for me, my search for new friends brings me back to old friends, to friendly faces I see each day and those I already know, but have not given enough attention to. I count up all the messages I regularly forget to reply to, and the old work colleagues I adored, but lost touch with. And I send an overdue text using three, magic words: “Fancy a catchup?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fcfe59549992952d27c14827702c2b324bac4ff1/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1004c36ecf49815729edcbe6d936ff83","title":"a sneaker peek behind the scenes at new balance","story":"Since 1982, New Balance has produced its flagship 990s at one of two US factories. We take a look at the craftsmanship that goes into each trainer at the site in MassachusettsFew trainers can claim a fanbase as erse as that of the New Balance 990 series. The first trainer to cost $100 when it was released in 1982, it was a performance running shoe that was eventually embraced for its nerdy dad look (the late Steve Jobs was a fan), while also acquiring street cred in Baltimore and DC. Meanwhile, the 990v4, which was released in 2016, popped up at fashion shows while being name checked by rappers such as Meek Mill and Lil Yachty.Each pair of 990v5s takes three hours to make they’re constructed from more than 30 different components and are handled by more than 30 workers. Tejada is the leader of the “closing” team, which puts the final touches on the shoe – hand-sewing the leather and suede in the heel. She’s been sewing at New Balance for 31 years, and first put needle to thread when she was a nine-year-old girl under the watchful eye of her mother, who was a seamstress in the Dominican Republic, where Tejada grew up.“I have sewn all my life. This is my pride,” she says. “When I’m sewing, I am happy – I am doing what I learned, with high quality. No run-off. Clean lines, everything where it needs to be.”Eric Vassall, the senior product manager at New Balance in charge of the 990 series, believes the craftsmanship and experience that workers such as Tejada bring to bear is part of what has made the shoe appeal to so many distinct markets.“I’ve been here 19 years and you see generation after generation after generation. So you have the mother who has been here that taught the daughter, who had taught the son,” he says.And at New Balance, the workers don’t just make the shoes – they are also integrated into the design process. This is only possible because, unlike most of its competitors, New Balance both manufactures and designs the bulk of its trainers in the same offices. This means that instead of emails going back and forth across different time zones, workers can give designers and engineers direct feedback in person.For Vassall, the fact that his team only works a few floors above the production line has been crucial. It allows them to make quick adjustments and, ultimately, produce a better product.“I would say for the latest version of the 990, the 990v5, we always would come downstairs and talk to the craftspeople and say: ‘Hey, what’s working, what’s not working?’”Jesse Plouffe, the product developer who worked on the 990v5, says workers like Tejada have made him better at his job.“They’re experts. I can’t tell them how to stitch the shoe. I have no idea how to stitch it. I know what I want to do, but they are experts and the value they add is incredible,” he says.And the atmosphere on the line embodies that spirit of collaboration. The workers move quickly – they each have just 22.5 seconds to complete their task – but still find moments to greet each other warmly.Luis Puello, a 51-year-old leather cutter, carefully runs his hands across a sheet of pig’s hide, looking for defects that he marks with a laser before a machine makes a cut.

Road deaths fell sharply during the previous decade but numbers have remained roughly static since 2010.Guidance on alcolocks, breathalyser-type devices that stop the vehicle operating if its driver has consumed more than the alcohol limit, will be part of a review of drink-driving trends and interventions by the Parliamentary Advisory Council for Transport Safety (Pacts). The devices are commonplace in Europe, particularly for operators of commercial and passenger vehicles, and National Express fitted them to their coach fleet some years ago.The transport secretary, Chris Grayling, said: “The UK has some of the safest roads in the world but we are not complacent and continue to look at how we can make them safer.”The road safety minister, Michael Ellis, said: “Far too many people are not wearing a seatbelt while traveling in a car, needlessly putting their lives at risk. Increasing penalties for people who disregard the simplest of way of protecting themselves is just one of a long list of actions this government is taking to help keep people safe on our roads.”An advisory panel will also be set up to explore how to boost road safety on rural roads, while campaigns will be set up to further educate children about road safety.The measures come in addition to a trailed possible ban on new drivers taking the wheel at night under a “graduated driver licensing” plan. Insurers welcomed the announcement and urged immediate action. The Association of British Insurers said its “potential to dramatically improve road safety in the UK is indisputable”, adding that there was overwhelming evidence for its effectiveness from places such as Canada, New Zealand and California."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5fb367835e8d406228201edefbb947cdca6e1642/0_81_3120_1872/master/3120.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e98e0bcf02fe3130f5e150739cc84a1","title":"sadiq khan calls for new powers to impose london rent controls","story":"Exclusive: Report sets out blueprint for overhaul of rental sector including devolved powersSadiq Khan will demand an overhaul of tenancy laws in a campaign for London rent controls that is set to be the cornerstone of his 2020 re-election campaign.The London mayor has said he intends to introduce a London private rent commission, with a board that would include current renters, to enforce measures to reduce rents and keep them at lower levels, but he currently lacks the legal power to do so.Khan’s demand is unlikely to be viewed sympathetically by the Conservative government, but the mayor will launch a report at City Hall on Friday setting out the new powers he would require and a blueprint for the overhaul of the rental sector.The report says the mayor is seeking devolved powers in order to:Polling by YouGov and City Hall suggests more than two-thirds of Londoners favour caps on the amount landlords can charge, similar to systems in Berlin and New York.In the German capital, which has recently announced a five-year rent freeze, rents are controlled both within and between tenancies. In New York City some apartments have their rents capped by a board.Khan said Scotland had recently introduced laws allowing councils to apply “rent pressure zones” where rents could rise by no more than inflation, but the rest of England and Wales had very weak protections.“It is high time for private renting in London to be transformed. Londoners need fundamental change that is long overdue,” Khan said. “Unlike other mayors around the world, I have no powers over the private rented sector. That’s why this landmark report sets out a detailed blueprint of what the government must do to overhaul tenancy laws, and what powers City Hall needs from them to bring rents down.”The report, authored by the Labour MP Karen Buck and the deputy mayor, James Murray, draws on proposals from a study by the New Economics Foundation (NEF).Miatta Fahnbulleh, NEF’s chief executive, said urgent and radical action was needed. She said: “Since 2010 average rents have risen three times as fast as average incomes. The scale of this affordability crisis means that action must be taken. We support the mayor’s call – drawn from NEF’s proposals – for additional powers to design and roll out rent controls. With a majority of Londoners now in favour of rent control, we urge the government to grant the powers needed to the mayor to bring rents down to affordable levels for London’s 2.4 million private renters.”Dan Wilson Craw, the director of the housing campaign group Generation Rent, said the current state of the rental market meant a rented property could rarely be a true home. “Londoners are being priced out of the neighbourhoods they grew up in, couples are delaying having kids and many tenants dare not complain about disrepair in case their landlord retaliates with a rent hike,” he said. “Sadiq Khan recognises the ambition and urgency needed to improve life for private renters. We hope the new prime minister recognises this too and acts quickly.”Labour’s 2017 manifesto included a pledge to “introduce controls on rent rises” and to consider giving the mayor of London additional powers, given the particular pressures in the capital.The Tory mayoral hopeful Shaun Bailey launched his own pledge on housing, proposing establishing a “taxpayer-owned housebuilder” controlled by City Hall that would operate like a private sector firm.Bailey claimed this would result in more affordable homes being built overall, saying the target “acts as a bar” to housebuilding and was rarely being met."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b2ecd31ff8e8ecf18105f5e4f7019387ad48b2a/0_0_1300_780/master/1300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d50d6265f3ef7463e0ef65cf65e77561","title":"treasury to unveil 2bn public sector pay rise but from existing budgets","story":"Teachers and police officers are among those to reportedly benefit but Treasury has made no new funds availablePublic sector workers including teachers and police officers are reportedly to be given a £2bn pay rise. The Treasury will unveil the biggest public sector pay rise for six years on Monday before Theresa May’s tenure as prime minister comes to an end, according to The Times.Two million workers will receive above-inflation salary increases, the paper said, amid concerns the private sector was pushing ahead on pay.The Treasury is expected to say that, barring some extra funding for schools, the money will have to come from existing budgets.The rises to be announced next week do not apply to other public sector staff, such as more junior civil servants and nurses, whose pay is dealt with separately, the newspaper added.“It is the highest nominal pay increase since the coalition. But these increases are still slower than pay rises that are happening on average in the private sector.“With the partial exception of schools, there seems to be no new money to fund these pay rises, meaning savings will have to be made elsewhere.”The announcement will come during May’s last days in office, with either Boris Johnson or Jeremy Hunt taking over the top job.During the leadership contest, Johnson refused to commit to a pay rise for public sector workers despite an apparent policy pledge by one of his key backers.Health secretary Matt Hancock had said the public sector would be “shown some love” if Johnson won, but the former foreign secretary made no spending pledge. “Of course he’s right, we are going to make sure that we properly fund our public services,” Johnson said.“It’s very important when you’re in charge of a great public service, whether it’s the police or transport, you’ve got to make sure – or local government – you’ve got to make sure that you understand their cares and their needs.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/782d26ebf909827cf7aa4e31020e8a551df24ee6/0_505_3633_2180/master/3633.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2e11df9ad0e67bc4f69da428938c9d0a","title":"we had 15 seconds of fuel left buzz aldrin on the nervy moon landing","story":"Astronaut’s newly released video interview describes final moments before ‘the Eagle’ landed on the moonTime was running out. The Apollo 11 lunar module was on its historic descent to the moon’s crater-pocked surface on 20 July 1969 when a fuel light blinked on. Still 100ft (30 metres) above the ground, it was not what the astronauts needed. The Eagle’s tank was nearly dry.In a new video interview about the momentous first landing on the moon, Buzz Aldrin, the mission’s lunar module pilot, describes how he held his tongue when the warning light appeared and Charlie Duke, Nasa’s capsule communicator, came on the line from Houston to inform Aldrin and Neil Armstrong they had only 60 seconds left to make it down.“OK. One hundred feet. Sixty seconds. We’d better ease down,” Aldrin recalls thinking. But he thought better of telling Armstrong to get a move on. Dressed in a jacket and “Destination Mars” T-shirt, his fingers adazzle with rings, Aldrin’s contorted face conveys how dicey the moment was. “But I don’t want to disturb Neil by saying: ‘Hurry up, hurry up!’” he says, leaning in and dropping his voice.Armstrong had enough on his mind. From an altitude of about 500 ft he had taken control of the lunar module and was carefully steering the craft down. Nobody knew how the module would handle and there in front of the descending craft loomed a large crater that would have spelled disaster for the men and the mission.The astronauts had already had to contend with program alarms going off in the module, which themselves could have forced the mission to abort. The glitch was eventually resolved, leading to a “go” from Houston, but as Aldrin concedes: “it tended to distract a little bit.”The Eagle dropped 90 ft over the next 30 seconds, leaving the crew a further half minute of fuel to navigate the final 10 ft to the lunar surface. In the interview recorded at the Science Museum in London in 2016, but released on Thursday for the first time, Aldrin says it was only at that late stage that he felt more confident about the landing. “I figured, ah, we got it made,” he recalls.It was a feat that succeeded by the finest of margins. “We touched down, and I think the estimate, not because somebody put a dipstick in the fuel to see how much was left, but it was calculations and information onboard, we probably had about 15 seconds of fuel left.”The museum is marking the 50th anniversary of the Apollo missions with a Summer of Space, featuring the Soyuz capsule from Tim Peake’s mission to the International Space Station and the original Apollo 10 command module simulator console. The latter will go on display alongside the Apollo 10 command module, “Charlie Brown”. The mission served as a dress rehearsal for the moon landing and the module holds the record for the fastest crewed vehicle in history, having reached a speed of 24,790 miles per hour as it fell back to Earth on 26 May 1969. Aldrin’s interview will appear on the Science Museum’s YouTube channel.For those of a certain age, the museum will celebrate the touchdown of Apollo 11 on Saturday with a special screening of The Clangers introduced by Sir Michael Palin."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc3150f36f6b82bfdbc60e368b88fd6360a4958b/0_0_3864_1326/master/3864.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=55dca042a256e29de944d58513ffadce 960w","title":"cricket world cup 10 fans countries review action","story":"Readers from around the world reflect on seven weeks of cricket and one astounding finalEngland’s run to the semi-finals, and indeed final, could not have been more quintessentially English. The team came into the tournament on a great run and hope was lifted to even greater heights with a few high-quality performances, only to be met with a crash back to traditional English cynicism when we almost inevitably lost to two tournament underdogs. From this point on though, they were exceptional, rising to the challenge of what essentially became four consecutive knockout games.What else can be said about the final? It was the best game of cricket I’ve witnessed and quite possibly the best of all time. The match had it all and England finally proved that they can stand up in those pressure moments in a knockout tournament. They had no small degree of luck and there was plenty of tension, but how else would you want to win your first Cricket World Cup?Let’s hope this group stays together for one more World Cup under the cool head of Eoin Morgan and a coach who will further develop this exciting brand of cricket. It would be easy to see this as the pinnacle, but how incredible would it be to push for an Australia-esque World Cup dynasty? Matt LeechWe delivered the greatest of World Cup finals. No other countries would have produced such a game. New Zealand always get stuck into games and regularly deliver some of the greatest cricketing spectacles. It’s such a shame we remain financially uninteresting for cricketing schedulers. Winning the World Cup might have changed that, but we are worthy runners-up.Jimmy Neesham was my player of the tournament. He plays hard and fearless, keeps going and has a mental toughness and mature outlook on life. He will have plenty of big moments in his career. Malcolm EddingtonIndia were like a critically acclaimed television show. After power-packed leading performances from neo-noir legend Rohit Sharma and the experimental yet highly engaging directorship from Jasprit Bumrah, most expected that pair, along with a strong supporting cast, to help India execute a stunning finale. But, despite bringing in the biggest viewing figures, the show was cancelled at the last moment by the executives at the World Cup – the notorious Kiwis.MS Dhoni was a fan favourite, but his personal style did not suit the overall tone of the crew. Rishabh Pant, a cult hero on the local soap opera, Indian Premier League, wasn’t ready for the biggest stage just yet. Surely, by the time the next big show comes around, he will be in the spotlight. Scriptwriter Virat Kohli was excellent but still did not meet his lofty standards and fluffed the ending. Cameos from Sir Ravindra Jadeja grabbed bits and pieces of the public imagination and an unexpected starring role during India’s final moments justified calls for his regular introduction to the set-up in the future. Abhijato SensarmaDespite the horrible thrashing in the semi-final, we performed above expectations. Six months ago I didn’t think we’d make it to the last four in some respects we got through because other sides failed to deliver.Mitchell Starc was our best performer. It was a shame he went AWOL in the last two matches. Alex Carey looked a class above most in his ball-striking and attitude. He was a real find. To play a great knock after being cleaned up by Jofra Archer really showed he has what it takes. The performances of Glenn Maxwell and Marcus Stoinis were really disappointing. The one innings where Maxwell looked really like to kick into gear was the one where Usman Khawaja ran him out horribly.The semi-final revealed all our weaknesses at once, which was a shame. Unfortunately our domestic one-day competition is now contained in a short period at the start of our season. It’s not enough for players to improve their skills in this format on the biggest international stage. Scott MeehanPakistan did well. Our performance would be viewed much more positively had we reached the semi-finals, but that’s how fine the margins are. The game against West Indies was very costly and some fans think the Sri Lanka washout was a missed opportunity. Although we have no one to blame but ourselves for not reaching the last four.After beating both the finalists in the group stage, it’s a shame we weren’t consistent enough elsewhere. We have a few special players coming through and they will surely help. Although fielding remains a problem. Awais AhmedWe were hot favourites to finish in the bottom two, yet finished sixth and may have qualified for the semis had we won our two washed-out matches. We have a bright talent in Avishka Fernando. In fact, we could have a fearsome batting unit in 2023. The bowling will be the real concern. We have to search hard for the next Malingas and Muralis. Malinga still has a role to play in four years’ time. We need his personality and experience in the team. And our former cricketers need to take part in building cricket from scratch. The current administration is useless. Akesh SamudithaIt took us four games to get a point on the board and we had to thank the English summer weather for that. South Africa paid the price for a terribly slow start, and highlights were few and far between. The AB De Villiers debate before the tournament obviously didn’t help.I’m hugely disappointed that we were so poor early on. The late wins against Sri Lanka and and Australia, were spoiled by the fact that there was so very little to play for. Wasting a successful 300+ run chase against Australia in a dead rubber hurts. Nils LouwAfter a great start to the tournament – beating South Africa and almost forcing a win against the Kiwis – the Tigers threatened to be the story of the World Cup, but it never quite happened. Instead the campaign ended in a whimper with damaging losses against both south Asian neighbours. The defeat to Pakistan was particularly disappointing given the historical context and the fact they were playing in front of a packed house at Lord’s. It was easily their worst performance of the tournament.In contrast, the stunning run chase against the Windies on the postage stamp-sized Taunton ground was the tournament highlight, reaching the target of 322 with such ease and with so many overs to spare. It gave fans genuine hope for a top-four finish. Had fine margins gone their way, a semi-final place would have been a reality.The team didn’t quite live up to its billing for the emotional Tiger fans. A feeling of the wheels coming off was compounded by the swift dismissal of coach Steve Rhodes long before England lifted the trophy.Giving player of the tournament to Kane Williamson was obviously a sympathy vote. Shakib Al Hasan was the true star of the World Cup. After spending a decade being the most underrated international cricketer in the most underrated international team, Shakib finally became a household name – for those households with Sky TV anyway. His consistency batting at No 3, often arriving at the crease early in the innings, and scoring at nearly a run a ball was staggering. Add to that tidy reliable off-spin and you have the complete package. Tawhid QureshiWe were terrible for most of it. Bowling Pakistan out for 105 in the first game got our hopes up, but there wasn’t enough thought into anything after that and we played out the tournament as a Chris Gayle testimonial tour. At least we beat a plucky Afghanistan side.The authorities must begin planning for the next World Cup immediately by investing in players who will be available solely for the longer version of the game. We have become champions of the T20 game, but the same players struggle in longer formats. T20 is hurting the quality of players in the longer versions. The problem remains that we have a very small pool of players. Glen DucreayIt was always going to be tough. Always. I’m disappointed we didn’t take any points but there were some competitive performances. Falling 11 runs short of beating India, and two balls from shocking Pakistan, were the best memories.Captain Mohammad Nabi had plenty to say before the tournament, but his inexperience showed in the field. I’ll be happy if we can progress tactically and learn from the experience of playing against the very best.

England have to win this Test if they are to stand any chance of regaining the Ashes but already, after 100 overs of attritional cricket and with rain likely to interrupt play across the second and third days, a draw looks the most likely result.England were yet again undone by a patient effort from Ellyse Perry, who finished unbeaten on 84 after a century partnership with Rachael Haynes for the fourth wicket, in an innings that has already sparked comparisons to her 213 not out on the last occasion of this kind, at North Sydney in 2017. Earlier in the day, Alyssa Healy and Meg Lanning had both hit maiden Test half-centuries.It would be hard to argue that England’s bowlers did not throw everything bar the kitchen sink at their opponents, in pursuit of the early match advantage. Katherine Brunt, returning to international duty having missed the third ODI with a swollen ankle, reached 75mph in an opening spell reminiscent of her golden years Sophie Ecclestone bravely bowled on through considerable pain after bruising her shoulder early in the morning session ing for a catch while Test debutant 21-year-old Kirstie Gordon, playing in her first competitive multi-day match, shouldered a load of 20 overs. In fact, all made breakthroughs but none of the three could quite make the decisive impact which the series situation demanded.“One hundred overs in the field is something we’re not used to, and we’ve stuck at it really well,” the England vice-captain, Anya Shrubsole, said. “It was attritional Test cricket, that’s for sure. We hung in there really well, and never let the run rate get away from us, but they batted with a lot of discipline and made it hard.”Australia – whose captain Lanning had insisted on the eve of the Test were on the hunt for a win but for whom a draw will suffice to retain the Ashes trophy – were clearly in no hurry. An aggressive declaration late in the evening session might have been on the cards had Perry and Haynes forced the pace: instead, resuming after tea on 203 for three, they plodded along merrily, content to add only 62 runs across the evening session.Indeed Haynes, who brought up a 145-ball half-century just before stumps, had earlier remained with her tally on 41 so long that the 2,000-strong Taunton crowd might well have suspected the electronic scoreboard had malfunctioned.First blood in the biennial Test had gone to Australia, who after winning the toss opted to bat, setting up a difficult day in the field for the hosts. Brunt provided a chink of light first up, getting enough movement off the seam to bamboozle a tentative Nicole Bolton early with a good-length ball that hit the top of her off stump, leaving Australia 25 for one. But disaster soon struck: Ecclestone, already into the attack as first change on a pitch that looks a spinner’s paradise, ed awkwardly at midwicket and had to leave the field two balls into her next over for treatment.Her fellow left-armer Gordon bravely stepped into the breach, with a first over in Test cricket that will for ever be a four-ball statistical quirk, but the momentum seemed from that moment to pass back to Australia – Healy picked off some wide balls from Shrubsole to ease herself to a 61-ball half-century. Gordon won the battle in the end, having Healy bowled round her legs to claim her maiden Test scalp just before the lunch break she should have added Lanning to her collection shortly afterwards, Heather Knight putting down an easy catch at short cover with the Australian captain on 26.Fortunately Ecclestone was able to return to the fray immediately after the break, in a tight spell that heralded the most sustained period of pressure for Australia and did, ultimately, yield the wicket of Lanning, bowled by a beauty that skidded into the top of her off stump.Shrubsole was fulsome in her praise of the 20-year-old: “She’s probably been our best bowler. She bowled a long spell and caused a lot of problems, particularly in that middle session. She’s a tough northern girl, and did an amazing job for us today.”Perry, though, grabbed back the initiative in the evening session. Shrubsole’s post-match assessment of the match as “evenly poised” seems, in the context of the series, an overly optimistic one."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6eae6e285046afc4c67a24c22116ebf8769443b/0_161_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a3530ea1648ece9c41fb1eaaad8a85a","title":"england south africa netball world cup match report","story":"A touch of ballet came to the Liverpool stage last night as England showed off some serious style to beat South Africa 58-47. Goalshooter Jo Harten hailed one of her side’s “best performances in the last two years” as they finished top of their group and set up a semi-final against New Zealand on Saturday.After some workmanlike performances, England seemed to raise their game against what Harten described as their bogey team. “Whenever we come up against them they take it down to the wire,” said Harten, who had tasted defeat against South Africa in January’s Quad series. “We were really nervous going into that one.”The pre-show butterflies worked. Under the mesmeric marshalling of centre Serena Guthrie, England established an 11-goal lead by half-time. The Proteas were not helped by the fact that the only person who might have been able to combat Guthrie – their own captain, Bongiwe Msomi – turned her ankle and hobbled off court after 11 minutes.Karla Pretorius and Phumza Maweni, who play alongside each other in the Australian Superleague, were supposed to be the strongest defence pairing that England’s attack had yet faced. But they had no answer to the dance that unfolded in front of them from the sixth minute, when a rebound off the baseline parlayed the ball back to Harten, who sent in a long-range shot that screamed confidence.Three more unanswered goals followed from her pas de deux in the D with Helen Housby, and by the end of the first quarter, England had scored 19. The last was a piece of almost ridiculous flair from Harten, who received a long ball on the edge of the circle and plunged it towards the net with one leg cocked coquettishly behind her.In the centre of the court, Guthrie exchanged long balls with Chelsea Pitman, their clean, clear arcs overwhelming the South Africa midquarters. There was something fun, almost flirty, about the way the ball kept making its way back to the England net. It had little interest in the other end, and when it did make an occasional appearance, South Africa’s own attack looked rattled. Maryka Holtzhauzen finished the first half with five misses from her nine attempts, while Geva Mentor and Eboni Usoro-Brown doubled down on Potgieter to keep her contained.South Africa returned stronger after the break, and England – who had previously not conceded a single quarter in the tournament – were even outscored 17-15 in the final 15 minutes. But at no point in the second half were the Proteas closer than nine goals in what coach Tracey Neville described as a “clinical” display and what Harten’s shooting alter ego, Housby, simply called “having fun”.England’s upcoming semi-final opponents New Zealand finished runners up in their own group, after they suffered defeat to Australia by a single goal in a stunning morning game. The Silver Ferns had fought back from a six-goal half-time deficit – but Israel Folau could only watch from the stands with everyone else as his wife Maria, New Zealand’s go-to pressure shooter, skimmed the rim with her last-second attempt to draw level.It was the World Cup’s best day of drama, which included Northern Ireland’s first ever victory against Barbados. After the high paced first half ended 23-23, captain Caroline O’Hanlon – who took hits to every part of her body, including her face – inspired her troops and even a late wobble as Barbados halved their six-goal lead with three minutes to play could not deny Northern Ireland their 46-43 win, or the reward of a place in the 9th10th place play-off.Scotland were only a single goal from meeting them in that fixture, after their thriller against Trinidad and Tobago ended in the first draw of the tournament. Forty-five minutes of see-sawing scoreline climaxed in a frenetic final five minutes, Ellie Barrie levelling the scores with a shot that reached the net after the hooter sounded. With the two teams finishing Group G on equal footing, a lower goal average means Scotland now play Barbados for the 11th-12th placing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dfff9d2b1e5e80f6426b7467a4a32de868b4c5ef/23_33_2515_1509/master/2515.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5d65aba9cb1dc041e8db9fb01012ee31","title":"jb holmes rory mcilroy open","story":"“I don’t feel like I’m the centre of attention,” insisted Rory McIlroy before a ball was struck in this, the 148th Open Championship. Well, he is now – for reasons far removed from the fairytale scenario in which McIlroy would raise the Claret Jug at the venue where he excelled as a 16-year-old. Such a memorable occasion for Northern Ireland instantly lurched towards calamity for one of its most celebrated sons.One of the most extraordinary – and extraordinarily damaging – rounds of McIlroy’s career began with an eight and finished with a seven. The 30-year-old’s 79, eight over par, on the Open’s historic return to Royal Portrush leaves him embroiled in a desperate scrap to make the cut. The last time McIlroy opened golf’s oldest major with this score, in 2013, he lasted only two days. In four subsequent Open appearances before this wounding day on the north coast of Antrim, McIlroy had not scored higher than 71. McIlroy has not so much drifted as sunk, from one of the short-priced Open favourites to a 400-1 outsider. This was not in anyone’s script.It is doubtful whether there has ever been a McIlroy scorecard like this one. It featured two birdies, 12 pars, a bogey, double bogey, triple bogey and quadruple bogey. To his credit, the four-times major winner undertook media duties and sought to explain how the “simple stuff” went awry. Privately, he must be devastated about what transpired in front of such an expectant audience.“I definitely think if I can put the ball in the fairway tomorrow I can shoot a good enough score to be around for the weekend,” said McIlroy. “Obviously I’m pretty sure anyone starting with a 79 in this golf tournament doesn’t think about winning at this point. But I think I can go out there and shoot something in the mid-60s, be around for the weekend, and then try to play good from there.“I didn’t give a very good account of myself out there. And I can definitely play better, as all of you know.” Indeed we do, which made this situation such a head-scratcher. McIlroy did not sugarcoat an “inexcusable” missed putt from tap-in range at the 16th.When walking to the 2nd tee, McIlroy was already eight from the lead. By close of play on a squally day, he sat 13 shots adrift of the front-running JB Holmes. Shane Lowry returned an impressive 67 to lie within one of Holmes’s five-under tally. Holmes has something of a curious Open record, with a third-place finish at Troon in 2016 leaping out among a string of missed cuts and the making up of numbers. In his past six starts on the PGA Tour, Holmes has not lasted beyond Friday.In another unquestionable blow to the profile of the Open’s staging at Portrush for the first time in 68 years, Tiger Woods joined McIlroy in the gallery of infamy. Woods’s struggles, that said, were far less of a surprise. The Masters champion winced at impact on his opening tee shot there was further cause for Woods to grimace as he reached the turn in 41. Woods, unfamiliar with these surroundings and visibly fragile, laboured towards a 78.Pre-tournament, little was made of the fact Lowry had tasted success here, as an amateur in the North of Ireland Championship. The man from Offaly is comfortable on links courses and enjoying one of the finest seasons of his professional career. It would be no shock whatsoever should Lowry at least remain prominent for another three days.“I think four under is a great score on that course and I’ll take it any day,” Lowry said. “I was probably as nervous as I’ve been in quite a while on the 1st tee, almost ever, I’d say.“Look, nerves are a good thing, aren’t they? It’s where you want to be. I just hope I’m nervous on Sunday afternoon out there. It’s right where you want to be and you have to tell yourself that when you’re there. Where would you rather be? Would you rather be here or sitting at home watching on TV?”A string of illustrious names are well placed. Sergio García, Jon Rahm, Alex Noren, Tyrrell Hatton, Tommy Fleetwood and Brooks Koepka are among the group at three under par. Garcia has endured a dismal time in majors since winning one, the Masters of 2017. Koepka’s recent run on the same stages, of course, has been outstanding. “I feel good, I feel very comfortable,” Koepka said. “It’s a major championship this is what you’re trying to peak for.”Scotland has been desperate for a golfing superstar for some time. Further proof that it might have one was delivered by Bob MacIntyre’s joining of the 68 club. The left-hander from Oban held the lead for a brief spell on day one. MacIntyre does not seem remotely fazed by his major debut.Francesco Molinari’s Open defence began with a 74. Adam Scott slumped to a 78. Phil Mickelson’s recently drastic weight loss did not have an instantly positive impact he signed for 76. David Duval attracted attention for all the wrong reasons after taking 14 at the 7th – blow by blow accounts of this debacle would give you a headache – en route to a 91.There was, then, considerably worse than McIlroy. It just did not feel that way."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e22a75f38e9eb591c85b4fd8039f267658221c6b/0_455_6418_3851/master/6418.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d39ebf9a0879605f3c24a38dfa54e1c3","title":"team gb biggest team overseas olympics 2020","story":"• Chef de mission hoping for 380 athletes in Tokyo• Paralympic team to decrease slightly on RioGreat Britain is on course to send its biggest team to an overseas Olympics, with the aim of staying in the “upper echelons” of the medal table at Tokyo 2020.The GB Paralympic team is predicted to total 250 athletes, a decrease on 2016 of 265.As previously revealed by the , the British team is also expected to feature more women than men for the first time. England said the BOA was “on the cusp” of attaining that milestone, thanks in part to an “equalisation programme” which will allow female athletes to compete in as many disciplines within a given sport as the men. The BOA is currently projecting 191 women will take part, compared to 187 men.With a year to go until Tokyo, qualification for the Games is continuing. The women’s hockey team, for example, are yet to confirm their place despite winning gold in Rio. According to the director of performance at UK Sport, Chelsea Warr, British athletes are performing on a par with this point four years ago, but equalling previous achievements would be tough.“We’re not behind, we’re not in front.

He disappeared for several hours, prompting his team, Bahrain-Merida, to issue a statement on Twitter raising concerns over the 29-year-old’s “welfare”.He later turned up at the Bahrain-Merida bus at the finish line but left the bus with his agent and a team media officer, refusing to talk to the waiting media.The team later said the rider made the decision “reluctantly” but offered no further clarity as to why he pulled out. Nor did Dennis when he eventually issued a statement and said he was “very disappointed” to leave the race at this point, but stopped short of giving an explanation.“Obviously the inidual time trial tomorrow had been a big goal for me and the team, but given my current feeling it was the right decision to withdraw earlier today,” Dennis said.“I wish my teammates the very best for the remainder of the race and would like to thank all the Tour de France fans who cheered for me, at home and on the roadside, since Brussels. I will hopefully be back competing in this great race again over the coming seasons.”Amid the initial confusion, Bahrain-Merida sports director Gorazd Stangelj had said he was “confused” and “disappointed” that Dennis, who won the Tour of Switzerland time trial last month, had quit.“We actually expected a big effort from him tomorrow,” Stangelj said. “It was his decision today to stop in the feed zone. We tried to speak with him. He said, ‘I don’t want to talk’ and just abandoned the race.“His condition is not bad, he’s good enough to perform at the Tour de France. For sure it has nothing to do with his condition.”Dennis was fancied to be in contention to take out Friday’s inidual time-trial stage in Pau and his exit will be a boon for defending Tour champion Geraint Thomas, who is also expected to be in the mix on Friday.Dennis has just one year remaining on his contract with Bahrain-Merida and there has been some speculation he is growing impatient with playing second fiddle to former Tour winner Vincenzo Nibali.But when asked whether Dennis was difficult to work with, Stangelj said: “I didn’t have any problem with him this season.The Bahrain-Merida team have been the subject of some controversy this year in the aftermath of the Operation Aderlass doping investigation, which is ongoing and had connected Milan Erzen, of the team’s management, to the investigation. Erzen has forcefully insisted that any allegations against him are false and unfounded.Asked after Thursday’s stage if there were any other issues that may have led to Dennis’s sudden withdrawal, Stangelj said: “Come on, don’t put words in my mouth.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29348f8b1c5fd433f66eb2bf614f0d3a6fa1ac69/0_0_5159_3439/master/5159.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=201ba81caf88cfca8c4865d291eaf39d 960w","title":"our church review","story":"Watermill, NewburyMarietta Kirkbride’s play about a village torn over forgiving a sex offender convincingly channels older voices The #MeToo movement has inspired a number of plays giving voice to the victims of sexual predation. Now comes drama tackling the inner lives of sex offenders themselves, the most prominent of these being Downstate, a Steppenwolf and National Theatre co-production, and David Mamet’s current West End play, Bitter Wheat.Marietta Kirkbride’s Our Church is far quieter and more English than either of these. It is set in a fictional village that could be the backwaters of Ambridge. Three church committee members eat Hobnobs and discuss parish matters, from dwindling volunteers (“We need fresh blood”) to a diseased pear tree, a renegade cow and a game of croquet for villagers.It is only when June (Kirsty Cox) nominates a churchgoer called Tom to be part of the group that their conversation becomes charged. Tom is a convicted sex offender who was caught with downloaded images of underage girls. Now elderly, the sustained suspicion towards him in the village is aired by Michael (Robert East, who doubles excellently as Tom) and Anne (Susan Tracy).Kirkbride’s script is a blend of convincingly naturalistic dialogue with comic edges and thorny conversations tackling the difficulties around rehabilitation and Christian forgiveness, particularly between Tom and Anne, who has her own history of abuse and is played by Tracy with a dialled-down spiky nervousness.While it does not have the dramatic complexity of Downstate, Nik Partridge’s production captures the awkward reckoning and reconciliation process between abuser and abused. At times, it treads a fine line between potent drama and debating society rhetoric but it never slips into judgment, and Tom’s argument – that he can only do good in society if that society begins to trust him again – is a powerful one.What is extraordinary is that Our Church is constructed for the small communities it reflects. It has toured 17 village halls and arts centres, and Anna Orton’s set of a church hall has an airy, minimal quality.There is something very brave about a young writer channelling elderly voices, and Kirkbride does so excellently. It is, in the end, a focused study, perhaps too light on plot, but with a power that lies in its quiet, emotional understatement."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a51a6fd5852eaf21033b5bc9bb8dad6d4390471b/58_354_2715_1629/master/2715.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bacd887b53eea28d4d3e4c9946b8fef6","title":"sheila atim anguis game of thrones cleopatra edinburgh fringe","story":"Soon to star in the Game of Thrones prequel, the Olivier-winning actor presents Anguis at the Edinburgh fringe‘The last thing I did in any kind of creative-writing capacity would have been my English GCSE,” Sheila Atim laughs. The 28-year-old actor, who won an Olivier award for the Bob Dylan musical Girl from the North Country and has landed a role in the hotly anticipated Game of Thrones prequel, has now turned writer. Her debut play, Anguis, is at the Edinburgh fringe this summer.“A producer approached me, initially in a music capacity,” she tells me over the phone during a rare break in her hectic schedule. Atim is a multi-instrumentalist and composed Time Is Love, Che Walker’s production at the Finborough earlier this year. “I thought, ‘Right, let me think if there is anyone in history that I’m interested in.’ Cleopatra came up, and I did a bit of reading about her.” The music project soon turned into a play instead when the producer asked if she would like to write it, Atim thought: “‘Yeah, why not?!’ And then it’s like ‘Oh. Wait …’ But it’s Edinburgh and that’s the whole point, it’s all about experimentation, emerging artists.” Can an Olivier award-winner call themselves an emerging artist? “Absolutely!”Set in the modern day, Anguis is, according to Atim, “basically a long conversation” between Cleopatra and an immunologist called Kate Williams. The two women are recording a podcast. “Cleopatra’s got some things in her story that we are not sure whether they are true, so we’re discussing a lot of the Cleopatra we’ve come to know versus who she might have actually been. Secondly, Kate is going through an event in her life with large political and social ramifications, so she’s having to navigate that.”Recently, Atim has explored how the online age means we are responding faster to the world around us, a theme that runs through Anguis. “There’s less time and space to exist in the kind of ‘I don’t know’ ambiguous place where we do all our decision-making.” Instead, she thinks, “within five minutes of hearing about something, you must have made a decision on how you feel about it, how are you going to deal with it, what you’re going to tweet”.Her rising profile means she does a lot of interviews. “I get asked questions on things and I’m very clear in those interviews that I don’t know, if I don’t know or haven’t worked it out yet.” It feels meta to ask if she worries about being interviewed, but I do anyway. “No, I don’t. I’m aware of certain pitfalls or whatever, but I’ve got nothing to hide, and I’m not ashamed of anything that I think or feel. I do like talking about things.” Her Essex accent has some humour in it. “Yeah, don’t worry. I’m not freaking out. I’m not going to hang up!”Born in Uganda, Atim grew up in Essex with her mother, and caught the acting bug in school. Almost 6ft tall, she did some modelling as a teen, toyed with being a doctor and studied biomedical science at King’s in London. Her early roles included Che Walker’s The Lightning Child at the Globe and a lot of Shakespeare. She was in Phyllida Lloyd’s Donmar Trilogy and played a riveting Emilia in Othello opposite Mark Rylance and Andre Holland. But she’s perhaps better known for her roles as the haunting, silent Woman in Les Blancs at the National theatre in 2016, and in Girl from the North Country a year later.These days, she’s recognised “a lot more often than I thought I would be”, and the Thrones TV prequel – which she “can’t talk about yet” – hasn’t even been released. Fans don’t know when the pilot will air, but after a casting announcement in January, we know Atim will have a major role. Since she is doing more work on TV, does she have hopes to write for screen, too? She laughs. “I’m going to see how this is received first. Honestly, I’m the sort of person who’ll take the L, right? If everyone says it’s rubbish, I’ll be like, ‘Do you know what, fair enough mate.’ I can’t do everything.”Saying that, she has enjoyed the writing process. “I’ve had moments where I’ve gone, ‘Oh my God, what am I doing? Delete, delete, delete.’ But the team have been really reassuring, and I’ve got a lot of friends who are writers and they’ve all said that’s completely normal.” She seems proud of Anguis and calls it “genuinely thought-provoking in a time where I think we do need to pause and think – this play gives us time that we don’t necessarily give ourselves to think about things”. She’s currently doing rewrites, and despite her busy acting schedule, aims to get to Edinburgh to see it. “I am really excited. I’m just also terrified, but that’s all part of it, and those two feelings are almost the same thing sometimes.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/789e8feeafb24fd4ec258d794f27d0f6c1a7ce77/0_21_5264_3158/master/5264.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=084a4508ce1eac1a481e29a366986942","title":"calling at all stations tube passengers to get 4g reception from next year","story":"4G mobile technology will launch on Jubilee line and will be extended to other linesLondon Underground passengers will be able to use their phones in tunnels between stations from early next year, removing one of the last major public places in Britain without phone reception and creating new challenges to commuter etiquette.Transport for London confirmed to the  that 4G mobile phone technology would go live in tunnels on most of the Jubilee line from March 2020 and on other lines in the coming years.The move raises the prospect of commuters making and receiving phone calls while packed into typically largely chat-free tube carriages.Mark Bulle, TfL’s head of infrastructure transformation, acknowledged that passenger behaviour could change. “People could have their commute interrupted – but at the end of the day it’s up to people whether they take the call from their boss.”However, he expects most people to instead use the connection for data services, and he said it should be fast enough to allow uninterrupted viewing of video streams. “You should be able to stream live sports,” he said.Mobile phone coverage has been standard in many subway systems around the world for several years, with some cities such as Moscow offering commuters both wifi and mobile phone connections. Even the Channel tunnel has a 4G signal, but until now London commuters have had to rely on the wifi system available only in stations – resulting in a rush to log on at the moment a train pulls into the platform.The capital’s underground network, the world’s oldest subway network, poses a challenge because many of the lines are built in narrow tunnels that often bend to follow the route of public roads on the surface, making it harder for signals to travel along them. TfL is adopting a model based on “leaky feeders” – essentially running cables through tunnels that act as giant aerials.The upgrade, which will ultimately require around 2,000km of new cabling, is being installed in conjunction with a much-delayed Home Office-mandated 4G telephone network for the emergency services, saving the need to fit two different sets of equipment.While TfL is picking up the bill for initial trial on the Jubilee line extension between Canning Town and Westminster, it will soon award a contract to a private operator which will install 4G equipment within all of London’s tube tunnels by the mid-2020s. Mobile phone networks will then pay the private operator for access to the network, with the transport authority receiving a cut of profits.Installation of the network is complicated by the decision to introduce 24-hour tube services, which limits the amount of access that engineering staff have to the tunnels. There are no plans to install a 5G network within the tunnels owing to the substantial amount of equipment that would be required.The introduction of mobile phone reception could have a negative impact on London’s free print publications such as the Evening Standard, which rely on attracting the attention of commuters on the tube.Similar schemes are being considered on the UK’s other underground rail networks. Merseyrail is installing a wifi network in its Liverpool tunnels, and the Glasgow Subway is experimenting with 5G services. Newcastle commuters could feel London is playing catch-up, having had 2G mobile signal on the limited sub-surface sections of the Tyne \u0026amp Wear  since 2004, with upgrades to more modern technology due to start in the autumn.Although the UK’s four mobile phone networks are is still in negotiations about accessing the new equipment in London’s tube tunnels, TfL expects that customer demand will ensure they all provide services on the move. “Our suspicion is that none of them will want to be left behind,” said Bulle."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f237ebad83038a6bad5935f35a776a8028da3c4/0_109_3300_1980/master/3300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c109570b99853b96241bb64772302847","title":"send tip off the tourist trail europe twin 200 pound hotel voucher","story":"You might know a hidden-but-wonderful village, town, historic site, landscape or beach.

What can this unique relationship teach us? It is difficult to describe the weight of eiderdown in a language in which the epitome of lightness is a feather. Unlike a feather’s ordered barbs arranged around a solid shaft, under a microscope, eiderdown offers a portrait of chaos: hundreds of soft threads branch out from a single point, twisting around one another. Upon each thread are countless small hooks, which allow the down to cling to itself, trapping pockets of air and warmth.When I returned from Iceland, I asked my wife to close her eyes and put her hands out. After placing a duck-size clump of down in her hands, I asked her what she felt. “Heat,” she said. She opened her eyes to find the down, a ghostly grey form, hovering above her palms, and pulled it apart. It crackled as if electrified, emitting a mild smell that reminded me of burned hair. She scrunched her hands and the down disappeared in her fingers, compressed into a ball smaller than a duckling’s bill.Over centuries, eiderdown has been treasured by those who shared their lands with the eider. The Vikings apparently filled their bedding with it, while medieval tax collectors accepted it as a means of payment. Today, its buyers are the global super-rich. In Iceland, I heard stories about Gulf royals who sleep under eiderdown in the desert, and Russian politicians whose hearts can be warmed with the gift of an eiderdown duvet.The properties of eiderdown – extreme lightness and insulation – make sense when you consider the life of its owner. The eider is a fat seabird, more penguin than duck, and many of them spend most of their lives in the Arctic Circle. Visit the Icelandic coast and you will see hundreds bobbing gregariously in the sea. Brash creatures, their boldness inspires admiration in the Icelanders. “The eider is an unsung hero, far braver than any bird of prey, which it is known to attack to protect its offspring,” one local told me.The usual story of how feathers come to fill our bedding is anything but comforting. According to trade bodies, most feathers are a byproduct of the meat industry. Less fortunate birds may have their plumage ripped out while they are still alive, a practice known as live-plucking.As I held a clump of eiderdown in my hand, however, one Icelander told me something that seemed to offer an alternative to this unsettling relationship between humans and birds. He said that the eider it once belonged to is probably still alive. Not in some dark barn, or even in an open-air enclosure, but in the wilds of the Arctic Circle.In a cafe in Ísafjörður, the pastor explained how he harvests eiderdown. As part of his parish duties, he runs a small farm, a throwback to earlier times when pastors in remote areas would survive off the land. Every June, he said, about 500 ducks arrive from the sea and waddle to his farm. Eiders do not naturally nest in such large colonies, but will congregate close to human settlements to seek shelter and protection. The ducks nest anywhere: in tyres, doorways and even houses. “I always take a lot of flags with me and I put a flag beside each nest so I will be able to find it again. Because they are incredibly camouflaged, these ducks. You can almost step on them,” he said.At night, the pastor guards the flock of eiders from their predators: seagulls, foxes and mink. “I was quite lucky in that I got interested in guns when I was just a little over 20,” he said. “It was before I started studying theology.” If he were to fall asleep, a fox would have a feast of sitting ducks. “It’s more than a financial loss, it’s also like they are depending on me. So I don’t want to let them down. I used to be a night watchman, so I have a little bit of experience staying awake.”In the middle ages, pelicans were thought to pierce their own breast to draw blood to feed their young. The mythical act was known as vulning, a Christ-like act of self-sacrifice. On the pastor’s land, the eider, too, makes herself vulnerable for her offspring, although it is down, not blood, that she draws from her breast. From this down she builds a nest for her eggs her own bare skin, freshly revealed, covers them with warmth. She sits on her eggs for some 28 days, during which she may lose a third of her body weight some mothers starve to death.The scene described by the pastor has been a common sight in Iceland for centuries. Down has been collected here probably since the arrival of Norse settlers in the ninth century. The sight of thousands of tame eiders close to human settlements astounded early European travellers in Iceland. CW Shepherd, an Englishman who visited the island of Vigur in the Westfjords in 1862, described a farm besieged by eiders: “On the ground, the house was fringed with ducks. On the turf slopes of the roof, we could see ducks and a duck sat on the door-scraper … A windmill was infested and so were all the outhouses, mounds, rocks and crevices. The ducks were everywhere.”Environmentalists, economists and ornithologists have all fallen in love with Icelandic harvesting. There is an irresistible simplicity to the relationship between the harvesters and the eiders. If a harvester cares for the ducks, more and more will come to nest, increasing the amount of down that can be gathered.In myths, fables and hagiographies, one often reads of the ability of iniduals to tame wild creatures. It is said that St Cuthbert, the seventh-century missionary who settled on the Farne Islands off the Northumbrian coast, protected and tamed eiders. (Today in Northumberland, the eider is sometimes called St Cuthbert’s or Cuddy duck.) Many of these stories were built upon embellishment or pure fantasy, but in Iceland, travellers’ accounts repeatedly confirmed the existence of this strange relationship between Icelanders and the ducks.I wanted to know how this relationship worked, how it was possible for a wild bird to behave as if it were domesticated. How did this strange tradition come about? How was it that the relationship had been preserved despite the arrival of the market? Could eiderdown harvesting teach us about our relationship with other species?Back in Ísafjörður, the pastor told me about a Japanese film crew who had made a documentary about him. For several weeks, they followed him around his farm, recording him collecting down with his children, while sidestepping nesting eiders. He appeared bemused by their attention, just as he was by mine. After all, he said, the down was only some brauð, a slice of his daily bread.The pastor’s parish lay a short drive from Ísafjörður in another fjord, Önundarfjörður. It was once reached via a winding mountain road but, since 1996, the two fjords have been connected by a vast tunnel that bores directly through the hillside. One morning, I emerged from its confines, blinded by the subarctic light, and headed to the pastor’s church to take a tour of his nesting area.Like many Lutheran parishes, the pastor’s land is among the most prized in the Westfjords. In the shadow of a steep glacial wall, his family home and church overlook a floodplain that leads to the shoreline. It was hard to conceive of a more peaceful spot for a family, yet there was an air of abandonment to the pastor’s home. Children’s toys lay scattered around on the floor and a layer of dust covered the work surfaces. The previous winter, he explained, the weather had got so bad that he and his family had to leave the parish and take an apartment in Ísafjörður. He now rarely spends any time in the house. “We were trapped here for 36 hours with no electricity, no phone,” he said. “I can’t be responsible for that.”I was late for the eiderdown season, but the pastor offered to lead me around the land and re-enact his summer ritual as he had done for the Japanese film crew. Dressed in an old Polish military uniform, he headed off across the flat plain towards the beach, hunting for any nests that he had missed. It was a still day, the silence broken only by the call of an oystercatcher, alarmed by our presence.Walking on this flat land, I felt as if I had missed out on a great gathering. All around us were hundreds of small piles of crushed mussel shells, the remnants of the eiders’ feasting, ground up by their powerful gizzards. Quartz-like, these remains had an understated beauty, glinting in the light. “In the later part, everything is going crazy,” the pastor said. “Birds and chicks running around. Arctic terns attacking all the time. It’s good to have a broomstick.”Later, as we made our way back to the church, the pastor let out a cry and pointed to a nest that he had missed during the previous gathering. Covered in moss, grass and broken eggs, it looked like a furry grey omelette or pancake. He wedged his stick under the down, easing it gently from the grass, and picked it up. Laden with seaweed, twigs and dirt, it reminded me of the contents of a vacuum cleaner, half fluff, half debris. Unlike the clean down my wife had held, it had a pungent, mouldy aroma, suggestive of the sitting duck from which it came. Looking closely, I saw the remains of several eggs caught up in the down. Rendered rubbery by rainfall, their fragments were proof of what the pastor had said he always allowed the ducklings to hatch before collecting their bedding. “Take it as a gift,” he said.Some 50 years before I visited Iceland, the Scottish writer Gavin Maxwell became momentarily possessed by Icelandic harvesting while living in Sandaig, a bay in remote western Scotland. He began to read about it and even travelled to Iceland on a research trip. Maxwell is best known for for his memoir Ring of Bright Water, which recounts his domestic life with several otters, but he also adored eiders. “Perhaps,” he mused, “it is their peculiarly uneven voices, or the way their massive bills ascend in a straight line to the top of their skulls without any ‘scoop’ in between. Or perhaps it is their curious and very inidual smell, which seems as if it could have nothing to do with a bird.”Unlike previous travel writers who described eiderdown, he dreamed of recreating the success of the Icelanders. From his cottage, he had noticed eiders nesting on a small island close to his home he counted only 30 pairs in total, but he imagined that he might turn it into a magnet for ducks. Inspired by Icelandic methods, he proposed erecting flags, wind propellers, scarecrows, artificial nesting sites, wind shelters and decoy drake eiders to attract the ducks. He concocted plans to feed the ducks with mussels and – apparently – even to entertain them with music.Maxwell wrote of harvesting in utopian terms, describing how early settlers had lured eiders with “an elaboration of fluttering flags, little wind-driven clacking propellers, and reeded wind instruments that would sigh, groan or trumpet, according to the strength of the breeze”. The Icelanders, he believed, had some sort of special ability to understand ducks that verged on the mystical. While he took copious notes on Icelandic techniques in an attempt to understand their success, he allowed that there was “a certain mystique” about the practice. “Some men,” he wrote, “seem to have ‘green fingers’ with Eiders.”When I visited the pastor, I was infused with Maxwell’s own vision of down, a contrast to stories of degradation and exploitation. Patient and sensitive, the pastor seemed to fit perfectly Maxwell’s vision, heroically guarding the ducks, never taking the down too early. And yet something didn’t feel quite right. In the 19th century, British, French, Scandinavian and American travellers, many of them scientists, started visiting Iceland, which was then a Danish colony. Wandering through its volcanic landscape, admiring the frames of its miniature horses and its colossal populations of eiders, or listening to the Icelandic tongue, they described Iceland in magical terms. Fed up with their descriptions of “scenes of thrilling horror, of majestic grandeur, and of heavenly beauty”, the explorer Richard Burton wrote of a condition called “Iceland on the brain”. I feared that I was falling into a similar trap, failing to write about another character in the drama.The Arctic fox – Vulpes lagopus – is the only mammal in Iceland whose presence predates the island’s settlement. Much smaller than its red cousin, the Arctic fox has miniature soft paws that are entirely covered in fur (hence its species name, which means “rabbit foot” in Latin). Perfectly adapted to the country’s varying seasons, the foxes can roam thousands of kilometres, their winter coats transforming from white to brown or even blue in the summer months.When settlers arrived with domestic animals, it was inevitable that they would clash with the Arctic fox. Fearful of the threat to livestock, farmers clubbed, trapped and later poisoned and shot them. Such was the fear of the foxes among Icelanders that a myth emerged that they had been sent by the king of Norway to punish settlers for their abandonment of their motherland. Legislation to encourage their extermination dates back to 1295, and even today each community in Iceland is obliged to hire a fox killer to visit all known dens in the area to exterminate their occupants.As I drove back from the pastor’s farm to Ísafjörður, it struck me as unlikely that the pastor, this kind man who refused to disturb an eider, was a true fox killer. Despite the military uniform, glasses and talk of guns, he never actually described killing a fox. I later asked his friend and neighbour, a long-time eider farmer, who really kills the foxes in the fjord. “I do,” he said with a smile. “The priest has never shot a single fox.”I wondered whether I had not experienced a sanitised version of down harvesting, one primed for the Japanese market. I asked around in the Westfjords, searching for the name of an effective fox killer. Again and again the same name popped up: Valdimar Gíslason. Famed throughout the Westfjords for his cunning and ruthlessness, he had raised a private army, a band of killers to protect their capital of eider ducks. Eider farmers spoke of him in hushed tones, revering him for his dedication to fox extermination.Gíslason lived in Dýrafjörður, the fjord beyond the pastor. The following week I visited him at his home, a sparsely furnished farmhouse that overlooked the fjord. His Danish wife, Edda, welcomed me in, the sound of choir music blending with the roar of an eiderdown dryer in a barn outside. A retired maths teacher, Gíslason has lived in the fjord for seven decades. Since his boyhood, he has gathered eiderdown from his land and pursued the foxes that wish to dine on his ducks. “Sixty-five years, 50 nights every spring,” he said, as if considering a mathematical problem. After so many nights of shooting, his hearing had begun to fade.The practice of poisoning or sedating eiders’ predators was once widespread in Iceland, carried out by farmers and government officials alike. Such techniques may have saved the lives of countless ducks, but they have historically proved highly destructive to the island’s ecosystem. In the early 1980s, for example, more than 4,000 ravens were killed per year under the country’s pest control programme. Worse, the disappearance of Iceland’s white-tailed eagle, which almost went extinct in the 1960s, has been attributed partly to the activities of eiderdown farmers. Although eagle numbers have now recovered, their torrid history speaks of what Andri Snær Magnason, himself an eiderdown farmer, calls the “dark side” of the eiderdown trade: however virtuous harvesters may be, they have a strong incentive to kill any species that threatens the prized bird.But there was another reason that explained Gíslason’s fondness for foxes, one I appreciated only once he brought out his notebook. Bound in red leather, it recorded the number of ducks that had come to his farm over five decades. In the early 1960s, it recorded more than 6,000 ducks, but gradually the figure began to decline. Today, Gíslason said, there are only 1,500 nests. I guessed that the foxes were to blame, but he replied that the fox was innocent it was his neighbours, his fellow hunters, who had reduced his take of eiderdown.When settlers first came to Iceland from Norway, fleeing political turmoil, they were confronted with a harsh subarctic landscape, devoid of large animals. As well as bringing their own domesticated animals and crops, settlers foraged along the island’s coastline for driftwood, molluscs, edible plants, eiderdown and beached whales. Such a windfall offered opportunities, but also potential for great conflict. Indeed, much of early Icelandic law deals specifically with harvesting rights for these scarce resources in order to avoid violence.The sagas piled on Gíslason’s shelf, those bloody tales of Iceland’s settlement period, recount how huge disputes would erupt between settlers over driftage rights, particularly over beached whales. Like the beached whale, the ducks in Gíslason’s fjord were a finite and highly valued resource any gain by a farmer in eiderdown would be offset by another’s loss. Yet it was impossible to conceive of any conflict over their down, to conjure a scene in which they ran towards the nests, turning their rifles on each other or making missiles of eider eggs. The fox had masked the competitive logic of the harvest, uniting the farmers in common cause, their quest to avert a duck massacre.I did not sense any cruelty in any of the harvesters I met, merely the simple, unsentimental coldness of a people who lived off the land, who killed or starved. All this said, part of me still preferred Maxwell’s version, his image of Icelanders with “green fingers”. Walking through the Hornstrandir reserve, the most remote area of the Westfjords, I would often see Arctic foxes patrolling the banks of rivers or the coastline, looking for birds and eggs. At night, I would listen to their high-pitched calls from my tent, my dreams populated with images of small children at play. Like the birch trees that once covered Iceland, the foxes were a reminder of what this island was like before the arrival of human settlers. To kill them was to assert a certain logic that felt at odds with the promise of eiderdown, its essential balance, and I began to hunt for places in the Westfjords that might fit Maxwell’s image.In writings on eiderdown, Æðey, a tiny island in the Westfjords peninsula, has assumed an almost pre-eminent status among nesting sites because of the vast size of its eider population. In the summer months, thousands upon thousands of eiders besiege the island, coating its grassland in brown and white hues, the sound of cooing drakes almost deafening the visitor.It took me some five hours by car to reach the pick-up point to Æðey. A mere 15 miles (24km) of water separates it from Ísafjörður, but the coastal roads of the Westfjords wind like furled ribbons, tracing the outlines of the fjords’ fingers. Driving along them, you seem to brush your destination, only to fold back on yourself, and repeat the process.From the pick-up point, I stepped on to a small boat belonging to Alexíus Jónasson, one of Æðey’s owners. In his mid-30s, Alexíus spoke perfect English, honed from years of reading Tolkien, Clancy and the instruction manuals for fish-processing machinery from his workplace in Ísafjörður. The sixth of seven generations who have lived on Æðey, he gathers down together with his two brothers, Jonás and Magnús. But Alexíus told me that it is their mother, Katrín, who is really in charge of the down harvest, a reminder of the key role that women and family matriarchs have traditionally played in the trade, from nest to bedding.Handling the boat with expert care, Alexíus guided us across the narrow stretch of water, scattering the seabirds on its surface. As we approached the island, I could hear the cries of his children playing in the water under the gaze of his mother. “It’s nice for them to be free,” Alexíus said, before we heard a high-pitched wail. “We get the occasional argument.”I followed Alexíus as he wandered across the island. We headed onwards to the island’s lighthouse, studiously avoiding puffin nests in the fissures that riddle the island. At the island’s tip we sat down on a rock, admiring the spouts of several humpbacks, there to feed in Iceland’s rich waters after journeying from their breeding grounds in the Gulf of Mexico.Watching the whales’ spouts rise and dissolve in the distance, it was easy to believe this place a rural utopia, a place where eiders could nest in peace and children roamed alongside geese, rabbits, puffins and horses. Around us life exploded from the water, the skies and the crevices in the rocks. All one had to do was to observe it, wait patiently and gather eiderdown. But then we were met by Tása, the family dog, whose job it was to catch any mink that swim over from the mainland. “She’s a gentle family dog,” Alexíus said, “but when she meets the mink she goes apeshit. It’s quite messy when she gets it. She starts one end and breaks every bone.”The recent history of the Westfjords is really the story of rural depopulation, of a vanishing culture next to the Arctic Circle. Over the past decade, countless farmers have packed up and left the region, tired of the weather, isolation and poor roads. The region’s tunnels and bridges, intended to increase mobility, have served as escape routes, emptying the fjords of Icelanders. “The government is always making it harder for people,” Magnús said. “There’s so little money in it, being a farmer, it’s becoming a lifestyle choice.”Unlike many livestock farms in the Westfjords, eider farms are still populated, their down a source of stable income. Faced with rising costs and falling profits, the brothers stopped sheep-farming in 1990. Instead, they chose to specialise in eiderdown. “It’s like a family thing,” Alexíus said. “Everybody helps out.”While the Icelanders manage the eiders, drawing them to their dwellings with the promise of protection, the ducks had also bound the farmers to these remote corners. “It’s like the ducks are keeping us here,” Magnús told me. “We wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for them.”Yet there was another presence, one that silently haunted the harvesters’ imaginations, fed by novels or television: the men and women of ambition who wore the jackets or slept under the duvets. Unlike Icelandic wool sweaters, yoghurt or finance, eiderdown has, for much of its history, been an international commodity, first traded by the Danes, then – after Iceland’s independence – bought by middlemen in Europe and Japan. Far from isolated, Iceland’s 350 eider farms are connected to distant metropolises, with an invisible thread running between the ducks, the harvesters and the buyers, much of whose wealth, no doubt, is built on a form of resource extraction that is far removed from the gentle rhythms of down-gathering.In many remote communities, cut off from urban centres by the harsh contours of landscape, stretches of water or walls of rock, encountering the global market has been a source of trauma, leading to a collapse in the old ways of living and seeing. But I felt no quake on Æðey or indeed on any of the other eider farms I visited. Every season, the ducks came, and their down was harvested and shipped off to the middlemen for a stable price, much as has been done for centuries. And yet there were signs, too, that things might be changing, as Iceland continues to be shaken by the effects of the financial crisis, the influx of millions of tourists and rural depopulation. Like the sheep farmers, the eiderdown harvesters were getting fed up with the harsh weather and isolation. Many eiderdown farms, said Jón Sveinsson, another harvester, are merely summer houses, places of recreation for city dwellers. “The new owners are not interested in the pittance a few kilograms of eiderdown give. After all, they have come to the countryside to have a beer on the porch, fire up the grill and relax on the weekend, not to run around harvesting foul-smelling, flea-ridden eiderdown.”I tried to imagine what the Westfjords might look like in 50 years or so, as old ways of life faded away. “It’s not sad,” Sveinsson told me, “just different. The world is getting smaller.” But I did feel sad, thinking that this tradition might disappear. When I returned to the UK, I made a habit of checking in department stores to see if they had eiderdown quilts or pillows. Finding them in a shop window, I always felt reassured that the traffic in down continued, that this tradition still had a place in our own century of synthetics and factory farming. Nestled in silk covers, the down was always hidden from view, its rich history condensed into a short description on the label. Tempted by an act of mischief, I almost wanted to rip them apart, allowing the down and its stories to expand and escape outward.Adapted from Harvest: The Hidden Histories of Seven Natural Objects by Edward Posnett, published by The Bodley Head on 8 August and available at bookshop• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50b0cd81c942c710be2da2e196140c0b4bdc7308/38_0_3426_2055/master/3426.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a6704a54ef76f6fabc01859e00fc630e","title":"friday briefing every inch of the way against no deal brexit","story":"Ministers including Philip Hammond abstain as vote to thwart Boris Johnson passes … horror car crash in Stevenage … and mobiles on the tubeHello, Warren Murray here with just the sort of thing you need of a Friday morning early.Conservative rebels are among MPs who have moved to stymie Boris Johnson by voting to block any attempt to suspend parliament and force through a no-deal Brexit.The chancellor, Philip Hammond, vowed to “fight no deal every inch of the way” as he and three other cabinet ministers abstained and let the vote pass in a defeat for the government.Johnson has refused to rule out suspending parliament but a series of Commons and Lords amendments now make this markedly more difficult, dictating that ministers must report regularly to the Commons up to and beyond the Brexit deadline.Pay day is on May –\u0026nbspPublic sector workers including teachers and police officers are reportedly to be given a £2bn pay rise.

Photograph: iStockTechnology graduates are earning significantly more than other graduates within five years of leaving college, according to major study by the Central Statistics Office.The CSO survey tracked the earnings of hundreds of thousands of graduates who left college between 2012 and 2016 using income recorded through the PAYE system.Within five years of leaving college, graduates from information and communication technology courses were by far the highest earners, earning €815 a week on average.Engineering students earned €730 on average five years after leaving college, while those who studied health and welfare earned €710, science (€705), education (€695) and businesslaw (€685).By contrast, the lowest earners had qualifications in services (€530 a week), arts and humanities (€585), agriculture and veterinary (€610), social sciences and journalism (€645).Despite high earnings on offer in the sector, many tech firms say they are facing acute skills shortages and relatively few school-leavers are choosing courses in this area.The most popular industries for new graduates in 2016 were wholesale and retail, followed by health, science and education.There is also evidence of a gender gap in earnings, with men more likely to earn more than women.For example, men who graduated in 2016 earned an average of €485 a week , compared to €470 a week for womenOne possible factor is that men are more likely to be employed in sectors with higher earnings, such as ICT.Earnings premiumThe data also shows a significant earnings premium is attached to higher levels of qualification.Graduates with a doctoral degree earned most within a year of qualification (€710 per week), followed by master’s (€560), honours degree (€475), ordinary degree (€380) and advanced certificate (€285).In a sign of the job opportunities on offer in the growing economy, fewer graduates are choosing post-graduate studies and are opting to go straight into the workplace.While about one in four graduates re-enrolled in higher education in 2016, this is down from one in three in 2010.Almost 80 per cent of 2016 graduates were in employment in the first year after graduation, compared with 65 per cent of 2010.Graduates are also earning more, with weekly median earnings for 2016 graduates at €475 a week, compared with €420 in 2010.While the five-year figures show tech graduates are earning most within five years of graduating, the one-year figure paints a different picture.Over recent years, education graduates have tended to earn most in the first year after college, followed by health and welfare.However, the slower rate of salary increase in these sectors means tech and engineering graduates outstrip them within a few years.ApprenticeshipsThe study also sheds new light on the further education sector, which includes post-Leaving Cert courses and apprenticeships.It shows almost two out of three 2016 graduates were in employment in the first year after graduation, compared with less than half of 2010 graduates.Relatively high numbers are choosing to remain in the education system. Some 30 per cent of 2016 graduates from further education progress to higher education, while 38 per cent were re-enrolled in another further education course within a year.The study also shows employment prospects for apprenticeships have improved significantly over recent years.While more than half of apprentices qualified in 2010 were in employment two years after qualification, this rose to 80 per cent for apprentices qualified in 2014.Paul O’Toole, the Higher Education Authority’s chief executive, said the study provided “invaluable information” on what graduates do after leaving college.He said it will allow stakeholders in higher education to build a “strong and objective evidence-base for policymaking and delivery of a high-quality higher-education system”."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"\u0026lsquoIs it not evident that the world needs trees more than ever?

while those in Lambeth in London could have more than £31,000 at their disposal. Leicestershire, Derbyshire, Somerset, East Sussex, Staffordshire, Lincolnshire and North Yorkshire were among other areas with the most limited resources, according to the analysis. All the councils which fared best were in London. The trends also show an increasing gulf, with  “spending power” in rural councils falling, while it is rising in urban areas. The organisation said it was now having to subsidise places in its own care homes, to the tune of an average £302 per person were week. Lieut-Colonel Dean Pallant, of The Salvation Army, said: “Rural local authorities have been set up to fail with this flawed formula and it urgently needs revision. “People are living longer and the population is ageing, the adult social care bill is rising but the local authority funding streams aren’t enough to cover the demand, especially in areas where there are not many businesses or people to tax.”“The Government must prioritise its spending and properly fund adult social care.”Why is the NHS under so much pressure?Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK said many parts of the country were becoming “care deserts” leaving pensioners in need of care stranded. She said: “These are some localities where there is literally no care to be had, even when older people can afford to pay, leaving significant numbers with potentially long distances to travel to get the help they desperately need, or giving their families no choice but to step in - if indeed they exist. Cllr Ian Hudspeth, Chairman of the Local Government Association’s Community Wellbeing Board, said: “Councils in England receive 1.8 million new requests for adult social care a year – the equivalent of nearly 5,000 a day - and there is a £3.6 billion funding gap facing adult social care by 2025, just to maintain existing standards of care and support.“We cannot duck this issue as a society any longer.”Breathalysers could be fitted inside the vehicles of convicted drink- driversJeremy Hunt anger whips after claiming he was told he could skip no-deal Brexit voteComment: Voters don\u0026#39t want the green campaigners\u0026#39 extreme climate policiesLondon Tube passengers to get 4G reception on Underground from next yearBrandon Lewis admits he cannot guarantee that every eligible member gets a vote in leadership contestStevenage crash: 14 injured as cars plough into crowd after collision at event\u0026#39Millions\u0026#39 of Painted Lady butterflies set to arrive in the UK this summerHundreds die due to government salt scheme that let industry set reduction targets, experts claimTheresa May set to give £2bn pay rise to public sector workers in one of her final acts in Number 10NHS flu jabs delayed amid scramble to keep up with \u0026#39Aussie\u0026#39 strain How Philip Hammond delivered his final act of rebellion on the steps of No 11US has shot down Iranian drone in Strait of Hormuz, says TrumpComment: Community is the first line of defence against all forms of extremismPhilip Hammond orchestrates Tory no-deal rebellion in Brexit parting shotComment: There may well be an economic cost to no-deal – but plenty of people want it anywayOxford\u0026#39s admission problem is because state schools fail to push their brightest pupils, vice chancellor suggestsThere will be no repeat of April gridlock in London, police chief warns Extinction Rebellion A quarter of police forces have just one or fewer women in their top ranks, figures showWild Justice is attempting to strangle game shooting industry with latest legal challenge, say campaignersWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/07/17/TELEMMGLPICT000201466623_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"debate should bbc scrap free tv licenses over 75s","story":"Senior citizens protest outside the BBC studios in London on June 21, 2019Free BBC licences will no longer be universally available to the over-75s, after the national broadcaster said it could no longer afford to take on the financial burden from the Government. From June next year, the entitlement will be restricted to recipients of pension credit.

After it was read, the two astronauts would be given a ceremony something like the burial at sea, but one entirely without precedent.Created with Sketch.

But over time it became public, after being revealed by the man who wrote it, and is now available for the public to read.It was prepared in the case that the astronauts and their moon lander failed to get back to the main craft that was floating around in the Moon\u0027s orbit ready to bring them home, and contained Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin\u0027s\u0026nbspcolleague Michael Collins.Everything you need to know about the Apollo 11 Moon landingIn that case, it was most likely that those pioneering explorers would not lose their lives in a single spectacular moment. Instead, they would most likely be stranded, stuck 250,000 miles from Earth with no way of getting back home.In the end, and despite some very anxious moments, the crew would explore the lunar surface and come back down safely. That meant that, instead of announcing their loss, Nixon could instead share in the astronaut\u0027s success.In one of the most famous moments of the mission, he spoke to them in a phone call that was beamed around the world. He recognised the triumph of their achievement, and wished them safety for their return.Hello, Neil and Buzz, he said during that phone call.\u0026nbspI\u0027m talking to you by telephone from the Oval Room at the White House.And this certainly has to be the most historic telephone call ever made. I just can\u0027t tell you how proud we all are of what you\u0027ve done. For every American, this has to be the proudest day of our lives. And for people all over the world, I am sure they too join with Americans in recognising what an immense feat this is. Because of what you have done, the heavens have become a part of man\u0027s world.And as you talk to us from the Sea of Tranquility, it inspires us to redouble our efforts to bring peace and tranquility to Earth. For one priceless moment in the whole history of man, all the people on this Earth are truly one: one in their pride in what you have done, and one in our prayers that you will return safely to Earth.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Together, these push the economy into recession, with asset prices and the pound falling sharply.The stress test is by no means a worst-case scenario under a no-deal Brexit, it added.\u0026nbspSpeaking at a meeting of G7 finance ministers in Chantilly, France, Chancellor Philip Hammond said: “The report that the OBR have published this morning shows that even in the most benign version of a no-deal exit there would be a very significant hit to the UK economy, a very significant reduction in tax revenues and a big increase in our national debt –\u0026nbspa recession caused by a no-deal Brexit.Created with Sketch.Tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit  Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.There will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersBut that most benign version is not the version that is being talked about by prominent Brexiteers. They are talking about a much harder version which would cause much more disruption to our economy. The OBR is clear that in that less benign version of no-deal, the hit would be much greater, the impact would be much harder, the recession would be bigger. So I greatly fear the impact on our economy and our public finances of the kind of no-deal Brexit that is realistically being discussed now.”Detailing the less drastic IMF scenario it examined, the OBR said the possible recession would start in the fourth quarter of 2019 and last a year.\u0026nbspGDP adjusted for inflation would decline by 2.1 per cent by late 2020, around the same as in the\u0026nbspearly-1990s\u0026nbspeconomic slump and about a third of the fall during\u0026nbspthe financial crisis.The effects of the recession would be long-lasting, with real GDP 4 per cent lower by the middle of 2021 compared with the\u0026nbspOBR\u0027s\u0026nbsplatest economic forecasts released in mid-March, before the last Brexit deadline. Despite a recovery, it would still be\u0026nbsp1.6 per cent smaller by early 2024.Government debt would rise relative to GDP over the next three years and the budget deficit would widen by around £30bn from 2020-21 onwards, the report said.The economy is heading towards the 31 October Brexit deadline already weakened.The latest data and surveys suggest the economy flatlined at best in the second quarter, the OBR said.\u0026nbspSome of this is likely to be a ‘pay-back’ after Brexit-related stock building in the first quarter. But surveys were particularly weak in June, suggesting that the pace of growth is likely to remain weak. This raises the risk that the economy may be entering a full-blown recession.Fears of a no-deal Brexit have risen in the last few days after the two contenders to become Britain\u0027s next prime minister promised to scrap the Irish backstop, deemed indispensable by the EU. Their comments on Tuesday sent the pound to its lowest level against the dollar in more than two years.Additional reporting by Andrew WoodcockOffice for Budget Responsibility\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Alternatives\u0026nbspmust scale up to meet demandClick to followThe IndependentEmma Back has spent three years developing her idea for the\u0026nbspsocial care platform the Equal Care Co-op (or eccoo) and growing the business to a size where it can attract major funding. But unlike other startups vying for the attention of venture capitalists, Back and her co-founders are raising money through community shares on Ethex, which calls itself an ethical crowdfunding platform, and shunning venture capital that would force them to grow as fast as possible to generate returns.“There’s definitely such a thing as having too much money,” Back says. Rather than raising money to employ salespeople, the Equal Care Co-op is raising money to train and employ people within communities to organise and manage care.\u0026nbsp“Other care platforms have massive advertising budgets, so instead of community relationships it’s all about customer conversion,” Back says. “It gives people a transactional perception of their work in the world. We’re not going to be employing salespeople, we will be employing carers and people who understand their community from the ground up. That will make us resilient, not sitting there with a VP of marketing for our community campaign.”Startups are increasingly looking for alternatives to venture capital funding that leads them to choose between selling up, going public\u0026nbspor going bust. Stefano Bernardi, a founder and investor working as an angel scout for Atomico, says there has been some experimentation in alternative models, but nowhere near the scale needed to meet demand from startups. \u0026nbspHow to protect your freedom in the stupid game of capitalismVenture capitalists invested more than £1.19bn in UK startups in the first three months of 2019, according to\u0026nbspKPMG. The money was invested across 161 deals, including £150m for iwoca, a financial technology company, and £58m for\u0026nbspGoCardless, a direct-debit payment company, to expand the company overseas. “Late stage” companies like these two find it much easier to attract investment because they are generally considered to be beyond their startup-phase and have a better-established business model.This means that entrepreneurs who want to grow a business fast and then exit at a profit have a harder time attracting early investment. It can put greater pressure on founders to squeeze margins at the expense of wages, company culture and even the vision that they set out with. The ultimate goal for many – just like Facebook,\u0026nbspUber\u0026nbspand Google before them – is to grow to a size that when they sell or go public, early investors cash out with huge profits.\u0026nbspBut if a company realises it does not have this kind of potential, it cannot back out of a venture capital deal,\u0026nbspBernardi\u0026nbspsays: “If they find that they have a good business but not monopoly-like, they can either close shop or try to scale anyway and then go bust. Not really a great situation.”In June 2018, Guy Singh-Watson, the founder of vegetable box producer Riverford,\u0026nbspsold 74\u0026nbspper cent of his company to employees. The transition\u0026nbspmeans that idends will be\u0026nbsppassed on to staff rather than to external shareholders, giving them an incentive to make the company more productive.\u0026nbspBut it also makes Riverford practically impossible to sell, because it has so many owners – a fact that many young entrepreneurs, eager for venture capitalist funding to grow fast and then cash out, might find shocking.“When I go to London to meet the bright young food brands of the future, before they have even sold their first smoothie or whatever, they are thinking about how they will exit,” Singh-Watson says. “It makes me really depressed and angry. They are just going to build it and sell it. When I started my business, I did it because I wanted to make something worthwhile.”Lisa Ashford, chief executive of\u0026nbspEthex, says younger founders, in particular, are interested in doing business differently. “They want to access capital that can support them in their mission and many of them are shunning the traditional models of raising finance in favour of models where everyone benefits,” Ashford says.Ethex works with organisations that have a social mission. The platform gives them access to 15,000 investors and several investment structures including ISAs, charity bonds and equity. Ashford says: “Venture capital funding can often be about financial performance and short term returns and exit strategies, sometimes to the detriment of the other impact aspirations of an organisation. That’s not what our investors are about.”In the US, Indie.vc is offering startups a route to profitability without venture capital funding. The platform gives entrepreneurs access to revenue-based loans with the option to start buying back shares out of a percentage of their monthly sales after one to three years. Bryce Roberts\u0026nbspsaid that when he founded Indie.vc three years ago, it received two or three applications a week, mostly from venture capital rejects. Now it can get as many as 10 applications a week from companies that have decided not to go down the venture capital route.\u0026nbspRobots are taking over farming faster than expected“We think there is going to be a tsunami of entrepreneurs who have experienced the one-size-fits-all venture model and want to cherry-pick the pieces of it that work for them,” Roberts said in an\u0026nbspinterview\u0026nbspwith\u0026nbspThe New York Times.Forty per cent of millennial consumers polled by Deloitte in 2018 said the goal of business should be to “improve society”. Singh-Watson believes that it’s going to take businesses embracing alternatives to put a stop to the overconsumption associated with capitalism.“Capitalism is destroying our world,” he says. “It’s 25 years since I did my first conference on corporate social responsibility and I don’t think much has happened since. We need something different and we need it fast.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Together, these push the economy into recession, with asset prices and the pound falling sharply.The stress test is by no means a worst-case scenario under a no-deal Brexit, it added.\u0026nbspSpeaking at a meeting of G7 finance ministers in Chantilly, France, Chancellor Philip Hammond said: “The report that the OBR have published this morning shows that even in the most benign version of a no-deal exit there would be a very significant hit to the UK economy, a very significant reduction in tax revenues and a big increase in our national debt –\u0026nbspa recession caused by a no-deal Brexit.Created with Sketch.Tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit  Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.There will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersBut that most benign version is not the version that is being talked about by prominent Brexiteers. They are talking about a much harder version which would cause much more disruption to our economy. The OBR is clear that in that less benign version of no-deal, the hit would be much greater, the impact would be much harder, the recession would be bigger. So I greatly fear the impact on our economy and our public finances of the kind of no-deal Brexit that is realistically being discussed now.”Detailing the less drastic IMF scenario it examined, the OBR said the possible recession would start in the fourth quarter of 2019 and last a year.\u0026nbspGDP adjusted for inflation would decline by 2.1 per cent by late 2020, around the same as in the\u0026nbspearly-1990s\u0026nbspeconomic slump and about a third of the fall during\u0026nbspthe financial crisis.The effects of the recession would be long-lasting, with real GDP 4 per cent lower by the middle of 2021 compared with the\u0026nbspOBR\u0027s\u0026nbsplatest economic forecasts released in mid-March, before the last Brexit deadline. Despite a recovery, it would still be\u0026nbsp1.6 per cent smaller by early 2024.Government debt would rise relative to GDP over the next three years and the budget deficit would widen by around £30bn from 2020-21 onwards, the report said.The economy is heading towards the 31 October Brexit deadline already weakened.The latest data and surveys suggest the economy flatlined at best in the second quarter, the OBR said.\u0026nbspSome of this is likely to be a ‘pay-back’ after Brexit-related stock building in the first quarter. But surveys were particularly weak in June, suggesting that the pace of growth is likely to remain weak. This raises the risk that the economy may be entering a full-blown recession.Fears of a no-deal Brexit have risen in the last few days after the two contenders to become Britain\u0027s next prime minister promised to scrap the Irish backstop, deemed indispensable by the EU. Their comments on Tuesday sent the pound to its lowest level against the dollar in more than two years.Additional reporting by Andrew WoodcockOffice for Budget Responsibility\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special. The heist here, led by a mysterious man known only as The Professor, involves breaking into the Royal Mint of Spain and printing off €2.4 billion. There are even more twists in the show’s 15 episodes than there are hostages. 220 American Vandal (TV series, two seasons, 2017–2018)Part satire of true crime documentaries such as Making a Murderer, part carefully observed portrayal of teenage life, American Vandal was criminally underappreciated during its two season run. It’s been cancelled now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email.320 One Day at a Time (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)In stark contrast to the off-beat, low-key comedy that currently rules TV – the kind that provokes a wry smirk rather than a hearty laugh – One Day at a Time is a big, bright sitcom filmed in front of an interminably enthusiastic studio audience. You wouldn’t have thought that the story of a Cuban-American army veteran  nurse  single mother – who suffers from PTSD and depression – would fit into this format, but it does so beautifully, tackling issues of sexuality, racism and sexism in the process.  Based on writer  director Tamara Jenkins’s own fertility struggles, Private Life stars Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti (both giving brilliant performances) as a spiky, loving middle-aged couple desperate to have a baby. They even rope their enthusiastic but irresponsible niece Sadie (Kayli Carter) into the mix, much to the horror of Sadie’s mother (Molly Shannon, turning a potentially repellent character into one worthy of empathy). It’s subtle, restrained and beautifully realised.520 Big Mouth (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Crude, rude, and rife with surprise emissions and bodily functions, animated sitcom Big Mouth is also a sensitive, nuanced deep e into the various horrors of teenagehood. When 12-year-old Andrew Glouberman (John Mulaney) is visited by the hormone monster (Nick Kroll, who voices many of the show’s best characters), he finds his life irreversibly – and seemingly disastrously – changed. Unlike many other puberty-centred comedies, Big Mouth makes as much time for its confused female protagonists as its male ones Maya Rudolph is a delight as the female hormone monster, and look out for Kristen Wiig’s wonderful turn as a talking vagina.  620 Easy (TV series, two seasons, 2016–)Joe Swanberg’s style of defiantly undramatic mumblecore isn’t for everyone, but if you enjoyed his earlier films, Drinking Buddies and Happy Christmas, you’ll find plenty to admire in this anthology comedy-drama series. Big-name stars such as Orlando Bloom and Aubrey Plaza crop up, but Jane Adams – who you might remember from Todd Solondz’s chronically depressing 1998 film Happiness – is the show’s heart, and Marc Maron is its jaded soul.Community’s Gillian Jacobs is brilliant as the prickly, magnetic recovering addict Mickey, who forms an unlikely – and arguably deeply unwise – relationship with her nerdy neighbour Gus (Paul Rust). Despite Gus’s pathological need to be the nice guy, we’re never quite sure who or what we’re rooting for – which is what makes Love such complex, compelling viewing.  In 2016, comedian Patton Oswalt’s wife, the true crime writer Michelle McNamara, died suddenly in her sleep. That subject matter doesn’t exactly scream “stand-up special”, but out of his devastating loss, Oswalt managed to craft something funny and profound. Over the course of an hour, he processes his grief onstage, managing to find humour in the struggle to raise his grieving six-year-old daughter alone.920 Santa Clarita Diet (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Granted, this horror-comedy – which stars Drew Barrymore as a neurotic real estate agent who suddenly develops a taste for human flesh – is really silly, and really, really disgusting. But it’s also strangely charming, and funny. Timothy Olyphant is excellent as Sheila’s frazzled husband Joel, and the pair’s idiosyncratic but respectful relationship with their smart teenage daughter Abby (Liv Hewson) isn’t quite like anything else on TV right now.1020 Dark Tourist (TV series, one season, 2018–)New Zealand journalist David Farrier is an unlikely TV presenter in the same way that Louis Theroux is – in just about every scenario in which he finds himself, he’s a little bit awkward. But as with Theroux, Farrier’s weakness is actually his strength, allowing him to endear himself to the many unusual people he meets on his journey through the world’s most questionable tourist destinations. Farrier’s stops include the site of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the road where JFK was assassinated, and the Milwaukee suburbs where serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer murdered his victims.1120 Sacred Games (TV series, one season, 2018–)Based on Vikram Chandra’s epic 2006 novel, Netflix’s first Indian original series is a slowly unfolding gem. The first season of Sacred Games – which follows a troubled police officer (Saif Ali Khan) who has 25 days to save his city thanks to a tip-off from a presumed dead gangster – only covered one quarter of Chandra’s 1,000-page novel. As the show itself declared when it announced the forthcoming second season, “the worst is yet to come”.When the trailer for Dumplin’ first landed, it seemed all the ingredients were in place for a film that was at worst tone-deaf, and at best vaguely patronising. Thank heavens, then, that the trailer did Dumplin’ such a disservice. Starring Danielle Macdonald (who broke out in the excellent 2017 film Patti Cake$) as Willowdean, a self-described “fat girl” who enters a local pageant to annoy her former beauty queen mother (Jennifer Aniston), Dumplin’ is as funny, warm and sensitive as its protagonist – and with a killer Dolly Parton-laden soundtrack to boot.1320 Dark (TV series, one season, 2017–)This sci-fi thriller – which features disappearing children, a mysterious local power plant, and scenes set in the Eighties – has, for obvious reasons, drawn comparisons to Stranger Things. But Dark is even more beguiling and (true to its name) less family-friendly than Stranger Things.1420 The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson (Film, 2017)Though it’s been somewhat tarnished by claims that director David France appropriated the work and research of trans film-maker Reina Gossett, this documentary is nonetheless a loving, respectful tribute to gay rights activist Marsha P Johnson. One of the key figures in the Stonewall uprising (though her involvement was almost entirely eradicated in 2015’s critically hated Stonewall), Johnson modelled for Andy Warhol, performed onstage with drag group Hot Peaches, helped found the Gay Liberation Front, and then died under suspicious circumstances in 1992.1520 On My Block (TV series, one season, 2018–)This coming-of-age series might not have found as many eyeballs as it deserved last year, but those it did find were glued to the screen. In fact, it was the most-binged show of 2018 – meaning that it had the highest watch-time-per-viewing session of any Netflix original. Created by Awkward’s Lauren Iungerich, On My Block follows a group of Los Angeles teens as they navigate both the drama of high school and the danger of inner-city life.Two beleaguered assistants (Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell) conspire to get their over-demanding bosses (Taye Diggs and Lucy Liu) together in order to get their lives back in this winning romantic comedy. Set It Up is responsible not only for coining the term “over-dicking” (it’s much more innocent than it sounds), but for rejuvenating a tired genre.Martin Freeman stars as the father struggling to protect his young daughter from a zombie epidemic spreading across Australia. So far, so overdone. But this drama thriller, directed by Ben Howling and Yolanda Ramke and based on their 2013 short of the same name, throws a handful of unpredictable ners in the works.    1920 Godless (TV series, one season, 2017–)With shades of John Ford\u0027s The Searchers, this languorous western was critically acclaimed but swiftly forgotten after it landed on Netflix in 2016. Set in 1884, it\u0027s about Frank Griffin (Jeff Daniels) and his notoriously ruthless gang of outlaws’ pursuit of their injured former ally Roy Goode (Jack O’Connell), who is hiding out in a small town populated solely by women after a mining accident killed off all its men. A gun-toting Michelle Dockery, clearly relishing the change of scenery after years of Downton Abbey, and a taciturn Jack O’Connell, are on brilliant form.2020 Atypical (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)This coming-of-age series about a teenage boy with autism was sweet and well-intentioned from the start, but its first season was criticised for a handful of inaccuracies, and for its lack of autistic actors. Rather than drowning in a sea of defensiveness – as too many shows tend to do – it listened, and brought in autistic actors and writers for its excellent second season.120 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017–)Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix’s most streamed non-English language show. The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special.

A gun-toting Michelle Dockery, clearly relishing the change of scenery after years of Downton Abbey, and a taciturn Jack O’Connell, are on brilliant form.2020 Atypical (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)This coming-of-age series about a teenage boy with autism was sweet and well-intentioned from the start, but its first season was criticised for a handful of inaccuracies, and for its lack of autistic actors. Rather than drowning in a sea of defensiveness – as too many shows tend to do – it listened, and brought in autistic actors and writers for its excellent second season.Netflix blamed the drop-off in growth on price rises in the US where\u0026nbspconsumers had to stomach price hikes of between 13 per cent and 18 per cent, depending on which package they have, with the most popular plan now $13 per month.Disney plans to offer its new service, Disney Plus, for just $7 and has deep pockets to fund its expansion.Netflix is banking on a number of hit shows to be released in the second half of 2019 – most notably series three of the immensely popular Stranger Things – to lure more customers.Chief executive Reed Hastings was sanguine about the results. “Sometimes we forecast low, sometimes we forecast high—this is one where we forecasted high,” he said in the company’s video earnings interview. He said it was “easy to over-interpret” the significance of quarterly membership numbers.By traditional measures of company performance Netflix is still growing fast. Price rises helped boost revenue by 26 per cent compared to the same quarter last year while profits exceeded expectations at £709m.Mihir Haria-Shah, head of broadcast at media planning agency Total Media said: “Netflix’s head start means it remains in reasonable health whilst the new services such as Disney Plus get over any early teething issues.\u0026nbsp“The bigger concern for Netflix is what happens further down the line once these new entrants have established themselves. It has essentially built its business on the back of leasing content from other companies and has had great success doing so.\u0026nbsp“Now its content providers are becoming competitors it will have to invest even more into original content as existing deals expire and content is taken off the platform.”\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Instagram unfortunately doesn’t let you tinker with filters and effects, but you can change your original caption, tag people and update the location.  But Instagram seems unlikely to reverse its decision and may even roll it out to even more locations.\u0026nbspWho is affected and why did Instagram do it?Instagram first began trialling the feature in Canada earlier this year, saying it wanted people to worry a little bit less about how many likes they\u0027re getting.The trial has now extended to Australia, Brazil, Ireland, Italy, Japan and New Zealand, meaning all users in those countries will no longer be able to see the number of likes and video views a post receives.Senator accuses Facebook of ‘flagrant displays of bulls***\u0027We want your friends to focus on the photos and videos you share, not how many likes they get, Instagram wrote in a post.The move comes in response to various studies that have found a link between mental health issues and the pressures brought about by social media use.Can you still find out who liked a post?Instagram says the feature is mandatory for all account holders in the seven countries, but even those users will have ways of seeing who likes their own posts.The firm explained: You can still see your own likes by tapping on the list of people who\u0027ve liked it, but your friends will not be able to see how many likes your post has received.arttributed to use of their platforms (Getty Images)If you are not in one of the affected countries, then it is still possible to see the number of likes posts receive from users within those countries.Also, Instagram says it does not mean the era of influencers is over, nor that brands and companies should worry about customer engagement.For businesses and creators on Instagram, this test will not affect measurement tools like Insights or Ads Manager, a spokesperson said.Will the feature spread to other countries?Key markets for Instagram, like the UK and US, remain unaffected but the spread may appear ominous to users in these countries.Despite the trial extending beyond Canada to six other countries, Instagram refuses to confirm the feature is permanent or that it will roll out further.Instead, Instagram said hiding the likes and video views\u0026nbspis a temporary trial and that it will seek feedback before making any further decisions.​Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The move follows several studies that appeared to link social media pressures with mental health issues.Instagram unveils new anti-bullying feature to discourage trolls“We want Instagram to be a place where people feel comfortable expressing themselves,” said Mia Garlick, Facebook’s head of policy in Australia and New Zealand.“We hope this test will remove the pressure of how many likes a post will receive, so you can focus on sharing the things you love.”Not all users are happy with the move, with many taking to social media to complain about how it could affect the income opportunities of influencers.“What about the people using it for income?” one user wrote on Twitter. “The people who work hard creating content, to then have their hard work not praisednot shown how successful it was to others?”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Michael has thrown a huge curveball Amber’s way, which is conveniently timed with the arrival of new islander Greg, while Chris is scaling the sidelines just to see which girl filters through to him. Bless.It certainly seems like fan favourite\u0026nbspOvie\u0026nbspmight have finally found someone who’s actually interested in him, though, which is good news for viewers considering another couple are days away\u0026nbspfrom leaving the villa.Below are the four biggest talking points from the latest episode.1. Michael comes clean to AmberSo, just days after he somewhat angrily told Amber he wasn’t interested in her, he’s now done a huge 180 and is apparently very much into her. Tonight’s episode saw him take Amber to one side and explain his feelings, but she wasn’t so sure – and for good reason. She reminds Michael that he was very much interested in someone else (Joanna) just days ago, but Michael – ever the snake – swiftly rewrites history and wants to know which girl she’s “specifically” referring to.\u0026nbspIt seems\u0026nbspthe £50,000 prize fund is weighing very heavily on his mind.\u0026nbsp .\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

After correcting him when he said he looked younger than his 28 years, she confirmed it was his wrinkles which were aging him. She would go on to diss his sunglasses before ditching him for Anton during the next coupling.Sensitive boxer Tommy has been vocal about his love for Miley Cyrus’ teen sitcom since day one. His fandom reached new heights when he serenaded Curtis with a rendition of her hit song ‘The Climb’ to illustrate his path to winning Lucie’s heart. Aww.Blonde surfer Lucie was an instant hit in the villa, with almost every boy trying a cheeky graft. She seemed torn between Tommy and Joe, who each went nuclear in their attempt to woo her. Tommy pledged that he would crawl to the moon and back for her after knowing her for around 24 hours. Despite this, Joe’s jealous moping eventually won out. The confident Scotsman’s seduction skills manage to be both slippery smooth yet wildly erratic. His mile-a-minute chat has failed to land with any of the Love Island ladies, leading his to receive a cold shoulder from from Lucie, Anna and Mollie Mae. The raunchy challenge saw the boys strip down to chaps and speedos before hopping on a bucking bronco and getting covered in paint splatter. Performances ranged from smooth (Michael and Sherif) to deeply awkward (Callum and Joe).Amy had a minor wobble when newcomer Mollie Mae picked her man Curtis to join her for a date in the hot tub. She shouldn’t have worried: Curtis firmly friendzoned Mollie Mae and settled in for a gossip about his fellow housemates instead.Anton seemed confident at the first recoupling that pharmacist Anna would choose him. His confident smile on hearing Anna compliment her mystery love’s body quickly turned into disappointment when he realised she had been talking about Sherif.1062 Calum leaves the villaThe aircraft engineer barely seemed to grace our screens before he was ejected after Mollie Mae chose to couple up with Tommy. 1162 Tommy makes his first cup of tea Tommy shocked the nation when he revealed he didn’t know how to make a cup of peppermint tea. With a lot of coaching from Sherif, the boxer managed to impress Mollie Mae without her realising the truth.1262 Tommy convinces himself he made an omeletteEncouraged by his success, Tommy tried to step up his culinary game by impressing Mollie Mae with a breakfast omelette (with Curtis doing the actual cooking.) Tommy even seemed to convince himself that he cooked the omelette, although he was rumbled after Sherif let slip who really made it.1362 Yewande’s quest for love Gorgeous scientist Yewande had been unlucky in love in the villa – until she was picked for a date by newcomer Danny. The rest of the Islanders encouraged her fledgling romance, from putting in a good word with Danny to criticising Mollie Mae’s attempt to woo the new boy for herself. Nine days into the series Love Island bosses confirmed that Sherif had been suddenly ejected from the show after “breaking the villa rules.” The 20-year-old confirmed his departure was due to his “poor judgement”, but it remains unknown which rule he broke. 1562 Curtis and Amy become a half-couple Amy may have never had a boyfriend before, but she was the first girl to make it official in the villa – sort of. During a date in the hideaway, Curtis asked her to become exclusive, which ended up with her getting the very high school label of ‘half-girlfriend.’1662 Amber opens up Amber gained a reputation for withering looks and cutting putdowns, but one man was able to get past her icy exterior. Firefighter Michael proved he could take her self-proclaimed a attitude, and was rewarded – on the second try – with a kiss.With Sherif out the villa, Anton resumed his moves on Anna. This time, it went even worse than before, with the Scotsman inadvertently comparing her with Mollie Mae, calling Anna beautiful ‘on the inside’. He thought the chat went well a dressing down from Amber and Michael soon put him in his place. Tommy was tasked with making a starter for his date with new girl Maura. “I’ve never put so much effort into cheese in my life,” he said, as he carved out lovehearts from limp sliced cheddar. The result, two slices of ketchup and mayo-smeared white bread, proved that Maura’s continuing lust for the 20-year-old boxer is made of powerful stuff. 1962 The girls freak out over Maura and Elma Amber, Yewande and Mollie Mae watched their respective partners meet the new girls from the balcony. “Confident sh*ts,” fumed Amber, while Mollie made fun of their flirty laughter.Michael brands Amber\u0027s behaviour as childish after the beauty therapist heckled his date with Maura.2162 Tommy and Mollie Mae fightMollie Mae wasn\u0027t happy when Tommy seemed interested in new girl Maura, and wasn\u0027t afraid to let the boxer know how she felt.2262 Amy and Lucie fall outLucie tearfully stood up for herself after Amy accused her of not spending enough time with the girls. Is Lucie just not a girl’s girl, or did Amy drive her away?2362 Maura gets a rise out of TommyMaura had her sights set on the 20-year-old boxer from the start, and things got steamy when she got him into bed. Her straight-up seduction techniques proved a bit too exciting for Tommy, who got a little hot and bothered under the covers. Just wait until he sees her eat an ice lolly…Maura went full factor 50 on Tommy when she ambushed him on the sofa. Tommy put his boxing training into practice as he dodged her kisses, while a jealous Mollie Mae watched on from behind a potted plant.2562 Jordan and Tom enter the villaAfter being the only two girls not picked for recoupling, Anna and Maura got to go on a date with the new boys: 29-year-old Tom and 24-year-old Jordan.2662 Joe and Elma leave the villaThe islanders voted for the couple they thought was least compatible, leaving the Joe-Lucie and Anton-Elma couples vulnerable.

Amy was not happy, storming off followed by an apologetic Curtis.Arabella stirred the pot when she accused Yewande of being overly-possessive of Danny, telling her a few uncomplimentary remarks Danny had made about her to boot. A devastated Yewande soon realised that her fledgling romance was in serious jeopardy.3262 Maura is livid at TomMaura’s carrot-swallowing skills won her first place during the gym bunny challenge, giving her a night in the hideaway as a prize. Maura chose Tom to join her, but things quickly went south after she overheard him brag to the boys about finding out whether or not the Irish beauty was “all mouth.” Tom got a scathing dressing down, and a night in the hideaway was firmly off the cards.3362 Yewande leaves the islandDanny chose Arabella during a recoupling, leaving Yewande as the eliminated singleton. She was devastated to leave best mates Amber and Anna, but Danny was left with a scathing parting shot: “What goes around comes around.” Ouch.3462 Danny faces the wrath of AmberAmber was furious after watching Danny kiss Arabella the same night that Yewande left the villa. She had some choice words for the model, although Danny stayed calm and collected during the confrontation.3562 Curtis and Tommy share an intimate momentAfter declaring how much their friendship meant to each other, Tommy and Curtis shared the season’s first bromance kiss. Perhaps if they ditched their girlfriends, Turtis could go all the way to the £50k?During a challenge which saw the islanders read the public’s tweets, some couples were left seriously shaken.

A disgruntled Lucie complained about the new “rules” imposed on her, while also refusing to rule out a potential relationship with Tommy during a chat with the girls.Maura wasn’t happy to hear that Tom had called her “attention-seeking” and “cringey” behind her back. She stormed over and confronted him, later making it clear he had blown his second chance.3962 Arabella and Tom get dumped from the islandAfter four couples were left vulnerable following a public vote, the three safe couples decided that Arabella and Tom should be the pair to leave the villa. Maura comforted a devastated Danny, but didn’t appear to be that heartbroken about losing Tom.4062 Lucie confesses her feelings for Tommy Encouraged by Anton, Lucie revealed to Tommy that she would be interested in rekindling their romance. Tommy told her he was happy with Mollie Mae, and later told Mollie about Lucie’s confession, leading Mollie to brand the Cornish surfer “muggy” for not coming to her first.4162 The girls take a holiday to Casa AmorSix new boys entered the game when the girls took a trip to Casa Amor. A thrilled Maura took an instant liking to Dennon, while 6ft 7in basketball player Ovie immediately cracked on with Anna, leaving her relationship with Jordan in jeopardy. 4262 Six new girls cause the boys to have doubtsBack at the villa, heads were also turning at the arrival of six new girls. Jordan flirted with Jourdan, Anton shared a bed with Belle and Danny seemed ready to move on from his Arabella heartbreak. Michael and Curtis began to question their own seemingly-solid partnerships, thanks to pretty newcomer Joanna. Anton remained hopeful about his odds of finally finding love: “I’ve got six new chances to not get pied.”4362 Curtis tells Jourdan he wants to recouple with herCurtis took a risk and laid it all out to Jourdan, telling her he would choose to recouple with her over Amy.

Michael recoupled with Joanna, leaving Amber single – and absolutely fuming. Poor Jordan saw Anna return with basketball player Ovie, although she was more apologetic about it than Michael. Mollie Mae collapsed into relieved tears when she saw Tommy waiting for her, holding her favourite stuffed elephant toy Ellie-Belly. Anton finally found himself in a romantic couple with Belle, Lucie coupled with new blonde bombshell George and Maura seemed keen on sensitive Marvin.4862 Michael and Curtis catch some serious heatAfter seeing Amber in tears, Anna went straight for Michael’s jugular, accusing him of leading Amber on by not communicating his doubts about their relationship earlier. Michael went on the defensive, calling Anna and Amber “childish.” Meanwhile a tearful Amy gave Curtis a dressing down for making moves on Jourdan: “Do you know how worthless this makes me feel?”4962 Maura serves some cold, hard truthWhile Amy was discussing her drama with Curtis to Maura and Lucie, she seemed on the verge of forgiveness: “I love him,” she said. A doubtful Lucie interjected: “But does he love you?” A furious Maura took a less subtle approach: “Why are you asking her that? He doesn’t!” 5062 Lucie tells Tommy she has feelings for him – againAfter Tommy took Lucie aside to check they were still friends, she confessed she’s still attracted to him, wishes she had chosen him over Joe and was thinking about him the whole time she was in Casa Amor. Once again, Tommy brushed her off saying he was still smitten with Mollie Mae – perhaps third time lucky, Lucie?5162 Tommy and Mollie Mae get seriousAfter the latest declaration from Lucie, Tommy reassured Mollie Mae by telling her how much he liked her. Mollie Mae confessed she could see herself falling in love with him, before Tommy admitted he was already falling.5262 Anna and Jordan rekindle their romanceWhen Anna returned to the villa and saw Jordan was still single, she seemed to question her new romance with Ovie.

George and Marvin were sat down and pied together, with Marvin reacting with outrage and George barely keeping a straight face. Ovie may have seemed like her perfect man in Casa Amor, but Jordan caught Anna’s eye once again when she returned to the villa. Anna sat down for a chat with the laid-back basketball player, but things got heated quickly. Ovie stormed off before Anna headed up for a sneaky balcony snog with Jordan. 5762 Tommy pulls off the perfect proposalTommy decided it was time to ask Mollie Mae to be his girlfriend. As with cooking, writing isn’t Tommy’s strong point, so he enlisted Curtis to write him a love note in eyeliner (who knew there were no pens in the villa?) Mollie Mae found the note tied to her toy Elly Belly, and happily agreed to making things official with Tommy.Not long after Danny coupled up with Yewande and Arabella the two girls were sent packing, leading presenter Iain Sterling to nickname Danny ‘the travel agent’ for his talent in sending girls to the airport. New partner Jourdan was the final girl to fall under Danny’s curse as the pair received the least votes, although this time Danny was booted from the villa too.5962 Amy leaves on heartbreaking noteAs she prepared to leave the villa, Amy took her ex Curtis aside for a chat. Days after Curtis had ended their relationship, she told him: You turned my whole world around and turned it into some kind of craziness. All I\u0027ve ever wanted is for you to be happy. And you\u0027re not going to be able to be happy if I\u0027m still here. As Curtis broke down in tears, she continued: I want us to be best friends and I want us to both find someone... I\u0027m not going to be ready in the next three weeks to meet someone else.He might be coupled up with Joanna, but it was Michael’s ex Amber who got his pulse racing fastest during the dirty dancing challenge. Amber was glad to hear it, saying: “So now I\u0027ve at least got something, I can\u0027t just sit and mope around because I know I raised his heart rate the most!6162 Anton and Belle hit the rocksShe may have shaved his bum, but Belle reached breaking point after a series of slip-ups from Anton. She wasn’t happy that he kissed Anna in the Snog, Marry, Pie challenge, and a confrontation ended in a heated exchange at the nightclub6262 Joanna and Michael say an awkward goodbyeAfter it was revealed that Joanna and Michael couldn’t stay in the villa together, their fellow Islanders chose to send Joanna packing. She was less than impressed with Michael after it became clear he wouldn’t follow her out of the door, refusing a hug and labelling him a “snake” for staying. 162 Love Island\u0027s Ovie kisses new girl IndiaLove Island\u0027s Ovie kisses new girl India on the terrace after stealing her from Chris in last nights show.262 Lucie trying - and failing - to make ‘bev’ happenLove Island is known for adding new slang to the British lexicon, but 21-year-old Lucie’s firm insistence that ‘bev’ means a hot man failed to catch on.362 Amber’s anti-chemistry with Callum Straight-talking Amber quickly made mincemeat of Callum, the first boy she coupled up with. After correcting him when he said he looked younger than his 28 years, she confirmed it was his wrinkles which were aging him. She would go on to diss his sunglasses before ditching him for Anton during the next coupling.Sensitive boxer Tommy has been vocal about his love for Miley Cyrus’ teen sitcom since day one. His fandom reached new heights when he serenaded Curtis with a rendition of her hit song ‘The Climb’ to illustrate his path to winning Lucie’s heart. Aww.Blonde surfer Lucie was an instant hit in the villa, with almost every boy trying a cheeky graft. She seemed torn between Tommy and Joe, who each went nuclear in their attempt to woo her. Tommy pledged that he would crawl to the moon and back for her after knowing her for around 24 hours. Despite this, Joe’s jealous moping eventually won out. The confident Scotsman’s seduction skills manage to be both slippery smooth yet wildly erratic. His mile-a-minute chat has failed to land with any of the Love Island ladies, leading his to receive a cold shoulder from from Lucie, Anna and Mollie Mae. The raunchy challenge saw the boys strip down to chaps and speedos before hopping on a bucking bronco and getting covered in paint splatter. Performances ranged from smooth (Michael and Sherif) to deeply awkward (Callum and Joe).Amy had a minor wobble when newcomer Mollie Mae picked her man Curtis to join her for a date in the hot tub. She shouldn’t have worried: Curtis firmly friendzoned Mollie Mae and settled in for a gossip about his fellow housemates instead.Anton seemed confident at the first recoupling that pharmacist Anna would choose him.

She was less than impressed with Michael after it became clear he wouldn’t follow her out of the door, refusing a hug and labelling him a “snake” for staying. New arrival Greg has a theory about Michael’s change of heart. He tells Amber he thinks it’s extremely “convenient” that Michael suddenly wants Amber back – just as she begins to show interest in somebody else (himself). The Irish contestant’s fans – namely Maura, Anna and Bell – agree, but Amber, whether she’s convinced by his point or not, makes it clear her mind is not made up. It seems she still has feelings for Michael, even if she’s sad Greg didn’t kiss her during the latest challenge. After weeks of dram for the Liverpudlian, Amber’s holding\u0026nbspall the cards.3. Ovie’s finally cooking up a stormIt’s taken a few weeks for the girls in the villa to pick up on the fact that Ovie is quite clearly the best Love Island 2019 prospect. It’s India who’s reaping the rewards, much to the upset of Chris – very much the David to Ovie’s\u0026nbspGoliath (”..but David did win,” Chris wittily points out at one stage). Not that Ovie’s chats with India are that sizzling. At one point, she asks him\u0026nbspif he believes in love at first sight, to which\u0026nbspOvie\u0026nbsp– who has seen India many times by now – replies: “I dunno, but you can make me a believer.” The fact he can still remain cool despite dishing\u0026nbspoutthis\u0026nbspkind of awkward wisdom says a lot.With the fate of several islanders up in the air, Maura gets a well-timed\u0026nbsptext informing everybody that a recoupling is about to take place.

The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special. The heist here, led by a mysterious man known only as The Professor, involves breaking into the Royal Mint of Spain and printing off €2.4 billion. There are even more twists in the show’s 15 episodes than there are hostages. 220 American Vandal (TV series, two seasons, 2017–2018)Part satire of true crime documentaries such as Making a Murderer, part carefully observed portrayal of teenage life, American Vandal was criminally underappreciated during its two season run. It’s been cancelled now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email.320 One Day at a Time (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)In stark contrast to the off-beat, low-key comedy that currently rules TV – the kind that provokes a wry smirk rather than a hearty laugh – One Day at a Time is a big, bright sitcom filmed in front of an interminably enthusiastic studio audience. You wouldn’t have thought that the story of a Cuban-American army veteran  nurse  single mother – who suffers from PTSD and depression – would fit into this format, but it does so beautifully, tackling issues of sexuality, racism and sexism in the process.  Based on writer  director Tamara Jenkins’s own fertility struggles, Private Life stars Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti (both giving brilliant performances) as a spiky, loving middle-aged couple desperate to have a baby. They even rope their enthusiastic but irresponsible niece Sadie (Kayli Carter) into the mix, much to the horror of Sadie’s mother (Molly Shannon, turning a potentially repellent character into one worthy of empathy). It’s subtle, restrained and beautifully realised.520 Big Mouth (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Crude, rude, and rife with surprise emissions and bodily functions, animated sitcom Big Mouth is also a sensitive, nuanced deep e into the various horrors of teenagehood. When 12-year-old Andrew Glouberman (John Mulaney) is visited by the hormone monster (Nick Kroll, who voices many of the show’s best characters), he finds his life irreversibly – and seemingly disastrously – changed. Unlike many other puberty-centred comedies, Big Mouth makes as much time for its confused female protagonists as its male ones Maya Rudolph is a delight as the female hormone monster, and look out for Kristen Wiig’s wonderful turn as a talking vagina.  620 Easy (TV series, two seasons, 2016–)Joe Swanberg’s style of defiantly undramatic mumblecore isn’t for everyone, but if you enjoyed his earlier films, Drinking Buddies and Happy Christmas, you’ll find plenty to admire in this anthology comedy-drama series. Big-name stars such as Orlando Bloom and Aubrey Plaza crop up, but Jane Adams – who you might remember from Todd Solondz’s chronically depressing 1998 film Happiness – is the show’s heart, and Marc Maron is its jaded soul.Community’s Gillian Jacobs is brilliant as the prickly, magnetic recovering addict Mickey, who forms an unlikely – and arguably deeply unwise – relationship with her nerdy neighbour Gus (Paul Rust). Despite Gus’s pathological need to be the nice guy, we’re never quite sure who or what we’re rooting for – which is what makes Love such complex, compelling viewing.  In 2016, comedian Patton Oswalt’s wife, the true crime writer Michelle McNamara, died suddenly in her sleep. That subject matter doesn’t exactly scream “stand-up special”, but out of his devastating loss, Oswalt managed to craft something funny and profound. Over the course of an hour, he processes his grief onstage, managing to find humour in the struggle to raise his grieving six-year-old daughter alone.920 Santa Clarita Diet (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Granted, this horror-comedy – which stars Drew Barrymore as a neurotic real estate agent who suddenly develops a taste for human flesh – is really silly, and really, really disgusting. But it’s also strangely charming, and funny. Timothy Olyphant is excellent as Sheila’s frazzled husband Joel, and the pair’s idiosyncratic but respectful relationship with their smart teenage daughter Abby (Liv Hewson) isn’t quite like anything else on TV right now.1020 Dark Tourist (TV series, one season, 2018–)New Zealand journalist David Farrier is an unlikely TV presenter in the same way that Louis Theroux is – in just about every scenario in which he finds himself, he’s a little bit awkward. But as with Theroux, Farrier’s weakness is actually his strength, allowing him to endear himself to the many unusual people he meets on his journey through the world’s most questionable tourist destinations. Farrier’s stops include the site of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the road where JFK was assassinated, and the Milwaukee suburbs where serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer murdered his victims.1120 Sacred Games (TV series, one season, 2018–)Based on Vikram Chandra’s epic 2006 novel, Netflix’s first Indian original series is a slowly unfolding gem. The first season of Sacred Games – which follows a troubled police officer (Saif Ali Khan) who has 25 days to save his city thanks to a tip-off from a presumed dead gangster – only covered one quarter of Chandra’s 1,000-page novel. As the show itself declared when it announced the forthcoming second season, “the worst is yet to come”.When the trailer for Dumplin’ first landed, it seemed all the ingredients were in place for a film that was at worst tone-deaf, and at best vaguely patronising. Thank heavens, then, that the trailer did Dumplin’ such a disservice. Starring Danielle Macdonald (who broke out in the excellent 2017 film Patti Cake$) as Willowdean, a self-described “fat girl” who enters a local pageant to annoy her former beauty queen mother (Jennifer Aniston), Dumplin’ is as funny, warm and sensitive as its protagonist – and with a killer Dolly Parton-laden soundtrack to boot.1320 Dark (TV series, one season, 2017–)This sci-fi thriller – which features disappearing children, a mysterious local power plant, and scenes set in the Eighties – has, for obvious reasons, drawn comparisons to Stranger Things. But Dark is even more beguiling and (true to its name) less family-friendly than Stranger Things.1420 The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson (Film, 2017)Though it’s been somewhat tarnished by claims that director David France appropriated the work and research of trans film-maker Reina Gossett, this documentary is nonetheless a loving, respectful tribute to gay rights activist Marsha P Johnson. One of the key figures in the Stonewall uprising (though her involvement was almost entirely eradicated in 2015’s critically hated Stonewall), Johnson modelled for Andy Warhol, performed onstage with drag group Hot Peaches, helped found the Gay Liberation Front, and then died under suspicious circumstances in 1992.1520 On My Block (TV series, one season, 2018–)This coming-of-age series might not have found as many eyeballs as it deserved last year, but those it did find were glued to the screen. In fact, it was the most-binged show of 2018 – meaning that it had the highest watch-time-per-viewing session of any Netflix original. Created by Awkward’s Lauren Iungerich, On My Block follows a group of Los Angeles teens as they navigate both the drama of high school and the danger of inner-city life.Two beleaguered assistants (Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell) conspire to get their over-demanding bosses (Taye Diggs and Lucy Liu) together in order to get their lives back in this winning romantic comedy. Set It Up is responsible not only for coining the term “over-dicking” (it’s much more innocent than it sounds), but for rejuvenating a tired genre.Martin Freeman stars as the father struggling to protect his young daughter from a zombie epidemic spreading across Australia. So far, so overdone. But this drama thriller, directed by Ben Howling and Yolanda Ramke and based on their 2013 short of the same name, throws a handful of unpredictable ners in the works.    1920 Godless (TV series, one season, 2017–)With shades of John Ford\u0027s The Searchers, this languorous western was critically acclaimed but swiftly forgotten after it landed on Netflix in 2016. Set in 1884, it\u0027s about Frank Griffin (Jeff Daniels) and his notoriously ruthless gang of outlaws’ pursuit of their injured former ally Roy Goode (Jack O’Connell), who is hiding out in a small town populated solely by women after a mining accident killed off all its men. A gun-toting Michelle Dockery, clearly relishing the change of scenery after years of Downton Abbey, and a taciturn Jack O’Connell, are on brilliant form.2020 Atypical (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)This coming-of-age series about a teenage boy with autism was sweet and well-intentioned from the start, but its first season was criticised for a handful of inaccuracies, and for its lack of autistic actors. Rather than drowning in a sea of defensiveness – as too many shows tend to do – it listened, and brought in autistic actors and writers for its excellent second season.120 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017–)Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix’s most streamed non-English language show. The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special.

He said it was “easy to over-interpret” the significance of quarterly membership numbers.By traditional measures of company performance Netflix is still growing fast. Price rises helped boost revenue by 26 per cent compared to the same quarter last year while profits exceeded expectations at £709m.Mihir Haria-Shah, head of broadcast at media planning agency Total Media said: “Netflix’s head start means it remains in reasonable health whilst the new services such as Disney Plus get over any early teething issues.\u0026nbsp“The bigger concern for Netflix is what happens further down the line once these new entrants have established themselves. It has essentially built its business on the back of leasing content from other companies and has had great success doing so.\u0026nbsp“Now its content providers are becoming competitors it will have to invest even more into original content as existing deals expire and content is taken off the platform.”\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Anything that is hidden in such a way suggests that the person leaving it behind is most definitely aware that it is not the correct way to dispose of their rubbish.“You don’t actually see people just dropping litter these days, they all know better.\u0026nbspSome have suggested adding bins to the hills, but this does encourage folk\u0026nbspto empty their pockets, and leave even more behind.“Pistachio shells make a regular appearance on the Ben, as well as cigarette ends. All litter is bad, but has different impacts. Plastic will never go away, foodstuff\u0026nbspcan poison the wildlife, and tissuesfaeces spread bacteria.”First-time climbers\u0026nbspcan be the worst offenders, Mr Pyne said, likely through ignorance regarding how long organic material takes to break down in a mountain environment a banana skin may take between two and three years to disappear.However, following the Real3Peaks organised litter-picks and the long-term work of other volunteers, “the noticeable volume has gone down, and the place is looking much better for it”, he said.A more pressing problem is walkers going to the toilet because the desire for privacy leads them to pick the same spots over and over again, he said. “Most or all of the accessible and obvious hiding places\u0026nbspare open, unflushed toilets, smelling very bad, often draped in used tissues, a vibrant green algae present, and black coloured soil, which has been tainted by the concentrated urine.”Staying well away from water courses while doing one’s business is important, Mr Pyne said.He added: “The best thing that anyone outdoors can do, whether in the park, down by the canal, or in the mountains, is to pick up litter they see, and be considerate of where they will ‘go’.”The next Real3Peaks Challenge is due to take place on 12 October.Mountaineering Scotland runs a #TakItHame campaign designed to encourage walkers to pick up any litter they see.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s not useful to use it.”However, Ms May\u0027s official spokesman later insisted: The Prime Minister was clear in her discussions in public or in private that the UK could leave without a deal.The European Commission’s top official\u0026nbspMartin Selmayr, meanwhile, said he thought the UK was still unprepared to leave without a deal.“We have seen what has been prepared on our side of the border for a hard Brexit. We don’t see the same level of preparation on the other side of the border.”The EU secretly offered to put Brexit “on ice” for five years in order to come up with a new deal for Europe, Ms May’s de facto deputy David Lidington told Panorama.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A group from the National Marine Mammal Foundation monitored the whales by boat.“We’re cautiously optimistic that the group dodged a bullet, and that they’re now on their way to deeper water,” said Clay George, a biologist for the Georgia Wildlife Resources Division.Crews had also flown a helicopter above the area, which is about 90 miles south of Savannah, and determined no other whales were stranded.Pilot whales are essentially large dolphins, and can grow to 24 feet in length and weigh 6,600 pounds.Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Dr George said they were still investigating why the animals rushed to shore, an event he called “exceedingly rare in Georgia”.Dr George described the whales as “one to three-tonne dolphins”.“They’re so social that if one animal in the group gets injured or sick, all the other animals in the group can follow them great distances into shore,” he said, “and then they can strand.”Normally these creatures swim 100 miles offshore, he said, which means “something went wrong”, possibly days or weeks ago.In the necropsy, Dr George said researchers will be looking for ingested plastic, evidence of plastic netting or signs of an acoustic disturbance, like bombs or sonars, that could have caused one or more of the animals to swim towards land.“Tomorrow will be the beginning of a process that could go on for potentially weeks,” he said.Normally, added Dr George, he would not advise humans to intervene with pilot whales, but in this case, “it was the right thing to do”.Dr\u0026nbspErin Fougeres, who administers the marine mammal stranding program for the Fisheries ision of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the Southeast, said that “mass strandings of pilot whales aren’t entirely uncommon for us.”There have been about 23 mass strandings in southeastern states since 1991, mostly along the Gulf of Mexico, but never in Georgia, she said.“This event, so far, and fingers crossed, has had the best possible outcome,” she said. “We don’t often have happy endings.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

His English was fairly limited and my Spanish went no further than: “Paella, mucho gracias.”So when, after several minutes of discussing the musical inspiration for his new single album , I went in for the killer question.“How many women have you slept with ”He shrugged.“ ” I ventured.He pulled an expression to suggest I had woefully misjudged his pulling power with the opposite sex. So I aimed higher.“, ”“Ooo knows ” he drawled with a lazy smile. “A gentleman  . . .  he never tell.”“Shall we go with , then ” I suggested, aswe were making a joint entry to one of those “guess how many sweets” attractions at the local fete. He shrugged again, a gesture I took as implicit confirmation. Well, he didn’t deny it.The interview appeared the following day and shortly afterwards the figure went global when the US-based National Enquirer ran with it.Julio, who is charm personied, made no complaint when his legendary Lothario-ism went stratospheric, though many years later he mitigated to another interviewer who broached the subject: “Me, I don’t have numbers. I respect women very much.”Like Mick Jagger, who is said to have bedded around , women, the Spanish crooner joined the ranks of Warren Beatty, Errol Flynn, Jack Nicholson and the notorious lover Casanova as one of history’s great seducers.Back then, such, ahem, swordsmanship was admired. The majority of women swooned at the mere thought of a sacred moment in their seductive gaze, while young men felt both inspired and intimidated by such a dizzyingly high number of sexual conquests.But now  Thanks to the #metoo and #timesup campaigns, men with more notches on their bedposts than the rest of us have had hot dinners are regarded with certain distaste. Last week, Julio’s tongue-in-cheek statistic popped up again, when a -year-old man finally won recognition as the star’s son — the product of a brief affair in the s.Suddenly, the legendary “,” was being viewed through the modern-day, more puritanical prism, where such behaviour might be regarded as “sex addiction”.Whatever the truth , he’s now been with we Miranda Rijnsburger for more than  years and they have five children.So it’s fair to say that his womanising days are long gone. Just as well, perhaps. Because,the Love Island men are anything to go by, old roues are now old hat and it’s romantic and wholly faithful young men like Tommy Fury who, quite rightly, earn the nation’s admiration. Long may it go on.Though it seems there are still some lotharios refusing to go quietly. Last year, Italian playboy Maurizio Zanfanti,  — dubbed the “Romeo of Rimini” after claiming to have slept with , women — died while having sex with a -year-old tourist in his car. It’s what he would have wanted.JOBLESS Daniel Eyers and his pregnant partner Lucrezia Worrell say they have been evicted from their Kent council house for spending their rent money on takeaways.The couple, who have four children, are now living with Daniel’s mum. Daniel, , says: “I can’t get a job as it would mean my children would miss out on school, as I have to drive them there every day.”Oh let me count the ways.A flexible, part-time job perhaps  How about your partner taking them to school, or asking other parents for a lt  Or perhaps desisting from having a fth childyou can’t afford to keep the other four Meanwhile, let us compare and contrast this “can’t do” attitude with that of this father in Vietnam who drags his son across a raging, muddy river in a plastic bag so he can get to school, before ing to his remote village to work.A couple of years ago, we cowered inside a friend’s French holiday home as hailstones the size of golf balls rained down outside.Oh how we laughed . . . until I remembered our hire car parked outside.It was peppered with more dents than a Swiss cheese and, because we hadn’t taken out the “full insurance”, left us with a bill that cost more than the actual holiday.A BRIEF chat in front of the assembled cameras at Wimbledon was all it took for the Duchesses of Cambridgeand Sussexto dispel the long-standing rumours of a spat.Several weeks ago, it was also reported that the Duchess of Cambridge had fallen out with Rose Hanbury, one of her closest friends in the “Norfolk set”.The story has been dismissed as “unsubstantiated rumours” by sources within the Palace but it flared up again when Rose attended the recent Trump banquet without her husbandand was seated in practically a separate postcode to her old chum. Of course, they could kill those rumours stone dead too by being photographed together while out shopping or having lunch.That it hasn’t happened perhaps speaks volumes.AMAL CLOONEY is a well-regarded human rights lawyer who, together with husband George, uses her  to highlight ious liberal causes.So I was rather perplexed to hear – via a -page leaked document – that in  she reportedly gave legal advice to Wikileaks founder Julian Assange on how to potentially sabotage the British government’s bid to arrest him.Whether you think Assange’s role in leaking , classied US documents was espionage or heroism, it remains that he was also trying to avoid extradition to Sweden where he faced charges of sexual assault.How, pray tell, does that fit in with liberal values JENNIFER Lopez is  later this month and credits her youthfulness to daily “self-affirmations”.“I tell myself ‘I am youthful and timeless’ every day a few times a day,” she says. It sounds like cliched bull****, but it’s not. Age is all in your mind.”Hmmm. Quite frankly, I could chant her mantra on a loop and never look like this.One suspects that regular exercise, healthy eating and an expensive skincare regime have played their part too.A SMALL number of residents currently living in the swanky London area of Hampstead are up in arms at proposed boundary changes that would place their homes in nearby Gospel Oak.“By severing political ties, you’re disenfranchising many residents,” says one.What they actually mean is: The price of our houses will plummet.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If the Government won’t abolish this archaic licence, or at least decriminalise non-payment, it should axe the fee for OAPs . . .And strip the BBC of £million, by rewriting the long-term deal it welched on.WE have criticised Amber Rudd over Brexit.But we are delighted the Work and Pensions Secretary has listened to our Give Me Shelter and Make Universal Credit Work campaigns and acted.Credit where credit is due.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The British boozer is in crisis.More than a quarter of all pubs have closed in the past two decades, from , in  to ,, according to the Office for National Statistics. We are losing three pubs a day. At this rate we will see the end of the British pub within our letime.So I got together with two friends who, like me, had never been in the licensed trade, to rescue this wonderful, warm, welcoming, Grade II listed building so everyone can continue to enjoy it. And I am not alone.I know of whole communities that have got together through crowd funding to save their local, with £.million being raised through internet donations for ious establishments last year.People are coming to realise that we can’t afford to lose these treasured spaces. There is no social network that can beat the pub, particularly in a world so insular where people have their noses in a mobile phone the whole time.It is so important people sit up and have a good chat, whether it is with a stranger at the bar or one of the staff. Workers come in after grafting and want to speak to the barmaid about what a hard day they’ve had, about the van breaking down or the tractor engine blowing up.Pubs often have football teams, darts, dominoes, quiz nights and are a venue where many great bands played their first gigs. In other places you will find a small shop at the local, because the village one has closed.At The Half Moon we sponsor the village cricket team, have Women’s Institute meetings with tea and cake in the morning, charity events and people come to celebrate weddings, birthdays and anniversaries.And no, nanny state meddlers, this isn’t about encouraging drinking, it’s about popping down to the local for a pint once or twice a week, which isn’t going to do any harm.The pub is now a place that families visit and I want everyone to treat it as their home.  My mum is in the garden, my dad helps out and my son Indio comes in to ask our head barman: “Can I have the usual please” — by which he means an apple juice and a packet of crisps.I had noticed pubs closing, but I hadn’t realised the reason until I became a landlady myself. Someone needs to give this industry a break. Landlords and land–ladies can only make tiny margins on the beer they sell, due to the high taxes they have to pay.That’s why I got involved with the Long Live The Local campaign last year to help pressure the Government into freezing beer duty. Everything is trying to kill this incredible part of British culture, whether it’s business rates, beer tax or sugar tax.Our rates are three times the European average and we pay almost  per cent of all beer duty across the EU, while drinking only  per cent of the beer. But the industry employs around , — many of them young people — and puts £BILLION into the economy.I can’t thank The Sun enough for its support in helping our campaign. I don’t think we would have received as many signatures without the help of you, the readers. Thankfully, the Chancellor listened to our case, agreeing in the last budget not to raise duty on beer.Sin taxes are high enough already and I hope the next Prime Minister will give us a break. It was an honour to be named  Beer Drinker Of The Year by the All-Party Parliamentary Beer Group, which promotes the unique role of the pub in our society.Certainly there is hope that this great institution can survive by changing with the times and adapting to new tastes.  It is amazing seeing all the microbreweries and gin distilleries starting up, with a new generation enthusiastic about real ingredients.The gastro pub movement also offers customers the quality food they desire. We were proud that our restaurant received two AA rosettes for culinary excellence in the first six months.But there is also a need for a pub to be a pub, where customers can come in with their wellies or work boots. At The Half Moon we have good dining on one side and an old-fashioned fireplace that drinkers can gather round on the other.For the first year I was there all the time, but now it’s wiping its own nose, so I go in two or three times a week — it’s my other jobs that pay the mortgage. It’s a great place to wind down, particularly on a Sunday, and it brings me a lot of joy.When I got the lease for the pub, a friend advised me to make sure I stood back once in a while to peer through the windows to see people having a good time. That’s why Britain’s pubs have to be saved.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

However, her child had passed away more than a month previously.Defence counsel Martin Bernhaut said his client knew what she had done was wrong.“Ms Mains accepts that she received a range of payments relating to deceased child during a period when she was not entitled to.“She absolutely accepts that and she did make  representations to Centrelink that her child was alive and in her care and had ious disabilities that required additional care.”However, her solicitor added, the Judge should take into account that her daughter, “died in horric, tragic, circumstances aged five months”.The trauma of this together with her inability to read and write meant she was “never going to be able to work due to her range of conditions.”He noted that at one point her distress over her child dying was so strong that she began “dressing up a doll and pretending it was her daughter”.Mr Bernhaut said her “limited cognitive ability” meant she had been entitled to a range of other welfare payments which she didn’t claim.Ms Mains’ lawyer argued she potentially could have received around £, of Newstart allowance during the same period or nearly £, in disability support.The possible — but never claimed for — disability support payments would have added up to just £, less than she obtained for the care of her dead daughter.Ms Mains had a range of issues that included alcohol abuse and had spent several months in a residential hospital program to detox which her counsel asked to be taken into account in terms of sentencing.Mr Bernhaut said his client had already paid back around , of the funds.The sentencing was adjourned until  September.Similar offenses have happened in this country, including Karen Trant, , from Devon claimed she couldnt leave the house as she was an agoraphobic but snuck off to live in Goa for large parts of the year.She claimed £, in disability benefits, income support, housing benefit and council tax benefit.Ruth Nabaguzzi,  from Forest Gate in London cheated the taxpayer of an estimated £million using   identities.Pensioner Ian Burns, , from Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire swindled nearly £,, pretending to be three other people."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/NINTCHDBPICT000506436960","title":"heatwave america temperature weather","story":"Washington D.C will be just two degrees shy of the scorching temperatures in the Death Valley desert in Calornia.The dangerous heat is set to break more than  local heat records and experts warn it wont even cool down overnight.Officials have released warnings that smog may make it more dficult for certain people to breathe -

Brits consider themselves “well-travelled” – visiting an average  countries in their letime and going overseas twice a year, but holidays to places connected with our own personal history are central to the nation’s travel choices.Lisa Francesca Nand, host of the chart-topping Big Travel Podcast, said: “Holidays connected with our own personal history are so popular – largely due to nostalgia and family tradition.Our own parents chose these destinations for a reason they’re generally good value, warm, friendly and offer plenty of activities for children happy kids equal happy parents.Although more families are travelling further and wider than ever, carrying on special traditions, such as building sandcastles on the beach or going on long walks together hold sentimental value generation after generation.The research comes as % of Brits say they would love to visit the places where their ancestors called homethey knew where it was.Russell James, DNA and Family History expert at Ancestry, said: “It’s no surprise that the staycation trend is continuing to grow but it’s interesting to see that an increasing appetite for people to understand where their relatives are from or lived is evolving how we travel the UK.Combining holidays and family history can be very rewarding – you can take your children to the same beach your parents visited when they were children, or drive down the same streets your grandparents lived.These personal, unique experiences can be made possible and more accurate by Ancestry’s database of over  million DNA customers, and our billions of global digitalised record collections.The combination of these tools can bring your DNA and family history closer together than ever before, and inspire your next staycation.”"},{"url":null,"title":"extra sunday service church hangover","story":"Reverend Mark Montgomery also said parishioners spent their mornings at kids’ footie matches or farmers’ markets.He said many struggle to make the normal am service after “a night out the day before”.Rev Montgomery, below, said: “This is something we’ve been looking at for a while.“Even though historically church services are in the mornings and evenings, society has changed and Sunday mornings are not always the best time for people for ious reasons.”The St Gabriel’s congregation meet at a primary school in Kings Hill, near Maidstone, Kent.The extra pm services will be every second Sunday.He added said that am services would still take place as normal on Sundays and added: We have a growing congregation in Kings Hill so we see this as very good news for us and an important next step in our journey.Local Graham Lawson, , said: “At last someone with a bit of sense.

We will perform an MRI scan and then perform a surgery to separate the ‘heads’”.Although rare, there have been other reports of babies being born with more than one head, especially in African nations.This type of birth defect is referred to as an encephalocele.According to the NHS, an encephalocele is a rare congenital type of neural tube defect where part of the skull has not formed properly.So a portion of brain tissue and associated structures are outside the skull.According to reports, babies diagnosed with an encephalocele have a  per cent survival rate.The long-term prognosis for survival becomes less likelythere are other complications, such as associated defects or syndromes orbrain tissue protrudes into the sac.Approximately  per cent of these infants who do survive have ying degrees of mental deficit.On March , an expert team of neurosurgeons at Sher-e-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciencessuccessfully operated on an infant with two heads.According to reports, the father of the newborn had tried to bury him alive, fearing he would not be able to afford his treatment.He was rescued by police near Nowhatta town in Jammu and Kashmir.Doctors were able to separate the abnormal brain from the normal brain, along with skin after three-hours of laborious surgery.The baby was later adopted by his uncle."},{"url":null,"title":"top plots top ten gardens","story":"Top of the Plots - the top ten gardens of Great BritainFrom Cornwall to Scotland via Northern Ireland - Britains gardens have it allShareCommentsByDiarmuid Gavin:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL NewsBritain is a garden lover’s dream holiday destination.Thanks to a temperate climate, historical wealth, success as an empire builder and prowess on the seas, we’ve scoured the world over hundreds of years and brought back plants, ideas, styles and adornments to put together the finest examples of gardens anywhere.Some, such as formal Hampton Court, take their lead from formal European style.

Crafty George Osborne, who was Chancellor  when a deal was stitched up, believed forcing the BBC to fund the leline would save the Government £million a year from . But the Treasury’s own watchdog yesterday revealed the move could backfire - ultimately costing more than it saves. The Office for Budget Responsibility confirmed spending on Pension Credit was set to rise because of the move to restrict free licences to only those who receive the benefit. Many who are eligible but do not currently take up the benefit are now likely to do so amid a planned advertising blitz by the BBC to raise awareness of entitlement, the OBR said.  The Department for Work and Pensions should be braced for a surge in demand for Pension Credit, it suggests. OBR chairman Robert Chote said it “illustrates the dangers of unintended consequences when governments come up with clever ways to save money”. Its fiscal risks report says: “DWP estimates there were around , people aged  or over who were entitled to the guarantee element of pension credit in - but who did not receive it, almost  per cent of the total number entitled. “These had an average entitlement of £ a week, resulting in around £.billion of unclaimed benefit among this age group. So around half of that group would need to start claiming to wipe out the expected savings from transferring responsibility to the BBC and the BBC cutting its domestic spending by a corresponding amount.”    While “very large increases in take-up are unlikely”, the Corporation’s plan to publicise the availability of Pension Credit will lead to more people taking it up. It adds: “It is relatively unusual for a government to delegate parameters of welfare policy to a broadcasting company in an attempt to save money, and it is perhaps not surprising that this may have unintended consequences. “The BBC’s decision to means-test free TV licences via a link to pension credit receipt may well raise welfare spending by more than it reduces BBC spending ... The net effect on the public finances would therefore be to push the budget deficit up not down.” Stressing the move posed a fresh risk to public coffers, the OBR goes on: “The likely cost of the BBC’s recent decision to means-test free TV licences for the over-s by linking it to pension credit – thereby potentially prompting a material number of those currently not taking it up to do so – poses a fiscal risk that we had not previously envisaged.  The Corporation announced this Spring that only over-s receiving Pension Credit will be eligible for free licences. Just . million OAPs are likely to be continue receiving free licences, while an estimated . million will lose out. The Mirror is campaigning to save the benefit, with more than , readers backing the fight by completing coupons in the paper. More than , people have signed Age UK’s Switched Off petition calling for free licences to be preserved and the Government to take back responsibility. Setting up a system to means-test eligibility will cost the BBC £million, with £million annual running costs, MPs heard.Bectu broadcasting chief Philippa Childs said: “The Office of Budget Responsibility is confirming what we have said all this time - that the Government should not be outsourcing responsibility for decisions on welfare benefit policy.“Since the BBC’s announcement, there has been an unexpected consequence highlighting how many older people should have been in receipt of the Pension Credit.“This shows the Government should take back responsibility.“By passing the buck onto the BBC, it has fundamentally undermined this public service broadcaster by changing the nature of its relationship with its loyal viewers and dedicated workers.” "},{"url":null,"title":"home office scheme rejects 70","story":"NewsHome Office scheme rejects % of bids for cash to steer kids away from kne crimeEXCLUSIVE: Ministers have denied funds to dozens of projects for vulnerable young people that bid for cash from the flagship ‘Early Intervention Fund’ShareCommentsByOliver MilnePolitical Correspondent:,  JUL NewsThe fund is designed to fund projects to keep children out of crime \"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe Home Office rejected over % of bids for cash to ert children away from kne crime and violence, as demands for resources to combat rising serious violence outstripped the available funds.

He’s a young man within , votes of unseating the future PM in an increasingly marginal constituency. This wouldn’t just be the first time a sitting prime minister lost his seat in a general election. For a Muslim ­immigrant to beat a man whose ­arguably racist comments about “letterboxes” and “piccaninnies” refer to around % of his own multi-ethnic constituents, it would also be poetic justice. “I hear that phrase a lot,” Ali says. “On so many levels. I’m the candidate that happens to be Muslim and ­immigrant. I’m also the local candidate, and the working-class candidate. I was born in Iran and came over at the age of five with my mum, so people also see it as poetic justice for Nazanin.”    Nazanin Zaghari-Ratclfe is the imprisoned British Iranian mother further endangered by Boris when he was Foreign Secretary. “The buffoon character has consequences,” Ali says. “Nazanin is one of the consequences.” Johnson was parachuted into Uxbridge as the Tory candidate in , after leaving office as mayor. The  election saw his majority halved, partly due to shting ­demographics, and partly, claims Ali, due to his lack of time spent in the area. “It’s so rare to get Boris here in the constituency that you need David Attenborough to narrate it,” Ali says dryly. “You could drop him off at the end of the road and he wouldn’t be able to find Uxbridge station.” Then there’s the thorny local issue of Heathrow expansion. “Boris was going to lie down in front of the bulldozers but he ran away to Afghanistan instead,” Ali says. “I’m a Heathrow councillor. There are villages that will be devastated by Heathrow expansion in my ward. I’ll stand up for them.”    The contrast between the two men could hardly be wider. Ali grew up in a working-class household where his mum often had to choose between feeding the gas or electricity meter. “Even in my wildest dreams I never thought I would stand to be an MP,” he says. “Becoming an MP doesn’t happen for people like me who grow up in a council house raised by a single mum. MPs are people like Boris – Etonians.”Instead, the Manchester United fan dreamed of becoming a goalkeeper, only losing out on a place at Fulham academy when genetic testing showed he wasn’t going to be tall enough.He pulls himself up to his ft in height. “Science was right,” he smiles.” Ali joined the Labour Party when he was at Brunel University, after hearing alumni and Shadow ­Chancellor John McDonnell speak. “My generation has been hit with everything – tuition fees tripled, we’d lost EMA, the maintenance grant was gone. My mum was made homeless from her council house. “I decided to get politically active and I went to a meeting. I thought I’d give him hell. But by the end of the meeting I said to him, ‘I want to canvas for you’. That broke the barrier in my mind against joining a political party.” The former vice president of the National Union of Students laughs and says a few MPs have advised him to “get a real job” before becoming an MP.    “I don’t need to work in Goldman Sachs for some le experience,” he says. “Real le experience is when your mum can’t afford the electricity to cook. It’s spending my first day at school terried because I couldn’t speak English. It’s considering picking up a kne to protect yourself, which luckily I never did.” In any case, Ali says he’s lost several job offers since announcing his candidacy. “They were with organisations who need to get on with the new prime minister, I understand that.” He’s also had death threats since standing.He shows me a message on Twitter about his candidacy: “I hope your family are well protectedyou do this”.Ali shrugs. “I went to a school in North West London where you left by dferent entrances depending on what gang you were in. I had knives pulled on me regularly. I got beaten up. This has happened all my adult le. So I’m not that bothered.” Boris, he says, “is going the Trump route. The veneer’s slipping. The ­dference between Trump and ­traditional Republicans isn’t policy, it’s that language has dropped the veneer. We need to give our own simple answer that the people with black and brown skin living next door have more in common with you than someone who made £million tanking the economy.“Words have consequences. I was at a primary school to give a talk.

MM was rejected for PIP because assessors said he didnapost need social support to engage with other people. Instead assessors said he only needed prompting to engage with people - a definition that carries fewer points under the scoring system for PIP. The Department for Work and Pensionsdefended the decision on two counts. First, the DWP said social support meant someone trained and experienced in assisting people - not just a friend.And secondly, the DWP said the supporter has to bepresent at the timesomeone is trying to engage socially.But the five Supreme Court judges said this second part of the definition was too narrow.    They wrote: Social support is likely to take many dferent forms, depending on the inidual needs of the claimant,. It is undesirable to attempt to prescribe, in the abstract, which other forms of support will be sufficient. It will be a question of fact and degree, and is something that will have to be worked out on a case by case basis. Mind spokeswoman Sophie Corlett said: This is a landmark moment in the ongoing battle to make sure disabled people are supported through our benefits system to live well. Far too many are struggling to claim benefits they need because of draconian assessments, which often fail to take fully into account the impact a mental health problem can have.

The couple, who live in London, have said they have received nothing but support from both their families.    The pair flew to Julia’s home country Brazil where they met Julia’s mother for the first time in December last year. Their genuine love won over family and friends and the couple decided to take the next big step – a le-long commitment to each other. The wedding ceremony took place at a -star hotel in Liverpool Street, in London on June . Julia wore an A-line white Maggie Sottero dress with Eileen also donning an elegant white, lace dress. Both brides wore a veil and dyed their hair bright pink.    Julia and Eileen were both in tears saying their vows during an emotional wedding ceremony. The brides weren’t the only ones who couldn’t hold back the tears. Wedding guests were also moved as the happy couple were pronounced as we and we.

Eileen added: “Getting married is a big process. “It’s a really big business that you could almost lose sight of the thing you’re actually going to do. “And it’s really a very intense feeling so I ordered champagne.” Speaking of how she was feeling before the ceremony, Eileen said: “Really, really nervous and excited. I haven’t felt nervous like this in quite a while.”    Eileen admitted that she never thought of getting married. She said: “I think part of the reason for that is because I grew up in a time where for gay people it was never something that you even had the right to think about.” Eileen’s sister-in-law, Nancy De Freest, said: “The last thing I expected was Eileen to be married but I am so happy for her that she has finally found some happiness in her le.” She said that the age dference between Eileen and Julia at first came as a shock but added: “The age somewhat surprised me but knowing Eileen, she loves fun and she loves le. “When she told me about Julia it just seemed like that would be the perfect person for Eileen.”  Julia’s friend, Lara Sant ’Anna, who flew from Brazil to attend her friend’s wedding ceremony, said that Julia is quite a spontaneous person and added: “It’s not a surprise they are getting married so soon. “They love each other.

Long-awaited tests carried out on High Pressure Laminatematerial - which is wrapped around the homes of thousands of people in the UK - found it was “clear” in some cases it had to be removed. HPL cladding was deemed unsafe when it was not made with fire retardant or is used alongside a combustible material. The Fire Brigades Union said it was “outrageous” it had taken the Government so long to recognise the dangers, more than two years after the tragedy that killed  in West London. Part of the Mirror’s Grenfell: Never Again campaign is to see the removal of dangerous cladding from UK buildings.    The Fire Protection Association , which carried out the test, said last week that all combustible cladding should be removed from high-rise buildings regardless of the insulation used. In May the Government announced a £ million fund to help with the removal of lethal ACM cladding - which was used on Grenfell - on buildings across the country. But many leaseholders whose buildings have HPL and other dangerous cladding are being forced to foot le-changing bills by developers. Although experts have been calling for tests on non-ACM cladding since September , it was only carried out last Thursday. An expert  for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government found it was “clear” that an external wall fitted with non-fire-retardant HPL cladding “would not have met the al requirements of the Building Regulations”.    It “presents a notable fire hazard on buildings over m,” the government told building owners in an advice note. Building owners who identy these materials “should take immediate measures to remediate their system,” it said. The note added: “Where existing buildings have any HPL  in combination with combustible insulation, they should immediately take action.” Fire retardant HPL was safe when used in combination with a non-combustible material, the experts found. Sarah Jones MP, Labour’s Shadow Housing Minister, blasted: “In the wake of a damning select committee report, the government has finally confirmed what experts have been telling them for years: HPL cladding is lethal and should be removed from buildings. “The fact that ministers waited until two years after Grenfell to confirm to people that they have been living in potential death traps is a disgrace.  “And today’s statement is a poor attempt at a cover-up, highlighting the one combination of cladding and insulation which passed a fire test.  “Worst of all, Ministers were made aware of a failed fire test featuring HPL nine months ago and failed to act. “The Government must immediately require building owners to check for this cladding, as they did with ACM, so we know the scale of this problem.

In her former le as a TV actress, thereaposs a good chance Meghan would have responded to the rumours personally, possibly by posting a comment on social media or her popular blog The Tig. But sheaposs not allowed to do this in her new royal role, and itaposs largely because of her husband Prince Harryaposs great-grandmother.    According to royal expert Victoria Arbiter, the Queen Motheraposs “well-worn mantra” could be causing Meghan a few problems. Speaking to Nine News Australia, she said: “I think really she [Meghan] is doing incredibly well. “It’s very dficult when you come from a celebrity background where a publicist can stand up for you or come out and say ‘no, that report is categorically untrue.’ “But, generally speaking, members of the public follow the Queen Mother’s well-worn mantra: ‘Never complain, never explain.’ “And so you have to sit back while the world’s media and social media just comment. Even though Meghan hasnapost been able to speak out, many of her friends have defended her in a series of TV and magazine interviews.   When the Queen Mother died back in , she left Harry a lot more money than his brother Prince William in her will.But it wasnapost because she preferred the younger brother, and there was actually a very thoughtful reason behind it. Years before she died, the Queen Mother reportedly put a large chunk of her money into a trust fund for all her great grandchildren.Harry and William shared about £m of this, with the bulk going to Harry, reports the BBC .When the Queen dies and Prince Charles becomes king, the Duke of Cambridge, Prince William, will become the new Prince of Wales.    This means he will take on the Duchy of Cornwall, a private estate which funds the public, charitable and private activities of the heir to the throne.Prince Harry on the other hand, wonapost get any of this.After her death, Buckingham Palace released an outline of the Queen Motheraposs will, after going through the high court to try and keep it private. Her estate, which was valued at between £m and £m at the time, was passed onto her daughter the Queen. Her majesty did not have to pay inheritance on the fortune. Many items from the Queenaposs private art collection were given to the royal collection and went on display at the Palace.    Prince Charles moved into her home Clarence House. A statement released at the time read: Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother has bequeathed her entire estateto The Queen. In her will, she asked The Queen to make certain bequests to members of her staff, and these bequests will be subject to Inheritance Tax in the normal way.

This has been and still is one of the hardest times of our lives. We have been fortunate to have a fantastic support network who have supported us through this time.

We still do not know how to come to terms with someone committing such cruelty and violence against our defenceless little girl. We still continue to seek ways to process our immense pain and loss.

The coupleaposs builders planned to do further extensive work in the garden of Frogmore Cottage .But the Duke and Duchess of Sussex changed their mind about the design of the garden after they were granted planning permission by their local council. Newly released documents show that the couple are now seeking retrospective planning consent for external landscaping works’’ after opting for a dferent design. They could be forced to reverse the work at their padplanning consent is refused.      The royal couple moved into the Grade II listed Frogmore Cottage on the Windsor Estate in April ahead of the birth of their first child Archie. The cottage received an extensive £. million renovation funded by £.m from the taxpayer and £, from themselves, according to sources. The cottage was gted to the Duke and Duchess by the Queen last year, with Kensington Palace confirming the move in November, saying Windsor was a very special place for the couple. Frogmore Cottage is located near of Windsor Castle, the Queenaposs summer residence, and St Georgeaposs Chapel, where Harry and Meghan tied the knot in May as millions around the world watched on TV. Ian Ratclfe, project manager at the Royal Household said in an email to the council’s planning enforcement team: “This application has been submitted following a material change to elements to the granting of planning consent.” Under planning law, a retrospective planning application is submitted to the councila change is made to a property that requires planning permission and approval has not been sought.    A local authority can also request that a retrospective planning application is submitted for the work that has already carried out. However, it does not mean that planning permission will automatically be granted and the application will be treated in the usual way. If the retrospective application is refused, the local authority can issue an enforcement notice which could require the couple to reverse any changes made to Frogmore Cottage. Under the plans revealed by a well-placed royal source last month, the plans include provision for a tennis or badminton court at the coupleaposs Windsor home. There are also said to be plans for exterior painting and landscaping, the installation of security lights and the planting of £,-worth of fast-growing shrubs and trees.  Several baby friendly features for the couple’s child Archie as well as a vegetable garden so the couple can grow their own produce are also included. The revised plans, according to the source, will be slightly dferent following a last-minute change of heart by the royal couple. A well-placed source said: “Some changes have been made to the plans to create the Duke and Duchess’s garden after the original planning consent was granted. “Frogmore Cottage will be the perfect place for a royal prince to grow up with the Duke and Duchess and these changes are very important to create a perfect home for themselves and Archie. “These specic changes are currently being dealt with the local council to avoid the need for any action.

Croatian youngster Lana Bendelja was diagnosed with an osteosarcoma in  and her case became well known in the country when her mother Marijana Prpic refused to let her daughter be treated. Since her daughteraposs death on Monday, July , Ms Prpic has been accused of squandering money donated for her daughteraposs care. Ms Prpic had said she didnapost want her daughter given chemo and wanted her to be treated abroad instead.Around  days after the diagnosis the mother reportedly started a Facebook page to appeal for donations and claimed that her daughter needed medication that is not available in Croatia.   But doctors in her home country claimed that osteosarcoma is treated there in the same way as in other European countries, so they reported the mother to Social Services and the Ministry of Health . Lana was treated with chemotherapy without her motheraposs approval. Director of the Clinic for Childrenaposs Diseases Goran Roic said at the time: The termination of the treatment and the nature of the disease in the minor patient would be detrimental for the patient. He claimed that the treatment was fully covered by health insurance and eventhat was not the case the hospital could have helped so donations were not necessary. Ms Prpic continued to accept donations and did not cooperate with the medics while the girl was still receiving treatment in the hospital, according to local media. The unnamed father of the girl, who the mother was reportedly stopping from seeing his child, started a court procedure asking for an independent decision to be made on his daughteraposs treatment.

I’ve been here before and won - with a last-minute winner, so you just take it, you take the win and get up the road.”Robbie was pleased to see winning goal scorer Butcher back in the starting line-up for the first time since he tore a groin muscle during May’s play-off games.Having handed starts to Louis Appereand Logan Chalmers , he was pleased with their contributions as well.“Calum gives us that stability we’re looking for in there. I thought Ian Harkes did well there as well and Sam Stanton did very well when he came on.“I thought the kids did well. Like many kids, their decision-making is something they can get better at, but both had good moments in the game.“They have worked hard during the close season, so they deserved the chance to come in and there are a couple of other young ones in the background who will get game time in the coming weeks. The future is bright for the place.”After drawing at Hearts in their opener, United are now sitting on four points in Group A, a point behind the Jambos.With home ties against Cowdenbeath on Friday and East Fe next Tuesday to come, they are looking good to progress as one of the second-placed teams with the best record.“All in all it’s been good. Three points from this one and we’re sitting with four points after the draw at Tynecastle and a hard game here. We now go into two home games and we know what we have to do.”"},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-memories-of-happy-days-gone-by-in-glasgow","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Evening Times."},{"url":null,"title":"irn-bru-cancel-noel-gallagher-branded-scotland-third-world-country-lewis-capaldi-spat","story":"Irn-Bru have CANCELLED Oasis legend Noel Gallagher after the singer took another pop at Lewis Capaldi in the pairs bizarre rivalry."},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-recognise-old-pictures-glasgow","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Times Group."},{"url":null,"title":"jack-victor-greatest-glaswegians","story":"WHO do you think is the greatest Glaswegian of all time  The summer we are showcasing the top  men and woman who have put the city on the map.

consultation","story":"Calls have been made to halt a consultation on options for dualling a major north-east road.North-east Labour MSP Lewis Macdonald has written to Transport Secretary Michael Matheson urging him to put the brakes on a consultation into the project to dual the A between Huntly and Aberdeen.He has also made repeated calls for transport bosses to reconsider ruling out dualling the road along its existing route.Mr Macdonald said: “At a recent meeting in Inverurie, representatives from the local A Action Group were able to put forward their case for putting the option back on the table to representatives from Transport Scotland and Amey Arup.“Neither Transport Scotland nor Amey Arup have yet been able to provide a clear explanation of why this option was deselected so early and failed during the meeting to answer the Action Group’s compelling arguments.“I have now written to Michael Matheson making this clear, and urging him to bring a halt to the consultation so it can be reopened with Online Inverurie as an option, which the public can be invited to comment on.”Transport Scotland has faced repeated calls to justy why dualling the existing A Aberdeen to Inverness road at Inverurie has not been included in proposals to widen the route.Campaigners have claimed the option has been “rejected prematurely” on “flawed and incomplete” information.However, Mr Matheson previously claimed the dropped option would result in the loss of some properties and gardens of residents along the existing route.But Mr Macdonald said the option would only have an impact on neighbouring propertiesthey built the road to a higher standard than the AWPR – meaning it would be a wider road.He added: “If you dual the existing route at the current standard then you don’t have the impact on properties.”A Transport Scotland spokesman said: “Re-use of the existing route between East of Huntly and Aberdeen has been investigated thoroughly as part of the design and assessment process.“Due to a number of factors, such as the existing trunk road alignment and the impact on existing roadside properties, as well as the high number of junctions and accesses, the assessment concluded it would be more suitable to develop the new dual carriageway offline from the existing trunk road at Inverurie, with the existing A retained for use as part of the local road network.“However, some of the options under consideration do include sections of online upgrade on other parts of the route where this is feasible.“The consultation is now closed and all feedback received is vital and will be taken into consideration as we look to identy a preferred option for the scheme later this year.”"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 25","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFiona McCuish of Ardrishaig captured the VIC puffer wending its way up the Crinan Canal.Fiona used her camera phone as the vessel passed through West Bank, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 28 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat is it with recruiting #professionals# to Argyll We seem to be a distinctly unattractive prospect, as witnessed by the problems with recruiting a dentist in Lochgilphead.What people fail to appreciate is that they stand to gain so much more than they would lose by coming to Argyll.The scenery is unrivalled the pace of le is civilised we are not that far from the central belt and a sense of community remains.Just turn to our front page story for proof.Disappointment at losing out on council grant funding has turned into joy in Tarbert.But only because the people of the village have such big hearts, as they have demonstrated in the past.The council may argue that this vindicates its decision to refuse funding.

Peter O#Neil edged out Penrice in race one, but Penrice would take his revenge in race two and it was all to play for in the final encounter. Peter O#Neil was up to the task and would take the overall, with Penrice a deserved second and  Damian Carter would third.The four stroke class was enthralling, with Sam Sibbald thundering around the Kilmartin track, big Andy Malloch and his Armstrong chasing him all the way to the flag and winning the final race but not the overall. Sam would be the victor followed by Andy and a consistent Keith Stanford third.For the youth class it was a day of mixed fortunes and consistency would be the key, with Jordan Graham coming out on top ahead of James Forrest and picking up a superb third overall was Rhys Brown.Pre- action would see committee man and track builder Grant McClure and his Maico, with three decades of riding under his belt, become the overall winner ahead of Callum Wilson on the superbly prepared Honda.The Twinshock under cc event would be a three race win for the flying Calum Kilgour and his cc Yamaha ahead of Jim Grieve, who would have some bike issues but would bring home his Honda in second fighting off a very persistent David Lawson and Gordon Peterson but it would be Gordon that would hold the third place trophy with some consistent riding.The Twinshock open class event would be a spectacular sight as cc Hondas and Maicos battled their way around the bracken.In race one there was a very small gap between first and second place and a similarly small gap between third. Brian Alexander would take the win from Craig ‘Smitch’ Smith, and John Crawford would come home in third with a notable mention to the very unlucky Paul Chiappa who had his fair share of misfortunes throughout the day, as his seat was torn from his bike at the top of one of the steep climbs. The overall would end up the same as the first race with Brian, taking the win from Craig Smith and John Crawford bringing the big Honda home in third.In the over s class it was a triumphant day for John Lamont with three resounding victories. Johnny Rutherford was second, a great result for the club sponsor, with David Watson bringing home the Honda with some consistent rides.For the group three races Robert Bell took the honours from Allan Shields and Bryan Colligan, all of these riders deserving a notable mention and with some very similar lap times and some quick racing in trying conditions.The clubman class was great to watch, with some fast up-and-coming riders such as Peter Rennie, Callum Laird and Stuart Wilson all angling for the win. Rennie would take the overall from Laird in second and  Wilson in third.The evolution class was again the Paul and Tom show. In what must have been the fastest racing all day, it would be Paul #PJ# Johnston who would take overall honours with three wins and Tom Grant would take the runner-up slot followed home ably by a consistent Roy Potts taking the third place.In the final block of racing it would be a win apiece for Jordan McDonald, Shaun Robertson, and John Kenny, but it would be the ever improving Shaun Robertson, ing from injury, who would take overall honours from a rapidly improving John Kenny in second and #Mr Consistent# Karl Livingstone in third.Results:Group Pre- class:  Grant McClure  Callum Wilson.

recent criticism by a group of local homeowners.Last week the Peeblesshire Newscovered a meeting of Innerleithen Community Council at which five residents used the public open forum to complain about last months Transcend Biking Festival.Following this report, many members of the Innerleithen community took to social media hitting out at the claims and praising the event, which was attended by thousands of bikers worldwide.Moves are afoot to make Innerleithen the mountain bike mecca of Europe - including a pound million investment to create world-class facilities.But following the catalogue of complaints aired by the small group of residents, a strong message has been voiced to the community ndash ldquoletrsquos embrace whatrsquos coming to us.Transcend was TweedLoversquos first instalment of the bike and music festival in the town.And it is being hailed a success for not only creating a jam-packed programme for bike-mad riders of all ages, but breathing le back into the quiet town and boosting the economy.Fears are growing that biking festival organisers will simply move these types of events from the townfaced with continued backlash.Innerleithen was once described as ldquoa poor cousin to Peebles and Glentress for mountain biking and tourism, but is now on its way to becoming the national hub for outdoor events.Following our article, Tom Veitch, who resides in Montgomery Street not far from the location of the festival, said: ldquoWe didnrsquot get the leaflets which were apparently posted through some doors about the traffic management plans and parking, but to be honest it was fairly self-explanatory. Apart from the cones on the street, we never had any issues with bad parking or disturbance from people attending the event.ldquoI could hear some music on the evenings but I liked the atmosphere and it certainly wasnrsquot a nuisance. We did attend the family ride on the Sunday, and while there was plenty of mud, I thought theyrsquod done a great job creating such a big event in its first year in Innerleithen.With the proposed plans to redevelop the old mill to create the Mountain Bike Innovation Centre, Tom added: ldquoI think its exciting times to be a resident in Innerleithen and I hope events like these continue to grow and do well here.ldquoI remember when Innerleithen was a poor cousin to Peebles and Glentress as an MTB and tourist destination, and I think itrsquos the hard work of local people who have brought Innerleithen to the fore. Most people are excited about the prospects and possible future developments here, and Irsquod hate people to get the wrong impression of the overall community support based on the reported views of a few people who were disturbed in the eventrsquos first year.ldquoHaving said that, I hope the organisers take on board the negative feedback and incorporate improvements into any future events. I know they were in touch with the community council earlier this year before the event, hopefully theyrsquoll keep up this close relationshipthey come back.Meanwhile, Allan Graham who has lived in the town all of his le said without events such as Transcend, the Innerleithen community has nothing.He added: ldquoThe mills have all gone and what we have is biking, walkers etc. Letrsquos embrace whatrsquos coming to us and make the most of it.Jamie Birks echoed this sentiment adding: ldquoThe town has a real and deserved opportunity to be a national hub for outdoor events such as this. So much talent and experience from so many organisations, coupled with truly amazing natural resources that could make such a positive impact on the town ndashwe all want it.Innerleithen Community Council has promised to pass on the complaints raised at the meeting to event organisers, Scottish Borders Council and Police Scotland.But Chairman Marshall Douglas said the community council ldquostrongly supports the Transcend Bike Festival and will continue to work closely with event organisers to ensure the future success of the event."},{"url":null,"title":"cops-ask-help-catch-boy-racers-galashiels","story":"POLICE in Galashiels have called on a local supermarket to help them catch boy racers.For months there have been reports made about young drivers gathering at the Tesco car park.And now officers have asked the firm to take down registration details to help them track down the culprits.PC James Harrison said: ldquoWe are still receiving calls about boy racers in the car park at Tesco on a Saturday night.ldquoIt seemed to get better for a while, but the problem is still there.

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack. The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area. In the winter one would have to wear a wetsuit, of course, but the conditions are ideal and the wave forms have great potential # after all, they are coming straight in from the Atlantic over the north of Ireland.#What I#d like to see is a surf club established in Campbeltown. It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"letter open letter to dog owners","story":"While responsible dog owners take care to ensure their dogs are under control at all times, there are still a number who do not # and seem unaware of the potential consequences of their actions.There has been a disturbing rise in the number of sheep and other livestock attacks, and we are hoping to enlist your help in raising awareness of dog #worrying# which will, in turn, assist the authorities, farmers and land-users.If a dog worries livestock on any agricultural land the owner, or person in charge of the animal at the time, is guilty of a criminal offence.Section  of the DogsAct  defines #worrying# as:Such incidents cause distress to the animals and often lead to them being injured and or killed.

It is better than some human beings are treated ndash that is the sad truth.Mr Farnsworth was presenting an annual report on the racecoursersquos performance over the last financial year.The Beast from the East snow storm, an outbreak of equine influenza, and a long spell of dry weather all contributed to what he described as one of the worst years the course had been through in his memory.A number of key fixtures were cancelled and profits fell.In December, four horses died during one day of racing at the course but a subsequent review by the British Horseracing Authority ruled that the course and race organisers were not at fault.Councillor Gordon Mackett asked Mr Farnsworththe racecourse had been affected by animal welfare concerns.The course manager said: ldquoWe did have a horrible day when there were four fatalities however, these were all completely separate incidents.ldquoIn a sport like this you will get injuries and fatalities from time to time.

History is the way we view and see things that happened in the past. That view is limited by a number of factors. The availability of surviving records and evidence is one.The vast majority of what happened in the past is inevitably lost to us. This is true even for our own personal memories. So history is the small tip of the iceberg of events and times gone by, brought to the surface by the survival of some accounts more than others.And these records are never unbiased. Often historical records and evidence are purposely partial, influenced by ideology and personal allegiances. But all are biased in some way, as the limited viewpoint and interests of those recording events is based on their experience or motives.As a result, we can only see historical events through a narrow keyhole, with most characters and goings on out of view. Itrsquos the common people who are most always invisible in history. Our own ideological preference and belief in what is important will then affect how we interpret the limited evidence we have.This is why history is often subject to furious debate, and rightly so. Irsquod say itrsquos almost impossible not to allow our own perspectives, interests and values to influence the way we interpret the broader meaning of historical events and their signicance for contemporary society.Such a debate is being had in East Lothian just now, as to the name of the new town to be built on the Blindwells site, between Prestonpans and Longniddry and just to the north of Gladsmuir and Tranent.The name can be romantically translated to mean lsquohidden springsrsquo and it was across this once-marshy ground that the Jacobites crept stealthily at night to mount a surprise attack on the Redcoats on September , . That famous battle lasted  minutes and was a victory for the Jacobites, and the launchpad of Bonnie Prince Charliersquos march into England.Consequently, the Scottish Battlefields Trust has submitted a petition, as reported in the Courier last week, to name the new community Charlestoun and build a statue of Charles.When I was at school, he seemed a dashing and heroic figure. The songs and stories about him are infectious and I totally understand how the stories told about him have created a romantic and thrilling image.But then I studied the topic in more depth, at both university and afterwards. The period has suffered from the romantic treatment but there are fascinating stories of loyalty and sacrice to a man who, in reality, saw the common people chiefly as cannon fodder for his personal and family ambitions.It is for this reason I feel there are enough name places and statues to aristocratic and powerful men whose main historical role was to make and wage war, evenhe has a famous and romantic reputation.This is not to say we shouldnrsquot remember the fascinating history of the area, including that fateful day of battle when the Jacobites crossed the land.But itrsquos how we commemorate it and who we include. What makes the Jacobite period truly fascinating is the tapestry of stories of the many people involved, on both sides. It was a brutal time, in which there was certainly deep loyalty on both sides, but there were many other reasons why people found themselves on one side or the other. It was a brutal civil war, brought on by the aspirations of the exiled Stuarts.Do we commemorate the memory of the man who caused that war or do we commemorate those who were caught up in it  Is it really the case thatwe do the former we do the latter  Irsquom not convinced.There are other stories to consider of course for the site. There was coal mining there for generations. The lives of mining families, men, women and children who toiled in horric conditions, still remains mostly unheralded by history. Maybe itrsquos not lsquoromanticrsquo enough. Likewise with farming, which was a constant economic activity in the area for generations.There was also another unusual underground activity on the site after the early mine closed. Smugglers made an illegal whisky still deep down in the mine shaft once it was disused. It took a while for the customs men to realise East Lothian had an illicit whisky-making enterprise deep below ground in the old mine workings. When they finally raided the mine, they found the still, but no sign of the makers of the whisky. It kind of gives new meaning to the name lsquohidden springsrsquo!It is suggested the children in schools should have the final say in the new name, which is a great idea. But let our children be introduced to all aspects of our local history and allow them to understand how the way history is taught influences what we believe is important in contemporary society as well, and that there is no lsquocorrectrsquo view on this.Irsquod love to be part of that discussion and debate."},{"url":null,"title":"parents-launch-petition-school-bus-operator-change","story":"Families whose children attend two secondary schools in East Lothian were stunned to discover that local firm PrenticeCoaches would no longer be used to transport the youngsters when schoolsafter the summer.The news was broken to them by Prentice, which is based in Haddington, last week, sparking a furious reaction from a number of parents.Now a petition has been launched calling for Prentice to have the contract, which has allegedly been awarded to a rival firm, given back.One mother whose children attend Knox Academy in Haddingtonand are bussed in from Gford said that she was shocked by the news.She said: ldquoPrentice have been looking after our children for  years and they are being replaced with no consultation or discussion.ldquoParents know the drivers and trust them to look after their children.ldquoIt is beyond belief that the council would simply put a dferent company in place without even consulting with the families affected.A petition calling for theof Prentice has collected more than  signatures since it was launched online.It says: ldquoPrentice provide a community service where parents feel reassured and comfortable putting their children on the buses.ldquoWe believe East Lothian [Council] has chosen to put cost over service and safety.ldquoThere is absolutely nothing wrong with the current service.ldquoThis is simply a cost-cutting exercise which could potentially put our children at risk.Prentice provided bus services for Knox Academy and North Berwick High School but has now lost the contract for those services.Ross Prentice, the company boss, admitted that he was ldquodisappointed by the councilrsquos decision.The company said: ldquoIt is a sad day.

attracting golf fans from across Scotland and beyond.ldquoWith its range of  courses, high-quality accommodation, food and drink, and visitor attractions, East Lothian really does live up to its name as Scotlandrsquos Golf Coast.ldquoGolf is a vital part of the visitor economy, with the ripple effect felt in shops, hotels, restaurants and a wide iety of other businesses across the region.ldquoGolf tourism is worth poundm to the country annually ndash and around pound.million to East Lothian alone.Cast a great lightGael Pollitt, chair of Scotlandrsquos Golf Coast, felt that the event had cast the county in a great light.He said: ldquoThere is no doubt that the hosting of the ASI Scottish Open on Scotlandrsquos Golf Coast again showed East Lothian to be a golfing Mecca and the live TV streaming of the championship throughout the world will surely boost interest in all the county has to offer.ldquoDuring commentary and written reports there were frequent references made to the wide range of golf courses and the ersity of accommodation options available.ldquoOn our stand in the championship village, it was very encouraging to hear the comments from visitors who had travelled considerable distances of their desire toand play courses that they had not previously appreciated, as well as visit the many other tourist attractions in East Lothian.ldquoIn three weeksrsquo time, it is the turn of the ladies to compete on Scotlandrsquos Golf Coast, when again many of the top players in the world will be present.North Berwick Coastal ward councillors Jim Goodfellow and Jeremy Findlay also felt the event had gone well.Mr Goodfellow said: ldquoThe Scottish Open has been another success for East Lothian tourism and has brought positive worldwide exposure for the county and economic benefit for local businesses.ldquoWe were lucky with the weather and the use of The Renaissance course minimising local traffic disruption.ldquoThe credit for the smooth running of the event must go to our council officers and the event organisers.Mr Findlay added: ldquoIt was a great event for East Lothian and showcases Scotlandrsquos Golf Coast, which is now the premier golfing location in Scotland.Councillor Jane Henderson, a ward colleague, agreed that the event appeared to have gone smoothly but she questioned what impact it had had on local businesses over the four days.The councillor noted that a number of businesses were very quiet during the tournament but acknowledged that the success of the competition could leave a positive long-term impact.She said: ldquoYou have to look at both sides and that is definitely my stance.ldquoIn the shorter term, people have bills and rent to pay and are running businesses.ldquoIt is alright for tourism and economic development to say the long-term impact will pay off in East Lothian.Businesses painted a mixed picture when it came to the impact of the tournament.Chris Hansen, owner of The Open Arms in Dirleton, was among those enjoying a fruitful week.He said: ldquoIt was a good week. The place was maybe a little bit quieter during the day when it was centred on the golf course.ldquoIn general, we were quite lucky with the weather.Gullanersquos Co-op store was also affected by the tournament, with traffic encouraged to avoid the village.Greg Millar, store manager, said: ldquoWe actually did better than what I thought we would but didnrsquot do as well as the business thought we would,that makes sense.ldquoIt could have been a lot betterthe traffic was erted through Gullane.Meanwhile, Tricia Johnstone, of Fenton Barns Farm Shop and Cafe, felt the event had a detrimental impact on their business.She said: ldquoIt damages business more than increases it.ldquoA lot of people just stay away.But Carol Millar, from The Golfers Rest on North Berwick High Street, said the pub was ldquobusy, adding: ldquoOn Friday and Saturday it was absolutely crazy. I donrsquot knowit is because we are called The Golfers Rest but it was quite busy.Tom Drysdale, chairman of Gullane Area Community Council, which also covers Dirleton, said the impact in terms of flow of people and traffic through the village was ldquonot very signicant.He said: ldquoI went on Saturday and Sunday and there was a wonderful atmosphere. I think it was a very good thing for the area.ldquoI think it would be fair to say it did not have a major impact on the village of Dirleton itself but, speaking as a community council for the other areas, it was a big event for us and brought a tremendous number of visitors to the area and I think that has a long-term legacy."},{"url":null,"title":"provost-flies-flag-east-lothian-festival-france","story":"John McMillan, Provost of East Lothian, was carrying the Haddington flag through Aubigny-sur-Nere on Sunday afternoon during a parade in the Franco-Scottish Festival.The Haddington and Lammermuir ward councillor was flanked by his son Douglas and brother Jim, who were carrying the town keys.Mr McMillan is visiting the town on a family holiday and was joined there by Haddington Pipe Band.He the Courier: ldquoIt was quite a long parade and I thought I really should be flying the flag.ldquoEverybody in the pipe band played tremendously over the weekend.ldquoI am here on holiday but was asked to open the festival and the flag was here.ldquoI had been given the keys to the town on Friday evening at a formal ceremony and it was a real honour to march behind the pipe band as they were leading the parade.Liz McDougall, the pipe band quartermaster, carried the flag at the morning ceremony at the war memorial alongside the townrsquos veterans.A copy of last weekrsquos Courier ndash wrapped in tartan and red, white and blue ribbon ndash was also presented to the townrsquos archive.A link between the East Lothian town and Aubigny, which is between Orleans and Bourges in central France, dates back to .Residents of each town have regularly made the trip to their counterparts.The twinning links are evident throughout Haddington, with a sign outside Haddington Corn Exchange bearing the street name Place drsquoAubigny, and the townrsquos leisure centre also named after the French settlement.Mr McMillan explained the importance of the relationship between the two countries and the two towns.He said: ldquoI think the French are aware of the Auld Alliance but in Aubigny it is particularly alive and remembered with links to the Hundred Yearsrsquo War, when a Scottish lord rescued the town from the English and gave wood to rebuild the town."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/9739672.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"nicola-sturgeon-party-ruined-scotland---go","story":"Divisive partyCould not disagree more with Nicola Sturgeon ndash in particular, the years that she and her party have been running Scotlandrsquos affairs.They have the worst emergency services record, the worst NHS record, food banks have risen along with poverty, her own constituency is one of the most rundown and impoverished in the UK.That party has caused more ision in Scotland than the Tories, with their totally anti-British rhetoric and independence browbeating.I have heard that woman say Scotland is a multicultural, erse and welcoming place ndashbut notyoursquore English or favourable to Westminster, the home of British Government.I heard Blackford say to our Prime Minister that every time she speaks of Scotland support for independence grows.Only in the minority minds of the nationalist.Scotland was a far better place before they took over the reins and will only flourish again when they are gone.H McKean, via emailGoodbye to LabourI watched the Panorama programme about antisemitic behaviour of some Labour members and Jeremy Corbynrsquos response to them.I am now convinced Jeremy Corbyn is not fit to be prime minister ndash the people he has associated with and shared a  with should be a warning to all decent Labour voters.As long as he is leader then, after a letime of voting Labour, I am sad to say ndash goodbye.Jim Tees, GlasgowGreen space mysteryGlasgow once held itrsquos head high with its dear green spaces.

You could call it cowardice, the reluctance to see the player I wanted to win, but suspected would not, brought low. Such was the fight Federer put up, however, that by the fourth set I had rediscovered my nerve, and was back on the sofa, strapped in safely to prevent me hitting the ceiling whenever he won a rally.When Djokovic finally prevailed, the cameras politely kept off Federer for a few moments. Not that it would have made much dference. Unlike the French player who had sobbed uncontrollably after conceding the menrsquos doubles final, the Swiss maestro is made of sterner stuff. Of course being worsted must have been hard. The ferocity of the game spoke to how much each player wanted to win. As the football pundits like to say, this pair left nothing in the changing room, throwing their hearts and souls into combat, and playing through a level of exhaustion only marathon runners can fully comprehend.In a previous age, a duel of this signicance would have resulted in one contestant being carried, mortally wounded, off the field. From that perspective, Federerrsquos defeat ndash a silver salver and a substantial cheque ndash is still victory of a sort. In a gracious speech, he acknowledged Djokovicrsquos brilliance. The new Wimbledon champion was equally sporting, talking of the inspiration he took from Federer, not just for playing so well at , but throughout his remarkable career.Whatever encouragement thirty-something athletes take from the Swissrsquos astonishing performance, there is inspiration also in his acceptance of the result. To read and listen to sports coverage ndash indeed discussion of all competitive realms of le ndash such is the lionising of those who do well, defeat has become a dirty word. Yet without losers of the calibre of Federer, or Serena Williams, or so many other tennis and sporting giants, there would be no winners. Wherersquos the reward of winningit comes so easily there was never any contest in the first place  You can only have a championhe or she has had to do battle against a worthy rival. Why would the likes of Rafa Nadal or Williams spend so many hours practising, improving, and perfecting their gamethe threat of being beaten was not ever-present The near hysteria of our culture when celebrating those who reach No.  seems predicated on ceaseless success. Organisers of childrenrsquos sports days who insist everyone is a winner, and nobody should ever be stigmatised as finishing last, are doubtless well-intentioned. Yet in the long run, donrsquot they do more harm than good  All of us know, from an astonishingly early age, that we are better at some things than others. We donrsquot expect to be first in everything ndash some of us donrsquot expect to be first in anything. From the offset, nature seems to train us to accept a hierarchy of ability. First-class cricketers are not necessarily so adept at maths or art or baking a sponge. Those who are not especially good at any subject often go on to show they are every bit as valuable to society as the whizz-kids, and sometimes a great deal more.Read more: Menopause ruling is another huge win for womenrsquos rightsTo counteract the hype that goes with triumph, we must pay attention to its counterpart, and learn how to fail well. In whatever area you name, publicly falling short of a goal is something all of us will experience. Whether itrsquos not getting a job, or losing an election, getting on to a prize shortlist but tripping at the last hurdle, there is only room for one victor in every competitive situation. Since statistically we are likely to fall short more often than we win, we should be given guidance in how to cope. I donrsquot mean we should expect failure ndash though Presbyterianism offers a first-class DIY course in defeatism ndash but that we should be taught how to handle it. And by that I donrsquot mean denial.Listening to sports figures, politicians, or business leaders finding positives even when theyrsquove been trounced, is almost a sport in itself. It seems the very thought of not being the best has been brainwashed out of all competitors lest it influence their performance. Surely, though, we need to embrace coming in second place, or lower, in a healthy way  Defeat is to victory what day is to night, but to live in perpetual sunshine is unsustainable and, frankly, unthinkable.Phil Neville, coach of the England womenrsquos football squad, was refreshingly unafraid to discuss the f-word. He did not want an open-top bus parade when the team ed home after coming fourth in the World Cup. That, he said, would be to celebrate failure. He now wants the team to focus on learning how to win. Hersquos absolutely right, yet one hopes that this process will include a dose of realism, a cushioning of expectations, that allows for coming up short without a crisis of self-belief or losing face.Federerrsquos reactions after the final were a lesson in precisely that. He acknowledged that he and Djokovic had both had their chances to win, and he had blown his. Will those elusive championship points haunt him  How could they not  Yet while he will relive those moments, and wince at letting the trophy slip from his grasp, a sportsman of his calibre will have learned to be resilient. The number of grand slams top tennis players have under their belts is repeatedly trumpeted, but yoursquore never told how many they crashed out of.

Their chances of getting through the first round, indeed, could be summed up by a picture of a spherical object made of ice being flung into the fiery maw of hell.When asked to respond to US President Donald Trump telling four congresswomen on Sunday to ldquogo back to their countries ndash three were born in America, the other arrived as a child refugee ndash both Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt, like Theresa May, criticised the presidentrsquos comments but pulled back from calling them racist. Mr Hunt thought it was not helpful to use that kind of language about the US President. In other words, donrsquot say what you see. Wrap your measured, liberal response in pretty paper and tie it up with a silky ribbon. That will show him.: Why Iain Macwhirter is lookingforward to a Johnson premiershipThe House of Representatives did the necessary, prompting the President to double down by declaring he did not have a racist bone in his body. If only an X-ray could pick up such things. Even then there would be some running shy of the diagnosis. It was left to George Conway, husband of Trump aide Kellyanne Conway no less, to say it like he saw it. In a piece for the Washington Post, Mr Conway, a lawyer, wrote that he had thought the President boorish, dim-witted, inarticulate, incoherent, narcissistic and insensitive. ldquoNo matter how much I found him ultimately unfit, he added, ldquoI still gave him the benefit of the doubt about being a racist. But Sunday left no doubt. Naivete, resentment and outright racism, roiled in a toxic mix, have given us a racist president. I think we have a winner in this particular round of Catchphrase.Mr Trumprsquos aim is as brutally simple as it is ugly: make the  election about race, because it worked in . As for the aftermath, a country even more ided than it currently is, donrsquot worry about that for now,you ever do. This is not a clever political strategy but a failure of leadership on a breathtaking scale.Failure of leadership is not confined to Republican presidents. Inyesterday,  Labour peers laid the same charge at Jeremy Corbynrsquos door for his negligence in tackling anti-Semitism within the party.ldquoYou have failed to defend our partyrsquos anti-racist values, said the advertisement paid for by the peers. ldquoYou have therefore failed the test of leadership. Quite the eyebrow scorcher. No wonder Theresa May brandished it at the Labour leader during PMQs yesterday.: Suspension of parliament being consideredIt was notable that the signatories to the letter mentioned the Panorama whistleblowers, the former party staff who defied non-disclosure agreements to speak out. Almost all of them were young and at the beginning of their careers. They were risking a lot, and the strain of dealing with so much hate, and seeing accusations filed away with zero action taken, took its toll. Several found their mental health suffering. One contemplated suicide.It was left to these youngsters, as it was left to the four congresswomen in the US, to make a stand against, and to suffer the consequences of, other peoplersquos failure to lead. The older, the wiser, the more experienced and powerful, might come along in time, but they could not be counted on.Accepted wisdom has it that we are living in the era of the populist strongmen. The Trump, the Orban, the Putin, the Duterte. How did it happen  Because as societies we were seduced by the notion of simplicity. Le was busy and stressful, the political problems we faced were complex and seemingly intractable, the pace of change was unrelenting. Along came people who said they had the answers. Who said donrsquot listen to those so-called ldquoexperts who tell you things cannot be done. Who promised to sort things out because it was all very simple, really.: Easier to believe lie than seek truthThe phenomenon was not the sole preserve of the seemingly strong, or men. It was Theresa May, after all, who coined the phrase ldquoBrexit means Brexit and look at the chaos she unleashed. Nor is it only to be seen on the right. Mr Corbyn, or rather his closest aides, operate like a collective strongman, treating any criticism as an attack that must be crushed.There are indeed answers to societyrsquos ills, and at heart we know what they are. Homelessness  Build more houses, and tackle the deep rooted problems that brought the person to sleep on the streets. Itrsquoll cost you, and it wonrsquot be easy. End child poverty  Not cheap, and it will take time. No NHS waiting lists  Open your purse and expect a wait. Save the planet  Extremely expensive, as well as a pain in the backside. So much easier to believe in the simple answer or turn the other way.One would like to think the pendulum was about to swing back, as people began to see that this drive for simplicity was exacting its own price, whether it be in ever widening inequality or worsening social stre. But then this time next week, barring an upset, we will witness Boris Johnson becoming PM. Mr Johnson is a king among Simple Simons. This is a man whose answers to problems are so snappy they can fit on the side of a bus. A man who oozes laziness, who reeks of the quick fix that turns out to be the bodge job, who changes his position to please whoever he is speaking to at the time.The irony is that far from being strong, what all these leaders have in common is their weakness, and that will begin to show itself when their fortunes change. It may not happen in time to stop the next one coming to power, but it will happen.

Art should make you angry, scared, elated, aroused ndash it should grab hold of your heart and mind and shake up the emotional world in which you live. Art should tell you truths you didnrsquot know or were too scared to learn. Art should make you feel awe, pity, wonderment. It should renew you and nourish you. Art should inspire and humble you.Does Brown do any of that  I feel his work is for people who neither like nor trust the idea of art. To me, Brownrsquos paintings are comfy. Brown provides prettiness and safety. Itrsquos a warm bath, and thatrsquos not art. Brownrsquos work is home decor, interior design. Itrsquos meant to make your living room attractive, not to touch your soul or change you.The irony is that while Brown may not be creating lsquoartrsquo, hersquos certainly reflecting culture.

It sits easily alongside tribal tattoos, European city breaks, mindfulness, Love Island, Med holidays, Netflix and chill, retro breakfast cereal, breakfast for dinner, Ed Sheeran wedding songs, banter not a conversation, Sunday at the shopping mall, and arguments in Ikea. Itrsquos safe. Everyone does it. Itrsquos moribund.Itrsquos also understandable. Itrsquos not hard to work out why so many now chose cultural comfort rather than a cultural challenge.

The common theme in so much mainstream music is \"yoursquore great, you can do it, the world will love you, success waits around the corner\". Le is a constant summer festival and sooner or later yoursquore going to take to the main stage. Literature has been reduced to what supermarket buyers think a good book is ndash a -page pitch for a B movie thatrsquoll never get made.

Perhaps, the meme is the biggest cultural development of late. Brownrsquos art is meme-like ndash he repeats the same images over and over. The simpler it is, the more wersquoll buy it.Our lsquocomfyrsquo culture makes even discussing such issues dficult. To subject Brown to scrutiny as his company fails will be seen by many as cruel instead of what it is: a timely assessment of someone with a position in Scottish culture.

What could be worse in our cosy anti-intellectual society But Brown should be subjected to scrutiny as he affects Scottish culture and how itrsquos perceived.

By contrast, Mr Hunt has insisted he would not use such a constitutional manoeuvre.The amendment to the bill builds on an amendment passed in the Commons last week when MPs backed a proposal from the pro-European Tory Dominic Grieve calling for fortnightly reports from the Government on the efforts to restore the power-sharing executive.The new Lords amendment would ensure these have to be debated in the weeks before the Brexit deadline, thus making it theoretically illegal for the Government to prorogue Parliament in the autumnthe power-sharing executive in Northern Ireland had not been restored."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10153679.jpg?type=article-full","title":"tsb-launch-banking-selfie-app-over-55s-say-no-mobiles","story":"New research from TSB reveals that more than halfof over s say they never use mobile banking, despite being smartphone users.

We are in agreement with the council that we need to move forward. The past should not influence how we get to a solution. There is a phenomenal potential to be realised.ldquoWe just need to work together, it needs a resetting of the hourglass. It has to be done to save the building.

This is still included in one of the options, although Mr Souter admits it is unlikely at the moment.A team is currently carrying out a structural survey on the building, which Mr Souter says will inform which option is most appropriate.He said the Scottish Government has also got to consider whether it can support any development.ldquoWersquove got to establish the structural integrity of the building and that will inform all proposals going forward, the developer added.ldquoIf we could remove the scaffolding we would.

Donald Trumprsquos racism is about as subtle as his quf and always has been. But increasingly we are seeing Republicans delight in his racist tirades: his approval ratings among party members rose by five per cent in the wake of the tweets. A president whorsquoll boot political correctness to kingdom come  They couldnrsquot get enough of him.In three years, Mr Trump has transformed the Republicans from the big tent party of Reagan and Bush, into a suspicious, mistrustful, angry sect. He has torn off the veneer and revealed the seething resentment underneath. He has revelled in it and is now seeking to use it to propel himself all the way back to the White House.And he has done this almost entirely with words. Simplistic, inaccurate, often downright absurd words. Petulant words. Self-pitying words. Words that, in their very inarticulacy, resonate deeply with voters alienated by the high-flown oratory of Barack Obama. Words that respect no boundaries. If Mr Trump is an iconoclast, then political correctness is lying smashed at his feet.Will it be mourned  Well, it certainly should, because without it, we are sliding back to the s. In the UK too, where the Prime Minister-in-waiting Boris Johnson has bated Muslims just to endear himself to an increasingly radicalised Tory Party membership, considered speech can no longer be taken for granted, even at the highest levels of politics in its place is polemic and sneering derision.It is tempting to argue that the PC police had gone too far, that nursing hurt feelings had become a full-time occupation for some and that public officials were taking matters too far. Perhaps. Banning all religious references in childrenrsquos ldquoChristmas plays is one example. But snagging on these passing headlines is to miss the bigger picture and the real signicance of this phenomenon: language is one of the only weapons against hate that we have. If we abandon kind and respectful language, then vicious words and deeds will surely follow. Itrsquos already happening.In the st century, political correctness has been co-opted as a term of abuse to dismiss anyone, particularly those advocating for women, the disabled, ethnic minorities, transgender people or other traditionally marginalised groups, who suggest that we should exercise some thought about the words that spew from our lips. As such, it is a source of the most volcanic irritation for many people. Yoursquove heard the sort of thing. They donrsquot see why they shouldnrsquot be allowed to say what they want Britain is a free country isnrsquot it  Frankly they wouldnrsquot be at all surprisedthere was an EU regulation outlawing the habit of calling waitresses ldquolove. And in fairness, like many of us, they are afraid of inadvertently falling foul of the rules and being branded a bigot for getting the terminology wrong. But at its heart, political correctness upsets people because examining the words we use and the assumptions we make about others forces us to confront our knee jerk beliefs about them. And those might not be quite as kindly as wersquod like to think.That is why it matters. Anyone can incubate prejudice without meaning to after all many of us, to some extent, live in a bubble, whether racial or social or economic. It does no harm to examine our beliefs from time to time.We just need to relax about it. After all, most of us exercise political correctness in our personal lives every single day.Because what is being PC except editing the thoughts that spring to your mind before they exit your mouth, so as not to cause unnecessary hurt  Itrsquos just showing consideration by another name. We all do it all the time. Most of us, seeing a friend in the street, would resist the temptation to comment on her expanding girth. Mothers and fathers donrsquot usually tell their kids that their singing is a bit rubbish. Wersquove all received gts that have made our hearts sink but only a truly malevolent soul would drop the china unicorn into the bin right in front of Auntie Sue. We exercise self-control to protect other peoplersquos sense of self-worth. And extending that courtesy to strangers helps to protect them in the same way in an increasingly hostile world.Some see all this as a veneer, arguing that kind words donrsquot necessarily denote kind thoughts.Undeniably. But kindness and consideration in our language, when all public figures adhere to the same rules, provide a sort of herd immunity by making it socially unacceptable to voice your darkest impulses in public. When this consensus is abandoned by the likes of Donald Trump and Boris Johnson, the prejudice lurking beneath is validated and the bigotry normalised.Mr Trump and Mr Johnson, who both spin themselves as honest and open, are in truth cynical and manipulative. Mr Trump knows that endorsing racial prejudice will galvanise his supporters and might win over some Democrats in marginal states, and Mr Johnson has been playing a Tory membership that believes overwhelmingly that parts of the UK are under Sharia law.The invasion of the public space with racist, misogynist, anti-immigrant and anti-LGBTI views ndash views that some of us had dared believe were in terminal decline in supposedly advanced democracies like Britain and the US ndash is a reminder that progress is not linear.The property mogul from New York has gloried in abandoning the consensus around measured, respectful language.

This was a substantial commitment but was vital for Scotland’s long term interests, preparing ourselves for the challenges of an ageing population. We’ve recently extended free personal care to cover all those who are assessed as needing it, no matter their age.MSPs also charted a dferent course when, following a change of administration in , parliament voted to scrap tuition fees in Scotland, restoring Scotland’s long and proud tradition of free education.Similarly, the decision to abolish prescription charges brought to an end what was little more than a tax on ill health. The NHS of course is the greatest, and most valued, example of a universal service where care is provided on the basis of need and not ability to pay. Our health service, like others across the world, faces challenges. But it is a real achievement of the Scottish Parliament that we have resisted the marketization moves south of the border while ensuring that under the current government Scotland’s AE departments are the best performing in theUK.On other occasions, the Parliament has led the UK in making bold policy choices, such as the ban on smoking in public places. Our Climate Change Act includedthe most ambitious emissions reduction targets of any legislature in the world and, as Health Secretary, I was heavily involved in the campaign to introduce a minimum unit price for alcohol, which we knew would play a key role in tackling Scotland’s unhealthy relationship with drink – another world leading measure.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"As the Scottish Parliament prepares to celebrate its th anniversary, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on both its journey and her own.\"  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on  years of the Scottish Parliament viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"It took a decade of hard work to make this policy a reality and I am personally very proud of the campaign, working with stakeholders, to persuade MSPs to back minimum pricing, as well as overcoming a legal challenge that went all the way to the Supreme Court.I am personally committed to making sure every child and young person in Scotland gets the best possible start in le. We have already delivered an increase in free, high quality childcare for all three and four year olds and extending entitlement to eligible two year olds and will increase it further before the end of this parliament.Scotland has also become a much safer society under devolution. Recorded crime has fallen to some of the lowest levels seen since the s. In particular, non-sexual violent crime has fallen substantially, thanks in no small part to the excellent work of the Violence Reduction Unit, which was established over a decade ago with cross-party support and is now being copied across the UK.In recent years, new powers have come to the Scottish Parliament and with those powers come increased responsibilities for MSPs to deliver for the people ofScotland.Income tax policy is now a key feature of the annual Scottish budget. We’ve used these new powers to introduce a fairer income tax policy, with most people paying less tax than they would south of the border – while continuing to raise revenue to support investment in the economy and public services.Last year Parliament passed the wide-ranging Social Security Act, paving the way for devolution of a number of benefits, as well as creating a number of newbenefits such as increased carers’ support allowance and best start grants for families with young children – and a new social security agency to deliver them. This new agency has a culture of dignity and respect at its heart and early feedback from service users has been overwhelmingly positive.I also appointed the first gender balanced Scottish cabinet and we are encouraging more women to stand for parliament, and bring a better balance to ourpublic le.Over the course of the Scottish Parliament consistent action has been taken to ensure communities have the opportunity to own the land they live and work on.Many communities have benefited from the right to buy that now covers rural and urban communities.Of course, the foundation of our country is a strong and resilient economy. That’s why we have slashed or abolished business rates for , premises –saving almost £. billion for our small businesses.We have invested in our infrastructure with all governments building new schools and hospitals and, of course, the iconic Queensferry Crossing.And, to help make sure we have the workforce we need for years to come, we have delivered just over a quarter of a million Modern Apprenticeships in the lastdecade.In April this year, new legislation to tackle controlling and coercive behaviour came into effect, giving Scotland some of the most robust domesticabuse legislation in the world.I’m also proud of the many steps we’ve taken to make Scotland a fairer society, including the introduction of equal marriage rights – attending one of the first same-sex weddings in Scotland is a memory that will stay with me for a long time.And we all worked together over many years to help Glasgow successfully host the  Commonwealth Games. This helped to inspire Scots to get more active,delivered new facilities and put Scotland on the world stage. It was a sight to behold.My final achievement is perhaps harder to quanty. There is no doubt that the re-establishment of Scotland’s parliament has profoundly changed our political culture for the better, with our nation’s lawmakers much more accessible to those they represent. It has also enabled us to have conversations we wouldn’t have had and to debate our own future, with the  independence referendum generating an increase in democratic engagement.Looking ahead, we now face the signicant challenges posed by Brexit which, of course, Scotland’s people and parliament overwhelmingly oppose. Given the long-term damage that Brexit will cause to Scotland, and the material change in circumstances this represents, I believe it is only fair that people are given the choice of whether to become an independent country. Indeed, the current SNP Government was elected on a clear manesto commitment that people should be offered that choice should Scotland be taken out of the EU against its will. Polls consistently show that people living here believe the decision on whether to hold a referendum should be a matter for Holyrood and not Westminster. Twenty years after it came into being, that is an important measure of the way people in Scotland view the Parliament and one that the new UK Prime Minister would do well to heed."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"July ,  at : pmViews are being sought on a strategy for the development of hydrogen projects in the county.

And I understand that it is very unfortunate that this problem, while unrelated to the air traffic controllers’ industrial action, has coincided with it. However, that is not much consolation to frustrated users of the service.“The issue here is that this is a leline service and there are no alternatives for people who simply have to fly. Local people and businesses in the Northern Isles need a reliable service, and we simply cannot afford local service-levels to be reduced.

The schemes are designed to protect electricity consumers in the North of Scotland from high costs of distribution in their area. In   this was done by providing an annual assistance amount of £ million to consumers in the area, which Ofgem estimates is worth around £ per household.Mr McArthur said: “It is simply unfair for islanders to be surcharged when so many households in our island communities already experience the highest levels of fuel poverty anywhere in the country.“If these plans are implemented, it will be good news for consumers across the highlands and islands. It’s also evidence of the benefits of pooling and sharing across the UK.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The move is a result of a partnership with the organisation PAMISwhich campaigns for these facilities, and has been supported by Transport Scotland.The move comes as a result of research highlighting that , people in the UK need such special assistance and facilities. Users include people with profound and multiple learning disabilities and people with a range of other disabilities including Cerebral Palsy, Motor Neurone disease, Multiple Sclerosis, stroke, some older people and other specic disabilities.The requirements are set out in British Standards, and include:The new toilets are already open on deck six of MV Hjaltland and MV Hrossey, and will be available on board MV Hamnavoe by the end of the year.“This investment is another sign of our commitment to making our facilities as welcoming as possible to everyone in the community,# said Stuart Garrett, managing director at Serco NorthLink Ferries.#It will open up opportunities for many people with disabilities and their familes to visit some of the most beautul parts of Scotland. It also supports those living on the islands when travelling to and from the mainland for leisure and essential healthcare.”The move is the latest in a series of measures aimed at improving journeys for all travelers. Earlier this month the company became the first Scottish transport operator to introduce the pioneering Neatebox support service. This followed improvements to the NorthLink website, disability awareness training for staff, and a new partnership with a sign language interpreting agency.Mum and carer Jenny Whinnet, who helped to start the PAMIS campaign  years ago, said: #This is an exciting development for families and carers.#It permits people who need these facilities to travel further afield confidently and with dignity. This is very dferent to the early years of this campaign, when it was so dficult for me to travel with my son Craig because there were no Changing Places toilets available.”Jenny Miller, Chief Executive Officer of PAMIS added: “We’ve been very impressed with the commitment and consideration shown by Serco NorthLink Ferries in developing changing places toilets on their ferries.#They have really listened to the stories from the families and people we work with and who feel excluded from so many activities that we all take for granted. We’re delighted that the Orkney and Shetland ferries will be the first in the country, and possibly the world, to have a Changing Places toilet.”Paul Wheelhouse, minister for energy, connectivity and the islands is pleased to see the new facilities up and running.He said: #This type of improvement is exactly why we set up the Ferries Accessibility Fund.#We know accessible travel not only enables people to enjoy equal access to our beautul country, but it also enables people to fully participate in society and improve the quality of their lives, so we want to continue to identy and remove any disabling barriers which prevent people from making journeys or lead to them having an unpleasant time on board.#It’s very important that Scotland’s ferry services are fully accessible, offering the best passenger experience possible to everyone and this targeted investment marks very welcome progress on that journey.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This has become more dficult with tightening data privacy legislation globally. The maritime world has been slow to adopt digital solutions and reluctant to embrace collaboration. We were very frustrated with the products available on the market being unable to offer a user-friendly but complete approach to industry-wide problems. Ankaa Marine was specically designed by seafarers for seafarers to offer the sector a simple solution.”Stuart Garrett, Serco’s managing director for NorthLink Ferries, added: “We never stand still and are always looking for ways to improve our operations.

Fty years later, it stands as arguably the greatest achievement of the th century and a testament to human endeavour and perseverance. Astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin spent just under  hours on the Moon, including more than two hours of field work at the lunar surface. Meanwhile, Michael Collins circled the Moon in the ­command module, perhaps best-positioned to contemplate the meaning of le or our place in the universe.Down at the lunar surface, ­Armstrong and Aldrin performed several experiments, but arguably their most important task was to collect the first ever samples of Moon rock. Apollo  ed  kg of lunar samples to Earth. It was to be the first time that scientists were able to analyse Moon rocks in Earth-based laboratories and set in motion a series of discoveries that continues to this day. Over the past decade, I have been extremely fortunate to lead several projects working on Apollo samples at The Open University. Thanks to the Apollo astronauts and the curators at NASA, researchers such as myself – who weren’t even born when the Apollo Moon landings took place – are still able to study Moon rocks and feel part of a shared historical ­adventure.As the world celebrates the th anniversary of the Apollo  landing, The Open University also celebrates its th anniversary. By sheer coincidence, The Open University was awarded its Royal Charter just three months before the first Moon landing, heralding a new era, not just in space exploration, but also in higher education. Not surprisingly perhaps, The Open University has championed space research for most of its existence. We are very proud of our continuing leadership in this global endeavour. Indeed, it has been very exciting to be involved in the theory-changing ­discovery of water in Moon rocks, which had been thought to be devoid of water for almost four ­decades since the first samples were analysed in . Over the past decade, my team at The Open University have been undertaking cutting-edge laboratory research to look for water – and other associated elements such as carbon, nitrogen, oxygen – in Moon rocks. Our findings suggest the presence of a water reservoir in the Moon which is similar to certain parts inside the Earth’s structure. Furthermore, the distinctive chemical composition of the water in the lunar samples points towards water in the Moon having a common origin with that of the Earth and asteroids. Despite these Apollo samples ­having been collected  years ago, this field of research remains active, as many new questions have ­arisen through recent findings. Some of these new questions can only be addressed effectively by ing to the Moon with custom-built instruments to perform experiments insitu, followed by missions ing samples from areas of the Moon that were not visited by the Apollo ­missions. As water is a key commodity and a precious resource for supporting space exploration – it is required for le support and can be used in radiation protection and rocket fuel – finding water on the Moon has reignited interest beyond traditional space powers and a new ‘Moon Rush’ has begun – just look at the number of new spacefaring nations and private entities targeting the Moon. New research will explore the possibility of building habitats on the Moon. The availability of water on the Moon will play a vital part in realising our bold ambition of living there in the not too distant future. As we look forward to the next  years of space exploration, we must acknowledge the contributions countless iniduals made towards the success of what was once an unimaginable dream, of landing humans on another planetary ­surface. Just as the members of the ­Armstrong clan in Dumfries and ­Galloway several centuries ago couldn’t know that one of their descendants would walk on the Moon, we must continue to inspire and engage the future Neil ­Armstrongs of the world who will realise the dream of extending humanity’s presence to the Moon and beyond in a safe and sustainable manner.Dr Mahesh Anand is a reader in planetary science and exploration at The Open University.

The rebels fear this will happenthe new Prime Minister – ie Boris Johnson – is unable to muster enough votes from MPs to allow a no-deal Brexit, which is what will happen unless there is a breakthrough in the EU talks or a further delay.That’s the same no deal which, according to the Government’s own advisors, the Office for Budget Responsibility, will push the UK into a recession and force the Government to almost double public borrowing next year to £ billion, with an even bigger debt mountain to follow in -.: Brexit: MPs vote to block suspension of parliament to force through no-dealThe rebels don’t want Parliament to be suspended because this would mean they would be unable to bring down the Government, forcing a general election at which the people of Britain would be able to vote for candidates who support or oppose a monumentally foolish no-deal Brexit. A Government suspending democracy to avoid losing a vote in the Commons and a vote by the country, so that it can force through a policy that will trash the UK economy  Pardon  This rebellion was odd only because it was necessary.But Jeremy Hunt, the other candidate in the one-horse race to be next Conservative leader, managed to add an extra touch of the surreal when he accidentally failed to vote – while stressing he would have voted with the Government because it would be wrong, he claimed, for Parliament to “restrict the hand of an incoming Government in this way”. Just to be clear, his stated position is that it would be wrong to suspend Parliament and he wouldn’t do thatelected leader. So Hunt would have voted to allow something he doesn’t approve of, but didn’t.Four other Cabinet ministers, including the Chancellor Philip Hammond, also didn’t vote, but appear to have not done so deliberately, helping the rebels to win a vote that blocks suspension of Parliament – although only while there is no devolved government in Northern Ireland.Meanwhile, Johnson waved a kipper about to make a probably inaccurate point about EU regulations.

It’s a definite maybe from the First Minister!Notwithstanding his attempt to eat his words, he had been caught off guard, and had said what a growing number of people believe to be true: independence is a question of when, not .Since the European referendum in , people across Wales have seen the Westminster parties tie themselves in knots over what version of Brexit they want to push through.: Gordon Brown launches think tank with warning Boris Johnson could end Union: Benelux could be model for Scotland, Wales and England after independence, says Plaid Cymru leaderThis chaos has been a plague on the houses of both Labour and the Tories, and more and more people are looking on in horror, questioning whether this really is as good as it gets.But of course, the truth is this didn’t start in June . It started long before then, with a depressing democratic deficit which sees the interests of both Wales and Scotland side-lined.That the interests of the peoples of our two nations, and indeed the wills of our respective parliaments, can be ignored in favour of Westminster’s own interests is no new phenomenon.It is, sadly, a part of le in this United Kingdom.Indeed, it was the democratic deficit itself which drove Brexit itself. The result of the first European referendum was, in my view, the wrong answer to the right question. The question being: why are our voices not being heard by the powers that be What the past three years have shown is that the land of milk and honey promised by the leaders of the Leave campaign was never possible. Indeed, any version of Brexit would wreak unimaginable damage on Wales and Scotland, risking thousands of jobs and crucial investment in our communities.That risk increases exponentially when the next British Prime Minister takes office next week. If, as expected, Boris Johnson does indeed become Prime Minister, the occupant of  Downing Street will be a man who relishes the prospect of a no-deal Brexit.He is a man who has talked openly about cutting Scottish spending and seizing control of regional economic policy – rather than allowing spending decisions affecting Wales and Scotland to be made in our respective countries.Let us be in no doubt that these are very serious times which require all of us to think very seriously and soberly about the kind of future we want for our nations.The choice we face has rarely been starker. On the one hand, the insular, narrow nationalism of the British establishment and its obsession with delivering a nightmare Brexit come hell or high water. And on the other, a bright, prosperous future as independent nations at the heart of Europe.I know what I would prefer.More and more people are realising the sad truth that the current set up of the United Kingdom is incapable of serving either of our nations well.One such person is, of course, the de facto Deputy Prime Minister David Lidington, who penned a memo which said that Wales feels “failed” by Westminster. Indeed, he said that “we cannot be complacent about Wales’s attitude to the Union and independence”.His answer  To improve the “branding” on the few projects in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland that are funded by the UK Government.He sees that Westminster has failed us. He sees the series of infrastructure projects cancelled. He sees the fiscal gap. And yet he fails to do anything to remedy the situation.His shallow response exposes the contempt in which the British establishment holds our two nations. ‘Slap a union flag on it,’ he might as well have said, ‘that’ll pacy them’.Post-independence, our closest friends and allies will always be the other nations of the former UK, but let us not be fooled into thinking that the UK as it stands is a partnership of equals. It isn’t.In a speech in Edinburgh a couple of weeks ago, I proposed that the independent nations of Wales, Scotland and England adopt a model of cooperation based on the Benelux countries.That would be a kind of post-independence union – a voluntary association of sovereign nations, sitting above each independent nation. It could include shared institutions such as a parliament, council of ministers, and court, all in addition to the respective national institutions.Such a model would foster a more equal and congenial partnership between our nations than could ever be possible within the United Kingdom.When Wales and Scotland do choose an independent future – and it is only a matter of when – I also happen to believe England would benefit from an equal partnership as much as our two countries.This ongoing Brexit psychodrama has put the UK on hold: standing still, rudderless, without effective government. It is fraying, not just at the edges, but right through its body politic. Meanwhile, the rest of the world is moving on.This won’t go on much longer. People can only take so much before they choose a dferent, better path. For both our countries, that path can only lead to one future: independence.

As the population increases, this will become more relevant in terms of the overall pollution created, and no doubt, something will have to be done. Whether sea based farming of certain foods may reduce the pollution, but much of agriculture is still based on land and the production of meat will still create problems related to greenhouse gases in terms of land used for meat production and or crop production as well.

Gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included! Learners on this path can also become alert to common logical fallacies. Even those who like Ian, with a preference for physical sciences, can benefit. Happily don’t need to be much of a scholar to spot an ad hominem attack. With all due respect for Ian’s past achievements in the physical sciences, it would be nicehe could make his points without belittling others #kids included. That’s a normal standard “of decency and tolerance” btw.I so agree with these word #gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included!#. You do so hold yourself in such regard high Peter, now go glue yourself to a train or bus to prove your point!But just at that moment, as though at a signal, all the sheep burst out into a tremendous bleating of- #Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better!# It went on for five minutes without stopping. And by the time the sheep had quieted down, the chance to utter any protest had passed, for the pigs had marched back into the farmhouse ”.And what are you doing Ian to save the planet And what would you suggest the AHS and the SIC do Ad Hominem attacks # playing the man not the ball # are often used by those who don’t have much of an argument to begin with. Instead of dealing with whether the young people have a point or not, generous-spirited Ian opted to have a go instead.Logical fallacies show lazy thinking, masking an absence of creativity and independent thought. Ian’s trollswipe above looks Ad Hominem in approach st first, but he is also using the Tu Quoque Fallacy. This is where you accuse the opponent of hypocrisy to avoid answering their charge. Self-effacing Ian thus avoids addressing the possibility of his own hubris or lack of self-knowledge.Should I have made things easier for him and asked what his actual beef with the climate protestors was  He says “Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid”and demands that everyone should be able to answer “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ” before taking a view. Perhaps he will educate us by answering his own question # sticking to terms that demonstrate tolerance and decency of course. Nuclear Free Council, Declair Climate emergency,climate justice what a load of utter bunkum. Especially stop allowing political activists to exploit our children.I put forward the question : Is nuclear power the only solution to stop greenhouse gas emissions and the only way to stop climate change progressing further  It may be the worse case scenario in terms of our power demand solution, but what are the alternatives to our demand for energy without causing further environmental and ecological damage to the planet by in using fossil fuels or cleaner alternatives like wind or solar   It has been suggested the Sahara Desert could be used for solar energy to power Europe, but how much land would be required and could this be expanded  The alternatives to fossil fuels may be cleaner, but how would this affect global weather patterns or the depletion of species due to the destruction of natural habitats being replaced for energy production Very sadly the SG SNP has committed to wind energy with its catastrophic environmental damage and only intermittent supply, but that is the policy of the scientically ignorant and utterly stupid.Thank you for your comments, Ian. I fear humanity will have no choice but to go nuclear for its energy production in the future.Alternative resources, like wind or solar, may be the short term answer, but as mentioned, the downside to this is the large amount of land which will be required with the ability to vastly expand as demand increases. What would be the environmental damage and the destabilization of le on the planet have in the long term with such technologies  There is also the issue of economics dictating progress on future energy production, and would this be counter-productive due profits taking priority over progress and the reduction of the pollution into the environment  I agree with your comments Ian, in regard to nuclear based energy production. However, like many issues to do with progress, something catastrophic will have to take place before we realize we should have acted sooner.There it is again, the abusive and arguably ignorant use of that word “stupid”. Having reread all contributions above it seems Ali denies there’s a problem by saying there are dangerously low CO levels, John distracts by arguing the council should care more for child poverty, and Ian disparages, disparages and disparages again. Are all three attempting to harmonise from the same alt-right reactionary hymn-sheet Ian’s singular approach is getting between him and his key message. I’ve long been puzzling as to what makes the good doctorso determined to overuse petty insult so freely, but it would be helpful to know just whathis specic problem with climate change protests is. If he could but answer his own Ice Age question to Brian , his motive might become a little clearer. And apologies in advance to Ianhe has already made his point and I’ve missed it, but it wasn’t me who thought it smart to surround it with invective. Wouldn’t it be just lovelyIan could contribute tolerantly without using putdowns  It’s almost as though he needs them to build himself up# Oh. Hold on# Eureka!#Are all three attempting to harmonise from the same alt-right reactionary hymn-sheet # What a plonker, Peter, just cannot resist going political. Is thisLabour or SNP talking, he often points in both directions or is he now Green Maybe the characters on here who hate the idea of young people protesting about climate change should head down to the school and start shouting some of this stuff over the wall.But, then again, that might make them see . . . well . . . insane.Folk writing to the paper to have a go at the protesters is one of the most depressing contributions to local public debate imaginable.Hopefully, though, the usual naysayerswill only encourage them to do it more.There#s nothing wrong with anyone, of any age, having an opinion on whatever they like, and expressing it. But in their own time, only.The problem with this is that participation in this protest was permitted and facilitated,not encouraged by the education authority, which by default is an endorsement of the opinion being expressed in the protest and the timing method by which the protest was made, by the education authority.Education authorities and schools are supposed to be impartial, by granting #authorised absence# status to a politically motivated protest, that impartiality is now seriously called in to question and a dangerous precedent has been set.There was no reason other than a cynical publicity stunt for this protest to take place during the school day. If those still at school feel strongly enough to organise a protest like adults do, that#s fine, let them, but also like adults, it#ll have to happen in their own time, or they suffer the consequences of #unauthorised absence#, for it to be taken seriously.If they want to play in the big bad world, they play by the big bad world#s rules, not by special favours like this was.Only a few nutters are #impartial# about climate change these days.Do you mean that civil disobedience would have been better Well said Mark! The evident concern trollingis intended to deligitimise the voice of young people who, lets remember, are meant by right to have a say in matters that concern them. Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens. Therefore no one involved in supporting the reported protest has done any wrong, other than in the eyes of seemingly knee-jerk reactionaries who may well be hiding their true motives. Artfully comparing these identiable young people to Orwell’s unthinking farm animals, in order to subvert their point# well it more than lacks sensitivity and compassion. It is desperate, pitul and contemptible in equal measure. It may well also fall foul of observing normal standards of decency and tolerance that contributors to these pagesare meant to adhere to. Those joining the protest were not “stupid”, as has been claimed above. The overuse of that intolerant word may be though. I note you mention #Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens.# now could you explain how taking time off school and striking for the declaration of aclimate emergency makes the child an active and responsible global citizen  I rather feel they are being played by our Greeny ignoramuses and SNP political propagandists! Never mind, I am sure they enjoyed their day off school.Nuclear power  Thatgreat physicistRobert Oppenheimer , on seeing the first atomic bomb explode said with horror—-“ I am become death , the destroyer of worlds.”. The people of Japan and Chernobyl have had a taster and I suspect they arenot eager for a repeat. .However,Shetland is####..Hmm.Rock on.Haydn, Thorium reactors, not Uranium! no atom bombs, no long term isotopes decaying for millennia. Almost infinite clean energy with really cheap fuel.Where would your preferred site be for the Shetland nuclear power station be Dr Tinkler  Aith  Bigton  Would bring plenty work to the west side. You could include it in your manestoyou stand for the council again.Well, Ray Purchase, it is already here. Thousands of Shetlanders have had radiotherapy and had their lives saved by a nuclear atomic reactions of one type or another.I seriously doubtthere is a single person on Shetland who has not had their own, a member of their family or close friends le saved by the products of nuclear reactors.Are you so moronic as to deny that or is that a bit too deep for you to understand or Oh dear Dr Tinkler, it seems you’ve come down with a nasty case of whataboutery. I didn’t ask you about the undoubted benefits of x-rays and radiotherapy I asked you where you would build a nuclear power station in Shetland. Now do you think you could give a straight answer to a straight question  Physician heal thyself!If thorium proves viable, I would be happy for such a station in Lerwick. Safe, clean, small and less damaging than the district heating woodchip waste burner we have at present and infinitely less toxic. I also asked is that a bit too deep for you to understand  # So it seems to be!!Well done Ian, you answered the question! There was a lot of unnecessary waffling and needless aggression but you got there. So, in the incredibly unlikely event of a, totally safe, nuclear power plant being built in Shetland you’d still want it as far away from where you live as possible. Fair dos.Instead of nuclear power or gas have you ever put any thought into wind power  I’ve heard that they don’t cause any carbon pollution at all, so they’d be ideal. They’re very pretty too and scientic. Like an actual windmill, I’m a big fan.Sadly Ray, you are being misled. take Viking for example. Peat disturbance alone. over  kilometres of tracks, the ground footprint of over  square kilometres. A fair amount of COreleased there. Then tens of thousands of tons of concrete basses.emissions, Chatham House.  kilometres of the interconnector, Copper plastic!!! Now just imagine the peat is so unstable that helicopters are being used, just to move survey teams to reconnoitre the site. Tracked vehicles to damaging for the peat!! . Just what is that carbon footprint  Laughableit was not so sad!How something you and Mark Ryan Smith may understand. The very latest scientic information on controlling climate change “Tree planting #has mind-blowing potential# to tackle climate crisis” , now would not planting a tree be a more rational action for these children  That would be the sensible, intelligent and educated option. PS, could someone please inform the SIC SNP SCT and Green Lunatics!No one here has denied climate change Brian Smith. Just a discussion on the merits or otherwise of the School children#s strike. Our youngsters being encouraged to jump on the #Greta Thunberg# bandwagon. There you really do have a sacricial lamb to the European Green lunatics but that is another really sad story!You mustcarefully, Mr T.Well, Brian, I have never denied Climate change. I just dispute the best way to combat it.Deft footwork here from Ian. His, and his hero Farage’s position # not that he cares to own up to it # is not that there is no climate change. Obviously the climate changes over time. What he is conveniently avoiding are the questions around cause and appropriate response.Please do not make up speculative little stories porkies Peter. Farage is not my hero, however, I find him infinitely preferable to Corbyn and Salmond, however, here is not the place to digress further.Will Hell freeze over before Ian tells us what he presumes the protestors are ignorant of  Answering the question he posed Brian is not too mammoth a task for him surely. I suspect he is trying to dodge it for a reason.Read and weep Peter. If your intellect stretches that far. !! In the most simple of Science, It is set out below. The protestors are ignorant of the very most basic understanding of carbon capture and the prevention of climate change. Trees!! Only the very most utterly stupid, like yourself cannot see the wood for them!It is not clear the protest had a position on biomass, however Ian has firmly stated the need for those taking any position to be able to answer #how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age #Ian has thus far excitedly cited three articles, none of which reference any ice age. The first: #Tree planting ‘has mind-blowing potential’ to tackle climate crisis#, has Professor Crowther emphasising #it remains vital to reverse the current trends of rising greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel burning and forest destruction, and bring them down to zero# this is needed to stop the climate crisis becoming even worse and because the forest restoration envisaged would take - years to have its full effect##Reafforestation, necessary as it is, isn#t no silver bullet, nor a speedy enough solution, though many on the protest would likely love to plant some trees.The second and third articles focus on biomass, which is contested.To help Ian make his point, does he mean the Cryogenian, the second last ice age or the Little Ice Age  Again, other than to spread scorn and belittle, what is Ian#s actual point Sorrymy point is beyond you Peter. My question # “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ”That would require a thesis at post-graduate level to answer. Hardly space here! My point was that these children simple to not have the science to have a considered and informed opinion based on knowledge. The science is actually simple, I suggest you look it up and read it.Lest anyone thinking of studying the sciences, physical or social, be put off, Ian’s approach to advancing a scientic argument is far from typical. Thomas Kuhn made a very useful contribution by proposing that as a science advances some innaccurate claims will inevitably be made and indeed built on, but will later be corrected as sufficient contrary evidence emerges. Hawkins himself corrected some of his own foundational work. A settled consensus generally emerges over time through reasonable and reasoned dialogue and argument in which peer reviewed sources, research evidence and the thinking they provoke are made apparent.This is perhaps one reason why the Shetland Times asks contributors to observe normal standards of decency and tolerance for the opinions of others. It helps to bring forth the truth.It is, however, more than unusual for anyone taking themselves seriously to make a strong central scientic claim then refuse to back it up, clary it’s meaning or intent# unless of course Ian is proposing rhetoric, cant and distracting insult are now sciences, in which case top marks are due to the happy fellow.What a load of pretentious twaddle. You have outdone yourself here Peter. The word Science simply means knowledge, no more no less. It is just as simple as that.Whilst he remains intent on running away from clarying and substantiating his own point, here is an easier question for Ian: Why does he call Greens lunatics  There must be some point of disagreement between him and them, in his own head at least.That would be self-evident Peter. Read up the following. Bio-Fuels, palm oil plantation. Diesel fuel promotions, particulates. Germany non-nuclearpolicy,brown coal burning. Shetland exports clean gas imports polluting wood chip. Tree planting reverses CO build up, wood chip more polluting than coal burning and deforests huge areas. The EU % of renewable, Biomass .Greenies promote non-nuclear. more people killed in wind farm accidents in Uk than nuclear ever has. All the above would indicate a somewhat lunatic approach from the Greens. Now we have, using helicopters to survey Viking Energy sites as peat too unstable for tracked vehicles to reach, unbelievable!!! I hate to say the cult of #Greta Thunberg#,depression, eating disorders, and anxiety attacks,Asperger’s syndrome, high-ing autism, and OCD. She also suffers from selective mutism and self-harm. The sacricial lamb of the Greens across Europe. The inspiration behind the school strikes!!!!! Nowthat#s not lunatic, what is Ian’s position on global warming is either well grounded or is, well, hot air. He knows how this goes. Either he has a reputable theorist publishing an article in a reputable journal, or even a weblink to a news story referencing such, or he doesn’t. Because some vested interests have bought and paid for their own pet scientiststhere may be dferent opinions regarding whatever his as yet unclear point was with his unnamed and undated second ice age. If he really wants to be taken seriously he should put up or# consider his alternative.C’mon Ian, one reference to one reputable scientist backing up whatever it is you so obviously don’t want to say. You know you can do it.I am would be intrigued to opinions relating to climate change due to agriculture and what would be the answer to providing food but reducing or stopping climate change due to agriculture. I may be wrong but I believe agriculture produces  times more greenhouse gases than all of transportation put together, but this has, conveniently, been avoided by the media and scientic community. There is a terrible dilemma between producing food to this of attempting to reduce green houses gases and the progressive climate change taking place Both Ian and Greta Thunberg are right tho. We are not taking climate change seriously enough and we are confused.One minute providing grants to preserve Shetland#s peat carbon store, and the next proposing digging acres of it up, releasing all that carbon, to build Viking.Giving out paper straws in McDonalds with juice in a plastic cup .I mind askingabout planting trees on my croft. They said #oh we dont want these clumps of trees any more, not our landscape#, when I had always thought tree planting was good.Such a mixed message. Why dont we have a green rating system like we have for our washing machines. You could rate biomass, nuclear, windfarms from construction to operation in terms of green to red, so we would know where we are in the scale with our choices.Any way, still have a patch of high hill that would be great for a mini woodsI referenced Greta with a very heavy heart, a truly exploited child whose background would fire concern with any child specialist in the UK, psychologist or Social worker.Sorry, Johan, who isn#t #taking climate change seriously# Theresa May and the Tories are taking it very seriously, indeed, passing Mrs May#s unilateral # net zero# plan into law. The Treasury says it will cost over £ trillion , enough to fund the salaries of , nurses for  years.Too little for Greta Thunberg and her #Extinction Rebellion pals, apparently.This will find its way on to consumers# electricity bills, including those in fuel poverty, a clear majority of homes in Shetland #  percent, before the recent price hikes.The Shetland Labour Party that I grew up with was concerned with alleviating poverty, not creating it. They were not interested inwinning #Green Blue Peter Badges# for futile, bourgeois bagatelles like#tackling climate change#, without any hope of success.Britain, far less, Shetland, can achieve nothing alone.The only candidate to exhibit concern for Shetland#s poor is Ian Scott.Im confused. You state that the Tories are proposing  net zero and then you say Labour creating poverty.I am very seriously concerned about fuel poverty everywhere and especially in Shetland. I hope that there are no price hikes in our fuel bills, this is something we need to resist, and I also hope more help is forthcoming for retrofitting better heating systems and more insulation to improve housing quality.Please do not try to tell me what I believe.Johan, I don’t recall you ever mentioning fuel poverty before. Do you support or oppose “ net zero”, which was done in knee-jerk response to the campaigns of Greta Thunberg and her pals “Extinction Rebellion” Only, you have been supporting Ms Thunberg’s “climate emergency” campaign at local level, have you not Mrs May’s , nurses salaries for  years isn’t “emergency” enough for them, they want more.You can huff and puff as much as you like, the cost will find its way to the fuel poor, increasing their number.I put it to you that you cannot simultaneously support Greta Thunberg AND the fuel poor, whom you have now mentioned for the first time.Mr Scott has been arguing for Shetland’s poor since long before he became a councillor.No John I have not been supporting Greta#s campaign locally and yes I have mentioned fuel poverty before and I think I can support greener politics and the poor. It is an important point tho, how we are going to pay for it all. I heard somewhere the Tories are going to pay for it from the proceeds of G.Johan, I responded to your comment above that Greta Thunberg is right .You have also defended the Shetland schools strike “climate emergency” demonstration in this self, same thread.I quote: “Both Ian and Greta Thunberg are right tho. We are not taking climate change seriously enough#..etc..”That sounds awful like you think Mrs May committing  years’ worth of , nurses salaries isn’t “taking climate change seriously enough” If you are now saying that you do not support Greta Thunberg and do wish to tackle Shetland’s lamentable fuel poverty, will you be making a clear, prominent statement to that effect in your campaign literature Including your and Shetland Labour’s proposals for solving the fuel poverty The twisting of my words is really uncalled for, and completely ignoring the main point of my post which is that we need a green rating system to stop you all arguing about what is green and what is not # but then you enjoy the fight too much and would poo poo any system anyway I suppose.Strange move of support from Wir Shetland to Ian Scott  You#re scraping the barrel, now, Johan, getting personal. After your Up Helly-Aa performance, your comment about #enjoying the fight# is, frankly,a bit rich.It appears you are not prepared to make the campaign commitment I suggested. That#s ok.I#m not supporting anyone yet as I haven#t heard from all the candidates. I merely pointed out that Mr Scott is the only one so far to have shown any real concern for Shetland#s poor. He needs to say more about that. Under the present arrangements #climate emergency# will dump on the fuel poor. They have votes, too, of course # more than  percent of the electorate.Good luck with your campaign.Given his concern for the fuel poor John Tulloch will presumably be supporting whichever candidate puts the cancellation of Brexit first and foremost in their manesto  The largest driver of upward pressure on heating bills over the past two years is the devaluation of the pound following the Brexit vote. Greta Thunberg had nothing to do with it. In the event of further declines in the value of the pound post prime minister Johnson increased hard Brexit probability, the suffering of the fuel poor will continue to worsen as the wholesale price of gas becomes relatively more expensive when purchased in pounds sterling.The  dilemma that John Tulloch posed to Johan Adamson could equally well be phrased thus: I put it to you that you cannot simultaneously support Brexit AND the fuel poor.I apologiseI have gotten personal. Be as naesty as du wants, I just cant fathom why you need to be so  Breakfast TV only this morning were talking about how the market is not working, people not changing utility supplier and these people paying more as a consequence.Its surely not fairyour contract runs out that they are able to leave you on a higher rate Action on fuel poverty needs to include tackling the inequalities in the market as well as action to make our houses warmer.Ok, Johan. I’ve made my points about fuel poverty and there’snothing I want to add.So forgive meI don’t digress into bickering about who has or hasn’t been “naesty”. Readers may judge.Good luck with your campaign.Yes, Ian can answer a question when he chooses to. And there is sense in some of what he says. Wind farms on peat, for example, happen when commercial interests chase subsidies, so it is up to governments to get the correct approach. Not all that blame goes at the Green’s door, and they are either correct to claim there is a climate emergency or they are not.On the climate emergency Ian’s thoughts can only be guessed at. They have something to do with an ice-age, which is appropriate as progress towards getting him to answer his own question is, as yet, glacial.A big problem inside these debates stems from some people get beguiled by fake scientic claims. This is why genuine people making genuine scientic claims are generally happy to back them up by referencing the work of the real scientists involved. This offers folk who may or may not be less expert than Dr. Ian Tinklersome protection from charlatans with an axe to grind. Again,Ian is serious, rather than just being a contraryIan, he will reveal his ice-age source s. Or would doing so would reveal his actual movitation  C’mon Ian, youknowyouwantto.I actually sent them to the Times. They failed to print them as perhaps regarded as irrelevant pertaining to the school strike. I will do so again so Peter can untwist his knickers.The book you really should read, Mr T., is The Uninhabitable Earth by David Wallace Wells. Things are far more precarious than you think.David Wallace Wells. I would rather believe scientic specialists in ious fields than blindly take the word of a Journalist, Brian. He appears to hold no scientic qualication of any type. Writing for theis not reliable science training any more than writing for the Mail..Try reading it.Abruptclimate change , at younger dryasfor years also because of meteorite strike in Greenland. We still haven#t founda proper way of storing spent nuclear fuel, i can seethe repository at Sellafield being under miles of snow through the many ice ages to come before it issafe again.The nuclear nonsensewas never about cheap and safe electricity it was of course about weapons grade plutonium tons,produced here in Scotland alone,why that amount when a few tons could polish off the entire planet does anyone know Do we trust Boris and fruitcake farm with this ,aye right- their record speaks for itself! Maybe the bairns protesting about climate change holds a candle of hope up - -we are all going to need it.Graham Fleming, Thorium breakdown isotopes have short half-lives. Long term storage is nor an issue. Ask a standard grader that is beyond your understanding.Incidentally, the global stockpile of separated plutonium is about  tonnes. That is  tonnes too much, however Thorium reactors produce none at all. Sad you cannot get your facts straight Graham Flemming, so very SNP.Having read these pages for a long time Peter, it should be apparent by now that Ian is a dental surgeon by training and therefore qualies for Dr status.No need to have a PhDor any other bits of paper !Ok, well thanks to Ian, andthe Times did withhold the links as irrelevant to the school strike they maybe had a point. It was Ian that insisted to Brian Smith way back when that this issue was relevant, for whatever reason.I#m still not clear what Ian draws from these articles though, or why anyone would have to have this knowledge to take a view on the current level of threat, but I get that global warming isn#t about to lead to another ice age. I don#t recall the protest saying it would# It#s a welcome change to have Ian express himself without resort to petty insult though. Long may that continue. On his earlier point on science, however, I#m not sure most scientists would agree science means knowledge only, as Ian proposed, without including the search for it by using scientic methods.But here is the big unanswered question # whatever it is Ian take from these links # does he, or does he not, think we are facing a climate crisis  If we are then surely the kids are right to be concerned, especially as some government sponsored action on climate change is potentially green-wash.Slight problem with the colour test Johan.About % of men have problems when distinguishingbetween red and green .

The Loch Ewe farm has failed the required environmental standards for nearly  years. Mowi, despite virtually unlimited resources, were apparently unwilling or unable to make the necessary changes. broadcast in May.In January , the Scottish Parliament#s Rural Economy and Connectivity Committee agreed to undertake an enquiry into the state of salmon fishing in Scotland and in November  the regulatory body SEPA published proposals for a revised regulatory regime for the finfish sector. Within these proposals, SEPA said it would begin a programme of work to #modernise the regulation of existing sites#.Mowi#s head of environmental management, Stephen MacIntyre, said that the company wanted to #align its growth# with recent recommendations. The company had plans to sustainably grow their fish production levels over the next few years by #expanding into new high-energy farming areas located further offshore#.Bill Whyte, convener of the Wester Ross Area Salmon Fishery Board, said he welcomed Mowi#s recognition of the wild salmonid habitats and added: #We will expect further clarity about the process of biomass relocation. However,Mowi can provide evidence through EIAplanning and SEPA regulatory structure that the relocated biomass will have reduced potential impact on wild migratory fish, then we would be prepared to support biomass relocation on a conditional basis.#*A spokesperson from the Scottish Environment Protection Agency , said: “It is really encouraging to see that industry is proactively choosing to consider more sustainable locations for fish farms, away from more sensitive waters where pressures on the marine environment are greatest. “SEPA’s new regulatory framework for marine cage fish farming, launched on  June, , combines more accurate modelling and enhanced monitoring to encourage a more sustainable approach to the siting of fish farms. “In practice, we anticipate this will lead to fewer fish farms in shallower, slow-flowing waters and more fish farms in offshore locations where the environment capacity can better assimilate wastes. The new framework is designed to actively support operators who are seeking to relocate to more sustainable locations, and through improved practices and the innovative use of new technologies, reduce their impact on the marine environment.#They went on to add: “Indeed, our new framework provides exactly the type of flexibility and outcome-focus Mowi outlines it is looking for.Within this new framework, we will consider each inidual proposal on its merits against the legal standards.We encourage Mowi and other operators to work with us and other interested parties to explore their innovative proposals under our new framework.We look forward to doing so."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Kara-with-100m-IM-Gold.jpg","title":"inspirational western isles swimmer kara hanlon wins four gold medals at international island games in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine July.And the -year old was not the only WesternIsles athlete to celebrate a podium place in the shadow of the famous rock, asmore joy followed in the pool and in the athletics stadium.Isla Budge won bronze in the -metres freestyle event, while in Thursday’s triple jump final Mary Macleod won silver and Heather MacKinnon took bronze.Eriskay jumper MacKinnon had won gold in the event in Gotland two years ago with a shorter jump than it took to win third this time around.Hanlon’s week of glory began on Monday whenshe retained the  metres breaststroke title she won in Gotland in .

They have provided assurances that she will not be disadvantaged as a result of losing out on the experience of acting up nor will she be victimised in any way.

The maximum fine for serious speeding offences is £,, rising to £,caught on a motorway.Joshua Harris, director of campaigns for Brake, said:“There is absolutely no justication for any driver to be travelling at such excessive speeds – more than twice the national speed limit in some cases – putting themselves and others in grave danger.\"The number of drivers caught speeding at over mph highlights some deeply concerning issues with speeding across the country and makes clear the need for action. Anyone caught travelling at such speed should always face a ban – we have to make sure these dangerous, selfish drivers are taken off our roads.“The Government must invest in national roads policing as a priority to provide the police with the resources they need to get out on the roads and act as a true deterrent to dangerous driving. The law must also be used to its fullest extent in penalising such dangerous behaviour, making it clear that speeding will not be tolerated.” Four forces recorded more than , motorists exceeding mph last year. West Yorkshire police recorded the most with , followed by Kent Police with , then West Mercia Police with , and Surrey police with ,.Inspector Rosemary Leech: “The position of the Police Service of Northern Ireland on speeding is absolutely clear. “Excessive speed for the conditions is consistently one of the principal causes of the most serious road traffic collisions in which people are killed or seriously injured on roads across Northern Ireland.  “Drivers have to take responsibility for their own actions and by speeding they are causing a danger to fellow road users. “Every time you hear about a fatal or serious collision on the news, there is a family, a circle of friends, a community plunged into mourning.  There are many other people across the country how are having to learn how to cope with le changing injuries after being involved in serious collisions.“This is why it is critically important to remind all drivers that there are consequences to breaking the speed limit and driving in a manner that does not consider the safety of all road users. Police will continue to enforce the law and are determined to make Northern Irelands roads safer. “In , the number of speeding detections rose by .% from the previous year, consequently the number of offenders who are caught travelling at higher speeds is also likely to increase. “Removing excess speed from the road safety equation should be the easiest thing that every road user can do. If we all stop speeding, more people live. If we all stop speeding, fewer people have to contend with le changing injuries.“If everyone slowed down, did not drive after drinking or taking drugs, wore a seatbelt and drove with greater care and attention then together we can save lives on our roads.”"},{"url":null,"title":"taoiseach should contact parties before discussing backstop change sinn fein","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthThe OpenNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

A consortium led by Granahan McCourt, the last remaining bidder for the three-billion euro contract for the rollout of rural broadband, was announced as the preferred bidder in May. But representatives of Eir told an Oireachtas committee last month that they were “certain” they could deliver the plan for less than one billion euro. The company had previously submitted a bid of . billion euro before making the decision to withdraw from the process. Communications Minister Richard Bruton told his Cabinet colleagues on Wednesday that the reduced-cost proposal put forward by Eir for the rollout of broadband for more than , homes and businesses across the country was not feasible. Mr Ring said Eir had lost out on the opportunity of their own volition. “They had an opportunity. They were in the bidding game and they pulled out of the bid and they created part of the problem that we have now,” he said. Mr Ring added that a preferred bidder had been chosen and the process now needed to move forward. “We cannot open the process again or we won’t have broadband in rural Ireland for the next  years,” he said. The Mayo TD maintained they should have stayed in the processthey wanted to win the contract. “If they really wanted the contract, they were in the process, they should have stayed in the process, and they would have been considered like everyone ,” he said. “They pulled out of the process and created a problem. I want them to stop now telling us that they could do it cheaper.” He also said that he was “shocked” at the criticism being levelled at the government by Fianna Fail over the plan given thousands of people across rural Ireland were waiting for high speed services to be delivered. “I’m shocked that Fianna Fail are against broadband in rural Ireland, now they’d want to make up their mindthey’re for broadband for rural Ireland or they’re not,” he said. “They’re speaking out of both sides of their month. They’re saying one thing in Dublin, to please the supporters they have in Dublin, and they’re saying something  in rural Ireland.” He challenged Fianna Fail party leader Michael Martin to state whether the party was going to support the Fine Gael-led government when they sign the contract. “We’re about to sign that contract. Are they going to support us on that contract,” he asked. He added: “I want to know now are they going to support the broadband. The people of rural Ireland want the broadband, need the broadband and are entitled to broadband.”"},{"url":null,"title":"may to use final leadership days to give public sector staff 2bn","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthThe OpenNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The Committee then asked architect William Barker to estimate the cost of the renovations to the old building as well as the cost of a plain new place of worship.Mr Barker’s financial quote for the construction project said that the revamp of the old church would cost £ and a new church would be £,. To put the overall estimate into perspective, today the combined  figure of just over £, would be worth over £,.The records of Burt Presbyterian Church show that a Committee meeting on February ,  it was decided upon the casting vote of Rev Ross to abandon the renovation scheme and the idea of building a new church was then put before the congregation at a meeting on February , .The go-ahead for the new building was dependent upon the congregation subscribing an additional £ more than they had already promised. When that was agreed by the congregation, plans to construct the new church were given the green light for the year .Financial pressure on the project was immediately eased when Lord Templemore subscribed the entire £, but further collections were made in Derry, Newtoncunningham, Crossroads, Raphoe, Strabane, St Johnston and Carrigans, Knowhead, Fahan and Inch.Rev Ross himself reported back that he had gathered another £ in Belfast and Lisburn.With the money in place, William Barker was tasked to prepare plans for a meeting house that could accommodate  people, to have a plain roof, double windows, buttressed walls finished with cement dashing and windows with cement plaster. The church pews were to be pitch pine with walnut top rails.The location of the new church, it was decided, was to be in the upper corner of the ground filled by the old building with the entrance door facing the present gateway in line with the entrance of the old meeting house. Two Porrett stoves sunk in each aisle were to provide the heating.The lineage of Presbyterianism in Burt is one that stretches back over three-and-half centuries. But, as the city of Derry began to grow after the Plantation of Ulster, the Presbyterians of Burt travelled there. In the city at this time, Episcopacy, or the governance of the church by a clerical hierarchy was established by law. But, services were conducted at St Columb’s Cathedral and St Augustine’s Church on the walls to suit the views of Presbyterians.Back in , a Presbyterian minister in Derry was deposed for failing to conform to the views of the Episcopacy and another  fled from the city to avoid being imprisoned.By , the Presbyterian Congregation in Derry was still languishing when attempts were begun to bring preachers over from Scotland.As evidence of the persecution of those of the Presbyterian tradition, a William Hampton, who had been brought into the city by Presbyterians such as Campsie, Burnside and Early was implicated for preaching at a large meeting house which they had built within the city’s walls and just a few yards away from the mansion of the established church’s Bishop.This ‘affront’ to the Anglican tradition could no longer apparently be tolerated by the church authorities.On Sunday, September , , the Bishop decided to take action and with the Mayor, a judge, the city’s Sherrf and other officers they visited the meeting house where they found the Presbyterian congregation praying with William Hampton.It was recorded that they were: “Praying and preaching openly, and not according to the established Liturgy and order of the Church of Ireland.”A “riotous” confrontation took place, the leaders arrested and the church was promptly shut down. This situation continued until August ,  when devoid of anyone to lead them in prayer, the Derry Presbyterians asked for Hampton’s services until another preacher could be appointed.In , Rev Robert Rule of Kirkcaldy in Scotland accepted a call to minister in Derry and was installed that year.Some  years before Rev Ross set foot in Burt and application was made to the Presbytery of Laggan by an Alderman of Derry, John Craigie and a merchant, Mr John Fisher together with William Cunningham of Burt to ide the Parish of Templemore into two congregations. This came about in  and the previously pilloried Rev William Hampton ed from Scotland and was ordained at Carnamaddy on October  that year.Another  odd years later, there was a dispute over parish boundaries within the Presbytery of Derry when in  the people of Elagh, Coshquin and Ballynagalliagh refused to belong to Derry. But, it took until January , for the Synod to order “that the liberties of the City on that side of the water wherein the City standeth should be the bounds of the Congregation.”It seems the Burt people weren’t happy with that decision and appealed it, but without success.Another point of interest about Presbyterianism in Burt is that in  the worshippers from Inch who had attended Burt since  formed their own congregation under the Derry Presbytery. The mode of transport to Burt from Inch Island had always been boats. It’s said that on Sunday’s someone sat at a window in the Gallery of Burt church watching the tide and when it was just right, the person stood up and announced that ‘the Inch folk may go now.’During the -year ministry of Rev Robert Graythe old church had fallen into a state of disrepair. There were no pews and the aisles were covered by cold flagstones. But, previous to that there was only an earthen floor and no heating at all.In , the church had a new roof and ceiling installed. Prior to that it was recorded that it was a common thing for the rain to pour down on the heads of the congregation.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshNevertheless, the Presbyterian denomination in the district was flourishing. In , the Parish of Burt had , Presbyterians,  people belonging to the Church of Ireland and , Catholics.When it came time to finalise the plans for the new church under the watch of Rev Ross in , the final estimate of William Barker was £, and tenders for the construction project were advertised on April .Three bids were received. One came from R Colhoun in Derry who bid £, for the church and £ for its boundary wall. Another came from Joseph Colhoun, also from Derry who bid £, for the church and £ for the boundary wall. The final tender came from Matthew McClelland from the city who tendered £, for the church and £ for the wall, who having made the lowest bid won the contract.It was agreed that contractor was bound to have the house roofed, the outside of the walls finished and the windows installed by September ,  and ready for opening by March , .In the presence of shirt industry magnate, William Tillie, the High Sherrf of County Derry and many members of the congregation and people from the surrounding area, the foundation stone was laid on July , .The builder, Joseph Colhoun presented Mr Tillie with an inscribed silver trowel to lay the stone and a sealed bottle acted as a time capsule which inside were placed copies of the Derry Standard, the Derry Journal, Londonderry Sentinel, Northern Whig, Missionary Herald, Christian Banner, a photo of the old church and some coins. Lunch was provided for the dignitaries in the lecture room which was highly decorated with flowers and plants.The contract deadline was narrowly missed and the church opened in early May, .The opening services on Sunday, May ,  were conducted by the then Moderator of the General Assembly, Rev Dr G Buick from Cullybackey and the following week by Rev William Colquhoun of Fitzroy Avenue, Belfast. The minister’s room and toilet in the church as well as the pulpit and choir  were provided as gts by Mrs JB Mullin of Buncrana who was the sister of Rev Ross and the we of John Brice Mullin the Deputy Lieutenant of County Donegal.Fundraising events for the upkeep of the church were however still of course necessary. In , it was reported that Rev Ross organised a very successful Sale of Work and Summer Fete which were held on July ,  and  that year.The events took place in the Lecture Hall and a marquee in the church grounds and began at .pm each day. The proceedings were opened on July  by Mrs McMaster of College Avenue in Derry and the Mayor of Derry, Alderman JP Thompson oversaw the events.There was an Empire Work Stall, a Shamrock Work Stall, a Provision stall, a Sweet Stall, a Children’s Stall and Refreshment Stall. The Amusement Committee organised a large number of competitions that included shooting events. On the nights of the  and  July, a iety concert took place in the Lecture Hall. Over the three days, a firm called Neely’s operated a sidecar service ferrying people from Bridgend Railyway Station to the church and back again. The combined rail and admission ticket cost d and a specially laid on train took people back to Derry from Bridgend each night at .pm.The funds raised in July,  helped to renovate the Lecture Hall and other church buildings and to properly lay out the church grounds.As with many other congregations of all denominations across Ireland, the First World War impacted upon Burt Presbyterian Church. To reflect this, in August of  the Church Committee proposed to obtain an organ and a Memorial Tablet at the entrance of the church.Three of the congregation, John Buchanan, Stewart Buchanan and Joseph Downey were killed between -. And, in October  it was reported that £ had been collected for the organ and the memorial. The tablet was unveiled on Sunday, January ,  by Mrs Bowen, we of Colonel William Bowen DSO and the preacher on this occasion was Captain Rev WP Hall and a Guard of Honour travelled to Burt from Ebrington Barracks in Derry for the event. The tablet also remembered  more men and women from Burt congregation who had served in WWI.After the Great War and the partition of Ireland in , many of the working-class families connected to Burt Church moved into Derry city and other part of the North and many more who had served in the war had not ed to the area as work was scarce in this era. The drop in numbers within the congregation was reflected by the names recorded in the Communion Roll Book between -.Rev R W Ross resigned from active duty as Minister of Burt Presbyterian Church on July ,  and he died aged  at the City and County Infirmary in Derry on Sunday, July  after a long illness. The Church Session and Committee met later that day and paid tribute to the long and diligent service that had he had given.A deputation from the church was due to travel to Belfast the next day to meet with the Presbyterian Union Commission and they went ahead with the plans despite Mr Ross’ death as there would not an opportunity for another meeting for at least another two months.The Union Commission was proposing that Burt and Netwoncunningham congregations should be amalgamated under one minister, but the Session and Committee of Burt flatly rejected the suggestion.In June of  the Committee looked at the issue of enquiring at the price of a memorial for the late Rev Ross and a stained glass window and in February of  a Mr Haslett submitted sketches for a memorial tablet and his proposals were accepted. The memorial tablet was unveiled by Rev Ross’ widow Bessie on Sunday, June , .Rev Robert William Ross had married Bessie in  and in his will left a total of £ s d. He was buried in Derry City Cemetery.Upon her husband’s passing Bessie lived firstly at Castlehill Road, Belfast and later at Bognor Regis and then Pallant, Chichester. Following her death on July ,  she was buried there. Bessie bequeathed a total of £, s d to her two sons, Leslie Norman Ross and Arthur Gordon Ross, who were both doctors.A third son, George Harold Ross was born on May ,  in Derry. George was educated at Campbell College in Belfast and began a career in banking after emigrating. He enlisted in the th Canadian Battalion at the rank of Liuetenant on November ,  and later transferred to the th Canadian Battalion.  He saw action at the Somme in July,  and in April,  at Vimy Ridge where he was wounded and suffered injuries to his left femur and left foot. He was demobilised in July,  and ed to Canada where he became a farmer.CAPTION: The Reverend Robert William Ross."},{"url":null,"title":"derry university group says opportunity lifetime north west must seized","story":"The Derry University Group say that civic society has a responsibility to future generations to seize this opportunity to build a new, dedicated university in the North West.A spokesperson for the group told the Derry News: “This is the opportunity of a letime.

We have an opportunity here to create a legacy that will endure for centuries.”The spokesperson added that the North West must immediately begin revising its current ‘tenuous’ development plans so as to accommodate a new university.“It is a matter of great concern that so much of this region’s future planning centres on promises made by Ulster University, an institution controlled in Belfast and Coleraine, which has consistently failed Derry and northwest Ireland – and has broken promise after promise to this city - over the past six decades.“As regards the long-term planning of the region, it is not acceptable that we do build and deliver our own alternative. Derry and the North West have the capability, the determination and the vision to deliver a better future for ourselves.“It is reckless and perilous to remain entirely dependent on outside institutions that will always, by necessity, serve their own interests and those of their friends first. Why should we continue to acquiesce to those who have failed us, misled us and ultimately alienated us over six dferent decades ”The spokesperson added that a new Derry-centred institution, with a cross-border element under the auspices of the National University of Ireland, could help militate against the impact of Brexit.“Derry Strabane Council needs, as its first priority, to re-draft its City Deal to ensure that it can include a new independent university as its new anchor partner.“Council also needs to engage pro-actively with the Dublin and London governments to enact supporting legislation, and to secure resources, funding other support and accreditation for this new dedicated institution for the North West.“The positive momentum is there.

The committee was headed by Lockwood, who was an English academic. He produced a report on a second university for Northern Ireland he recommended not Londonderry but Coleraine.“Runner-up to Coleraine was the city of Armagh. It was not a sectarian decision it was made by an impartial English academic. It is slanderous to suggest that he was sectarian.”However, alluding to successive decades of underinvestment Mr Adonis yesterday told the Derry News: “No matter what the motives behind these decisions were, the result is that Derry has unfairly lost out and its young people deserve better.“The past should not govern the future. Yet the situation is getting worse not better.”Figures gathered by the Derry News under Freedom of Information legislation, and published last month, show that student numbers in the city actually fell from , in   to , in  .This comes at the same time UU created a new and much larger campus in Belfast city centre at a cost of £-m. The university has attributed a reduction in student numbers and “expansion challenges” in Derry to higher education budget cuts.At Monday’s debate, Baroness OLoan defended Ulster University’s position insisting that the building infrastructure at Jordanstown was not capable of being sustained leaving it with no option but to relocate.UU’s decisionWhile, Lord Empey, a former leader of the UUP, and Minister responsible for further and higher education who dealt with Ulster University at somesaid he supported the proposition of a medical school in Derry.However, he added that the decision of where to invest was down to the university alone and UU “made very clear to us what it wanted to do. It said: we want to rebuild our Jordanstown campus and put it in the centre of Belfast. Will you support us or not “It was not a question of Londonderry versus Belfast—that option was not open. It had made its decision.”Meaningful change can be brought about as a result of this report which, Mr Adonis says, is a signicant first step towards increasing student numbers in Northern Ireland and the establishment of a new university with its principal campus in Derry - \"I hope action will follow,” he added.“It is realistic to believe that Derry can have a standalone university since it is the norm for cities the size of Derry across the UK to have universities of their own. Derry is unusual only in being so acutely disadvantaged. It is scandalous that this issue was not addressed years ago.”Askedhe will continue to advocate on Derry’s behalf, he added: “Absolutely! I will follow the government’s report in September closely and continue to push for Derry to have a university with its principal campus in the city.

But, that short daily journey must have taken as least twice as long as it would have taken anyone  simply because almost everyone he passed knew him, stopped him and engaged in conversation with him.On the th anniversary of the school’s opening in  I was asked to help compile a book to mark the occasion. When I sat down to write a list of those who would have to be interviewed, John Dunne was the first name on the top of the pile.When I started to transcribe John’s interview it began like this: “In this era of media created ‘stars’, famous for nothing more than seeking fame-or infamy, in many cases-the tag of legend is one that is all too easily doled out.“Most people in their formative years can point to a mentor who influenced them greatly and provided knowledge and encouragement when these vital commodities were often all too scarce. More often than not, these people are unassuming and go about their lives in the same manner.“These people are society’s real legends and in the history of St Joseph’s, fewany, earned that accolade more than John Dunne.”That chapter of the book on St Joseph’s was entitled ‘One of nature’s gentlemen’, and there’s absolutely no reason to change that title for the purposes of this appreciation of John Dunne’s le because in my opinion its accuracy cannot be upgraded in any way.‘Big John’ as he was affectionately known to all former pupils of the school, made a positive mark on thousands of young lives in his four decades at St Joseph’s. It would be hard to find anyone that would disagree that the word big when applied to John Dunne not only represented his physical stature but also his intelligence and patience.By , the Dunne family had lived at Brandywell Road, Burnfoot and then back to Derry and more specically the newly developing Creggan estate.John Dunne began his career at St Columb’s College in  in the company of contemporaries such as Nobel laureates John Hume, Seamus Heaney.In  he told me: “I enjoyed the time at St Columb’s without really realising or wondering what le was about. There were people then who went back up to the College at six o’clock and studied until nine o’clock.“But, I and another man, Bill Smyth, who also ended up teaching at St Joseph’s, instead of going to the school, followed a great interest we had discovered-greyhounds. That was our main pursuit. Strangely, we both also ended up training as teachers at St Joseph’s College in Belfast which was linked to Queen’s University but separate in that it awarded its own accreditation.”It was at training college that John Dunne encountered a dilemma. Already well-known for his ability as a footballer, his lelong passion, he had to make the choice of whether he would pursue as a career as PE teacher.“I had distinct limitations, because when I was very young, I nearly died twice. When I was six months old and again when I was five, I caught pneumonia. I remember the second time and having to lie from about December to April before I came around.“I was in a sort of comatose state for a long time, but my mother God rest her, battled away and I survived. But, it left me severely limited in terms of stamina. In terms of pace, I was very quick off the mark, but I couldn’t sustain it. And, the further up you went in football, the more of a problem it became. I loved reserve football, but the full senior game was just too fast for me,” he said.In September  John began his teaching career at the newly opened St Joseph’s Secondary School in Creggan for the princely sum of £ per month. It was here that he spent the entire span of his professional le.The new school with its emphasis educating those who had not successfully navigated the old  plus exam, it was a ready-made home for John Dunne and many of his contemporaries alike. Like many of his era, John benefitted from easier access to grammar school system because of post-war changes to British education policy. But, also like many of his generation, John spoke candidly about his reservations on it. His words also revealed why he preferred the non-selective route through school.“The thing about going to St Columb’s is that we weren’t completely accepted. We were dferent somehow. The boarders who stayed there were the ‘real’ St Columb’s boys as far as the clergy were concerned.“There are things now that are still etched in my memory. Where I lived, there was a protest after a child lost a leg having been hit by a bus. The people were worried about the safety of their children so they weren’t prepared to let the bus keep travelling that route.“Anyhow, the protest could be seen from the College. A priest, who shall remain nameless said, ‘well, what would you expect from people like that ’“We took great umbrage at that. I had been through a kind of elitist system at St Columb’s, where you had to prove yourself in the first place by getting so many marks in an  plus exam, in English and Maths-and they weren’t easy. They were quite dficult examinations. I went to the Christian Brothers at they drilled us kept us on in the afternoon for an hour, got us up on Saturday mornings and drilled us and drilled us.“When I went to teach in a secondary school it was very dferent. You had children there that for one reason or another had fallen through the system. They hadn’t perhaps done themselves justice in the system that surrounded them. In my time at St Joseph’s there were children who should not have been there because they could not get anything out of the system at all, no matter how much we tried or how much sympathy we had for their position. But we did try.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“I had been through a system where I met good teachers, people who had made a good impact on my le. So, what I did when I saw what they were doing was imitate them. I wove all the goodness in other people into a fabric that I could use myself, and I found that it worked,” said John.At the end of John Dunne’s first decade as a teacher, the Troubles erupted on the streets of his native city. St Joseph’s geographical location meant that major disturbances often encroached upon the school itself. It befell people like John Dunne to provide a calm backdrop to the mayhem outside the gates of St Joseph’s.In  he said: “It was a very, very strange environment to be working in, because all hell could have broken loose in the immediate vicinity of the school at any time. There were teachers out on the streets, acting as buffers, trying tom keep a lid on things.“In practical terms, I found it very hard because in summer time it was very hot and you had to open the windows to let a bit of air in. But, there were helicopters flying about and the noise was unbearable and the youngsters couldn’t hear you. A lot of young people became involved and some of them lost their lives as a consequence.”Apart from a very quick but understated wit, John Dunne was blessed with a fantastic voice, full of dramatic intonation, that would have been the envy of many stage actors.As a teacher of the English language John had the ability the bring the most boring text to le and kept his students enthralled. He could have been reading the contents of the back of a cereal box aloud, but when he spoke people listened.The ability to relate a story, complete with an array of accents when required, was one that he credited his grandfather John Downey with.“He was a great storyteller. I remember as a young boy he used to take me early in the morning for his pension. We used to go to Mass about seven or eight o’clock and then go to the train station on the Strand Road and out to Bridgend for his pension and then visit people in the area.“But when we were walking, he always told me stories about haunted houses, about what kind of flowers were at the side of the road.“There seemed to be no end to his knowledge and then he could deviate and tell me another yarn. I just thrived on his stories.“I think also it was the way I was taught at the Christian Brothers. They were very precise about language. It’s become too loose now. People are very loose, especially when using mobile phones.“I’ve even read about the use of the apostrophe being lost. I was taught these things were important when you wrote something. I stuck to it and I tried to instil it into youngsters without being overly heavy about it.”John Dunne’s dulcet tones were employed again when Derry City FC re-entered senior football in  and for many years after he commentated on many of the games played by his beloved Candystripes.This interview with John Dunne was conducted in  at Pilot’s Row community centre. At this stage he had been retired from teaching for almost two decades. But, the huge capacity that he had to retain swathes of information was still very much evident.Asto prove that very thing, in the later stages of this conversation a young boy, no more than ten or eleven years old walked past and said cheerily, ‘hello John!’Without blinking an eye, John Dunne recounted the boy’s family history and how many of his relatives attended St Joseph’s. That was proof that you could take the man away from St Joe’s, but not St Joe’s away from the man.The interview with John Dunne ended with him speaking about the five decades since the school opened.He said: “It’s been some fty years, especially for somebody like me who has finished up living in the Bogside. When I got here, I was a little bit apprehensive about being someone who worked in St Joseph’s and being accepted into the local community. But, it’s no bother. I am on first name terms with people.“I was walking over to Mailey’s pub one night in the summer about .. It was a beautul night. There was a group of young men sitting in a garden. I was walking in the middle of the road and one of them came out and addressed me by my name.“He said, ‘John, there are not many teachers that could do what you are doing and walked through this area untouched.“That’s good to know I said.”CAPTION: The late John Dunne."},{"url":null,"title":"springtown camp monument officially unveiled next month","story":"A monument commemorating the Springtown Camp in Derry will be officially unveiled next month at a ceremony near the entrance to the former site it has been announced.The unveiling will take place on Thursday, August  adjacent to the North West Regional College Training Centre at  noon and will be followed by a Civic reception at the Guildhall at pm.The art installation will take the form of a Nissan hut in which the inhabitants of the camp were forced to live in deplorable conditions because of a policy of housing discrimination in operation at the time against the Catholic community.Springtown Camp was originally a Second World War United States military installation which was vacated after the end of the conflict in the mid-s. Over  families once inhabited Springtown Camp and occupied it around  because of over-crowded living conditions in Derry.The decision to squat in the former military huts, despite the fact there was no electricity, running water or means of heating, came after many families evaluated that these conditions were actually better than they were enduring.The camp became a focal point of the early civil rights agitation in Derry.Willie Deery, who grew up in the camp, said: “This monument is vital because the camp symbolises the precursor to the civil rights marches.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“It’s also somewhat ironic because  years after our mother’s were evicted from the Guildhall for protesting against the conditions at the camp there will now be a civic reception for us there.“This will be a recognition for our parents who had to raise their children in shocking circumstances. It will be an emotional day for us all. It’s not just about me, there were many hundreds of families with stories to tell but maybe I told mine a bit more forcefully.”In the coming days a crane will lt the one-third scale replica of a Nissan hut into place which were originally constructed out of iron welded together and covered in corrugated tin sheets.In , over  residents from the camp marched on the city’s Guildhall to lodge their complaints about their living conditions with the leaders of the old Londonderry Corporation as part of a long running battle with the former local authority.Willie Deery continued: “There is a famous Derry Journal photograph from November  when women from the camp marched on the Guildhall in protest after a fire. The mother’s in that picture are all gone but we are going to recreate that photo with their daughter’s standing in the same formation as the original picture.”CAPTION: An artists impression of what the monument to Springtown camp will look like after its installed."},{"url":null,"title":"statistics reveal missed targets department concedes ambulance service currently resourced","story":"The department of health has conceded that the current level of demand on the ambulance service exceeds available resources.The ambulance service has been dealing with a surge in emergency calls over recent years.Newly published Department of Healthstatistics reveal that between   and  , the number of emergency calls received by the NIAS increased by , from , to ,.In   the Western Local Commissioning Groupalone, which takes in Derry, received , calls – almost  a day.Aside from the Belfast LCG, the ambulance service in the Western area received the highest number of calls in the past year based on per ,-population.Category A calls are immediately le threatening and receive the NIAS’s highest priority with a performance target of arriving at .% of these calls within  minutes.During the last five years in NI, the percentage of Category A calls responded to within  minutesdecreased from .% in   to .% in  In   all LCGs fell well below this target, with the Western Trust the second-best performer at just .%.From December  to March  the performance across Northern Ireland has deteriorated.

Irsquom still in shock, she confessed.The highly-dedicated athlete didnrsquot start the competition that well, but she recovered well to lt bronze.ldquoI had a bad first shoot, which I put down to nerves. I then I had to work my way from the back over the next few circuits.Good shoots and strong running in the next three circuits is what helped to pull me up to bronze, she continued.ldquoMadeira was amazing.

I knew it could play to my strengths eventually, but being new to it, I wasnrsquot expecting to be as competitive just yet. I still have so much to learn and improve on, which makes it exciting, she enthused.ldquoOver the next few months I will have to chat with coaches and make a decision on the event I want to focus on the most.I will continue training all five events, but I think my main aim will be the Triathle Worlds in October in Florida.Suzie now feels that the time is right to put her toes into local waters so that she can improve her swimming discipline.ldquoNow Irsquove had a taste of open water swimming, its time to brave the Northern Ireland waters, so I can perfect my technique and become more efficient at sighting and swimming round buoys, she continued.ldquoI will also be back in the gym building on my strength again.

That is just an insult,” Edward O’Neill told the News Letter.Prorogation is the formal process that signals the end of a parliamentary session and brings nearly all Westminster business to a closeDuring a Lords’ debate on the Bill on Wednesday night, NIO minister Lord Duncan gave an assurance that all eligibility criteria procedures for a pension will “abide by the ‘no fault of their own’ principle”.Lord Duncan’s remarks followed the proposal from former NI secretary Lord Hain that: “The secretary of state must make regulations to give effect to a pension for those severely injured through no fault of their own during the period known as the Northern Ireland Troubles.”However, the wording of the final amendment, which was among a number of changes ratied by MPs on Thursday, stops short of blocking payments to former paramilitaries.The clause states: “Regulations ... must make provision as to the eligibility criteria for payments under the scheme which may, in particular, relate to: the nature or extent of a person’s injury how, when or where the injury was sustained ... and whether or not a person has been convicted of an offence”, and adds, “payments to be reduced or repaidin specied circumstances”.DUP peer Lord Morrow said he was “not entirely happy,” but added: “We did seek some assurances, and we got those assurances.”He said: “Whenever Lord Hain said that he was making it abundantly clear, that his aim was that a victim, in his opinion, was someone hurt at the hand of someone  in other words, it wasn’t self-inflicted.“If a victim is not treated as a victim, and a victim maker is not treated as a victim maker, then we will continue to have this problem and we will be ing to it.”Abortion: Radical liberalisation of NI law backed by huge majority as MPs Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Lord Empey said he had serious concerns over the speed at which the legislation was being rushed through the Commons, but said there have been y discussions around the definition of a victim in the Lords.“I think we are reasonably reassured but, when you are dealing with so many issues in the space of two days, it’s not the way to do business. But I think we’ve done the best we could in the time available.”Lord Empey said it was worth noting that, although the wording of the Lord Hain proposal stops short of blocking terrorists from accessing a pension, the debates in the Lords made it clear that the will of Parliament was former paramilitaries should not benefit. “Every single speaker took the same position,” Lord Empey added.“I’m not a lawyer, but the intention of the House could not have been clearer. In specic regard to the pension, I am happier today with what the minister has put on record,” • Two senior Alliance representatives have been challenged over claims only a small number of former paramilitaries are likely to benefit from the proposed Troubles pension.Stephen Farry tweeted his support for a Troubles pension to be implemented, and said: “This can’t be constantly held back due to a debate on where less than  people are in or out.”Trevor Lunn supported his party colleague, saying: “Less than a dozen perpetrators, half of whom would refuse a British pension anyway. Time to move on, swallow the pill for the greater good.”Mairia Cahill said she was “shocked” at the Alliance assertion, and added: “The scheme is open which means figures would change – however the real danger is the precedent it sets.”Former senior police officer Jim Gamble tweeted: “The slippery slope is suggesting that because less than  paramilitary thugs will receive a state pension paid by the taxes of their victims that some greater good is being achieved. Any terrorist receiving payment is wrong  you know it. You are on the slippery slope.”Stephen Farry’s tweet in full said: “Definition of a victim has been a long-running political issue. There are hundreds and hundreds of victims that continue to suffer from le-limiting conditions and urgently need help. This can’t be constantly held back due to a debate on where less than  people are in or out.”Mr Farry was responding to a comment from UUP MLA Doug Beattie, that said: “Perpetrators should not benefit from any Victims and Survivors Pension. We fully support a pension for innocent victims but it is not acceptable to include those injured by their own hand.” try catch  TrendingTributes paid to Northern Ireland road racer Darren Keys following fatal crash at WalderstownThe Twelfth  -

I also had the pleasure of meeting campaigners from across the UK as part of the Extinction Rebellion protests in Parliament.And I recently bumped into some students from Stanwell School who have been taking part in the climate strike movement and standing up for action on climate change and the climate emergency. I was glad to help get their and other constituentsrsquo voices heard on this in Parliament, because itrsquos not being debated enough - itrsquos getting lost behind other things.So whether itrsquos local action we can take on recycling and packaging, or global action on climate change and carbon emissions, we all need to do more to deal with an emergency thatrsquos going to affect us all for generations to come.I was out and about again in Penarth this weekend, along with a team of our fantastic Labour town and Vale councillors, talking to people about the forthcoming European elections. There was a lot of support for our clear Welsh Labour position backing a final say in a peoplersquos vote for the public on any Brexit deal.Following the mixed results in the local elections in England and Northern Ireland last week, there was much talk about Labour lsquobailing outrsquo the government. Let me be crystal clear on this ndash I will never lsquobail outrsquo the disastrous Tories on Brexit, and neither will the overwhelming majority of Labour MPs.We can resolve the situation, but not by any backroom stitch-up that would risk letting down both those who voted Leave and Remain. The only way forward out of this mess is to let the people have the final say on any deal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Remember to lock the bike to an immovable object in a well-lit, busy public area.Itrsquos important to keep your bike secure at home too -you keep your bike within a garage, shed or other such outhouse, please remember to secure your bike and lock that building at all times.If you own an expensive model, then make sure you keep your bike out of view of prying eyes and be vigilant when ing from rides.We recommend that you get your bike marked and registered it for free at ImmobiliseThe Penarth Neighbourhood Policing Team regularly hold bike marking events where officers will register your bicycle.

And under my leadership, a Conservative administration will proudly put the people of the Vale of Glamorgan first.ldquoNaturally, we are open to working with other councillors who share those ideals.ldquoOthers - including those who resigned from the Conservative party - will have to explain to voters where they stand on these issues - and I would urge them to back us, rather than propping up a Labour administration that was rejected by the Vale at the last election.Cllr Bailey said he had a six-point plan for the Vale.He pledged to deliver the Dinas Powys bypass stop inflation-busting council tax rises scrap proposed parking charges review the local development planto curb inappropriate development protect rural schools and oppose the Barry Biomass plant.Cllr Bailey said that he was also keen to improve engagement with the public, after a series of hugely unpopular decisions taken by the existing cabinet.He said: ldquoDuring the elections in , we promised to build a stronger relationship with local residents by consulting them on key decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, too many people feel that their views are simply being ignored and that Vale consultations are just tick box exercises. Take the proposals around car parking charges, or the closure of Llancarfan School. I donrsquot think anyone outside of the Civic Offices believes that those decisions werenrsquot already done deals, and thatrsquos simply unacceptable.ldquoAnother good example is the councilrsquos failure to listen to the public over Penarthrsquos original Victorian lamp posts.ldquoIrsquove been criticised for wanting to listen to the people who elected me, and I make no apologies for that.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John.

The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for. It will be realistic and fair for everybody.School improvementsThe new cabinet says delivering on major new school buildings is a priority for the new administration.Developments in the pipeline include new builds forPencoedtre and Whitmore High Schools, and expansion and refurbishment of Ysgol Gymraeg Bro MorgannwgAgeing schools in the Vale are set to get a pound. million cash boost for repairs.Llancarfan Primary SchoolLlancarfan Primary School was set to be lsquoclosedrsquoand moved to a new pound million facility in Rhoose.The previous cabinet had approved the plans despite protests from parents and campaigners.Cllr Moore said Llancarfan School move was ldquopremature - but did not commit to scrapping the plan entirely.ldquoIf itrsquos justiable itrsquos justiable, he said. ldquoIf itrsquos not, we will look at alternatives.ldquoItrsquos not an easy decision to take. Itrsquos something we have to take some time about.ldquoWhat Irsquom not going to do is jump or kowtow to people who shout the loudest.Cllr Burnett has previously tweeted the closure of Llancarfan ldquowouldnrsquot be happeningLabour were running the council.New roadsWork continues on outline business cases for two major new roads being proposed ndash the A to M link around Pendoylan and Dinas Powys Bypass between Barry and Cardf ndash but no decision has been made whether either will actually go ahead.The future of both roads rests on whether Welsh Government and the council deem them viable, and whether ministers cough up the cash to fund them.But Cllr Moore said he doesnrsquot think Welsh Government will find the money required for the Dinas Powys Bypass.ldquoItrsquos out of our hands, he said.IncineratorCllr Moore said he believes Welsh Government will order the Barry Biomass incinerator to carry out an environmentalimpact assessment.Cllr Moore, who has previously attacked what he termed ldquoscaremongering and lies around the biomass plant, said he did not want the facility in Barry Docks.He said: ldquoWe opposed it vehemently, both as a council and as a party and personally. It shouldnrsquot be there.ldquoBut now it is there it has to operate within legal parameters.ldquoIf it does, therersquos nothing anyone can do about it.The council refused the original planning permission for the facility, but a planning inspector allowed it in  following an appeal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/nstreet1.jpg","title":"belfasts north street arcade to be redeveloped","story":"Posted on Tuesday  June  by John Mulgrew A former Belfast shopping arcade left derelict after being gutted in a blaze more than a decade ago could be brought back to le amid fresh development plans. North Street Arcade was destroyed in a fire in , which caused severe damage to the floor and glass roof. It’s been sitting empty for  years, but once played host to a range of popular Belfast stores, including DJ and local punk pioneer Terri Hooley’s record shop, Good Vibrations. The plans to redevelop the arcade are included in a revised scheme called Tribeca Belfast – formerly Royal Exchange. UK developer Castlebrooke is planning to redevelop much of the north side of the city centre as part of a £m scheme. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. It has also been announced that architectural design firm Squire  Partners has been appointed to work on the amended proposals. The team from Squire  Partners will work alongside conservation architects from Belfast-based Consarc Design Group. Neil Young, chief executive of Castlebrooke Investments, said: “We are very pleased to be able to reveal our proposed amendments to our outline planning application for Tribeca Belfast, changes which we feel demonstrate that we have listened to feedback from the city. “We will continue to listen and today we have launched a voluntary public consultation process into these planned changes ahead of the submission of our application. Our community exhibition will provide an opportunity for anyone interested to see the new plans and we will be revealing more information about this in the coming weeks.” Murray Levinson, partner at Squire  Partners, said: “The mix of uses across the site – designed to attract a iety of retail, restaurant, cultural and workplace tenants – and the creation of new public realm, will ensure this part of Belfast will be active throughout the day and into the evening. Providing a large number of residential apartments with shared gardens, as well as a hotel, will create a new opportunity for people to live in the city centre.” And Graeme Moore, specialist conservation architect at Consarc Design Group, said: “Consarc Design Group is delighted that we continue to be involved with the proposals for Tribeca Belfast to offer our expertise in building conservation. As with the previous proposals, all of the listed buildings within this phase are to be retained, restored and adapted for a sustainable ongoing use within the masterplan, rooting the new development in the unique historical character of this part of the city centre.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/droad_1.jpg","title":"major new apartment building planned for dublin road","story":"Posted on Friday  June  by John Mulgrew The Dublin Road in Belfast A new serviced apartment building could be developed along Belfast’s so-called ‘Golden Mile’ on the Dublin Road, it can be revealed.

Entries are now open for the  Deloitte Technology Fast  programme.

Peter Allen, partner at Deloitte, said: “For  years, the Technology Fast  awards have celebrated the success and growth of Ireland’s leading indigenous technology companies. “It is fantastic to be able to look back and see how some of the companies which appeared on the Fast  list in the early days have become global businesses and market leaders. “The likes of First Derivatives and Novosco, who were early stage tech companies when they first made the Fast , are now major employers and shining lights within the NI economy.” One of the few Northern Ireland companies to have topped the Fast , appearing in it  out of the  years since the ranking’s inception, is Newry-headquartered financial software company First Derivatives. Shane Mulholland, senior vice president of marketing and operations at First Derivatives, said: “We’ve been involved with the Fast  programme since it began and have found it to be not only great recognition of every stage of the company’s growth but also a chance to meet peers and like-minded businesses who are striving to be leaders in their own fields.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/brexit_123234324234_web.jpg","title":"no deal brexit could cost ni  jobs","story":"Posted on Wednesday  July  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland faces losing , jobs in a ‘no deal’ Brexit which could have ‘immediate and severe consequences for its position as an all-island and UK economy, a government paper has warned.

Once again, it raises serious concerns over the agri-sector in particular, meat in particular, and beef especially, in regards to “increased vulnerability to low cost non-EU imports in the GB or NI market”. Its not just the physical goods, though as it says Northern Irelands IT sector is facing the cost of exporting services increasing, by an average of .%.
