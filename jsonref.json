It breeds real devotion, I\u0027ve found.\u0027Titchmarsh said: \u0027It is always a privilege to spend time in the company of His Royal Highness and none more so than when it involves our mutual enjoyment of classical music.\u0027It is typically thoughtful of him to choose to highlight the plight of his many musical patronages, alongside the difficulties that all musicians face, during an unprecedented period when enjoyment of live music has been curtailed.\u0027 A Royal Appointment will be broadcast on Classic FM tonight at 8pm, with Charles presenting a show himself tomorrow at the same time. "},{"url":null,"title":"Lance Armstrong bought entire tables dinner drinks screamed f him","story":"Share this articleLance Armstrong says in film that stepfather ¿beat the (expletive) out of me¿Lance Armstrong documentary gets off to quite the start"},{"url":null,"title":"Dominic Cummings dressed like GP","story":"Share this article \u0027He has asked me to repeat that account directly to you.

More useful, perhaps, is their inexplicable ability to navigate their way home from pretty much anywhere at distances of up to 700 miles in a day, and speeds of 100mph (with a tail wind), back home for a nice bowl of grain.‘No one knows how they do it,’ says James. ‘That’s why we respect them so much.’ But however pigeons achieve this, it made them perfect for delivering messages in war time (they are the most decorated animals of both world wars) and brilliant for racing. Yet even over 600-mile courses, they’ll never take the shortest route.So instead of travelling as the crow flies, they’ll follow the hollows of valleys, skirt thick woodland to evade hawks and trace the route of major roads, often going round the roundabouts and choosing the exit towards home.When Derek got his first pair of fan-tailed pigeons, aged seven, there were more than 100,000 registered pigeon racers. He started racing aged 13, has kept birds ever since and loves them with all his heart.‘It’s not a hobby, it’s a disease!’ he laughs. ‘Once you’ve touched one, you’re done.’ As was his first marriage, when his wife tired of his passion for pigeons.‘My second wife is much more understanding,’ he says.Indeed. She stood by happily as he gave up hundreds of thousands of hours to his birds, joined every pigeon club going, supported the annual shows in Blackpool and Epsom and encouraged their son, James, and now Elizabeth to do the same. Little wonder Elizabeth was up and running with her first breeding pair, Mr and Mrs Purplish, by the time she was seven.Just two years later, she’s ranked first overall at her local Bude Pigeon Racing Club, best junior racer for the Devon and Cornwall region of the Royal Pigeon Racing Association and is 29th out of 500 racers in the region!While pigeons are inextricably linked to the working class of the North, and of South Wales, today’s 20,000 members come from all over the UK, all backgrounds and include more and more women.The Queen is one of the industry’s most enthusiastic fanciers and recently spent £40,000 on a new loft at Sandringham for her 200 pedigree birds. Heavyweight boxer Mike Tyson has long been a passionate pigeon fancier and pins the start of his boxing career on the moment someone ripped the head off one of his prize birds, and he punched him, hard.The jewel bird in the Cook collection is Princess Pao, an 11-year-old who came second in a 600-mile race from Pau in southern France and has just laid a clutch of two eggs. The offspring, when weaned in 51 days, could fetch up to £2,000 a pop.Two thousand pounds! For a pigeon? But seemingly that’s nothing. James reminds me of Armando — nicknamed ‘the Lionel Messi of pigeons’ — which was sold last year for £1 million to a Chinese buyer and is now enjoying life as a feathered stud muffin.‘His racing days are over. Would you want to risk letting a million-dollar pigeon out?’ says James.Because however brilliant they are, some fly into power cables and turbines, others are picked off by birds of prey, some die from exhaustion and others mutiny and throw their lot in with the feral flying rats. Which means that the wait by the coop in the hours, often days, after release is the worst bit.‘Sometimes they’re shattered, sometimes you’d have thought they’d just flown round the garden,’ says Derek. ‘I had one come back. She couldn’t quite make it to the lofts — she dropped a few feet short and I had to pick her up, she couldn’t go any further.’His eyes suddenly look rheumy. ‘To think, a little thing like that can fly for 580 miles. In a day. It makes your heart pump.’Elizabeth is rather more sanguine: ‘Of course, I worry they are not going to come back, but I am excited to see if they win. Sometimes you lose one. It’s sad, but it’s just one of those things.’"},{"url":null,"title":"VE Day parties people drop guard caused coronavirus cases spike","story":"Share this articleUK hospital closes A\u0026ampE and no longer accepting new patients due to high number of coronavirus cases | The IndependentHospital forced to close A\u0026ampE ‘because of spike in coronavirus cases caused by people celebrating VE Day’ – The Sun"},{"url":null,"title":"BBQs garden socialising friends family bubbles green light month","story":"Share this articlePubs urge Government to cut two-metre social distancing rule to one metre so they can open up – The SunGarden parties and barbecues to be allowed next month, raising hopes people will see their parents again"},{"url":null,"title":"Coronavirus UK Slash social distancing allow pubs reopen say UK landlords","story":"Share this articlePubs urge Government to cut two-metre social distancing rule to one metre so they can open up – The Sun"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ecb5b8afbb1197d37d96eeef53be51485a0c039/0_731_1413_847/master/1413.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fa2bcfd7797daa793c7c3f3ff6a70b99","title":"its brought home the value of these roles lockdowns private sector heroes","story":"When the UK population was told to stay indoors, one maintenance team in Chester refused to let people in need of vital supplies go without. Two months on, Qwest continues to support the local community, delivering food, medication and even treatsThe effects of the coronavirus crisis extend far beyond those who have contracted Covid-19, with lockdown taking its toll on at-risk groups in cities, towns and villages countrywide. The past eight weeks have seen volunteers and local authorities rally together to help those in need. Efforts to help include work by the private sector, which has played its own part in helping those people who need it most.For energy and services company Engie, the Covid-19 pandemic has seen its teams support councils and local communities in ways that move far beyond their normal duties. The company, which has 15 major local authority partnerships and is active on regeneration projects in more than 400 communities, has deployed staff to help deliver resources, such as welfare boxes, through several of its contracts, including Qwest – its joint-venture partnership with Cheshire west and Chester council.Qwest’s engineering team was the first to distribute these urgent boxes to residents in the area and has continued to do so, delivering non-perishable essential food items to people who are shielding from the virus. Team leader Leon Cooke and his colleagues have swapped their usual maintenance roles to help deliver the parcels, working until 10pm on the first night to make sure 69 people got the supplies they vitally needed.“We pick up the parcels from Ellesmere Port Sports Village and then deliver them around the county,” says Cooke. With support from elsewhere, the whole team isn’t always required to help, and Cooke finds his engineers vying to get involved. “We get a real sense of achievement. We’ve got nine engineers and some days we’re only asked for two, so the lads are really fighting as to who can go out. We have work on, but everyone’s working from home at the moment – only urgent jobs are getting carried out maintenance- wise – so they’re champing at the bit to help the community. We’ve developed a ‘wheel of fortune’, so if we get a phone call saying: ‘I need two engineers to help out volunteering’, I spin and pick an engineer.”Delivering parcels isn’t the only way the team has been involved, with staff driving to Manchester to collect donated supermarket food, including treats such as Easter eggs, for the council’s food hub, according to Qwest managing director Ben Cummins.Cooke and a colleague also helped one resident who had recently been discharged from hospital by carrying out vital adaptations to his home. “He was in need of some grab handles in the bathroom, so we went out and fitted them,” says Cooke.Cummins adds: “Although it’s not our normal job, Leon and his team said they’d go in and help.”Qwest has plenty of stories of staff going the extra mile to help members of the community. In one case, a team member working in the contact centre took a call from an elderly resident with a disabled son and a husband with terminal cancer who could only eat soft food. Concerned about how long they would have to wait for the right food, the employee walked to a nearby supermarket, queued up, bought the food and dropped it off, meaning the family got it within a few hours of calling.On another occasion, an employee received a call from a diabetic resident who was shielding and hadn’t eaten properly for days. He was struggling to control his blood sugar levels. The team member did the shopping and delivered the food to the man – and his dog. “Our staff know the right thing to do,” says Cummins. “They’re highly competent and caring iniduals. They don’t do the job just for the money – they do it because they care.”Delivering food parcels isn’t the only way Qwest has shifted its work to help the local community amid the coronavirus crisis. Staff have also collected medication for residents, delivered PPE, and distributed PCs to council staff working from home. Qwest has also introduced an AI chatbot for the council’s website, to direct concerned residents to external websites for advice, and is providing security staff at distribution centres and at hotels that are housing people who are homeless.The roles team members have taken up may differ from their usual jobs, but volunteering isn’t anything new for staff who devote hours to helping the community on a regular basis, says Cummins. They helped to put a roof on a community centre last year and also worked on gardens at a care home. That desire to help comes from recognising that those affected could be their own family and friends. “One of our members of staff is 78. He is shielding,” he says. “The reality is we’re helping our wider community who pay our wages. Ultimately this is our family as much as it is anybody else’s. It’s about doing the right thing and recognising that we’re all in this together,” he says.Cooke agrees, saying that while staff are aware that by volunteering to help on the frontline they may be putting themselves at risk, they have the right equipment to stay safe and ultimately want to help. “There’s a sense of pride. We have a really close team – we all look after each other. From day one everyone was volunteering and wanted to help. One of our engineers has underlying health issues, so there’s no chance of him going anywhere, but he’s concentrating on maintenance tasks. We’re really happy just to work with the community and keep everything going with regard to the parcels.”Cummins says: “The question we’ve asked ourselves several times is, if we don’t do it, who will? There’s risk in everything you do, but it’s about balancing that risk, otherwise we’d end up with people dying at home, or having to go out and get shopping and putting themselves at far greater risk than we would be. It’s proportional, it’s managed risk.“The one thing I’d say on behalf of Leon and the other staff, our cleaners for example, is sometimes these roles are undervalued and overlooked. I think what this has brought home is the importance of what they do, and the value that they bring every single day, even when people don’t notice it’s there. When it stops, suddenly everyone notices.”This type of work carried out by frontline staff such as Cooke and his team has already been recognised by Cabinet Office minister Lord Agnew, who said: “The way we have seen many large organisations and their staff move from their normal day-to-day work into projects to help tackle coronavirus has been remarkable. They have been able to turn around projects very quickly, such as delivering hundreds of new ventilators to the NHS and setting up systems to deliver much-needed resources, including food parcels and PPE equipment, to those who really need it. Their work is a tribute to their organisations and a wonderful example of their commitment to working on behalf of the public.”This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

In West and South Yorkshire, an academy trust executive and a food services boss stepped in to see how they could help A delivery of food arrives at a doorstep. Inside the hamper are bags of pasta, tins of tuna, tomatoes and baked beans. There are also blocks of cheese, yoghurts, milk and cereal. It’s a basic shopping list, but for the children and their families receiving this box it’s a lifeline, meaning they are able to feed themselves for the next few days.“We’ve had calls from people in tears”, Pam Knox, chief financial officer from the Waterton Academy Trust, who has been delivering the food bundles. “If they’ve not been able to get out, or are pregnant, they’ve emailed and they are so, so grateful.”The closing of schools on 21 March had a knock-on effect for some children, as, at the very baseline of support from the education system, they have a few meals a day provided for them. While some schools are still open for key workers’ children and vulnerable children, there are families in every city, town and village who will be struggling now more than ever.“We’ve got some quite high levels of deprivation in some of our communities,” says Knox. “There are some sad stories out there. So in the early days of the pandemic, we talked about how best we could support our families.”The trust - which oversees 13 schools in West and South Yorkshire - partnered with ISS Education, a company that provides facilities management services and acts as caterers for 400 schools across the UK. The problem they faced was how to get the food out to the 550 at-risk children and their families while still observing the lockdown.Right from the start, both companies were adamant that they didn’t want to resort to food vouchers. Knox says: “I personally didn’t want to do that because I didn’t feel that the food would necessarily get to the children involved. For me, it would have been the last resort.”Working alongside Linda Cregan, food services director for ISS, they trialled a packed lunch scheme for the first two weeks, where the kids would walk to school to pick up a sandwich and a yoghurt. “What that meant was that some of the children had to come to school to pick those up,” says Knox. “It simply wasn’t working – we had surplus food. They didn’t feel comfortable coming to school to pick something up every day. They really didn’t see the benefit of it.”When the prime minister announced the lockdown, he urged the public to use food delivery services. Orders for online grocery delivery across the UK jumped up. Tesco, Asda and Sainsbury’s sites all crashed with the strain of business, while Ocado’s CEO noted that demand spiked to 10 times the normal level. Knox and Cregan realised that home delivery might be the answer to their problem: they too could deliver a hamper of food to those who needed it the most.“We designed the hampers to give some store cupboard staples like pasta and bread, that meals like lunch or dinner could be made from,” said Cregan. “Then we made sure that there were fruit and vegetables in there.Similar to other pricier food boxes available to buy on the market, they also had the idea of including ingredient lists and recipe cards. Cregan says: “It was to give an idea of what you could do with those ingredients and to encourage children to cook with their families. It’s giving them a creative way to do that by providing the recipes that went alongside the food.”It worked, presumably as it gave families stuck at home an activity to all take part in together. “We have had children on Twitter showing us what they’d been cooking with their recipe books,” says Cregan.The free school meal allowance has been increased because of the lockdown, giving £15 for the weekly box, of which the team are currently delivering 550 a week. However, Knox notes that even with this support, there are people who fall between the cracks: “Some people aren’t on the free school meals register, but need to be. If we have spare hampers, we deliver those ourselves to people who the current crisis has left in difficulty.”Cregan adds that it takes all parts of the chain to make things happen. “It’s been lovely to see the focus on making sure vulnerable children get everything that they need, and having so many people making that happen has been a great thing.”This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

Major indices in both countries are expected to rise, taking their cue from Asia where stocks are climbing thanks to the easing of Covid-19 lockdown restrictions across the world and some better-than-expected economic data out of Singapore. Singapore is among the world’s most open economies and is viewed as a bellwether on the economic front. And while the market was positioning for more pain, the GDP contraction was much less than expected. It will be received quite favourably in the global context since Singapore’s economy is only now emerging from lockdown status. In Europe, the German Dax and French Cac 40 are expected to log further gains after a strong start to the week on Monday. They were helped news of a rescue package for German airline Lufthansa and a potential lifeline for French carmaker Renault, but were also buoyed by further relaxing of lockdown measures across Europe. It seems as if investors are ignoring some of the unrest that erupted in Hong Kong over the weekend over Beijing’s plan to impose national security laws on the semi-autonomous region - at least for now. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, says: Asia markets have continued in this vein, rising sharply on reports that Japan is also easing its remaining emergency measures, while news that American firm Novavax is set to start its first human studies of its experimental coronavirus vaccine also provided a boost.

He should not stay on advising a government that needs the public to abide by the rulesThe prime minister’s chief adviser should be leaving Downing Street for good, not be giving press conferences from its rose garden. Unlike millions of Britons who stayed at home for the sake of collective safety of the country, Dominic Cummings broke the lockdown in March. While the rest of the UK was inconvenienced, suffered hardship and lost loved ones without saying goodbye, Mr Cummings drove 260 miles to his parents’ farm in Durham after his wife fell sick.Mr Cummings and his wife had not been tested for coronavirus. Neither of them appear to have been seriously incapacitated at the same time. They had one small child who needed looking after. These were unfortunate circumstances, not exceptional ones. Many, many people dealt with far worse. What Mr Cummings cannot seem to fathom is that if everyone considers their circumstances to be unusual, and decides that they can move around the country in search of childcare, then the virus will spread across households, and across communities, and the pandemic will grow, and many lives will be lost as a result.The message in this health emergency to the public was clear: “stay at home”. For Mr Cummings the message appeared to be to “read the small print” and find a reasonable excuse not to. The lack of self-awareness is galling. The exemption that Mr Cummings rests his argument on was developed for people at risk of domestic abuse. Legal experts suggest that Mr Cummings’ defence would not stand up in a court of law, let alone that of public opinion. It is a stretch to think that the lockdown would allow people with what appeared to be coronavirus symptoms to leave their home and drive to another part of the country. Or to allow them to end up in a hospital hundreds of miles away from their house.Mr Cummings’ actions have the government in crisis. But the country is in the grip of a coronavirus pandemic. What has been asked of people is to make sacrifices for the collective wellbeing. This requires a high level of cooperation and trust. Most people understood that they had to stay inside during the lockdown and believed that others would do the same. They might not have done so if people like Mr Cummings had been given official backing to cheat these reciprocal arrangements.There is a long way to go. In the coming weeks the British public is likely be asked to endure more restrictions for the greater good. It is hoped that they will ignore Mr Cummings’ example and not bend or stretch the rules but carry on obeying them both in letter and in spirit. Because this is about protecting the lives of one’s family and one’s community. The virus is being spread by people who think, like Mr Cummings, that the rules do not apply to them. This is why he ought not to remain at the heart of the government."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e60f1cd7aa4d419dda9a787ac47d60c4a0970b79/0_264_3620_2172/master/3620.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=33c03f9f797348ece406881b656a79a7","title":"how long did it take ulysses to get home the great british art quiz","story":"Feren’s Art Gallery in Hull set today’s edition of our quiz, which enables you to explore the collections of British galleries closed due to coronavirus – while answering some tricky questionsThis quiz is brought to you in collaboration with Art UK, the online home for the UK’s public art collections, showing art from over 3,000 venues and by 45,000 artists.

With three younger siblings at home, she has to take on “a lot of responsibility for helping out”. Even in normal times, school is a haven for her. Over the past seven weeks it has become even more than that: an oasis of calm.Rednock secondary is a specialist science college in the small market town of Dursley, Gloucestershire. This is not the affluent north Cotswolds of honeyed stone cottages, and the school is a typical comprehensive. Usually 1,500 students troop through its gates every morning. Today, 42 pupils are in.At the moment there is one teacher to four students, which means pupils such as Caitlin can be given unprecedented tailored pastoral and academic support, without the usual pressures of time. “I think without school right now I’d be an emotional mess,” Caitlin says with a nervous smile. “It’s my GCSEs and I’m worried – we’re missing a massive chunk of learning. But I’ve had a teacher to help me whenever I’ve wanted. It’s given me that extra confidence.”Here at Rednock, pupils have been encouraged to try a huge range of new creative and practical activities: knitting, Zumba, TikTok, baking, kite-making and sign language.The school has ripped up timetables in a way no state school could normally contemplate. “We’ve said, we will be completely flexible to your needs,” says Kerala Cole, assistant headteacher. “We work in partnership with parents to personalise the deal for the students. It can be that they come in for just a couple of hours. And I think we are seeing huge benefits to that.”One boy who had refused to attend for eight months, has been coming in every day, thanks to this flexibility and the attention he can now be given. Another year 8 child, “who arrived midway through this year and has been struggling … he’s been attending for four weeks now and he’s really benefited”, says Cole. “You can just see how his shoulders have relaxed.”The gap in GCSE results between children from disadvantaged backgrounds and the rest is thought to be around 19 months and, without changes in policy priorities, at the current rate it will take 50 years to close, according to the Education Policy Institute thinktank.Many fear children will fall even further behind during the pandemic, one reason the government gives for wanting to reopen schools to more pupils by 1 June. Rednock was hoping some 240 pupils would attend during lockdown, but numbers have been lower than expected.The corridors of the school’s spacious modern building are hushed. Children walk around alone, and don’t wear uniform. For many, “strange school” has huge advantages. “Before, I had quite a few classmates who were really annoying and distracting, but now this new way, it’s quieter,” says Edie, 13.“Teachers are ever so supportive, and it’s calmer because there’s not tonnes of people crowding around,” adds Molly, 11.“There’s less people who intimidate other people,” says Alfie, 12, whose parents, both nurses, have been at work during the crisis. “You can be yourself more rather than be the person other people think you should be.” His mum has had Covid-19, he says, and has recovered.Everyone nods. “Before, people used to sometimes judge you,” says Samira, 11. “You can sometimes have fake friends who really bring you down. This has given you a little bit of a break.”Because the school is being so careful about physical distancing, I meet students in the hall, with one child per desk. This small group either have key-worker parents, are under the care of a social worker, have an education, health and care plan (EHCP) for their special needs, or are otherwise defined as “high priority” by their teachers. They miss their friends but, to a child, say they feel immense relief from the pressures of “normal” school.“The teachers have more time to spend with you, and you get the help you need,” says Maisie, 12, whose mother works in food manufacturing. Samira agrees. “Teachers feel more like family now.” There is enthusiastic nodding from her schoolmates.The headteacher, David Alexander, and Cole, went through their entire roll to identify pupils they felt should have the opportunity to attend – those who were vulnerable, although not in the government’s stated categories.“We want as many to come in as possible,” Alexander says. As schools closed across the country, Rednock staff telephoned 280 families to make sure they knew their child had a place. “Some parents and carers are hesitant,” Alexander acknowledges. “And some prefer to have their children at home.” But efforts are unstinting to support the 160 or so students who, Cole says, “we would class as vulnerable, and who we’d prefer to be in school but aren’t”.Cole feels anxious for the welfare of some children who haven’t been seen for the past seven weeks. She is in regular contact with their social workers and, in some cases, the police. Teachers continue to check in, ringing some children weekly, some daily. In school, staff are sensitive to new needs. “Some here have really difficult home lives and they feel safer in school. And they feel worried about their parents who are at work. We’ve had tears, shouting, aggression,” says Cole.“Or they go quiet, or go off on their own,” adds Alexander. “Or you get over-the-top laughter, or clinginess,” says Cole.When all students do come back, Alexander and Cole are hoping there will be lessons they can use from lockdown. They know, too, that the return of the hurley burley will affect the more vulnerable children.And the pupils have mixed feelings about normal school resuming. Samira hopes there might be smaller classes, but says: “I’m not excited about going back – all the madness and screaming in corridors.” Molly agrees.: “It’ll probably be more stressful. Everything crowded again.”Caitlin is looking to the positives. “I’ve had the opportunity to reflect on who I want to be when I’m older,” she says. “I can be quite negative, and this time has given me a break. The extra support from school means that I know even when things get tough – because we’re in a pandemic and I’m getting through it – I can get through other things now.”Alexander and Cole emphasise that even in normal times this school tries to create a family atmosphere. But to these children, a caring school has never felt as much of a reality as it does now. There is no testing or targets, no pressure to achieve academically. They feel adults are there for them. And despite the immense stresses and limitations of living in a time of pandemic, they are blossoming.* All children’s names have been changed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2495483354c78907189379c2a846b301542e079/0_0_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e60a77960fbc56531d371432a444dbb6","title":"ban on bushmeat after covid 19 but what if alternative is factory farming","story":"Governments and WHO face pressure to ban commercial trade in wild animals, but experts say this would criminalise a way of life for millions of people Antelope is best, monkey is chewy, bats needs a sauce, forest porcupine is mild, and pangolin – one of the most trafficked animals in the world – tastes great roasted but smells awful. That, at least, was what the Gabonese workers told us.We were in a Belgian-owned logging camp in Gabon. The day had been spent watching giant trees being felled for the Chinese market but by evening everyone’s thoughts had turned to food.Most rural Africans and Asians say “bush” or wild meat is healthier, tastier and often cheaper than the bland meat of most farmed animals like chickens or pigs. The joke among the African loggers in the camp that night was that Asians would eat anything alive in the forest but the squeamish Europeans would eat nothing. Today, as a result of Covid-19 and its suspected origins in a Chinese “wet” market, governments and the World Health Organization are coming under growing pressure from conservationists, vegans, and animal protection, zoo, and welfare groups to not just stop the hunting of all wild animals for food but to end the commercial trade in live animals with a global ban. Now is the time to link human health with bioersity loss and animal suffering and to close all markets selling live or dead wild animals, they say.At the crack of dawn every day, “wet markets” in China and across Asia come to life, with stall owners touting their wares, such as fresh meat, fish, fruit and vegetables, herbs and spices in an open-air setting. The sights and sounds of the wet market form part of the rich tapestry of community life, where local people buy affordable food, or just go for a stroll and meet their neighbours for a chat.\u0026nbspWhile supermarkets selling chilled or frozen meats are increasingly popular in Asia, older shoppers generally prefer buying freshly slaughtered meat for daily consumption, believing it produces flavour in dishes and soup that is superior to frozen meat.“Wet markets”, where water is sloshed on produce to keep it cool and fresh, may be considered unsanitary by western standards. But most do not trade in exotic or wild animals and should not be confused with “wildlife markets” – now the focus of vociferous calls for global bans.The Wuhan South China seafood market, suspected to be a primary source for spreading Covid-19 in late 2019, had a wild animal section where live and slaughtered species were for sale, including snakes, beavers, badgers, civet cats, foxes, peacocks and porcupines among other animals.A spokeswoman for WWF UK says: “We have called for the closure of illegal and unregulated wildlife markets, primarily in urban areas. What we are concerned about is the illegal consumption of highly threatened wildlife, often seen as a delicacy.”There is no doubt that wild meat hunting and consumption is heavily impacting the world’s wildlife, giving rise to what is called “the empty forest”, where few large mammals remain. A 2016 Royal Society paper shows that the bushmeat trade is growing fast, with devastating results. “As wildlife populations outside protected areas decline, poaching pressure is increasing in many parks and reserves,” say the authors. “As a consequence many forests, savannahs, grasslands and deserts in the developing world are now becoming ‘empty landscapes’ devoid of harvest-sensitive wild mammals.”What has changed over 50 years, say scientists, is the scale of the commercial wild meat trade. In the past, local subsistence hunters killed animals in small numbers. Today a high-volume industry supplies fast-expanding Asian and African cities. No longer run by local hunters, it is helped by modern firearms and cellphones, and utilises a vast network of new roads driven deep into forest concessions by the international logging industry. Hunters can strip a forest or wetland in a few nights and access home and export markets for their meat. And as the forests are emptied of their animals, the price of wild meat soars and it becomes a luxury commodity for urban elites.But critics of a ban say that the legal wildlife meat trade employs hundreds of thousands of people, provides protein for between 30 million and 70 million people in Africa alone and kills few threatened, or rare animals.What about the environmental impacts of farming? According to a major 2011 study led by Robert Nasi, director general of the Center for International Forestry Research (Cifor), a switch to cattle to provide protein in place of wild animals would have huge impact.Factory farming has devastating effects on wildlife, says Philip Lymbery, director of UK-based Compassion in World Farming. “It is a main driver of wildlife decline and the destruction of the world’s remaining wild lands,” he says. “It’s about keeping animals caged in sheds, which sounds efficient but you have to devote vast areas of land to grow their feed. It drives encroachment into wild lands and the destruction of habitats.“It would cause unimaginable suffering to the animals, and even more environmental devastation. It would also create the perfect breeding ground for the next pandemic. Factory farming and pandemics are strongly linked. The main driver of future pandemics will be factory farming.”Many epidemiologists, ecologists, human rights and indigenous peoples’ groups say a knee-jerk global reaction to ban the wild meat trade could be unscientific, counter-productive and culturally offensive.The western conservation “industry” wants an end to the eating of wild animals because it wants vast new areas of land to be “protected” in the name of increasing bioersity, says Fiore Longo, advocacy officer of Survival International.“But this model of ‘fortress conservation’ is dangerous,” she says. “Conservationists have seized the crisis as a chance to criminalise the ways of life of a large part of the world’s population. It reinforces the false ide between people and wildlife, and potentially vastly increases the size of protected areas whatever the human cost may be.“What happens if we outlaw the trade and consumption of wildlife where there are no other sources of protein available? Do we let more people starve? Is a dependence on industrial food production with all its enormous environmental, health and financial impacts somehow ‘better’ than the sustainable consumption of wild animals?”As for the idea that disease is more likely to accompany wild meat, experts point out that illnesses like Mers and Sars, BSE, swine and bird flu, E coli, MRSA and salmonella, originated in intensive poultry, pig and livestock farms where the overuse of antibiotics and unhygienic conditions can spread disease quickly. Many are common. According to the OIE, the World Organisation for Animal Health, there are currently more than 25 outbreaks of H5 and H7 avian flu having to be controlled in more than 20 countries, including the US, Germany, India and Saudi Arabia. Any one, if unattended by vets, could develop into an epidemic.Delia Grace, programme leader for food safety and zoonoses at the International Livestock Research Institute, said: “Wet markets are basically fresh food markets. In the UK we like farmers’ markets with fresh cornfed chickens, farm-sourced meats and nice looking sausages. That’s basically a wet market, though in a different cultural context. They are essential to bring fresh food to urban populations, and provide for the food security of millions of people.“They do need to be regulated and controlled. They should not be blanket banned, as that is not sensitive to the needs of their clients who depend on them.”Conservationists are struggling to diminish consumption of wild animals through behaviour campaigns, legislation and law enforcement – especially in urban Africa, says Congo analyst Theodore Trefon, a researcher at the Belgian Royal Museum for central Africa."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cec76084b6dbd5e6ecdbbfd83a344060811f7db3/0_0_2079_1248/master/2079.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dfaf12e005cda1e6f3cce250639d6f8c","title":"climate change in deep oceans could be seven times faster by middle of century report says","story":"Uneven heating could have major impact on marine wildlife, as species that rely on each other for survival are forced to moveRates of climate change in the world’s ocean depths could be seven times higher than current levels by the second half of this century even if emissions of greenhouse gases were cut dramatically, according to new research.Different global heating at different depths could have major impacts on ocean wildlife, causing disconnects as species that rely on each other for survival are forced to move.In the new research, scientists looked at a measure called climate velocity – the speed at which species would need to move to stay within their preferred temperature range as different ocean layers warm.The study, published in the journal Nature Climate Change, found different parts of the ocean would change at different rates as the extra heat from increasing levels of greenhouse gases moved through the vast ocean depths.By the second half of the century, the study found “a rapid acceleration of climate change exposure throughout the water column”.The study used climate models to first estimate the current rates of climate velocity at different ocean depths, and then future rates under three scenarios – one where emissions started to fall from now another where they began to fall by the middle of this century and a third where emissions continued to rise up to 2100.Prof Jorge García Molinos, a climate ecologist at Hokkaido University and a co-author of the study, said: “Our results suggest that deep sea bioersity is likely to be at greater risk because they are adapted to much more stable thermal environments.”At present, the world’s heating was already causing species to shift in all layers of the ocean from the surface to more than 4km down, but at different speeds.But even under a highly optimistic scenario, where emissions fell sharply from now, the ocean’s mesopelagic layer – from 200m to 1km down – climate velocity would change from about 6km per decade to 50km by the second half of the century. But over the same period, climate velocity would halve at the surface.Even at depths of between 1,000 and 4,000 metres, climate velocity would triple current rates, even if emissions dropped sharply.Prof Anthony Richardson, of the University of Queensland and the CSIRO and one of the study’s 10 authors, told  Australia: “What really concerns us is that as you move down through the ocean, climate velocity moves at different speeds.”This could create a disconnect for species that rely on organisms in different layers.For example, Richardson said tuna lived in the mesopelagic layer between 200 and 1,000 metres deep, but they relied on plankton species near the surface.He said because the planet’s oceans were so large and stored so much heat, “warming already absorbed at the ocean surface will mix into deeper waters.”“This means that marine life in the deep ocean will face escalating threats from ocean warming until the end of the century, no matter what we do now.”Isaac Brito-Morales, the study’s lead author and a researcher at the University of Queensland, said: “Because the deep ocean has a more stable temperature, any small increase will have an impact on species – they’re more at risk than those at the surface.”Richardson added it was “concerning” their results showed, as well as different rates of climate velocity at different depths, the direction that species would need to move wasn’t uniform either.This could mean that marine park areas designed to protect different species or habitats could become compromised as species moved out of the protected areas into unprotected areas."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83e780032a450c085d844494582ee1e6af607806/0_0_1440_863/master/1440.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c76b25a82f800ddc12012256d4504e51","title":"dive in how slim aarons art directed the poolside summer","story":"French brand Maje are the latest label to take inspiration from Slim Aarons’ pictures of the jetset on holiday. Glamorous and full of sunshine, they’re welcome escapism right nowIn lockdown, holidays seem like some kind of fantasy - so looking at a Slim Aarons photograph is sort of appropriate. Aarons has, after all, always been about armchair travelling. It never rains in his pictures. They are not of people grinning through the downpour staycations, or of hard-fought sweaty adventures. Instead, Aarons concentrated on the holiday where the weather is perfect, cocktails at 11am are the norm, and sunglasses are always massive. The kind of holiday we’re all dreaming of right now, really.Glamour hotspots like Capri, Palm Springs and Acapulco were on the Aarons’ itinerary while working from the fifties onwards. And while he did photograph celebrities like Gary Cooper, Babe Paley and Ursula Andress, the fame of his subjects are a moot point. Its his images of the jetset on holiday that endure. Think young, glamorous women with midriffs on display, accompanied by older men in sports jackets, and possibly a labrador, almost always next to - but rarely in - a pool.Aarons’ influence on the Instagram holiday aesthetic is huge. So much so that there was an argument to be made if you didn’t post a sub-Aarons sun-filled poolside shot during your fortnight off, you weren’t ever there. Much like the modern influencers who emulate him, Manhattan-born Aarons had little interest in reportage, or capturing reality. He turned down an assignment to cover the Korean War, saying “I’ll only do a beach if it has a blonde on it.” His picture are not inclusive, but that is sort of the point. He described his practice as “photographing attractive people doing attractive things in attractive places.”This policy, of course, attracts fashion like the proverbial moth. Study Aarons’ photography for long enough and you’ll realise the people are just extras - the real scene-stealer is the pool itself, a symbol of pure escapism. It’s this that has inspired a capsule collection from Maje, the French brand designed by Judith Milgrom. Across eight designs - a shirt, T-shirt, sweatshirt, shorts etc - Aarons’ attractive aesthetic is printed, postcard-style, along with the slogan ‘poolside stories’. A dress and a swimsuit forget the people completely: they’re covered with a print of Aaronsian turquoise pool water.Milgrom takes her place in a lineage of fashionable types finding inspiration in Aarons. The photographer sold his catalogue to Getty in 1997 making it more well-known, and designers like Michael Kors and Anna Sui began to reference Aarons 1974 book A Wonderful Time, with vintage copies of the book going for around $2000. Sui called it “the quintessential guide for good taste”. Aarons, however, was somewhat sniffy about fashion’s interest in him. “I don’t do fashion,” he said. “I take photos of people in their own clothes and that becomes fashion.”Aarons died in 2006, four years before the invention of Instagram but his ideal vacation has become a reference point for the selfie era. There are nearly 50k posts tagged #slimaarons on Instagram, and sites like The Man Repeller and The Gentleman’s Journal have ran features on how to get the look. Going by Aarons’ rules would involve what not to wear first. The photographer was brilliantly obnoxious about the parameters of his good taste. He supposedly refused to photograph anyone in jeans, T-shirts or sneakers. Instead, think bold print bikinis for women, short shorts for men, anything wafty and bright, crochet, eyeliner. With the focus on the sixties and seventies, vintage is your best bet to find it. Channel Betty Draper on her trip to Rome, or Dickie Greenleaf on a yacht, even if you’re only social distancing sitting in your local park. Yes these characters are fictional but this is Aarons. Think about dressing the holiday you want, not the one you’ll have - certainly not this year - and you’re halfway there."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f6d06a53a8d104c9d95b6c1be7ae143b556efea/0_1262_4160_2496/master/4160.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=99f396f46319c2267a09241dfc74e478","title":"a look at the worlds most stylish men in pictures","story":"The Staley-Wise Gallery in New York is currently closed, but has plundered its archives to curate an online exhibition celebrating some of the world’s best-dressed men.

Whether you’re a vegan, a hipster or a millionaire, we’ve got you coveredPerhaps I am over-generalising, but I feel that the flapjack rarely migrates from the home economics class into everyday adult life. Yet at this moment, it hits all the notes: it is wholesome, very simple, you can bake it with children and you can throw any old nonsense in to no obvious ill effect. Plus, it needs no flour, which is great if you can’t get hold of any, and oats are incredibly good value. There is no kitchen alchemy involving things that have a habit of going wrong – no raising agent, no uncertainty from adding an egg.I tried every which way, with the “help” of an outrageously careless 10-year-old, to get one wrong, just for the suspense. There were rumours that tin size was important, that the wrong dimensions messed with the texture. It is true that a thinner flapjack will have a more biscuity, less squidgy mouthfeel, but biscuity is still fine, otherwise why would people eat biscuits? It is also true that the finer the oats, the more they hold together in the finished product, but even jumbo oats didn’t fall apart as I had been led to believe. But if this really worries you, you can make them finer by whizzing them first in a food processor, anyway.Having said that all flapjacks are equally good, it would be contradictory to claim that these are the 10 best: think of them, rather, as a flapjack for every taste.The Pooh Cook Book, loosely based on the sensibilities of Winnie the Pooh, came out in 1971: if you were born between then and about 1985, it will have provided the building blocks of your first cooking experiences even if you never read it. Trust me, I was there.Anyway, its flapjack – 50g butter, 50g sugar, 100g oats, one tablespoon of golden syrup, pinch of salt, 160C (140C fan350Fgas mark 3) for 20 minutes – is basically a ration-book version of the classic recipe (generally, there is more fat than oats), and, with a much smaller yield, that should be enough for two hungry children. That’s what really stands out about recipes written before the 90s, how incredibly small they are.You want perfection, go to the person whose middle name it is: our own Felicity Cloake identified the two fundamental schools of flapjackery as crunchy or chewy, and comes down, herself, very firmly on the side of crunchy. Much more syrup than sugar in this one, and she’s quite strict on the size of the oats, 50:50 jumbo to rolled, but the main way to assure more crunch is a shallower baking tray in a hotter oven.Baking genius Dan Lepard was unaccountably looking for a way to reduce the fat and sugar content of a flapjack, and discovered that even a small amount of tahini - 75g – had a fudgifying effect on the other ingredients, which reduced the need for both butter and sugar. The ingredients list – featuring dates, walnuts, sesame seeds, honey – means it isn’t for someone looking for something simple, but will be ideal if you want to winnow your weird stockpiles.There are variations of this recipe all over Instagram, though I have found no reputable chef that would put their name to them: the no-dairy, no-sugar, no-nuffink flapjack. Basically, you take mashed banana and oats of any size in roughly equal quantities before you mix them, toast the oats in a frying pan with enough coconut oil to coat, then add the banana and some kind of nut or seed butter (or more coconut oil, if you’re minded).You can add as much dried fruit as you think it’ll take without falling apart. And these have to be baked in biscuits, rather than squares, because they’re too mouth-drying otherwise, but they work surprisingly well, I think due to the initial toasting of the oats, which brings depth of flavour.My small and I agreed, though, that they just weren’t sweet enough, and tried again twice with golden syrup and agave. The golden syrup was the best. For a two-banana mix, I added in two tablespoons but feel free to adjust to taste.The industrialised flapjack has a very distinctive texture which, like shop-bought chocolate cake, is incredibly hard to replicate at home. That’s fine if you’re dead proud of your home baking, but not if you actually prefer the shop version. The answer came, unexpectedly, from a recipe shared by Anna Botting (the Sky presenter) on Twitter: condensed milk. She uses the unsweetened version, but I am obsessed with the regular stuff, and can attest, these have a wonderful shop-bought squidge and also taste like condensed milk.Not a traditionally Scottish snack, just from the marvellous Scottish Baking by Sue Lawrence: it’s a versatile recipe that basically lets you add anything you happen to have around, raisins, apricots, coconut, flaked almonds, whatever, and is also the only one that uses any flour. Even in a small amount, it makes them a bit more cake-like.Flapjacks are about as rich as life gets, and yet you can heap richness upon them to create something 10 times richer, but just as delicious. Like this BBC Good Food recipe for chocolate and caramel flapjacks. It’s the kind of maths that only the flapjack truly understands, just as only Jeff Bezos understands why you’d want to be a trillionaire when you’re already a billionaire.The Birmingham-based, mostly vegan but not inflexibly so Domestic Gothess fancied up the classic recipe here with coconut and ginger, and if you can overcome your inner purist, I have to say, these are the most interesting. The flavour still has a lot of clarity, it just sounds a few more notes.Almost all recipes that suggest any seeds and nuts will allow for infinite variations this BBC Good Food one is seeds only. Mainly, this is because you’re not really trying to pick out finer flavour differences between a pumpkin and a sunflower seed, you’re looking for more crunch, more textural variety and the overall impression of a more grownup snack.

I have not been alone, I don’t think, in my almost tick-like checking for symptoms in the past few months: cough and temperature, obviously, but also smell and taste. I reassure myself I am fine, having the most exaggerated sense of both: coffee, fish bones, flowers, bleach, the uncovered cheese, sour milk, the rubbish in our courtyard, strawberries, baked onions.The man working the grill in Catania tends whole onions, baking them in their skins until they are completely charred on the outside. Inside, however, they are soft, with opaque layers that flump out when you peel away the outside, ready to be dressed with oil and red-wine vinegar. Other things found on Sicilian grills are le stigghiole – lamb’s intestines wound round spring onions then grilled over charcoal – and cipollate catanesi, pancetta wrapped around spring onions. Both are referred to as arrusti e mangia, roast and eat, and can be made just as easily in a garden or a kitchen.Most spring onions have bulbs the size of an olive they are ideal for this. If they are a passing-round snack, estimate three per person if they are part of a larger grill spread, two. I don’t bother trimming the spring onions, leaving all the green intact, plus the little stringy root, which provides a handle of sorts and can be bitten off.Simply wash the onions and pat them dry. For every onion, you need a thin rasher of pancetta, which is salt-cured pork belly. Streaky bacon works here, too. Wrap the rasher around the onion as if it were a ribbon round a maypole, so at a bias, covering the bottom two-thirds of the onion this leaves the greenery sticking out at one end and half the fat bulb peeping out at the other. Rub with olive oil and it is ready to cook.Most of the time, we cook this over white-hot charcoal in our small, bandy fornacella, which means we are on the flat concrete roof of my partner’s grandparents’ house in Sicily. I have also cooked them in an aluminium tray barbecue, in a friend’s pizza oven, on an iron griddle pan, in a frying pan, under the grill and in the oven. There are many options. Wherever you cook them, the heat needs to be intense (but not flaming), so the fatty pancetta melts then crisps, the slender onion cooks underneath and both ends char until black. A great part of the pleasure of onions and pancetta is the smell of the catching and the scorching, arrusti, then the mess of eating with your fingers, wherever you are or wherever that takes you."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e457b4bb6489ede39631021c6a84d48a899246ea/0_0_7952_4774/master/7952.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=04b827868bfcb4f2f250267ecdfcdaa6","title":"companies investment fund yorkshire york mole valley asset management","story":"Mole Valley Asset Management will only include firms based in the county in its portfolioPeople from Yorkshire are often stereotyped as being proud of their identity and careful with money, and a “first of its kind” investment fund could be said to tick both boxes – as it will only put investors’ cash into companies based in the county.There are plenty of investment funds that concentrate on just one country, but the Yorkshire T20 Portfolio goes one step further by having a strict regional focus. If a company isn’t “made in Yorkshire”, it doesn’t go in the fund.The asset management company behind it said the tide was turning against globalisation in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, and this was a way for people from Yorkshire – as well as other investors – “to grow their savings while supporting local home-grown industry”.But a fund where people’s money is being invested in a relatively small number of companies in just one region will inevitably involve more risk and volatility than one that spreads the cash more widely. And while this is open to iniduals and firms, the minimum investment of £20,000 will put it out of many small investors’ reach.Mole Valley Asset Management (Mvam), whose regional office is based in York, said it believed this was the first fund of its type and would only invest in 20 listed companies based in Yorkshire.The first wave of firms include Wetherby-based biotech firm Avacta, which made the headlines a few days ago because it is developing a 10-minute home saliva test for coronavirus that will be similar to a pregnancy test.Another of the 20 companies is Zoo Digital, which has bases in Sheffield, London, Los Angeles and Dubai. It specialises in subtitling and dubbing and is pioneering digital technology in the entertainment industry.Duncan Sanford, who heads up Mvam’s York office, said that while there was always going to be an appetite for investment in global companies, “we’ve seen the tide starting to turn for some time, with people looking increasingly to be part of their local economies”.“We can only see that counter-globalisation drive increasing post-Covid-19 as people reassess their priorities in all aspects of their lives. And if they are increasingly looking to shop local, why not invest local as well?” he said.More than 80 companies that have head offices in Yorkshire are listed on the stock market, from luxury food producers and digital gaming companies to property firms and healthcare equipment minnows, according to Mvam.“There is so much potential in this area – in industries from digital to creative and pharmaceutical – it’s hard to choose, but we believe what we have come up with is an excellent group of listed firms which are either already hugely successful or, in many cases, about to break through,” Sanford said.It emerged on 21 May that Avacta had signed a distribution agreement with a venture set up by the billionaire co-founder of online fashion brand Boohoo to sell its coronavirus instant testing kits to consumers.Alastair Smith, Avacta’s chief executive, said of being included in the portfolio: “I’m a Yorkshireman myself, and many of our employees based at our Wetherby lab and head office are local, so it’s great to have a showcase like this for the innovation and entrepreneurship going on in Yorkshire.”Mvam highlights the high-risk nature of the actively managed fund on its website: “We would not advocate putting your entire wealth in such a portfolio. While the rewards can be high, so can the risks.”It said this was partly because the companies in the fund could be small in size, adding: “The portfolio is concentrated, holding 20 companies, and therefore has additional company specific risk.” The £20,000 minimum investment was “considerably lower than the thresholds for other directly managed portfolios with exclusive access to the portfolio manager”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/053313fb5278573ce83033a8fbfae9a50d263b36/0_81_2652_1592/master/2652.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3d01d09583c40e0b7336b91c14091cbe","title":"rian evans poulenc pinocchio boesman beethoven schoenberg","story":"In our new series, critics tell us about the music they’re listening to at home, from symphonies to live streams, grand opera to guilty pleasures. This week, Rian Evans moves from Poulenc to Pinocchio, and rolls over BeethovenMy corona-listening is a mix of random v planned. Switching on BBC Radio 3, but missing the beginning of a piece, is one kind of random. The fabulous viola tone in Schoenberg’s intense String Trio (on BBC Sounds until 11 June) turned out to be that of Lawrence Power – I should have guessed – playing with Ilya Gringolts and Daniel Haefliger. Hitting on Poulenc’s Concerto for Two Pianos, with Shin-Heae Kang and her mentor Marta Argerich as soloists with the NDR Radio Philharmonic Orchestra was another plus (on BBC Sounds until 12 June).Poulenc embraces extremes, so an air of contemplation is never far from an irresistible joie de vivre and, here, a Mozartian vein coalesces with unmistakably Poulencian harmony. The composer himself often performed this work with Jacques Février, but how intriguing to discover that he gave the first London performance with Benjamin Britten in January 1945. They must surely have talked Balinese gamelan music, whose inflections colour the first movement. Roger Nichols’ new book will doubtless elucidate.That concerto sent me searching for the Poulenc cantata premiered by the BBC Singers in London in March. Figure Humaine, for double choir, sets eight poems by Paul Éluard: fast and brilliant alternates with slower and sad, culminating in his paean Liberté, a final tour de force. This single poem was recognised as being so important that, in 1942, the RAF dropped copies to the resistance in France, a symbolic gesture of fraternité and egalité that seems a world away from today’s insular rhetoric.Recent talk of Pinocchio and his nose demanded that I look out Philippe Boesman’s opera based on Carlo Collodi’s fairytale of the wooden boy. Collodi intended his original allegory to have political edge and Joël Pommerat’s 2017 Aix-en-Provence staging made it darker again, underlining the conflict between fiction and reality, lies and truth. But, frankly, for all that Chloé Briot’s Pinocchio was sung with great panache, I found the puppet a bit too ADHD for comfort and gave up on it.Now’s the moment to say a big thank you for the techno-wizardry giving us a different kind of “live” and, across media platforms, demonstrating musicians’ ingenuity and adaptability. Audio-visual artist Kathy Hinde organised the 840 requisite iterations of Erik Satie’s Vexations to mark the composer’s 154th birthday on 17 May (so successful that another is planned for 12 June). The repetitions were soothing rather than vexatious. Llŷr Williams should have been performing Beethoven’s 32 piano sonatas in Mexico this month: instead, Signum has engineered it to beam the cycle direct from his home in North Wales. It’s been remarkable playing thus far. There are three recitals left – 29 May, 1 and 3 June – with Ops 109, 110 and 111 triptych closing the series.Fundamental as Beethoven is, by way of antidote to potential anniversary overload, I also bop in the kitchen to a tape of Chuck Berry. The first track is Roll Over Beethoven. No guilt involved, though best blot out his “I got a rockin’ pneumonia” line…Rian’s pick for the coming weekI’ll be watching Rimsky-Korsakov’s The Legend of the Invisible City of Kitezh, considered his operatic masterpiece, a “Russian Parsifal”. Telling of love and war, heaven and hell, the possibilities of redemption and utopian paradise, it covers most bases. Meanwhile, Invisible Cities is the title of Charlotte Bray’s four-movement work for viola and piano, where she takes Italo Calvino’s 1972 novel as the impulse for making musically connecting threads, encouraging us to do the same."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a054ffef3b114da6bc8a3ba863d924d7a5305d7c/0_192_4221_2534/master/4221.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0ef6128165807643ef388cb355a66a5f","title":"peggy lee perfect is that all there is coronavirus","story":"As coronavirus derails plans for a concert to celebrate the centenary of Lee’s birth, Kevin EG Perry looks back on a singer whose seductive style masked rejection and painIn September 1968, songwriting titans Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller were on the hunt for a singer for their curious new composition Is That All There Is? The song was something of a departure for the writers of Hound Dog and Jailhouse Rock. It had been inspired by Thomas Mann’s 1896 short story Disillusionment, which deals with what Leiber called “the existential hole that sits in the centre of our souls”. The fatalistic spoken-word verses describe the narrator watching their house burn down, losing their first love, and even facing death, “that final disappointment”, with sanguine grace.The pair felt the song needed an actress to sell it so offered it to Marlene Dietrich and Barbra Streisand before thinking of Peggy Lee. After catching her show at the Copacabana in New York, they handed Lee a demo. She called them the moment she listened to it. “I will kill you if you give this song to anyone but me,” she said. “This is my song. This is the story of my life.”It’s not surprising that Lee wasn’t Leiber and Stoller’s first thought. Best known for her smouldering 1958 version of Fever, she had spent years carefully crafting an image for herself as an impossibly glamorous blonde with a seductive purr. Is That All There Is? spoke to the woman behind that image. As a child, on two separate occasions, she really had watched her family home burn down. Her first husband had left her to raise their daughter alone. There was even a lyrical reference to clowns, one of Lee’s lifelong obsessions. She felt that she too had learned to paint on a happy face. “That song completely resonated with her,” says her granddaughter, Holly Foster Wells. “To her it was about looking at everything that’s unfolding in front of you, pulling yourself back, accepting it, and going on living. What she heard was: survivor.”Lee, who died in 2002, was born 100 years ago on Tuesday. There had been plans to celebrate the milestone with a tribute concert at the Hollywood Bowl, with performances from Herbie Hancock, Sheryl Crow and Debbie Harry. “Unfortunately the great equaliser, Mother Nature, has put us all on notice,” laments Harry. As a child, she heard Lee for the first time on the radio show Your Hit Parade. “The timbre of her voice was exciting and mysterious against the woodwind and brass. She had a wonderfully smoky voice and a phenomenal sense of time.”When Lee was born, in the small farming town of Jamestown, North Dakota, she was named Norma Deloris Egstrom. She was the seventh of eight children, and her childhood was an unhappy one. Her father Marvin was a station agent for the Midland Continental Railroad and an alcoholic. Her mother, Selma, died when she was four. Her father remarried, the older children left home, and for 11 years Lee bore the brunt of her stepmother’s physical and emotional abuse. Her only escape was the radio. She fell in love with big band and jazz, and did her chores to a rhythm.The first time Lee ever sang in public, at church, she was so paralysed with nerves she sang facing a wall. By September 1937 she had scraped together enough confidence to audition for WDAY radio in Fargo. She impressed them, but the programme’s director, Ken Kennedy, couldn’t picture “Norma Egstrom” on a marquee. On the spot, he christened her Peggy Lee. The following year she tried her luck in Hollywood. Arriving in California with $18 and her father’s railroad pass, she wound up working as a carnival barker on Balboa Island. For a time, one of the of the 20th century’s great voices could be heard bellowing: “Three for a dime! You break one, you win!”Undeterred, Lee continued to seek opportunities to develop her style. On stage one night early in 1941 at The Doll House, a tiny celebrity haunt in Palm Springs, she found herself struggling to hear the music over the roar of conversation and clinking cocktail glasses. Rather than shout over the din, Lee softened her voice. A hush fell. It suited her. “She said she didn’t like the idea of screaming: ‘I love you’,” says Foster Wells. “For her, it should be said softly, with feeling.”Among the audience at The Doll House was Frank Bering, who owned the Ambassador West Hotel in Chicago. He booked Lee to play their venue, the Buttery Room, which is where bandleader Benny Goodman stumbled across her while searching for a new singer. Years later, appearing on This Is Your Life, Goodman reminisced about the moment, telling Lee: “I was so impressed that I hired you on the spot.”Singing with the Benny Goodman Orchestra was a dream come true for Lee, but Goodman was a tough boss. On stage she wore a borrowed dress and sang in someone else’s key. Critics compared her unfavourably to Goodman’s previous singer, Helen Forrest, while producer John Hammond assessed her witheringly: “Miss Lee is a lady whose attractiveness occasionally makes the listener forget that she has no vocal or interpretive talent.” Devastated, Lee tried to quit. Goodman refused. Less than a year later, on 27 July 1942, they recorded Why Don’t You Do Right?, which sold 1m copies and made Peggy Lee a household name.As her star was ascending, Lee was falling in love with the orchestra’s guitarist, David Barbour. Goodman had a strict rule forbidding his musicians from fraternising with their female singer. When Lee became pregnant the couple could no longer keep their relationship secret. After breaking the news to Goodman that they were leaving, the couple married and moved to Los Angeles where Barbour could get work as a session musician. Lee planned to retire to raise their daughter, Nicki, but found she couldn’t stop writing lyrics. “My grandfather would come home at night,” says Foster Wells, “And my grandmother would say to him: ‘Dinner isn’t ready, but the song is.’”The couple made an ideal songwriting team. After Lee resumed her singing career they had their biggest hit in 1947 with Mañana (Is Soon Enough for Me), which spent nine weeks at No 1. Behind the scenes, however, their marriage was collapsing. Barbour, like Lee’s father, was an alcoholic. You can sense her heartbreak close to the surface in her remarkable turn in 1955’s Pete Kelly’s Blues, playing a singer debilitated by drink. Despite having little acting experience she was nominated for the best supporting actress Oscar. “Of course, she was an actress while she sang,” says Foster Wells. “It was like watching a play unfold, watching her sing one song.”Lee was devastated by the breakup. Later in life she would say that her favourite song of her own was The Folks Who Live on the Hill, which is about a couple growing old together. “That was the life she longed for,” says Foster Wells. “To have a stable, wonderful, long-term relationship with someone she grew old with in the same house having children. The life she got was the opposite of that dream.”The glamorous, sexualised image Lee created for herself was a way of masking that pain. The flirtatious sensuality of her voice, combined with her looks, gave her more of an edge than some of her contemporaries. While the squeaky-clean Doris Day was advertising Lux soap and Royal Crown cola, Lee was the face of Chesterfield cigarettes and Rheingold beer. A press release from the early 50s breathlessly claimed: “Peggy puts more sex into a song than most girls could into a striptease.”It wasn’t all raunch. Lee was delighted when Walt Disney invited her to collaborate with big band leader Sonny Burke on the soundtrack to 1955’s Lady and the Tramp. As well as writing and singing, Lee voices four characters including Peg, the Pekingese with a tail like a feather boa who vamps her way through He’s a Tramp. That was how the burlesque performer Dita Von Teese discovered Lee, though it was her image that later had an impression on her. “She was stylish throughout her life. Quietly cool and chic, confident and powerful. I think she’s extraordinary, not just for her talent in singing, but as a creator, a lyricist who clearly had high intelligence.”Lee had no qualms about rewriting songs to better suit the character of “Miss Peggy Lee”. When she recorded Fever she added her own verses with allusions to Romeo and Juliet and Captain Smith and Pocahontas. By some margin her most popular song in the Spotify era, with more than 50m plays, it continues to accrue new fans: teenage Grammy winner Billie Eilish credits it with making her interested in older music. “She’s definitely had influence on my music,” says Eilish. “I wish I was as elegant as her when she performed. Her delivery and the way she sang and moved has been really inspiring to me.”Lee’s influence has been felt by young musicians for more than a half a century. The Beatles covered Till There Was You in 1963 because Paul McCartney had heard Lee do it on 1960’s Latin ala Lee! Although Lee was initially concerned by the sudden eruption of rock’n’roll, in the end she quipped: “You can’t beat the Beatles, you join ’em.” She recorded versions of Something and A Hard Day’s Night. On a visit to London, she invited Paul and Linda McCartney to dinner at the Dorchester Hotel and McCartney announced he’d written the jazz ballad Let’s Love for her. “They said that instead of bringing her wine or flowers,” says Foster Well, “they brought her a song.”The young songwriter Randy Newman also caught Lee’s ear – he was brought in at her request to play piano and arrange the orchestra for her recording of Is That All There Is? He remembers Lee being subdued in the studio. “She does it in sort of an almost cheerful, ironic manner,” he says. “I had no inkling that it would be a hit record.”The strange, melancholy song was indeed a hit, although it would be Lee’s last. She continued to perform into the 1990s, often in a wheelchair. “Ageing in the public eye was hard for her,” says Foster Wells. “She would say: ‘You try singing Fever when you’re in your 70s.’ She was constantly trying to recreate her look. As she got older she changed to a platinum wig and glasses, and made it a little more campy.” Lee released her final album Moments Like This in 1993 and died of a heart attack on 21 January 2002, at the age of 81.Even amid the immense collection of music that Lee left behind, Is That All There Is? stands out. In the years since Lee’s recording it has been covered by artists as erse as Chaka Khan, PJ Harvey and Cristina, whose 1980 no wave version was suppressed by Leiber and Stoller when they learned she’d added lyrics referencing Quaaludes and a violent relationship. “It wasn’t a parody I was quite serious,” Cristina told the Boston Globe. “In fact, when I was asked to punk out the song itself, I said I wouldn’t. It was too good for that.”It was more than just the lyrical coincidences that made Lee refer to Is That All There Is? as the story of her life. It is a song about the stripping away of illusions, performed by a woman who knew the power of them. She took all the pain of her childhood, and of losing the family she longed for, and remade herself as the superstar Miss Peggy Lee, a fragile heart sheltered behind sequinned armour.• Ultimate Peggy Lee is available digitally now and on CD and vinyl from 19 June."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4eb6918fad719d74c29cfce407b182bf7162582c/0_136_4089_2453/master/4089.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b1f6798d055eb8cf8d516227fdd916d","title":"cummings and not goings","story":"The prime minister’s senior adviser has provoked national outrage by admitting travelling hundreds of miles to stay with family at the height of coronavirus lockdown. ’s Matthew Weaver reveals how he helped break the storyDominic Cummings has given his version of the events that have dominated the news for the past five days.

But he said that they explored no other options before settling on their trip to Durham. Why not?Did Cummings consider whether there was any risk that his wife’s trip to hospital in Durham with the couple’s son could take Covid-19 on to the site? Did he consider whether the difficulty of getting an immediate taxi was sufficient reason for him to drive to the hospital when he could “barely stand up” the night before?If Cummings had concerns over whether his eyesight was good enough to drive to London, why was he confident enough to drive 30 miles to Barnard Castle, with his wife and son in the vehicle?4 How extreme was the risk?The deputy chief medical officer for England, Jenny Harries, said that the only reason to travel with coronavirus in search of childcare was if there was an extreme risk to life. Did the family’s situation constitute such a risk?5 Why not talk to the media earlier?Cummings said that the media had been told things were wrong but “repeatedly reported them anyway”. How does he reconcile this account with Downing Street’s refusal to engage with attempts by the  and Daily Mirror to seek comment for more than six weeks? Why did Downing Street only issue comments after the publication of key articles by the two newspapers?6 When was the walk in Durham?Cummings said that he took a walk in the second week of his stay in Durham “after I started to recover”.

He insisted he and his wife and child stayed in a separate building and communicated with his parents by shouting from a distance.He also admitted they made a separate trip after his family’s 14-day period of isolation to Barnard Castle, a beauty spot 30 miles away from Durham, which he claimed was necessary to check his eyesight was good enough for the longer drive back to London.He acknowledged they got out of the car and sat for 15 minutes by a river at a time when the lockdown rules banned nonessential trips, with exceptions for shopping, exercise and picking up medication.Cummings did, however, deny going back to Durham any time after his return to London on 14 April, saying witnesses who claimed they saw him in a bluebell wood on 19 April were mistaken. He said he had walked in woodland during his isolation period but only on his father’s property. Both the trip from London and to Barnard Castle would appear to be breaches of the government’s lockdown rules.Refusing to apologise and saying he had not offered to quit his post, Cummings said: “I don’t regret what I did … reasonable people might disagree.”Following the press conference, Johnson once again gave his full backing to his senior adviser, who was a key architect of Brexit and of Johnson’s election victory last year.The prime minister took a tone of contrition at some points, saying he did “of course regret the confusion the anger and the pain that people feel … as a country that has been going through tremendous difficulties and sufferings”.However, he also claimed that Cummings had fully explained himself and done nothing wrong, insisting: “I don’t think anyone in No 10 has done anything to undermine our messaging.” He insisted it was “very, very plausible” for Cummings to have gone to Barnard Castle because of problems with his eyesight.Johnson added: “I’m finding that I have to wear spectacles for the first time in years, because, I think, of the likely effects of this thing.”Numerous Tory MPs and cabinet ministers tweeted their backing for Cummings after the appearance but others remained unhappy with the explanation and feared that their constituents’ anger would not be assuaged.In other developments:Cummings’ movements during the end of March and early April in breach of the lockdown were first disclosed in a joint investigation by the  and Mirror.In his press conference, Cummings made clear that he had “not considered” resigning but acknowledged he could have acted differently by telling the prime minister he intended to travel to Durham before doing so.Insisting he had acted within the spirit and letter of the rules, he said: “The rules make clear that when dealing with small children, that can be exceptional circumstances and I think that was exceptional circumstances.”Asked why he was not resigning, he said: “There is understandable anger but a lot of that anger is based on reports in the media that have not been true. It’s extremely regrettable that the media were told some of these things were wrong and reported them anyway.”No 10 was repeatedly asked for a response hours in advance of the  and Mirror’s original stories and declined to comment.Cummings revealed that his son needed to go to hospital while they were in Durham. The child was taken to hospital by ambulance along with his wife, who stayed overnight. Cummings left isolation the next day to pick up his wife and child from the hospital. His son later tested negative for coronavirus.Cummings said he had no physical contact with his parents but they had “shouted conversations at a distance”. He said the trip to Durham was not mentioned in articles for the Spectator written by him and his wife about their lockdown experience because he was worried about his security.In another remarkable admission, he said he had initially gone home from work fearing that his wife had contracted coronavirus, but then headed back into No 10 later that day to continue working, instead of isolating at home for 14 days.Later that evening he made the decision to travel to Durham to seek backup childcare, fearing that they would both become ill. In the end they did not have contact with other relatives, as his wife, Mary Wakefield, was well enough to care for their son.Cummings said he had not told the prime minister where he was going as Johnson had “a million things on his plate”, but he acknowledged this could have been a mistake.Earlier on Monday, more than 20 Conservative MPs called for Cummings to resign for breaking the lockdown, including the former ministers Tim Loughton and Steve Baker.But other Tory MPs appeared to be engaging in an effort by the party’s whips to dampen down public anger by issuing nearly identical cut-and-paste messages asking constituents to “rest assured” they were passing on concerns about Cummings to the “relevant colleagues”.Opposition leaders are to meet on Tuesday morning to discuss the next steps in holding Johnson and Cummings to account.Labour said the senior No 10 aide’s statement was not good enough. A party spokesman said: “The British people were looking for at least an apology from Dominic Cummings for breaking the lockdown. They got none.“The message from this government is clear: it’s one rule for Boris Johnson’s closest adviser, another for everybody else.”The Liberal Democrats and Scottish National party went further, calling for Cummings to be sacked.Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, said: “What should have been a resignation statement turned out to be a botched PR exercise that changes nothing. It is now beyond doubt Dominic Cummings broke multiple lockdown rules.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d94fd6382a297dea941888701010e4563093884f/0_111_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=951e0a76abf28a707d1f95ac7b4e9050","title":"regrets st dom had a few but then again too few to mention","story":"Dominic Cummings used his press conference to flick a V and remind us rules apply differently to himClassic Dom: Downing Street’s very own Prince Andrew. Show how much respect you have for the public and the media by turning up 30 minutes late for your own gig. There again, start as you mean to go on. Because Dominic Cummings’ press conference in the Downing Street Rose Garden was all about his own exceptionalism. How the rules applied differently to him than to the little people.On Sunday we had Boris Johnson, the understudy prime minister, try and fail to convince the country that there had been nothing untoward about Cummings’ trip to Durham. A midnight flit that had been so normal that Downing Street had spent the best part of six weeks trying to cover it up.Now we were to get the full story – or what approximated to it – from the person who is really running the country. And what we were treated to was an hour-long confused ramble that was disguised as the martyrdom of St Dom. A man who had only ever acted in the best interests of his family and the country. A man more sinned against than sinning.“Hi there,” he said, when he eventually turned up after a half-hour row with his wife over whether he really needed to change out of his hoodie and put on a shirt. “Sorry I’m late.”He wasn’t of course. Dom is never sorry about anything, but that was the closest we were going to get to any form of apology for having driven 260 miles to Durham to self-isolate on his parents’ estate, when the rest of the country were obeying the letter of the law, that he had helped write, by staying at home.Much of what Dom had to say made little sense. His wife had initially been ill, but he had broken with his own health guidelines by going into work the following day. He had then decided to exploit a loophole involving young children that had never been intended to apply to families in his position and drive to Durham.And no, he hadn’t bothered to get any medical advice or tell Boris what he was planning on doing. Because he was the Special One – the real prime minister – so there was no need. Indeed he might only have told Boris where he was a week later and by then they were both so ill that they conveniently forgot about the conversation until the  and the Mirror rudely reminded them.That was just the start though. His car had had a full tank of petrol – nice touch – and his son who couldn’t last a 30-minute drive to Barnard Castle without stopping for a pee had proved iron-bladdered for the entire six-hour journey north. Once in Durham, both Dom and his wife Mary had been ill with coronavirus. They had only broken lockdown once by nipping out to the local hospital because their son was unwell, and had self-isolated for the full 14 days.Then on the 15th day, St Dom had risen again. And although, he was still feeling shit he felt ready to go back to London to start running the country again. There was just one small problem. His vision was playing up. So the obvious way to see if he was safe to drive was to pack his family into the car and take a 30-mile journey to Barnard Castle.Not sure if that’s quite in the DVLA guidelines. There they had stopped and sat by the river for a bit – their entire conversation had been focused on the state of his eyesight – before heading off back to Durham for a walk in his private bluebell wood.All this was said in a state of barely repressed anger. This statement was costing Dom dear. Classic Dom never explains and never apologises. And even though not a word of apology escaped his lips, you could sense that this whole exercise felt uncomfortably close to one. Just having to appear in front of journalists for whom he felt nothing but contempt and pretend to be Mr Polite Nice Guy was a humiliation he couldn’t bear.Once the questions started, the mask began to crack. He was just doing what anyone else would have done in the same exceptional circumstances. Except they hadn’t been doing that. People in far more testing situations without the comfort of a second home 260 miles away had obeyed the guidelines. Because they were mugs. The proles who weren’t able to think for themselves. If he had a fault, it was that he was just too loving and law-abiding a father. Regrets, he had a few. But then again, too few to mention.Time and again he was asked to apologise and every time he refused. Anything but that. Everything was totally above board, which is why he and his wife had both written stories in the Spectator that they knew to be misleading. Perhaps he and Mary had both been so delirious, it had slipped their minds to point out they hadn’t been in London.Then he went full-on Trump. Everything that had been written about him was completely Fake News. Apart from everything in the  and the Mirror, which he had as good as corroborated.Had he thought of offering his resignation? A dismissive shrug. Who was he going to offer it to? Himself? There was no point in offering it to Boris because why would you ask your understudy? Just remember who worked for whom here.It ended in a standoff. If Dom had imagined this press conference would clear the air, then he had misjudged the mood of the nation just as he had by pleading for his own exceptionalism.There was also a deep irony that a man whose entire political reputation had been founded on the simplicity of his messaging was now pleading for his career on the basis that life was complicated. He even concluded by saying there was no point in answering some questions because the answers could be more confusing. So the journos could get lost.There was to be no redemption for Laughing Boy. His presser may have satisfied a few of the Boris faithful, but the majority of the country could only see a man who had chosen to break the rules and had – worse still – put the nation’s health at risk by effectively telling everyone they could interpret the rules however they wanted.Not that Dom would have cared that much. What would have hurt the most was that he had been seen for who he really was. A man who can turn any hint of regret into a giant “fuck you”.• This article was amended on 25 May 2020.

This has led to a question that has kept scientists on the hop.“If predators cannot see straight though the frogs, why do glass frogs have transparent skin at all, and not the opaque camouflaged patterns of other tree frog species?” said Dr James Barnett, a postdoctoral researcher at McMaster University, Canada, who co-authored the study.Barnett and colleagues say they have cracked the conundrum. “The frog is always green to generally match leaves, but leaves will differ in their brightness,” said Barnett. The team say that while the colour of the frog’s body changes little against dark or light foliage, the legs are more translucent and hence shift in brightness, helping the amphibians to blend in.“By having translucent legs and resting with the legs surrounding the body, the frog’s edge is transformed into a softer, less contrasting gradient from the leaf to the legs, and again from the legs to the body,” said Barnett, noting that this makes the frog’s outline less recognisable to predators.Writing in the US journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Barnett and colleagues report how they carried out three experiments.In the first, they photographed 55 glass frogs both on leaves and on a white background and then used computer models to compare the colour of the frog in each scenario. “We found that the colour of the frogs’ bodies did not change much between backgrounds, but the legs did change significantly,” said Barnett, adding that the change was down to a shift in brightness, not hue.The results were the same when they modelled how different species may see these frogs, including a snake, a bird and a human. “The camouflaging effect is interpreted in a similar manner between humans and the frogs’ natural predators,” said Barnett.The team then produced computer-generated images of glass frogs with different patterns of translucency against leafy backgrounds. Twenty people were each presented with 125 such images and asked to point out the frog as quickly as possible. The team found participants were quicker to spot the frog when it was fully opaque compared with frogs with a natural pattern of translucency.Finally, the team made 180 translucent and 180 opaque frogs out of gelatine and put them in vegetation in Ecuador, monitoring over the course of 72 hours whether the frogs were attacked by birds. Overall, 53 opaque and 24 translucent frogs were eaten during the experiment.“Our study shows that being translucent does help glass frogs camouflage themselves from predators, but not necessarily in the way expected by comparison to fully transparent species,” said Barnett.Prof Devi Stuart-Fox, an expert on animalcolour and behaviour at the University of Melbourne, who was not involved in the research, said: “This is a fascinating study because it shows yet another form of camouflage in animal – the sheer ersity of camouflage strategies in nature is truly remarkable.”Stuart-Fox said all three of the experiments had limitations, but taken together the evidence was compelling that the frogs’ translucency is a form of camouflage.“Interestingly, the legs are more translucent than the body, making the edges of the body harder to distinguish,” she said. “Predators form a search image for the shape of their prey, so masking the body’s outline is a very effective strategy to enhance camouflage.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea0748119492880663b2787ec8c35aa95af20337/0_0_4056_2433/master/4056.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2ccc933f3d8faabd789a99f0071c9688","title":"young people tell us how rising unemployment rates are affecting you","story":"As unemployment rates skyrocket in the UK, we’d like to hear from those under 25 who have lost jobs, or are struggling to get work, due to coronavirusYoung people, who often have less experience in employment and applications, are likely to be one of the most affected groups.We’d like to hear from those under 25 who have been made unemployed, or are struggling to get a job, due to coronavirus.You can get in touch by filling in the form below.

This is especially concerning as we move into an economic downtown,” Olchawski said.“The increase in self-harm among young women is deeply worrying. Yet the discussion around this issue and women and girls’ mental health is often very narrow, focusing on issues like social media rather than reflecting on wider causes. This research highlights the important relationship between self-harm and poverty.”Agenda is an alliance of groups working to help young women and girls affected by abuse, poverty, poor mental health, addiction, homelessness and criminal justice issues.NatCen, which based its findings on face-to-face interviews with more than 20,000 people in England, also found other stark differentials in mental health related to young women’s financial circumstances.Dr Mary-Ann Stephenson, the director of the Women’s Budget Group, said: “This powerful report shows the strong links between poverty, mental health and self-harming for younger women. We know that young women are particularly likely to have been hit badly by the economic impact of Covid-19, since they are more likely to work in sectors like hospitality and retail that have been closed down.”Men, especially middle-aged men, are more likely to kill themselves than women. However, the suicide rate among girls and young women aged between 10 and 24 has risen: in 2018 it was the highest on record.Sally McManus, who led the research for NatCen, said: “People have become increasingly likely to report using non-suicidal self-harm as a way of coping and this increase is particularly apparent in young women. This report indicates that self-harm often occurs in the context of poverty and debt, especially for young women.”Andy Bell, the deputy chief executive of the Centre for Mental Health thinktank, said: “This survey underlines that economic and social inequalities have a major impact on our mental health. Young women’s mental health has deteriorated significantly in the last decade, and those who are most disadvantaged are at a far greater risk still.“The impact of Covid-19 on young women’s mental health is likely to add extra pressure both now and in the coming months and years. It’s vital that we take action now to protect mental health for all and reduce the inequalities that lie behind so much of the distress this survey has brought to light.”A government spokesperson said: “We are absolutely committed to supporting everyone’s mental wellbeing, especially during this unprecedented period. Vulnerable young women can continue to access mental health services, including virtually, and we have released new tailored guidance to help people deal with this outbreak through practical tips and advice.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d061cbecb908f46db0efd3e5f2c0f2efa6881b43/184_255_6536_3922/master/6536.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6d224bd4e1fe159275bb7071351d07fc","title":"knocking down barriers through boxing photo essay","story":"A gym in Bristol has become a vital mental health service for young people with a combination of boxing, psychological support and personal development. Before the lockdown,  Alexander Turner spoke to and photographed the coaches and mentors behind the project – and the young people whose lives have been transformedFounded by Martin Bisp and Jamie Sanigar in 2006, Empire Fighting Chance (EFC) has transformed the Empire Boxing gym – a respected Bristol institution since the 1960s – into a vital mental health service operating in the centre of the city. With world heavyweight champion Tyson Fury frequently advocating the value of boxing and fitness towards his own mental health, the connection with boxing and emotional health has never been stronger.EFC predominantly works with people aged eight to 25 who experience significant challenges in their lives, including those excluded from school and involved in antisocial behaviour – almost always as a result of mental health issues. With a unique programme of support, EFC provides an invaluable resource to more than 4,000 people each year in one of the UK’s most deprived areas. It offers young people who would probably not access traditional forms of therapy a variety of bespoke services designed to support complicated home lives, blighted by poverty, deprivation and inadequate housing.“We are a charity that uses boxing, non-contact boxing and boxing training as a hook, to leverage the street credibility of the sport to knock down some of the barriers to entry for some of society’s most difficult to reach young people,” says EFC. Alongside that, it offers intensive personal development, psychological support, therapy, and advice on careers and education.“Young people arrive at our doors with a range of behavioural and emotional issues, including anger, anxiety, depression and low self-esteem,” says Bisp. “Their distress is often expressed in ways that can lead them into trouble rather than care and support.” Young people are referred to EFC by schools, charities, pupil referral units and even the police.Bisp says: “I’ve not yet met a 10-, 12-, or 13-year-old whose real life ambition is to be selling drugs or who wants to get involved in some of the situations they have been involved in. We have not yet met young people who have any desire to be mentally unwell. What happens is that their behaviour can manifest itself in certain ways. What we’ve found is that if you look at the symptom of anger or criminal behaviour, there are always underlying core problems. It may be chaotic home lives, it may be substance abuse by the parents, it could be domestic abuse, it could be sexual abuse. There is a whole series of factors that can lead into a behaviour that becomes symptomatic, which then gets a young person labelled.” Through its unique package of non-contact boxing and intensive personal support, EFC seeks to challenge and inspire vulnerable young people to “realise their unique potential” and participate in sport, gaining support in ways that feel natural.Marvin Rees, the first directly elected black mayor of a UK city, trained at the gym as a young man. “I was a very lost teenager, a mixed-race kid in the middle of a racially fractured Bristol in the 1980s,” he says. “Poor family, living in the inner city about 200 metres from this club. I had a reasonable brain but I was immobilised by a fear of failure and low self-esteem. Through boxing, I got a real sense of confidence. And I was also around coaches who cared.”Many of the young people EFC works with may have fallen through the gaps in mental health services or be waiting to receive support. “The young people we are dealing with come from chaotic home lives, maybe lack of parental support, lack of parents in total, they have mental health issues,” says Sanigar. “They want to access mental health services but the waiting list with CAMHS (child and adolescent mental health services) can be six months. The hoops that a young person has to go through – visiting the GP, getting a referral to CAMHS, making that appointment, filling out the forms … That is challenging enough if you’ve got two parents in a middle-class family. But when you’ve probably not got the support, the barriers to entry for that service are too challenging and too long-winded, too time-consuming and too late in the day. Within that period of time, anything could have happened.”Visiting the gym in 2019, Prince Harry said: “The thought of sitting down in a chair, one to one, with a therapist, can be a real deterrent. However, this is the sort of place where you don’t even realise you are being cured, but you are.”“A lot of these kids have gone through so much, it might be physical or sexual abuse, it could be anything – and they are angry,” Bisp says. “Rather than try and tell people they shouldn’t feel angry, actually what we start talking about is that anger is perfectly normal. Anger is a manifestation of issues, and they are issues they have a right to be angry about. So, what we’re teaching them is how to react and how to deal with those situations in a way that’s constructive.”The former IBF featherweight world champion Lee Selby is a mentor at the club. “I try and get into them that I’ve worked my way up,” he says. “It’s not just sports that that works in, it’s general life. If you work hard you can achieve your goals and your dreams.” The influence of somebody such as Selby on marginalised young people – many of whom will have grown up watching and hearing of his achievements – can be dramatic. “They know I am from the same sort of background and they can relate to me,” he says. “At school they are being told what to do by some posh guy and they are not really interested.”For many of the young people, a supportive, nurturing relationship with an adult can be a new experience. Sarah, foster mother of April, 16, describes how April’s relationship with her coach Courtney “has grown to the point where Courtney is a trusted adult. That has been a rare thing for her in her life, in her experience. It’s really important.”This type of relationship at EFC is built and maintained over a 20-week programme that combines non-contact boxing with mentoring and psychological education. The coaches believe that boxing, being largely inidual and broken into three-minute rounds, allows a unique opportunity for therapy and mentoring.“The way that boxing is broken down into rounds means you’ve got opportunities to build relationships and to talk while they are doing the activity,” says Sanigar. “They can be skipping and you can be having a conversation. They can stop for a minute, you can have a conversation, you can’t do that in football. You have your own inidual goal set by a coach, and your goal might be to get five skips. We build small mini-goals for young people to achieve.”Ellie, 15, was referred to EFC by her therapist. “I had a really bad home growing up,” she says. “I never had space where I could just go to relax. It was always tension, tension, tension. I struggle with really bad anger issues. They have calmed down a lot, so much, since being here. Even after the first session you could see the difference. I’d keep everything in and wouldn’t let anything out. They really taught me how to open up about how I’m feeling. It’s definitely made a difference in every aspect of my life.”Nina, who has PTSD, depression and social anxiety says Empire has made her “less anxious about being in groups, and being with new people”. She adds: “I just feel comfortable being able to come back even if I don’t have to do the sessions. I can speak to someone, it doesn’t necessarily even have to be about what’s going on, it can just be about anything which helps and it’s a nice distraction from everything else.”Dontae, 17, was referred to the gym after being excluded from school a number of times. He is now at college studying health and fitness and says: “I started coming in more and more regularly. I started loving it and my confidence grew more and more knowing how I feel, and telling them how I feel, and them listening to how I feel. It’s helped me to calm down. They are basically like mentors to me. My mental health has got better. My mental health was just about anger, anger, anger. Now it isn’t. I feel better, I feel more normal. I feel more awareness, mentally stronger, knowing what decisions can benefit me.”One issue that EFC regularly identifies in young people is low self-esteem and sense of self-worth. “The level of extremity has drastically changed over recent years”, says Sanigar. “This is inner city, an area of deprivation that is going through a bit of a funny change at the moment. A three-bed house will cost you over £300,000. If you are growing up in this area with nothing – no role models, no mentors – it’s practically impossible now for you to get on the property ladder. Youth services have been closed. There is nothing for them and they are becoming more isolated, sitting in their bedrooms. They are living a fantasy life on their phones, where it’s Instagram, Snapchat – all these wonderful lives out there. They are suddenly looking at their lives and it is destroying their self-esteem.”One of the employment schemes EFC runs is with local coffee roasters Extract Coffee, who offer a barista training programme. Steven, 20, found employment after completing the course: “I wouldn’t have got the job at Boston Tea Party without Empire giving me that push. When I started coming to Empire I wasn’t in a great place, but now everything has changed. After doing boxing sessions day by day, my mood generally got a lot better. I feel happier, I don’t have those days when I don’t feel like doing anything because I don’t have the self-esteem or the energy. I’m actively looking to do stuff. Compared to where I first started that’s quite a big leap.”EFC has also trained qualified therapists in non-contact boxing skills in order to provide support to young people with some of the most severe mental health issues.“The demographic we have here is very varied,” says therapist Jane Ivall. “Often they will be some of the hardest-to-reach young people. The fact they are engaging and connecting here is a good starting point for them engaging and connecting with us. Here, there is a whole range of people with a whole range of issues, and we just come alongside them using the medium of boxing to enable them to access mental health support. The boxing breaks down the barriers to traditional therapy. It enables people to open up and access things they traditionally may not feel comfortable to access. Talking about a trauma is complex. Working physically enables you to shift trauma, to explore things and to build a rapport and trust with a therapist quicker.”According to Rees, “the benefits to the wider city are pretty straightforward: a healthier population. Young people who are less likely to become mentally unwell, who have more structure in their lives and who are better able to develop their own talents, abilities and ambitions in life. They are also less likely to become service users, or engage in activities that take away the quality of life from other people.”“We’re not careers specialists, we’re not education specialists, we’re not mental health specialists,” says Bisp. “We’ve had to just do our best and what we think is right, and thankfully the results over the last 10 years have proven that what we do does work”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85efe843737a1365ea6f67041c5244defe841840/61_0_3378_2029/master/3378.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1214781a3d78f77c8fc8e7bcf7aa7a4a","title":"dina asher smith commonwealth games gold 2022 kelly sotherton","story":"The pile-up of championships in 2022 could rob the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham of some of its biggest stars and will make it impossible for Dina Asher-Smith to attempt a unique treble, Kelly Sotherton has warned.Sotherton, three-times an Olympic medallist and the new track and field leader for Team England, is still hopeful she can persuade Asher-Smith to take part in Birmingham during a summer when the world championships, Commonwealth Games and European championships all take place during a five-week window between 15 July and 21 August.But Sotherton admitted the prospects of Asher-Smith attempting the 100m, 200m and 4x100m relay in Birmingham and Katarina Johnson-Thompson doing another heptathlon immediately after competing at the world championships in Oregon are slim because of fatigue.“The fixture congestion is not ideal,” Sotherton said. “Hopefully, ideally, we would have loved to see Dina Asher-Smith come to Birmingham, do the treble again. That is not going to happen realistically. She is not going to go to the worlds then come to Birmingham and maybe even go to the Europeans in Munich. She will maybe be selective.“My job is to speak to everybody and say: ‘OK, is the Commonwealth Games in your plans? If not, why isn’t it? It is a home Games. It should be a priority because your profile will be massive going into it, everyone will want to know who you are and you will gain new fans. Commercially it will be better for you.’ But I understand that financially for the better athletes the worlds will be where it is at because there is potential for more money.”The former heptathlete added: “KJT is not coming to the Commonwealth Games to do a heptathlon but she might come and do a long jump or high jump. In the same way maybe Dina might come to Birmingham to do the relay. I would love all of the stars to be part of the Games so all the fans can see them. It is finding that balance.”Sotherton is optimistic she can help England surpass the 29 athletics medals won when the Games were staged in Manchester in 2002. “I truly believe we can get that or can exceed that,” she said. “I believe we can be the most successful team at a home Games. From being a coach at age groups the last five years you can see a lot of talent coming through and that is really promising in the 18-20 bracket.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/326bd8e83caf4dbe4c57278b547bc593cd326e98/0_215_3264_1958/master/3264.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=177317d507d3a214cea48ccec269d3de","title":"hottest front room seats the best theatre and dance to watch online","story":"From live-streams of new plays to classics from the archive, here are some of the top shows online now or coming soon – this page is updated dailyThe National has risen to the occasion by unveiling a mighty lineup of some of its greatest NT Live hits, to be streamed online on Thursdays at 7pm and then available for seven days.

Like Hines, Watkins grew up in Barnsley.

I Want My Hat Back finds an otherwise polite bear taking revenge on a bad bunny who has pinched his pointy red hat. It’s eight and a half minutes of pure joy and just as mischievously macabre as the original book. The sequel, This Is Not My Hat, also staged on top of a wooden dresser and told with music by Jim Whitcher, is a kind of Grand Theft Aqua in which a tiddler has stolen a handsome green bowler from a much bigger fish who reclaims it while enjoying a snack. We Found a Hat completes a triumphant tabletop trilogy, with Nicholson giving a particularly expressive performance as two rod-puppet tortoises stumble across a stylish hat and things get a little bit cosmic. All three films will be online until 7 June. The Little Angel’s presentation of Toby Olié’s puppet version of the Ross Collins book What Does an Anteater Eat? is online until 1 September.“She had us, both of us, absolutely round her finger…” From that first line, Andrew Scott will have you hooked in this half-hour monologue by Simon Stephens that captures truths about family life, art, nature and much else besides.

Soon after, she was nominated for best newcomer at the Edinburgh Comedy awards. Now, she’s working in a supermarket. Pattison had moved back to Newcastle upon Tyne a few weeks before lockdown to save money for the Edinburgh fringe while living with her parents. Like many standups, she relies on live comedy for the bulk of her income, gigging most nights of the week. Some gigs are rescheduled for later this year, but, says Pattison, “I’ve got to mentally and financially prepare for the fact they might get pulled.”For those without savings or familial financial support, the sudden closure of comedy clubs was troubling. Like Pattison, some already have new jobs. Pope Lonergan has returned to care work, a job he did for eight years until becoming a full-time comedian in 2019. In lockdown, Lonergan started doing livestreams where audience members could pay through tips, but it became clear he needed reliable paid work. After waiting weeks for a new DBS check, he’s now signed up with a care work agency where you can pick shifts at the start of each week. “That will be really good going back into comedy,” he says. “I think a lot of comedians will be going back with secondary jobs.”Although Lonergan and Pattison miss being on stage, they’re staying positive. “I find it weird that people assume I’m gutted that I’ve had to get a job,” Pattison says. “To me, it’s the most sensible thing to do.”So far, she’s done stints on the shop floor and customer service helpline and found unexpected upsides. “At a time when everything is so chaotic,” she says, “having a set day where I get paid is lovely.”Lonergan, meanwhile, is looking forward to spending time with the care home residents: “I enjoy having a purpose that helps improve the lives of others. And I like to chit-chat the elderly because they always tell me I’m a handsome boy!”Jacob Hawley has been a comedian for six years and went full-time – his “dream life” – a year ago. During lockdown, he’s been recording a new BBC podcast, Jacob Hawley’s Job Centre, in which comedians Richard Gadd, Mark Olver and Nish Kumar discuss how work has changed during the pandemic.With two-thirds of his income coming from live work and a baby on the way, Hawley says: “This podcast came about through necessity – I had driving job applications up on my browser.”The conversations Hawley is having with guests haven’t always been open subjects between comedians. Who is paying your rent and who has an additional, non-comedy job are often shrouded in secrecy.“When I started doing standup, I was working in retail, and all I ever wanted to do was stop, because I didn’t feel like a real comedian,” Hawley says. “There’s a massive amount of shame around that in comedy. That will have to change, because it’s going to be a long time until people can make a living out of live performance again.”Meanwhile, secrecy leaves many wondering why they’re falling behind their peers. Pattison says: “It’s easy to think, ‘How did they climb the ladder so quickly?’ Maybe they didn’t have to work a day job, so of course they’re going to get seen more and get better quicker. If more people were transparent about help they’ve had, it would take the pressure off everybody.”Lonergan agrees: “I would love to look at every comedian’s parents’ bank account. Privilege is a huge thing in comedy. It creates a two-tier system – the ones who have financial resources can get ahead.”Some comics can’t view their secondary job as a temporary lockdown measure. Sikisa Bostwick-Barnes has always juggled multiple jobs, at times doing 50-plus hours a week as a solicitor, pub worker and comedian, so she could pay student loans and support her parents. This hiatus feels like a step back, with Comedy Store and tour support gigs cancelled. “I had a plan for my career and it all went up in the air,” she says. “My day job is intense – I work for a domestic violence charity – and having something that was creative, fun and social helped my mental health.”Not everyone is able to work now. Tom Mayhew would like to return to his supermarket job but doesn’t want to risk bringing the virus into the home he shares with his dad, who recently had radiotherapy. Instead, he’s enrolled on universal credit, but, with a six-week wait, had to use money saved for the Edinburgh festival for essentials.“I need to get money so my parents can afford rent,” he says. “It’s very tough not being able to do live work. I miss the financial side and feeling like I’ve got a purpose.”There’s concern that the loss of live comedy could also mean the loss of working-class comics. “There are more working-class voices on the live circuit than in writers’ rooms or on television,” says Hawley. “Live work was a genuine meritocracy – anyone could get on stage. It’s not perfect, but it was a more even playing field. That drawbridge has been pulled up.”Yet, says Pattison, working-class comics are used to putting in the extra work that will be needed to make up for lost time. “My first fringe, I saved every penny of my tips to pay for it,” she says. “I would turn up to gigs still in my uniform. I’ve always taken pride in that – what choice do I have, I’m going to work for it.”Hawley agrees: “I can’t fall back on my parents, so you do have that fear, but you’re used to grafting. I’m going to do this podcast, but then maybe I’ll be in a Tesco van, and gigging in the evening. I hope working-class people won’t be pushed away, because they’ve got the grit to do it. It’s not fair that they should have to, but that’s the world we live in.”It’s unclear when live comedy will return, and whether comedy venues will survive. Pattison says: “There’s a lot of places saying they’re not going to open until next year. In coming months more people will turn to other jobs, which is why I wanted to get in straight away.”With such a long hiatus, this could be a chance for industry-wide change. The recently established Live Comedy Association is a source of hope. Lonergan has been elected to its steering group. “I want to fight for live comedy and its preservation,” he says. “I want to push to make it more egalitarian.”The way we value comedy could change, too. During the pandemic, it’s lifted moods and offered escapism. Many comedians making new things are empowered to request reimbursement. “People before might’ve been shy asking for money,” says Mayhew. “Now, they’re more likely to say, ‘I need money to produce this thing.’”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf4c75ad819cd6cfca3648431bd71cdf63c91cf3/0_135_4018_2412/master/4018.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=37fc5fa92c43b4f7e54c05bce4ee19b9","title":"elon musk grimes change baby name roman numerals look better","story":"Tech entrepreneur and musician have changed their child’s name from X Æ A-12 to X Æ A-Xii, without much explanationThe tech entrepreneur Elon Musk and the musician Grimes have changed the unusual and largely unpronounceable name of their firstborn child. But anyone hoping that X Æ A-12 might be replaced by something a little more conventional is going to be disappointed.In an Instagram post on Sunday, Grimes confirmed that the baby formerly known as X Æ A-12 would now be known as X Æ A-Xii.Grimes gave no explanation for the change to using roman numerals, but later responded to a post asking if the alteration was made to comply with a California law that holds only the 26 letters of the alphabet can be used for child names.“Roman numerals. Looks better tbh,” she wrote.The couple appeared to have been at odds over how to interpret X Æ A-12 from the outset. The musician, whose real name is Claire Elise Boucher, previously explained that Æ was her “elven spelling” of AI (for artificial intelligence) and “X” stood for “the unknown variable”.“It’s just X, like the letter X. Then AI. Like how you said the letter A then I,” wrote Grimes on Thursday in response to a query on Instagram.But Musk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, told the podcast host Joe Rogan a different story: “I mean it’s just X, the letter X. And then the Æ is, like, pronounced ‘Ash’… and then A-12. A-12 is my contribution.”Musk already had five children – Griffin and Xavier and triplets Damian, Saxon and Kai – as well as a son, Nevada, who died as an infant. He credited his partner for the creative leap.“First of all, my partner is the one that, actually, mostly, came up with the name,” he said. “Yeah, she’s great at names.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d20c2c0544660c337abe163d6bf33f1980efd36/0_36_5536_3324/master/5536.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=70cf956de09dd9304b912fe6a5a1cb62","title":"your best holiday food or drink memory","story":"Whether it was cheap-as-chips or budget-busting, tell us ab out the most mind-blowing food-and-drink experience you’ve had on your travelsPerfect pizza in a Naples backstreet or spicy-sharp noodles from a Hanoi stall?

The absence of cars and planes swept away the Athenian smog and the spring skies shone with an uncanny clarity, throwing the familiar outline of the monument into sharp relief. The Parthenon seemed to vibrate with the promise of transcendence – a symbol of humanity’s ability to outlast, to overcome, to survive. But one thing was missing: the tiny tourists, clinging to the edges of the rock like a trail of black ants, were gone. There was nobody up there communing with the spirit of Athena, except perhaps for a few stray cats snoozing in the shade of those giant columns.So when archaeological sites opened up again – along with shopping centres, beauty parlours and high schools – in Greece on 18 May, I wanted to be the first up on that hill. But my plan was foiled by an unseasonal heatwave that kept Athenians confined indoors there was no question of scrambling up the Acropolis hill in 37C. On Thursday, the heat finally broke. In the silvery evening light, my seven-year-old son and I wandered past the restless shoppers parading up and down Ermou Street, the equivalent of Oxford Street. The crowds dissipated in the old town of Plaka, the souvenir shops still shuttered, the touts who normally prowl hungrily outside the tavernas gone. Usually, there’s a long queue of people waiting to enter the Acropolis, even at the quieter entrance on the north slope, by the ancient theatre of Dionysus. For us, there was nobody.“The marble had space to breathe, the temple had a chance to rest,” the gloved ticket seller smiled behind her plexiglass shield, when I told her how excited I was about our private audience with one of the wonders of the world. “Imagine, there are usually 10-12,000 people a day clambering over these stones. Today, there might be 10 of you up there.”A couple of masked security guards waved us up the slopes to the Propylaea, the monumental portico that marks the entrance to the sacred precinct. Yellow stickers warning visitors to “keep safe distance” had been stuck on intermittent steps, fashioned from massive slabs of marble. “Were people really huge in ancient Greece?” my son wondered, marvelling at the size of the stairs. Everything seemed amplified without the chattering, snap-happy crowds. The Parthenon looked even more monumental than usual. A gusty wind drove moody clouds across the mountains that encircle the city. Shards of sunlight pierced the clouds, like searchlights scanning the cascading blocks of concrete that surround the site, whose vanilla and nicotine palette matched the fragmentary columns scattered about in poetic arrangements.And there, on the horizon, was the sea, punctuated by stationary ships and islands, still off limits to travellers.Four teenage girls were taking selfies on a ledge, the Greek flag fluttering behind them. Three students were sitting on a marble bench, staring variously into their phones and into the distance. A man was fielding phone calls, while his two young daughters scampered around the ruins. There were plenty of affectionate cats, to my son’s delight. But I didn’t expect the gulp of swallows, slaloming in and out of the Parthenon’s columns in a joyous, sonorous game of tag.I took a couple of photos that didn’t do justice to the view or the monument or the moment. And then, auspiciously, my phone died. I didn’t have to filter this once-in-a-lifetime experience through a screen. I felt suddenly liberated, elated – like the tanned, insouciant tourists in photographer Tod Papageorge’s On the Acropolis, a recently published series of black-and-white photographs shot in the early 1980s. Reclining, embracing or unselfconsciously draped on the ruins like a modern-day frieze, these luminous mortals represent a time when touching the Parthenon and one another was perfectly natural."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6088d89032f8673c3473567a91157080840a7bb8/413_955_2808_1685/master/2808.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e70539507e72ee87162b69137db2b7fc","title":"10 of the best books about mountains for a virtual climb","story":"Pioneers, PoWs and those taking spiritual paths immerse the reader in beautiful and treacherous landscapes and offer wisdom for our times For the past 10 years, I have chased up and down mountains in wind, rain, snow and sun. Walking, rock-climbing, swimming and camping: a trip into the hills is always intense, visceral and life-affirming. I love meeting the elements and discovering what the mountain has to offer on any given day. Nan Shepherd’s seminal book on the Cairngorms, The Living Mountain, opened my eyes to the many ways of perceiving a mountain.In picking these books, I’ve steered away from the macho-mountain trend (not all hill-goers are male daredevils pitting themselves against nature). These stories of joy, wonder, fear and wisdom go some way towards filling the current void. Their voices lead me back into the remote high lands.Britain’s first female mountain guide, Moffat discovered the “free and splendid world of mountains and mountain climbing” in 1946, then deserted her post as a driver in the army and committed to a new way of life. Her spartan existence in postwar Britain included sleeping under hedges and washing in freezing tarns (activities that might now be re-branded wild camping and wild swimming). From Cornwall to north Wales, Langdale to Skye, these pages circle through landscapes that will be lovingly familiar to outdoors enthusiasts across the UK. Moffat pads barefoot up steep rock faces, teeters along icy edges, sleeps on frozen hay and picks watercress from clifftops. In crisp prose, this memoir describes many strange and delightful moments from a free-spirited lifestyle.Famously written on sheets of toilet paper in prisoner of war camps across Europe, Murray had almost completed the first manuscript of Mountaineering in Scotland when the Gestapo found his precious sheets and destroyed the text. With the tenacity of a true mountaineer, Murray refused to be deterred: he rewrote the entire book later stating that the Gestapo had done him a favour by forcing him to produce a much-improved second draft. Winter sunrise, moonlit nights and endless midsummer days … Murray captures the startling movements of light and weather in the mountains of Glen Coe, Ben Nevis and Skye. Struggling through snow and ice, delighting in the technical interest of rock climbs and looking out to dazzling views across land, sea and hills, Murray’s book will appeal to anyone who loves the Highlands.For mystics craving revelation, Matthiessen’s quest is a gift. The Snow Leopard hails from the 1970s counter-culture era when spiritual seekers sought to dissolve the ego and achieve oneness. While many experimented with hallucinogenics, Jung and eastern philosophy, Matthiessen travelled to the Crystal mountain in the remote Dolpo region of the Nepalese Himalayas. Gentle, reflective journal entries recount his path towards enlightenment. Sights, sounds, people and nature are observed with a gentle curiosity hopes and frustrations unfold alongside his desire to experience “the infinite in every moment”. Walking with Matthiessen through Nepalese villages, high mountain passes and Buddhist monasteries is a privilege. Snow falls and prayer flags flutter as he journeys on, hoping for a glimpse of the near-mythic snow leopard.Perched atop the steep banks over Loch Ness is Abriachan, a scattered hilltop community with a rich crofting heritage. From hill fires to haymaking, calving to ceilidhs, Stewart brings this remote neighbourhood to life. Her portrait of 1960s crofting is not a romanticised image of escape and rural idyll: a precarious existence lived “near to the bones of things” is described in simple, sharp prose. Among the snowdrifts, troublesome goats and interminable turnip drills, intimate relationships develop between people, animals and land. This is a tale of hardship and adversity faced with steady pragmatism, kindness and curiosity. “You foresaw the worst and so were quietly thankful for the best”: Stewart’s grounded hill wisdom is an earthy tonic for challenging times.Interest in women’s mountaineering has surged in recent years, and yet when I go to the bookshops, still I find shelves dominated by men’s stories. Helen Mort’s radical book redraws the map, bringing the forgotten narratives of remarkable mountain women to light. From a crinoline-clad Jemima Morrell crossing the Swiss Alps in 1863 to Alison Hargreaves on K2, this evocative collection also includes vivid descriptions of Mort’s own climbing and running across the UK. With exquisite rhythm and heart-stopping imagery, this book helps you to discover that mountains exist in unexpected places. “You zip your jacket up  And nobody notices you are a mountain.”Why are we so obsessed with climbing mountains? Just three centuries ago, mountains and wild landscapes were revered but not seen as something to be conquered now, each year, more than 350,000 people flock to the summit of Snowdon. Macfarlane’s modern classic charts the cultural revolution in our attitude to high places. The route from sacred to awesome challenge is related through a colourful cast of mountaineers who have pushed into extreme terrain over the past few centuries. While the scientists, explorers, poets and climbers may set out with different goals, their mindset is broadly similar: from Coleridge to Mallory, each character is driven by a blend of curiosity, compulsion and the ability to tolerate extreme suffering. For keen hill-goers, this book is deeply reassuring. Since Macfarlane suggests that the imagination is key to being a mountaineer, then I can now count all my time indoors reading, dreaming and obsessing as legitimate mountain activity.Like no other mountaineering book, Newby’s begins with a London fashion show. Frantically preparing the 1956 Spring Collection, Newby is struggling with an obstinate dress when he decides enough is enough and sends a fateful telegram to his friend, Hugh Carless. From here the book lurches from one misadventure to another as the hapless Englishmen travel to Nuristan, Afghanistan, to climb previously unconquered peaks. Sweating their way up steep roads and desolate gorges, past thundering torrents and mulberry trees, their story is narrated with a humour and modesty that will make you laugh aloud. However, the comedy does not disguise the fact that they were travelling through dangerous territory. One night, Newby awakes to see men in dark cloaks riding past, silently. The next day they find the body of a traveller whose skull had been smashed in with a rock. Vultures circle: Carless and Newby moved on, swiftly. Nuristan has since been the scene of intense guerrilla warfare and Taliban insurgency. This is a rare glimpse into a region that is now very much off-limits.Not one for the faint-hearted. The action of this book takes place on the fearsome North Face of the Eiger. Avalanches, rockfall and brutal storms abound in Harrer’s record of a significant period of mountaineering history. From 1935-1958, personal ambitions and national rivalries funnelled climbers from across Europe to take up ropes, crampons and ice axes in pursuit of a glorious new conquest: the first ascent of the North Face. Teamwork, competition, tactical retreats, heroic rescues and desperate tragedies unfold on this unforgiving, icy face. The White Spider takes readers to a place where few can follow. Harrer illuminates the profound lessons that are learned on the severe edges of our world.Frank Fraser Darling’s study transports you to the Scottish Highlands where, for two years, he followed a herd of red deer (in the remote north-west), observing how they live, eat, mate, socialise, raise young and respond to the environment. Darling is no detached observer: he seeks to build an intimacy with the deer and their habitat, spending hours in silence, emptying his mind and walking barefoot to raise the threshold of his awareness. I love the vivid descriptions of deer on the hill and the incredible insights gleaned through Darling’s meticulous attention to his subject. This pioneering study was published in 1937, when studying animals in their natural environment was considered “unscientific”. Through Darling’s words I see a little more of the “total” mountain: as a complex, social ecosystem.When Shu Wen’s husband disappeared in Tibet, the young Chinese doctor set out on an epic journey into wild, unknown lands to find him. This extraordinary true story s vast distances of space and time. Wen’s journey begins in 1958, during the tumultuous years of the Chinese “liberation” of Tibet. Early in her search for answers, Wen is attacked by resistance fighters and rescued by a nomadic family. For 30 years she lives on the high plateau with Buddhist nomads. Cut off from the world, she slowly adapts to their way of life. Years pass, Wen ages, her skin darkens and her old identity fades, but still she clings to her husband’s tattered photograph. Finally, Wen travels to the holy mountains, where she finds beautiful and devastating answers. War, peace, love, loss and reconciliation: this is a haunting book of immense power.

A key question is whether antibodies produced by the body following an infection with the coronavirus provide some level of immunity, and if so, for how long.But we do have some clues. “We know from ‘normal’ coronavirus studies done in the past you can infect people after about a year following an initial infection,” said Dr Ben Killingley, consultant in acute medicine and infectious diseases at University College London hospital.Dr Joshua Schiffer, an expert in infectious diseases at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in the US, added that any signs of reinfection would require detailed scrutiny.“It is also important to recognise that documentation of one or a handful of reinfections does not prove that this is a common, epidemiologically important event.” This initially caused concerns, as experts feared the results might suggest patients had been reinfected. However, the World Health Organization has since said the results were actually false positives, a result of the test picking up particles of the virus within dead lung cells – but this is not active virus. That’s because the PCR (or “have-you-got-it”) test is based on detecting genetic material from the virus – on its own it does not reveal whether that virus is active, and infectious, or not.Some people with Covid-19 experience complications following an initial infection.“In some persons they begin to feel well again and signs and symptoms including fever decrease, but some then go on to develop respiratory distress and must be provided oxygen in hospital,” said David Heymann, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. “It appears to be a delayed immune response that is more serious in some persons and that reacts to remaining virus in various organs.”Even some people who have had a mild experience of Covid-19 have reported experiencing symptoms for several weeks or even months, although experts say only time and testing will tell what the long-term implications are and how common this is.Killingley said it was unclear what was behind such ongoing symptoms, but there are a range of possibilities – including inflammation caused by the virus – although the mechanisms and risks are, as yet, unclear. Immunology professor Daniel Altmann, of Imperial College London, said such cases are important to study.Schiffer agreed such cases are cause for concern. “In the case of Sars CoV-2, my colleagues and I are particularly worried about the possibility of prolonged periods of lung inflammation andor scarring,” he said.A recent study of 60 coronavirus patients in China showed 10 patients tested positive for Covid-19 after discharge from hospital. However, once again, experts say this could be down to the test picking up genetic material from inactive virus, with other studies, including work in South Korea, suggesting those who test positive with Covid-19 after recovering from the disease are not infectious.“It’s not uncommon to find virus in the nose or throat for up to four weeks after initial infection, but tests to establish whether this is live infectious virus – as opposed to just genetic material detection – are not normally positive for much longer than a week,” said Killingley, adding: “I haven’t come across relapse cases whereby the initial infection acquired weeks ago reignites itself into an infectious case.”Schiffer had doubts: “In my view, the presence of Sars CoV-2 RNA many weeks after initial infection may represent ongoing viral replication in cells, which also implies the persistence of small amounts of “active” virus,” he said. “However, quantities are tiny and may represent the dying embers of infection in the body.”Altmann said that, asymptomatic cases aside, infectiousness correlates strongly with acute symptoms, which typically last for up to 12 days, with a tailout to 28 days. “My sense is that in the people who are feeling unwell long after this, it may not be virus, but some kind of immune or inflammatory perturbation,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13e53cdb8ee8dc21a08e8ba59cae12407966d704/0_656_3645_2187/master/3645.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bec4d118ed9c4d1a5edd907a028c7627","title":"marie antoinette travel bag paris auction","story":"Embroidered serviette used during coronation also went for several times its estimateA travel bag belonging to Marie Antoinette has sold for more than five times its estimate in an auction of royal memorabilia near her one-time home in Versailles.A large embroidered serviette used during the coronation of the Austrian-born monarch – who was executed during the French Revolution – also went for several times its estimate.The Osenat auction house said there had been fierce bidding late on Sunday “both in the room, over the telephone and on the internet” for Marie Antoinette’s belongings.The leather travel bag with the studded “Queen’s room number 10” inscription went for €43,750 (£39,120), having had an estimate of between €8,000 and €10,000.The damask serviette, embroidered with the fleur-de-lis insignia and leaf crowns with a bouquet of roses at its centre, went for €14,500.﻿A lock of hair from her husband, Louis XVI, who was also executed, went for €4,000.

What stories would have defined 2020 so far? Even before the worst pandemic in a century, tectonic shifts were already under way. The news felt exhausting. But the world is still turning, despite the movements of half of humanity being restricted in some way. Even apart from Covid-19, it has been a year of significant developments.In the middle of the night in Baghdad, on 3 January, a US drone fired the most consequential shot in the Middle East in a generation, killing 10 people including Qassem Suleimani, leader of the expeditionary force of Iran’s Revolution Guards.The 62-year-old general had been a thorn in the side of the American-led occupation of Iraq, overseeing the Islamic republic’s campaign in Syria and nurturing proxies that turned Iran into a regional player. He was thought to be untouchable. Donald Trump marked his killing with a wordless tweet of a grainy American flag.The chaotic days following the killing involved a deadly crush at one of the general’s public funerals, Iran’s first ever missile strikes on US troops, the accidental shooting down of a passenger jet over Tehran – killing all 176 aboard – and an outburst of anti-regime protests in Iranian cities.The reverberations may be felt for years: nearly all the regional projects Suleimani was overseeing when he died have faltered, the Observer reported this month, and the al-Quds force is struggling to manage its network of proxies without his giant presence.The largest swarms of locusts in decades have descended on farms in parts of Africa, south Asia and the Arabian peninsula this year, posing “an extremely alarming and unprecedented threat to food security and livelihoods”, according to the UN.The pests form vast, destructive clouds that can travel about 55 miles (90km) in 24 hours. A swarm about a square kilometre large can consume the same quantity of food in a day as 35,000 people. The risk of second waves is said to still be critical, including in Yemen, where food security is already dire amid the ongoing civil war.Hostility towards Indian Muslims has crept further into the Indian mainstream in the past five years since the country’s Hindu nationalist prime minister, Narendra Modi, was elected. In February, it boiled over during a state visit by Donald Trump, culminating in the country’s worst religious violence in decades.The catalyst was widely acknowledged to be a ruling party leader, Kapil Mishra, who on 23 February issued a public ultimatum that if the police did not clear the streets of mostly Muslim protesters, his supporters would be “forced to hit the streets”.At least 50 were killed in the ensuing violence between Hindu and Muslim mobs, amid allegations that the Delhi police stood back to allow Hindus to commit violence while beating to death some of the Muslim men in their custody.The riots and killings contributed to growing unease about the kind of India that may emerge from Modi’s years in power.After nearly 19 years, more than 43,000 civilian casualties and three US presidents, the Trump administration signed a peace deal with the Taliban on a Saturday afternoon in late February.It was a good deal for the Taliban: they managed to exclude elected officials in Kabul and deal with the Americans directly. On paper, US troops could be gone from the country by spring 2021. The Taliban have promised to sit down with their Afghan government counterparts and make a separate peace deal later, but there is no guarantee they will do so, and their attacks on the Afghan army and police continue.The US says the ongoing violence means their troops may stay, but it is clear, not least to the Taliban, that Washington is desperate to get out of the war.For a few days after Bernie Sanders swept the Las Vegas Democratic primary, it appeared that a self-described “democratic socialist” was going to win the nomination of a major American party. Instead, the Democratic establishment rallied behind former vice-president Joe Biden, the campaign’s standard-bearer for the liberalism of the Obama and Clinton eras.Biden cleaned up on Super Tuesday and soon after clinched the nomination, but there was no victory tour, nor conciliatory rallies with his opponents. Instead, the 77-year-old appeared to vanish from view as the scale of the coronavirus emergency finally broke through to policymakers and the public. He is currently campaigning from the basement of his Delaware home.On 6 February, an Argentine weather station on Antarctica’s northern tip recorded a temperature of 18.4C (65.1F) – roughly the same as Los Angeles that day, Nasa noted. The freak temperatures were attributed to the confluence of warmer than average sea surfaces, a high pressure system over South America and a warming phenomenon known as the foehn effect.They come against a backdrop of another looming crisis: an almost 3C temperature increase on the Antarctic peninsula over the past 50 years, part of a pattern of unusual weather events associated with global heating, including Australia’s catastrophic bushfire season.Campaigners in April hailed the passage of a new law that makes the practice punishable by up to three years in prison, but were sober about its impact. The practice is entrenched in Sudanese culture and will take time to be eradicated entirely. “There is so much work to be done. This is a start, a good start,” Fatma Naib, a Unicef communication officer in Sudan, told the .A dawn raid in a Paris suburb in May snared one of the world’s most wanted men. Félicien Kabuga, a wealthy Rwandan businessman, is accused of creating and funding the notorious Interahamwe militia that carried out the 1994 killings of about 800,000 people in less than three months.His radio station, the Radio-Télévision Libre des Mille Collines, allegedly helped lay the groundwork for the genocide with its relentless dehumanisation of the Tutsi population. “You have missed some of the enemies,” it said in one notorious broadcast during the killings. “You must go back there and finish them off. The graves are not yet full.”A 2003 attempt to capture Kabuga in Nairobi ended with the mysterious death of the man who was supposed to give up his location. French police said the 84-year-old had also spent time in Germany, Belgium and Switzerland.He is yet to enter a plea in a French or international court, but his lawyers said last week that he had the right to be presumed innocent.The fatal shooting of Ahmaud Arbery, a 26-year-old African American, as he jogged in a coastal city in the US state of Georgia in February, initially received little national attention. The two men accused of killing him claimed they did so in self-defence. Police and prosecutors showed little enthusiasm for pursuing the case.That changed with the 5 May release of a video depicting Arbery’s last moments. The man is trailed slowly by a car as he jogs on quiet street. He reaches another vehicle and two armed men appear. A struggle ensues with one and several gunshots go off. The last scene shows Arbery dying in the street.The shocking footage led to the arrest of the three men present at the shooting, and has rekindled popular rage at the dangers black men can face in predominantly white communities, and the impunity and inaction that regularly follows their deaths.Once a fringe notion espoused by Israel’s far right, the idea the Jewish state would simply declare swaths of the Palestinian territories – where its settlements have been proliferating for decades – its own territory has over the past year marched into the mainstream.The Trump plan calls for the annexation to take place in consultation with Palestinian leaders, but it is unclear what conditions – if any – the White House would impose on the Netanyahu-Gantz government. The annexation was “an Israeli decision”, Mike Pompeo said recently.European leaders, the UN and scores of retired Israeli generals and security officials have voiced their objection to the plan, arguing that it would isolate Israel and pour petrol on the volatile region. It would also signal the death of the two-state solution, the 1994 outline for peace between the Israelis and Palestinians that has been the framework for all subsequent negotiations, but which many analysts argue has been on its deathbed for years."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36502f53858cecb390134ca89dad648f0cdd8a85/0_367_885_531/master/885.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=7e1cb132d7b2ba195c3243e8784a1767","title":"coronavirus latest at a glance 26 may","story":"A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreakKey developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:According to the Johns Hopkins university coronavirus tracker, infections worldwide number at least 5,495,061. The death toll stands at 346,232. True death tolls and cases are likely to be significantly higher due to differing definitions and testing rates, delays and suspected underreporting.Countries where coronavirus infections are declining could still face an “immediate second peak” if they let up too soon on measures to contain the outbreak, the World Health Organization said on Monday. WHO emergencies chief, Dr Mike Ryan, told an online briefing: “We cannot make assumptions that just because the disease is on the way down now it is going to keep going down and we are get a number of months to get ready for a second wave. We may get a second peak in this wave.”The US has amended the timing of its Brazil travel ban to come into force at 11.59pm Washington time on Tuesday. It came as Brazil recorded a daily death toll higher than the US for the first time (807 versus 620). Brazil has the world’s second highest number of infections. In its original announcement, the White House said the travel restrictions would come into force on 28 May.The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, was unable to visit his dying mother in her final weeks because he obeyed coronavirus restrictions against visiting care homes, his office has said. His mother did not die of Covid-19, although there had earlier been an outbreak of the disease in the home where she was living, Dutch media reported.The British prime minister Boris Johnson’s senior adviser, Dominic Cummings, has refused to apologise or resign for breaching lockdown rules. Cummings drove 264 miles from London to his parents’ estate in Durham, despite suspecting that both he and his wife had coronavirus. Cummings also admitted to having taken a second trip, to a beauty spot 30 miles from Durham, which he claimed was necessary to check his eyesight was good enough for the longer drive back to London.The World Health Organization has suspended testing the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine in Covid-19 patients due to safety concerns. The WHO’s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, cited a paper published last week in the Lancet that showed people taking hydroxychloroquine were at higher risk of death and heart problems than those who were not taking it. In light of the study, he said, the organisation would pause the hydroxychloroquine arm of its solidarity global clinical trial.The coronavirus pandemic will have a “disastrous” impact on children’s rights worldwide, making them more vulnerable to forced labour and underage marriage, a rights group said on Tuesday. School closures left boys and girls more vulnerable to child labour, early marriage and teenage pregnancy, while millions would fall into extreme poverty because of the coronavirus outbreak, the NGO KidsRights said.Australia will not open the country’s borders “anytime soon”, the PM, Scott Morrison, said on Tuesday, but added the country would continue its discussions with neighbouring New Zealand about a trans-Tasman safe travel zone. “I was speaking with Prime Minister Ardern this morning, and we’ll continue to have our discussions about the trans-Tasman safe travel zone,” Morrison told the National Press Club in Canberra.Children under the age of two shouldn’t wear masks because they can make breathing difficult and increase the risk of choking, a Japan medical group has said, launching an urgent appeal to parents as the country reopens from the coronavirus crisis.Saudi Arabia will revise curfew times this week, and lift them entirely across the Kingdom with the exception of the holy city of Mecca, starting on 21 June, state news agency reported in a statement early on Tuesday. Bans on domestic travel, holding prayers in mosques, and workplace attendance in both the government and private sector will be lifted, starting 31 May, the statement added. For Mecca, the curfew time will be adjusted to 3pm-6pm and prayers will be allowed to be held in mosques from 21 June."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55e474b26de4b17638c9798d90fdd7612d41881b/0_0_5000_2999/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73cf0fb373639cd80b041beb1597c85d","title":"dutch pm mark rutte did not visit dying mother due to covid 19 restrictions","story":"Office of the PM says Rutte ‘complied with all directives’ and did not see his mother in the weeks before her deathDutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte was unable to visit his dying mother in her final weeks because he obeyed coronavirus restrictions against visiting care homes, his office has said.The news about Rutte emerged as Britain was gripped by a political row over allegations that the top aide to prime minister Boris Johnson broke Covid-19 rules to travel cross-country to stay on his parents’ estate.Rutte on Monday announced the death of 96-year-old Mieke Rutte-Dilling in a home in The Hague on 13 May, nearly two months after the government shut all such institutions to the public on 20 March.“The prime minister has complied with all directives”, Rutte’s spokesman told AFP when asked about reports that the premier had stuck to the rules and so not seen his mother before she died.His mother did not die of Covid-19 although there had earlier been an outbreak of the disease in the home where she was living, Dutch media reported.Rutte earlier announced his mother’s death, saying that “in addition to the great sadness and all fond memories, my family and I also have a feeling of gratitude that we were allowed to have her with us for so long.”“We have now said goodbye to her in a family circle and hope to be able to deal with this great loss in peace in the near future,” he added.Dutch authorities allowed inidual visits to some care homes from Monday, a measure that will be extended to all of them on 15 June.The Netherlands – which has imposed an “intelligent lockdown” with less strict conditions than many other European countries, though there have been concerns over a return to tourism in cities like Amsterdam.

He was rushed there by the Jewish volunteer ambulance service, Hatzola, after they had called at his house to check up on him. While he was in hospital, another volunteer organisation took care of Eli’s family’s shopping for Passover as they were self-isolating. Twice, a local restaurant cooked and delivered supper for the family, and when Eli’s wife wanted to send him kosher food to eat and books to read, Lecheiris, a local volunteer group, took the package to the hospital for her.Across the UK, communities have hastily pulled together in the pandemic, with leaflets posted through doors, WhatsApp groups set up and crowdfunders launched. Many people are meeting neighbours for the first time. In Stamford Hill, north London, the networks of support are well established. “Not on my fingers and toes could I count the times I’ve been helped by community organisations recently,” Sufrin said as we chatted on the street during the Jewish holiday of Lag B’Omer.Many strictly Orthodox Jewish families in the Stamford Hill community do not have access to social media and mainstream news outlets, so some were slow to grasp the severity of the situation. “Close-knit means we’re all there for each other and we keep in daily contact. But it also means we tend to congregate more, and the virus has spread much quicker,” said Mrs Davidovits, a part-time teacher and volunteer at the Interlink Foundation.Haredi men pray at least three times daily in the synagogue, and some spend six or seven hours there. So when Britain’s chief rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, ordered the closure of all United Synagogues, the largest network of Orthodox synagogues in the country, in the same week that schools across the UK were told to close indefinitely, the community was shaken.Sam Friedman, a local graphic designer saw what was going on and started a physical distancing awareness campaign putting notices in local magazines and on social media. He said: “For some people essential things means going to the supermarket, but for some essential means what’s ideally required by the Jewish law, and that is prayer in groups. Many people have never prayed by themselves in the house setting, with kids around. It’s very tough. These people needed an extra dose of awareness to adhere to the law.”Yoni Koppel works in property maintenance, and for the last three years he has volunteered with Chaveirim in his spare time. Chaveirim offers a free 247 service to help with breakdowns, gas leaks and other odd jobs around the area, but when I met him in April we drove to Homerton and Royal London hospital to drop off food and drink packages to the NHS staff there. Covid-19 has forced many organisations in Stamford Hill to adapt to the needs of the community. “At first my wife was worried,” Yoni said. “But we have been brought up in the same area, and here if people need help you have to put yourself in the frontline. So she does understand.”It’s not only men volunteering to criss-cross town dropping off packages and offering support. But when I reached out to some of the women, they politely declined to talk about it. Mrs Davidovits told me some Haredi women were leading organisations in Stamford Hill, but they did not want to attract attention due to tzniyut, a Hebrew word that best translates as modesty. “It’s not only about the way we dress, but it’s behaviour as well and about putting ourselves out there. It’s very central to our way of life, for men and women.”The virus has shone a light on cracks in every community, but it has also unearthed resilience. The close-knit way of life in Stamford Hill meant lockdown presented previously unimaginable challenges and many were at risk. Everybody knows people who have died. Equally, those like Eli who needed support in a moment of need have undoubtedly received it. Moses Gluck, the undertaker, echoed so many I spoke to when he told me his work was not just business “there has to be heart to it”. Hatzola hasn’t been called to a patient showing Covid-19 symptoms in two weeks."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b76af0224249c790c43a1aeabf6d293eaeca542/651_648_4239_2545/master/4239.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=43019276ad5c359e2343105565843f44","title":"irish taoiseach leo varadkar denies picnic with friends was covid 19 rule breach","story":"Spokesperson says PM broke no laws or regulations during meeting with friends in a Dublin park, despite guidance against picnicsLeo Varadkar, Ireland’s taoiseach, has defended having a picnic with friends in a Dublin park in defiance of a recommendation from a senior government official.A spokesperson for Varadkar issued a statement on Monday night saying he “broke no laws, breached no regulations and observed public health guidance” while picnicking in the Phoenix Park on Sunday.The comment came after images appeared on social media showing the taoiseach with his partner, Matthew Barrett, and two friends near the park’s Wellington monument. Varadkar was in shorts and shirtless.The outing appeared to contradict advice given in a media briefing last week by Liz Canavan, assistant secretary of the Department of the Taoiseach. She said: “If you’re visiting a public amenity try not to stay too long at the site or have picnics. Please do your exercise and then go home.”Some commentators accused the taoiseach of being cavalier with lockdown rules and setting a bad example similar to Dominic Cummings.The statement from Varadkar’s office on Monday night said phase one of Ireland’s lifting of lockdown restrictions allowed a group of four people to meet outdoors as long as they were within five kilometres (three miles) of home and maintaining physical distance.“Government guidelines allow people to spend time in the outdoors within 5km of their home while continuing to observe social distancing and good hygiene. There are no specific government guidelines on eating outdoors or picnics.”During the coronavirus pandemic Varadkar has lived at the state-owned Farmleigh Estate which is on the other side of the Phoenix park and within five kilometres of the Wellington monument.The chief medical officer, Tony Holohan, said the images of the picnic appeared to show respect for the rules. “I didn’t see any pictures that are in violation of that involving the Taoiseach.”Holohan was speaking at a media briefing on Monday that showed no reported deaths from Covid-19 for the first time since 21 March. The total reported death toll is 1,606. There were 59 new cases, bringing the total of confirmed cases to 24,698.“The number of new cases and reported deaths over the past week indicates that we have suppressed Covid-19 as a country,” said Holohan.Varadkar called it a day of hope."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/058145688edbbd7e78804378f5cd0638eb4f4fde/0_1_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7437a08799e5c7f1add50e18114ca554","title":"lockdown in a remote five star castle resort for two hotel workers","story":"Couple have been sole occupants of Ashford Castle, which has a 350-acre estate and its own cinemaTo hunker in a medieval castle while a pandemic rages outside sounds like a Black Death chronicle but Laura Jamieson and Michael Smith have rather enjoyed their coronavirus lockdown in Ireland.The young couple have been the sole occupants of Ashford Castle, a five-star hotel on the shores of Lough Corrib in county Mayo that boasts a cinema, spa, tea boutique, wine tasting tunnels and 83 guest rooms.Jamieson, 23, from Surrey in England, and Smith, 28, from Perthshire in Scotland, usually live in the nearby village of Cross and commute to the castle for work but have spent the past nine weeks living there while maintaining the buildings and 350-acre estate until tourists return.“It’s been surreal,” Jamieson said in a phone interview. “We’ve been incredibly fortunate that we were able to have this experience. It’s the most amazing place.”Quarantine in an 800-year-old castle – where the pair first met three years ago – has been a steep learning curve, said Smith, who manages the estate. “We’re finding out stuff not only about work but about each other. It’s something we’ll look back on with fond memories.”It may sound like a reality show or a Disney movie, with a couple playing prince and princess, but daily reality was often humdrum, he said. “I don’t know if they’d be rushing to make this movie. When we’re doing our jobs it’s quite boring.”Duties include vacuuming, flushing 160 toilets, dusting chandeliers and fielding emails and phone calls.“It’s very strange – we’re used to welcoming guests and look forward to having them back,” said Jamieson, a duty manager. “Initially we were a little bit wary of the place. You hear different floorboards creaking, and the wind and the doors. But as time has gone on it’s started to feel like home.”The air conditioning turning off took getting used to, said Smith. “It was terrifying at first, as if someone was inside it.” The isolated custodians of a big hotel in Stephen King’s horror novel The Shining did not end well, said Smith, but Ashford Castle was proving benign. “So far so good – may that continue.”The working day often ends with a visit to the School of Falconry to check on the owls and hawks. For date night they choose a bottle from the wine cellar and head to the 32-seat private cinema. The couple watched all eight seasons of Game of Thrones.The Anglo-Norman de Burgo family built Ashford Castle in 1228. A French-style chateau was added in the 18th century, after which it passed into the hands of the Guinness family which added trees and Victorian extensions. Since becoming a hotel it has hosted US presidents and Hollywood royalty including John Ford, Barbra Streisand and Brad Pitt.Jamieson and Smith said friends and relatives have been proud and a bit jealous of their experience. They are due to move back to their more modest digs before the castle reopens on 20 July. “It’s going to be back to reality,” said Jamieson. Smith is bracing for the day. “It’ll be sad when we have to hand over the keys.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32117b5f04af7421f87fb39615468bd8e5fe3eaa/0_41_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=41587953f62df663f14fb94b02bc3a5d","title":"research reveals gene role in both dementia and severe covid 19","story":"Having two copies of e4 variant of ApoE gene linked to double risk of severe Covid-19, study suggestsPeople with a genetic mutation that increases the risk of dementia also have a greater chance of having severe Covid-19, researchers have revealed.The study is the latest to suggest genetics may play a role in why some people are more vulnerable to the coronavirus than others, and could help explain why people with dementia have been hard hit: dementia is one of the most common underlying health conditions among those who have died from Covid-19 in England and Wales.“It is not just age: this is an example of a specific gene variant causing vulnerability in some people,” said David Melzer, a professor of epidemiology and public health at Exeter University and a co-author of the study.Writing in the Journal of Gerontology: Medical Sciences, Melzer and colleagues report how they analysed data from the UK Biobank, a research endeavour that has collected genetic and health data on 500,000 volunteers aged between 48 and 86.The team focused on a gene called ApoE – this gives rise to proteins involved in carrying fats around the body, and can exist in several forms. One such variant, called “e4”, is known to affect cholesterol levels and processes involved in inflammation, as well as increasing the risk of heart disease and dementia.The researchers found 9,022 of almost 383,000 Biobank participants of European ancestry studied had two copies of the e4 variant, while more than 223,000 had two copies of a variant called “e3”. The former, the team add, have a risk of dementia up to 14-fold higher than the latter.The team then looked at positive tests for Covid-19 between 16 March and 26 April when testing for the coronavirus was largely carried out in hospitals, suggesting the cases were severe. The results reveal 37 people who tested positive for Covid-19 had two copies of the e4 variant of ApoE, while 401 had two copies of the e3 variant. After taking into account various factors, including age and sex, the team say people with two e4 variants had more than double the risk of severe Covid-19 than those with two e3 variants.Melzer said the findings were not down to people with two e4 variants being more likely to be living in a care home – settings that have been hard hit by Covid-19 – since the association remained even when the team excluded participants with a diagnosis of dementia. None of the Covid-19 positive participants with two e4 variants of the ApoE gene had a dementia diagnosis.“It is pretty bulletproof – whatever associated disease we remove, the association is still there. So it looks as if it is the gene variant that is doing it … This association is not driven by people who actually have dementia,” said Melzer.The team say further work is needed to unpick the link.Prof Tara Spires-Jones, an expert in neurodegeneration at the University of Edinburgh who was not involved in the study, said the large number of Biobank participants meant the association between the ApoE genetic variants and Covid-19 risk was robust, but stressed the study did not prove the former caused the latter. Nevertheless, she said, the study was important.“It is possible that the role of ApoE in the immune system is important in the disease and future research may be able to harness this to develop effective treatments,” she said.Fiona Carragher, a director of research and influencing at Alzheimer’s Society, said people with dementia and their families were desperately worried, adding the government must take urgent action to protect people with dementia. But, she said, more research was needed to delve into the possible link between the e4 variant of ApoE and severe Covid-19.“Other factors may contribute, so it is difficult to draw firm conclusions at this stage. But clearly much more in-depth research is urgently needed to fully understand why people with dementia seem to be at a higher risk and to what extent factors like ethnicity and genetics might play a role,” she said.But Prof David Curtis, honorary professor at the UCL Genetics Institute, urged caution. He noted that among the study’s limitations, diagnoses of dementia in recent years are unlikely to be captured, meaning that the link between the e4 variant and severe Covid-19 may still be driven by more people with two e4 variants having dementia than those with two e3 variants."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/847c410afa220d9b0fb771195a761e4240ccc1ff/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6436ff68dd5b0eb5c8c1c1235b56f475","title":"tuesday briefing i dont regret what i did","story":"Cummings digs in at extraordinary press conference … dementia gene linked to Covid-19 risk … and living through pandemic in an iron lungHello, Warren Murray here and you are not breaching any guidelines by reading this – but make sure it’s on your own device, or one recently sanitised.At an unprecedented press conference Dominic Cummings, the prime minister’s chief aide, has repeatedly refused to resign or apologise for breaking the rules by relocating his family from London to Durham during lockdown. His appearance in the Rose Garden of No 10 raised yet more questions after the admission he suspected both he and his wife had coronavirus when they travelled across the country. “I don’t regret what I did … reasonable people might disagree,” Cummings said.Questions remain unanswered including why the family did not explore feasible options that might have avoided travelling much of the length of England. By way of contrast, the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, has revealed that his mother has died and due to Covid-19 restrictions he did not visit her in her last days. Following the press conference, Johnson once again gave his full backing to his senior adviser, who was a key architect of Brexit and of Johnson’s election victory last year.People with a genetic mutation that increases the risk of dementia are more susceptible to severe Covid-19, researchers think. The vulnerability does not depend on a person’s age, or whether they have already developed dementia. “This is an example of a specific gene variant causing vulnerability in some people,” said David Melzer, a professor at Exeter University and a co-author of the study, which drew on gene profiles of half a million people.

A teenage girl was pronounced dead in hospital after a rigid inflatable boat overturned in the water in Wadebridge. Three other people were taken to the Royal Cornwall hospital. A man was pronounced dead at Treyarnon Bay in Padstow after being pulled from the water by a member of the public. In a third incident, surfers pulled an unconscious man from the water in Porthtowan, Truro, at about 2.30pm. The man was taken to the Royal Cornwall hospital by air ambulance in a serious condition and was receiving treatment.Poverty and self-harm – Young women are being driven to self-harm as a result of poverty, debt and their struggles to pay household bills, research shows. Women aged 16-34 from the poorest backgrounds are five times more vulnerable, according to findings from NatCen Social Research and the charity Agenda. Sally McManus, who led the research for NatCen, said: “This report indicates that self-harm often occurs in the context of poverty and debt, especially for young women.”‘Climate velocity’ threat to sea life – Different rates of ocean water heating are threatening to force deep-dwelling species away from areas where they feed, researchers have warned. Under a phenomenon known as “climate velocity” – the rate at which species migrate to follow survivable temperatures – deepwater species are projected to move from their native waters much faster because they are more sensitive to temperature. Researchers say that even if emissions fell sharply from now, climate velocity in the depths would rocket from about 6km per decade to 50km by the 2050s. But over the same period the rate of migration would halve at the surface. Tuna, for example, could become separated from their surface-dwelling plankton food source. “This means that marine life in the deep ocean will face escalating threats from ocean warming until the end of the century, no matter what we do now,” said Prof Anthony Richardson of the University of Queensland and the CSIRO, one of the study’s 10 authors.The World Health Organization, citing safety fears, says it will temporarily drop hydroxychloroquine from its global anti-Covid drug trials. Concerns were raised in the Lancet. Other treatments in the WHO’s “solidarity trial”, including the experimental drug remdesivir and an HIV combination therapy, are still being pursued.“People were like animals!” From shoppers stockpiling toilet roll to spending £3,000 on wine, supermarket workers have had to cope with a panicking public – while finding themselves unexpectedly on the frontline.More than 200 organisations representing at least 40 million health workers – making up about half of the global medical workforce – have signed an open letter to the G20 leaders saying governments’ chief medical officers and scientific advisers must be directly involved in designing stimulus packages now under way to ensure they include considerations of public health and environmental concerns.The prime minister’s senior adviser has provoked national outrage by admitting travelling hundreds of miles to stay with family at the height of coronavirus lockdown. ’s Matthew Weaver reveals how he helped break the story.

But over time he learned to force air into his own lungs so he could spend time outside the machine.Extraordinarily, Alexander graduated from high school, then university, and became a practising lawyer. Today, at 74, he needs an iron lung again, and is one of the last people in the world to be using one. After barely surviving one deadly outbreak, he did not expect to find himself threatened by another.Players and managers will at last be able to examine the Premier League’s rules for a return to contact training on Tuesday, just 24 hours before they are put to a crucial vote. The pile-up of championships in 2022 could rob the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham of some of its biggest stars and will make it impossible for Dina Asher-Smith to attempt a unique treble, Kelly Sotherton has warned.Fifa has provisionally suspended Yves Jean-Bart pending an investigation into claims the president of the Haiti Football Federation sexually abused young female footballers at the country’s national training centre. Barnsley have sent a stinging letter to the English Football League expressing their concern over the “inability of governance to hold its members accountable” and warning they “will not accept” relegation from the Championship. And doing away with reset scrums and eliminating “upright face-to-face” tackles would significantly reduce the risk of coronavirus transmission, according to a new study by World Rugby.“No regrets” features prominently on several front pages – you can see them here – with the Daily Mail and the Daily Mirror using the same phrase but in alternative order: “No apology, no regrets” and you can work out the other. The Mail refers to Cummings’ “rose garden roasting” on TV appearance. “Boris’s defiant svengali refuses to quit” the Mail says over his trip to Durham, and asks: “So how CAN he survive?”  considers the inequity of it all and riffs off Boris Johnson’s “stay alert” messaging with the headline: “Stay elite”.“‘I don’t regret what I did’: Cummings refuses to quit” is the ’s headline, describing his TV appearance as “extraordinary”. As for his excuses, “it might have helped if he had had a whiteboard to sketch it out on”, writes political editor Heather Stewart. The Mirror indicts Cummings as “shameless”. The Times splashes with “Cummings: I did not break lockdown rules”, adding he believed he behaved “reasonably and legally”. It says Downing Street has tried to “orchestrate a show of support” but some senior ministers are angry: “My jaw continues to drop. He’s saying he’s so much more important than us plebs,” one is quoted as saying.The  runs a large picture of Cummings but a very small headline: “I don’t regret what I did”. It saves its splash for “High street to reopen as UK edges back to normality”. The Sun also grabs the “Open for business” angle and allots Cummings the top right hand corner with the headline: “Cummings out fighting: I did what was right for my family and my country”. The Express is also glad to lead on the hope of businesses reopening (“Hurrah! Shops to open doors soon”) with a side serving of “I’ve no regrets: Cummings faces down his critics”. The FT carries a picture of Cummings, but its headline is about the PM: “In the open: Johnson sorry for public’s anger after Cummings defends trips”.

Too many students end up dropping out of courses for which they are unsuitable.With all the uncertainty that Leaving Cert students have been living with over the past three months it is only now that they can turn their minds to the final list of CAO course choices, which they will have to submit to the CAO by 5.15 pm on 1st July next. Securing a degree at the end of three or four years of study will be a major achievement, but you’ll only manage it if you’re determined and focused on its course content from day one.Unfortunately, thousands of current Leaving Cert students have applied to the CAO to go to a college purely because their friends plan to attend, while others will have applied for courses without conducting any detailed research.Many of these students will drop out of their courses before Christmas 2020, once the reality of what’s involved in completing the programme dawns on them.Would you start a marathon on a whim? Absolutely not: such a task requires months of training and planning. Selecting a college course requires the same level of planning and commitment.If you think you might be one of these people, you have just over a month to rectify the situation. By now you are no doubt aware of the course options available to you depending on how you perform in the forthcoming grade assessments, undertaken by your teachers. If not, Qualifax has details of every course on offer, and its advanced search facility will enable you to refine your search to those subjects that genuinely interest you.The litmus test is what will motivate you to get out of bed on a cold morning next winter, when nobody will be checking whether you do so or not, to attend lectures, study the topics in the library, write the assignments that such research will generate, and then pass your first-year exams next May. All of the above is of course contingent on how colleges organise the delivery of their programmes in a post covid19 world. At this stage choosing a course should have very little to do with what job you will get when you leave college in three to four years’ time.Ensure you select a suitable courseIf you think you will not have enough CAO points, following your teachers assessment of your performance over the past two years, to get on to your preferred course at your preferred college, look at other options farther afield, where smaller college-age populations result in lower point requirements.You should also research local further education (FE) Post Leaving Certificate options, which may have reserved places on your preferred course, meaning you could secure a place on the programme in September 2021.Even if you are perfectly happy with your original course choices, it is wise to review them. Courses are discontinued all the time, and colleges often add new courses to the CAO system. Dozens of courses on offer in May 2020 did not exist when the CAO printed its handbook last summer. Explore them now.Between now and July 1st, log on to your account on cao.ie and see what courses you have listed, and in what order. For the courses you have listed, study the full content of each year’s lectures and how they might allow you to progress to employment or postgraduate opportunities, on qualifax.ie. Where will a degree in the subject you select now lead to? Technological change is rapidly reshaping the nature of work, and a degree completed in 2025 or 2026 could well open opportunities in the labour market that have not yet been envisaged. So, don’t worry about it now just get your course choices right over the next few weeks. What happens if I make that mistake?If you end up in August when the colleges offer their places, accepting a course that is not right for you, be it because you do not like the curriculum, you did not research the content thoroughly or you realise that you have selected a course you have no interest in, you may end up dropping out during the academic year or failing the exams.If either of these happens and you decide to return to college the following year to study another course, you will have to pay another registration fee of €3,000 in 2021. You will also have to fork out the course fee of at least €5,000 that the Department of Education will pay the college on your behalf this year.The Higher Education Authority, on behalf of the State, will pay course fees only once for each year of an approved course. If you end up repeating a year, you (or more likely your parents) will be the one paying. This extra €5,000 would bring your total fee for your first year to at least €8,000. This is far beyond the means of many families, especially when you factor in the living costs of attending college.Even if you choose a course at a private college this year, then leave it to follow one in a State-funded college next year, you still must pay the full fees. Fees paid to private colleges are tax deductible at 20 per cent on any charges over €3,000, and so are treated in the same way as State-funded places, even if you do not claim the tax relief.Things to checkMake sure you meet all the entry requirements and have taken the required subjects at the appropriate level. (An example of this is the higher-level maths requirement for level 8 engineering degrees.) With this list in hand, put them in an order of preference or priority.The coming month will be one of the most intensive periods of engagement between colleges and prospective students. Colleges will facilitate inidual interactions with staff, via online communications or virtual open days. You can use these forums to discuss any programme you are seriously considering. Contact the course director or programme office. You will find phone numbers and email addresses in the college prospectus or on the college website. When you have completed this process list your final course choices on your CAO record in the order you want them, allowing for all possible outcomes from your assessed grades.You have up to 10 choices at both level 8 higher degrees and level 7 and 6 ordinary degrees and higher-certificate programmes. Never disregard the level 7 and 6 courses out of academic snobbery: almost all these programmes allow you to progress to the level 8 higher degree with an additional year of study.Do not finalise your choices without consulting the key adults in your life, such as your parents and guidance counsellor. Although you can no longer communicate with your teachers, your Guidance Counsellor will continue to communicate with you online to help you finalise your course choices. Make sure to use their expertise before you finally submit your course lists.

File photograph: Dara Mac DónaillThe Department of Education has urged some 60,000 Leaving Certificate students to register online for predicted grades by Thursday night.Students have been instructed they must complete the registration process on the Calculated Grades Student Portal between 10am on Tuesday and 10pm on Thursday.Calculated grades have been designed as a solution to problems with sitting the exams while adhering to safety guidelines related to Covid-19. Students will have the option of confirming the level at which they wish to be assessed or changing to a lower level.Once the Department of Education has received all the necessary data, students will then be asked to opt-in through the portal to indicate if they wish to receive calculated grades.Those registering must have their examination number, Personal Public Service (PPS) number (which they will use to create a four-digit Personal Identification Number), an email address and a mobile phone number.Students will also be required to confirm the level at which they intended to sit each of their subjects.“This is a brand-new system that it has been necessary to introduce because of the decisions we have had to take as we respond to Covid-19 situation,” Minister for Education Joe McHugh said in a statement on Monday.“The important message for Leaving Certificate students is that they must now register by Thursday at 10pm to ensure that they can receive their Leaving Certificate calculated grades.“It is also essential that students confirm their levels at this time so that schools can complete the task of providing information for each student about their expected level of performance in each subject.”The Minister appealed to students not to leave the registration process on the gov.ieleavingcertificate portal to the last minute. Schools have been asked to assist their students and a helpline support system will be available from midday on Tuesday for anyone experiencing trouble getting access online.Those who are unhappy with their calculated grades will have the option to sit the deferred Leaving Cert written exams, whenever they are held in line with public health advice. However, it will be too late to start college in the coming academic year based on the results of those exams.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4258268.1589994578!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"third level gears up for blended learning","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tStudents will have to familiarise themselves with using the virtual learning environment  this year  due to  the increasing emphasis on  social distancing caused by the Covid-19 virus.As prospective students finalise their CAO choices and social restrictions introduced to disrupt the coronavirus pandemic are eased, what should this year’s crop of first year undergraduates expect when they start college in September?The first thing worth noting is that the third-level landscape is going to look very different when compared to previous years as the sector has undergone profound change in the space of just a few months.The arrival of the coronavirus on Irish shores triggered an abrupt move away from the traditional face-to-face style of teaching that most Irish students were familiar with.Almost all teaching activity had to be rapidly migrated to online teaching platforms as lectures were cancelled, campuses were evacuated, and many examinations were called-off or postponed.While some restrictions have eased in recent weeks, the expectation is that we are facing into a period of prolonged social distancing and by implication, continued disruption to the traditional university model.In a sector where you could have up to 500 students attending a single lecture, social distancing restrictions will directly impact how these courses are delivered at our third level institutions.In many colleges, lectures will be delivered online and students will attend campus in smaller groups for face-to-face sessions, tutorials and lab work. This combination of online learning and traditional classroom-based elements is referred to as blended learning.Students should check course specifications with the institution in question to see how their preferred course may be affected.The majority of third level institutions already had systems in place to facilitate remote working and distance learning before the arrival of Covid-19. These systems, sometimes referred to as virtual learning environments, are now expected to feature more prominently in the coming years as critical tools for the delivery of tertiary education.Video conferencing tools, online quizzes and specialised simulations might be more reflective of the global digital age than of traditional teaching methods but when used properly they can be effective tools for teaching and learning.Systems such as Brightspace, Canvas, Moodle and Blackboard have built-in tools that allow instructors to deliver lectures by video or audio, facilitate discussions and even track student performance.Dr Alison Hood, Dean of Teaching and Learning at Maynooth University says online course delivery gives students the flexibility to work at their own pace.Learning through technology can also help students “develop the digital literacies necessary for their future careers.”The use of technology can enable new opportunities for groupwork and collaborative learning and according to Dr Hood, can generate new opportunities for conducting assessment and providing feedback.“If utilised well, technology can improve access and support more inclusive participation for students with disabilities,” she says.One strategy that has emerged as a feature of distance learning is ’classroom flipping’. This is an approach to blended learning that is focused on enhancing engagement within the classroom setting. Whereas in the past students would attend lectures, take notes and then perhaps then prepare homework or assignments, flipping means the lectures are watched remotely and the work is prepared in advance while the ’live’ session is spent analysing the work in the presence of the instructor.To facilitate the new dispensation, students in many cases can expect college to start earlier than usual this year in order to facilitate special orientation sessions designed to help them adapt to the new learning environment.At DCU for example it is expected that first-year students will begin two weeks earlier than usual. However, as elsewhere, the health of students and staff will be prioritised as the virus is likely to impact how courses are delivered on an ongoing basis.Protecting the health and wellbeing of students and staff “is paramount and overrides everything else,” says DCU President, Professor Brian MacCraith.He says the approach taken at the university enables flexibility and the ability to “adapt to any change in circumstances.”“We will leverage DCU’s experience and capabilities in online and blended learning to offer every student a safe and high quality learning experience. If any student cannot access campus because of their specific healthcare situation, we will provide the highest standard of remote delivery to overcome these issues.”Most colleges will have additional supports in place to help guide students . As the focus continues to shift to blended and online learning, more resources are likely to be allocated to help improve outcomes.The National Institute for Digital Learning at DCU is developing a free ‘Learning how to learn online’ course for students at the start of the next academic year.The course will support students as they adapt a greater focus on learning online in higher education settings. Insights gained from the course will help harness the potential of online education and provide improved online learning experiences for students.The increased use of blended education is likely to have some unforeseen consequences for the education sector and those within it.There is a danger that the digital ide could increasingly prove to be a barrier to access as technology is increasingly integrated into the learning experience.To overcome this barrier to learning students will not only need high quality internet access and the technical tools required to do so but colleges and universities will need to ensure the requisite supports are in place to address the social equity imbalance.Nuala McGuinn, who is Director at the Centre for Adult Learning \u0026amp Professional Development at NUI Galway says when it comes to the development of online content best practice should include an “awareness that there will be differences in terms of access to the internet and digital resources so flexibility in learning will have to be featured into course design.”It is also important to build in support for remote learners. “Make sure to build in opportunities for pastoral support of students or some “online coffee-like threads” to check in and see how students are coping with the online environment”, she says.Another unforeseen consequence of the pivot to blended learning is the impact it could have on the student rental market.The wider rental sector was one of the first to be impacted by the pandemic. Within days of the shutdown, property websites recorded a surge in rental properties coming onto the market as demand for short-term lettings collapsed.It was reported earlier this month that the number of homes available to rent across the State has jumped by nearly 40 per cent as a result of the crisis.From a practical point of view students whose presence is no longer required on a full-time basis in college should justifiably ask whether it is worth their while renting accommodation for the year or if other arrangements such as commuting to college on the days they have to be present might be a better option.Social distancing rules will invariably limit the degree to which colleges can ask students to be present on campus. However, blended learning could offer greater access to third level education and as colleges work out how they can rotate students in and out of campus there could be an opportunity to open programmes up to more people than would typically register for a traditional course.There is no doubt but students and colleges are facing into an uncertain year. No-one knows how long the restrictions will last.Some colleges are already making preparations to rebalance back towards face-to-face learning in the event of the virus being fully eradicated.But, so as not to be caught off-guard, they are also preparing to react swiftly to any reintroduction of government restrictions.Students will have to familiarise themselves with using the virtual learning environment to a greater degree this year than they had to in the past. There will be challenges for some disciplines, as students of fine arts might attest, but there will also be new and innovative ways of tackling problems.Flexibility is therefore likely to be a key feature of college life in 2020.“Now is a period of great uncertainty and our university community will undoubtedly be presented with challenges,” says Professor Ciarán Ó hÓgartaigh President, NUI Galway.“Recommencing teaching in the autumn will require creative thinking and flexibility to adapt to the continuing restrictions and disruptions to normal life.”"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Rite\u0026ampReason: A healthy planet is a prerequisite for a healthy humanityProtecting wildlife: Local says this is the third year in a row hedgerows cut at wrong timeNetwork could advise government on viruses, climate change and water supply issues"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Antipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needsThe list of causes of damage is long, making it hard to know where to startFew, if any, of Ireland\u0026rsquos mammals have evolved the ability to eat venomous creaturesGolden kelp is notably bare of other sea life, so there are concerns over its possible impactLong-term objective is to see how wildflowers are responding to changes in weather patterns and climateTime to restore meadows once full of insects and nectar in summer and spires of seeds in winterA new report shows no let-up in the loss of wildlife in Northern IrelandCorncrakes get major EU funding despite being of \u0026lsquoleast concern\u0026rsquo on Red List criteriaAs top marine predators, dolphins accumulate the most man-made toxic pollutantsGlobal warming presents potentially damaging cascades of impacts, new study finds"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4262265.1590429586!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"swimming ban at dublin s merrion strand due to poor water quality","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMerrion strand: the beach is the first in Ireland to face a permanent bathing ban.Swimming is to be banned at Merrion strand in Dublin Bay because of persistent problems with bathing water quality – it is the first Irish beach to have such a permanent prohibition.The move follows publication of the EPA Bathing Water in Ireland report for 2019, which confirms the beach was classified as “poor” for the fifth year in a row under EU standards.Dublin City Council indicated in January if it failed to meet the minimum standards for a fifth consecutive year, a “permanent prohibition” on bathing will be put in place.Overall, however, bathing water quality improved across the country in 2019.– 95 per cent of bathing waters (140 of 147) met or exceeded the minimum required standard, up from 94 per cent in 2018– 107 (73 per cent) were classified as “excellent”, up from 103– 24 (16 per cent) were classified as “good”, up from 22– Nine (6 per cent) were classified as “sufficient”, down from 12.EPA director Dr Micheál Lehane said: “Declassification of Merrion Strand after five years at poor status is disappointing and action must be taken to ensure no other bathing water is declassified in future.”Portrane (the Brook) beach in Co Dublin Ballyloughane and Clifden beaches in Co Galway and Lilliput at Lough Ennell, Co Westmeath, were also deemed poor. The Brook beach and Ballyloughane risk being declassified next year as they have failed to meet minimum standards for the fourth year in a row.The main difficulty at Merrion strand is the impact from two polluted streams which flow on to the beach the Elm Park and Trimleston streams.They are polluted due to misconnections where domestic plumbing goes into the wrong pipe and goes directly into the stream leaks, spills and overflows from wastewater collection systems and run-off from roads. Other potential pollution sources include urban wastewater discharges, birds and dogs.A new task force set up by Dublin City Council is focusing on improving bathing water quality at Merrion strand and Sandymount strand.Dublin City Council is also working with Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and Irish Water to address pollution sources related to the wastewater network including misconnections, combined sewer overflows and pumping station overflows.Pollution incidentsDublin City Council is investigating the possibility of creating wetlands to improve water quality in the Elm Park stream, while a €9.2 million research project called Acclimatize aims to identify the main sources of pollution in the Dublin Bay area.Ongoing difficulties at the nearby Ringsend wastewater treatment works, which is operating at overcapacity and not in compliance with EU environmental regulations, are dealt with under the EPA urban wastewater treatment report. If problems there are cause for concern at Merrion strand, precautionary advice is issued to the public, confirmed EPA programme manager Mary Gurrie.Pollution incidents reported to the EPA decreased from 55 in 2018 to 50. Fifteen of these were related to problems at wastewater treatment plants but “do not appear to have caused a deterioration in bathing water quality”.“More improvements in operation, management and maintenance of plants and networks are still needed,” the report warns.Three bathing waters, all in Dublin, were classified for the first time: the Forty Foot, Sandycove (classified as “excellent”), White Rock Beach in Killiney (“excellent”) and Sandycove Beach (“good”). Inchydoney East Beach in Co Cork and Cúas Crom, Co Kerry, will be classified later this year.“Ireland has many beautiful beaches. Enjoying these natural amenities can be good for our physical and mental wellbeing, and it is therefore essential that Ireland maintains good bathing water quality,” Ms Gurrie added.Throughout the summer water quality information and details of any incidents affecting bathing waters are displayed at www.beaches.ieThe bathing water report is available on the EPA’s website.Five-day nationwide forecasts, weather warnings and rainfall maps "},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph Nick Bradshaw A debate has been happening in recent days on whether the recommended two metres of physical distancing with others to avoid the spread of the coronavirus can be reduced safely to one metre.So what is the current guidance in Ireland?The public health advice the State’s National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) is that people should maintain a distance of two metres to avoid the spread of Covid-19. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said at the weekend “there is no change” to the two-metre rule.Why is this?HSE chief clinical officer Dr Colm Henry said on Sunday the two-metre distance was based on the projected distance that a droplet containing the virus can spread to another person through cough and sneezing. The decision to maintain a two-metre distance was the reason, he said, why the reproduction rate in the speed of the virus had fallen to the point where it is now suppressed. So who wants it reduced to one metre?Some Government ministers and other politicians. There was a debate at Cabinet last Friday evening about whether the recommended distance should be reduced to one metre as it would make it easier for people in education, healthcare and other areas of work and could help businesses such as restaurants reopen more quickly.Would it help the health service?Yes, HSE chief executive Paul Reid said that it would help the health service treat more patients and create “significantly extra capacity” across the HSE in emergency departments, waiting rooms and other areas if the recommended distance was one metre. What’s the international advice?The World Health Organisation considers a one-metre distance between people to be safe. So what level of protection does this provide?WHO’s special envoy on Covid-19 David Nabarro, a professor of global health at Imperial College London, said that two metres “keeps you safe 99 per cent of the time but you can greatly reduce risk even at one metre because 70 per cent of the droplets will stick within one metre.”What other international advice is there?The European Centre for Disease Control still advises people to maintain a distance of two metres, while in the US, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention advises people to stay “at least six feet” - about two metres - apart.Has there been similar differing views among public health specialists in Ireland?Yes, NPHET’s expert advisory group said in March that there was a “lack of evidence in distinguishing between one and two metres.” Dr Cillian de Gascun, chairman of the group and director of the UCD’s National Virus Reference Laboratory, said that in some circumstances such as in healthcare and domestic settings where it is not possible or practical to maintain two metres distance “the recommendation is that at least one metre but ideally two metres are maintained between people, especially in the context of keeping distance from symptomatic iniduals.”Are there other views out there in Ireland?Yes, the State’s Health Protection Surveillance Centre advised healthcare workers in March to maintain a physical distance of at least one metre but ideally two from iniduals with respiratory symptoms in suspected or confirmed Covid-19 cases. In another guidance note advising how to minimise the risk of transmission in pharmacies on March 16th, the HPSC said that “if a healthcare worker can maintain a distance of one metre from the patient’s mouth and nose, they are not within the likely range of droplet transmission. This helps protect both.”Are there risks by moving back to one metre?Yes. Infectious diseases expert Prof Sam McConkey said that moving closer to one another would “inevitably lead to more transmission of Covid-19” and that a one-metre limit could result in “up to four times more transmission.” He described the decision being a “political choice.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Consider average class size, work experience, project work when choosing your courseArts degrees are as broad as they are mixed with graduates in big demandCovid-19 might persuade more students to opt for healthcare coursesBrian Mooney on how to approach the CAO process and get your course choice rightVictim aged in his twenties was shot on Main Street in Clonee at around 10.25pmApproach set to become the new norm for many courses as social restrictions disrupt traditional teaching modelCity beach is first to face such a prohibition, as EPA rates it as \u0026lsquopoor\u0026rsquo for fifth year in a rowStudents have until July 1st to submit their final third level course options to the CAOHiqa to raise concerns about care oversight shortcomings for some of State\u0026rsquos most vulnerable citizensRotunda Hospital has \u0026lsquodrive-through service\u0026rsquo to test patients for virus prior to admissionGovernment formation talks likely to continue until end of next weekFlexibility will be key as many college programmes shift to \u0026lsquoblended\u0026rsquo delivery modelBiotechnology or \u0026lsquobiotech\u0026rsquo is closely entangled with the pharmaceutical industry.

Photograph: TwitterArchaeologists in Spain have found part of a skull and a femur (thigh bone) in their search for the remains of Red Hugh O’Donnell, one of the great tragic heroes of Irish history. O’Donnell died en-route to Valladolid, a city in northwestern Spain, in July 1602 having failed to persuade the Spanish king Philip III to send another army to Ireland to fight against the English.On day five of the dig in Valladolid’s Constitution Street on Friday, the archaeologists recovered human remains. A tweet from the city’s tourism and culture department read: “A part of the skull, a femur, and some more remains appear in what appears to be the access to the Chapel of the Marvels.”The city’s culture councillor Ana Redondo posted a shamrock emoji and the words “estamos cerca” - “we are close”. The archaeologists involved are also searching for the remains of Christopher Columbus, who in 1492 became the first European to discover the Americas.He was buried in the same place as O’Donnell. However, Columbus’s remains were allegedly removed and reburied in the cathedral of Seville and later in the Dominican Republic. Speaking on Friday, which was the 514th anniversary of the funeral of Columbus in Valladolid, chief archaeologist Óscar Burón said he believed that both O’Donnell and Columbus are “buried right under our feet and now we are concerned with checking whether the research we have undertaken is correct”. He described O’Donnell as an “Irish prince and the hero of the resistance against the English”. O’Donnell and his father-in-law Hugh Mor O’Neill, who between them controlled large parts of the north of Ireland, started the Nine Years War to drive the English out of Ireland.Battle of KinsaleIt began promisingly and the Irish won a number of significant victories, but eventually ended in defeat following the siege and then the Battle of Kinsale in late 1601 and early 1602.A combined force of Spanish and Irish troops was defeated by the English in one of the worst military setbacks in Irish history, after which Red Hugh fled to Spain.Though Philip III never did provide the soldiers requested by Red Hugh, he did give him the equivalent of a royal funeral as described in the Annals of the Four Masters.“His body was conveyed to the king’s palace at Valladolid in a four-wheeled hearse, surrounded by countless numbers of the king’s state officers, council, and guards, with luminous torches and bright flambeaux of beautiful wax-light burning on each side of him.” He was buried within the Chapel of Marvels in the grounds of the Franciscan convent in Valladolid. The convent disappeared in 1836 and with it O’Donnell’s remains.In a statement, Valladolid city council’s cultural department said finding the remains of O’ Donnell would be a “spur to the dissemination of this city abroad and also, of course, within Spain.“The burial in Valladolid of these two characters of such relevance to the world as is the case of Columbus and to relations between Spain and Ireland against their common enemy: England, demonstrate the importance of Spain and specifically of Valladolid for centuries.” On Thursday the team of archaeologists located other human bones, but not those of O’Donnell. They hope that his remains will be easy to identify as he lost the big toes on both of feet from frostbite after he escaped from prison in Dublin in December 1591. He fled into the Wicklow mountains in the depth of winter. His companion Art O’Neill froze to death in the escape.

The sector required a specific plan. We knew that Covid-19 disproportionately impacts on older people. The planning and focus was almost exclusively on our acute hospitals. Multiple clusters initially emerged in our hospitals. But the numbers in nursing homes started to increase.”Mr Daly is expected to tell the committee that in the absence of a national strategy and response for the nursing home sector, a number of challenges emerged. These included insufficient testing of residents and staff, mass shortfall of PPE and aggressive recruitment of nursing home staff initially by the HSE as well as discharges from acute hospitals to nursing homes without testing.According to his opening statement, Mr Daly says the National Treatment Purchase Fund, the authority responsible for the commissioning of nursing home care, “fell silent as homes incurred considerable and responsible costs to manage the pandemic. The Department of Health eventually intervened.”“Key State organisations left the nursing home sector and its residents isolated in those early days. The dismay will live forever with us.”The committee will also hear from representatives of the Sage advocacy group for vulnerable adults and older people.According to an opening statement for the group, the initial warning signs regarding a Covid-19 pandemic were generally recognised by private nursing homes.“However, because of the lack of effective working relationships with the HSE, and the focus at state level on an expected surge and resultant threat to the acute system, the dangers to the most vulnerable who were in nursing homes did not become centre stage until the systemic weaknesses of the outsourced system became clear.”The group says that “the development of such a significant ‘blind spot’ at statutory level is something that requires considerable reflection.”The advocacy group will also say that in the absence of a robust testing system it is “most likely that there would have been some transfers of Covid-19 positive patients into nursing homes.”Furthermore, staff shortages in some cases led to “risk taking with staff in some facilities having to continue to work while ill and in other cases encouraging people back from isolation.”“Other staff, frightened for their own health and aware of the Covid-19 payments, chose to stay away with the result that some nursing homes were so short staffed that phone calls from extremely concerned and distressed relatives went unanswered in some cases for days.”It will say, “staff transfers from the public sector to the private sector were on a voluntary basis, negotiations took up valuable time and delivered little. From the perspective of one person involved, ‘The cavalry never came’.”Speaking in advance of the hearing, Sinn Féin TD Louise O’Reilly said “the opening statement from Nursing Homes Ireland (NHI) for the Oireachtas Covid19 Committee reveals the failure of the Government and the HSE to put a proper plan in place for nursing homes before they became gripped by the Covid crisis.“It further points out that planning and the cost of managing the pandemic fell on the shoulders of nursing homes and how the Department of Health only belatedly intervened.“The whole statement points to a complete failure of the State to enact a structural plan for the nursing home sector, with the necessary financial and staffing resources, until late in the day.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19

cummings controversy","story":"Dominic Cummings, chief adviser to British prime minister Boris Johnson, has told the media that he feels he acted reasonably and legally after driving from London to Durham despite the UK\u0027s Covid-19 restrictions.\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Dominic Cummings blamed inaccurate reporting in the media for the controversy over his journey to Durham during the lockdown. Photograph:  Jonathan Brady-WPA PoolGetty ImagesTime and again during his extraordinary press conference in the garden behind 10 Downing Street, Dominic Cummings blamed inaccurate reporting in the media for the controversy over his journey to Durham during the lockdown. But he confirmed a number of important details No 10 had been dismissing as inaccurate, some of which were apparently in breach of the official guidelines.The first apparent breach was when he went back into Downing Street for a few hours after his wife fell ill at their London home with suspected coronavirus when he should have self-isolated immediately. He confirmed that the couple drove about 27km with their four year-old son from Durham to Barnard Castle and spent about 15 minutes in the town, stopping in a forest on the way back.Cummings claims that they undertook the hour-long round trip to test his eyesight before driving back to London because he feared it had been damaged by coronavirus. But the guidelines he helped to draft told the public that they could only leave their homes to run, cycle or walk for exercise or to get essential supplies.Cummings expressed no regret over his actions, did not accept any responsibility for undermining the government’s public health message and said he had never considered resigning his position. He said his future was for the prime minister to determine, making clear he will have to sack him if he wants him to go.Although Johnson said at his own press conference later that nobody had an unconditional guarantee of continued employment in Downing Street, he left no doubt about his determination to keep Cummings in place. He struck a more conciliatory tone, saying “of course I do regret the confusion and the anger and the pain that people feel” but repeated that his adviser had done nothing wrong.Under questioning from Channel Four News’s Gary Gibbon, Cummings confirmed that he told Johnson about his journey to Durham a few days after he made it. But both men claimed that they were so ill at the time that neither could remember the conversation clearly.Daily MailCabinet ministers emerged from beneath the stones they have been hiding under since an early bout of supportive tweeting on Saturday morning to reprise their messages of solidarity and urge everyone to move on. None of the 20 Conservative MPs who had called for Cummings to go before the press conference immediately changed their tune afterwards.Cummings decided to make his statement after Conservative backbenchers found their inboxes filled with angry messages from constituents and the Daily Mail called for his resignation on its front page. His account of his actions was unconvincing to most of his critics but it may have been enough, along with Johnson’s announcement of a further easing of the lockdown, to take some of the heat out of the controversy.If that happens, Cummings will not only remain in Downing Street but will find his position strengthened as the indispensable element at the heart of Johnson’s government.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4192672!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"us democratic","story":"The process to choose the Democratic nominee to take on Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election is well under way.States across the country are in the process of choosing\u0026nbsptheir preferred candidate, either through a primary contest or a caucus. A primary is a traditional election where eligible voters select their candidate privately through a ballot system. A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates. All but one – Sanders – said they were opposed to this. The issue may become a headache for the Democratic Party as the primary process progresses."},{"url":null,"title":"dominic cummings says did nothing wrong refuses apologise lockdown","story":"Dominic Cummings last night insisted he had no regrets over his behaviour during lockdown and had done nothing wrong by driving 260 miles to stay on his parents’ farm.In an extraordinary hour-long press conference, Boris Johnson’s chief adviser refused to apologise for taking his wife and son to Durham and repeatedly said he had not broken any rules.He said he knew British people “hate the idea of unfairness”, adding: “I believe I made the right judgment but I can understand that others may disagree with that.”After three days of damaging headlines, Mr Cummings was ordered by the Prime Minister to make the unprecedented live television appearance in the hope that he would draw a line under the growing scandal. But he also made a series of admissions likely to draw further scrutiny of his decisions.Mr Cummings said he had not offered his resignation to the Prime Minister nor had he considered doing so, despite calls from more than 20 Conservative MPs for him to quit.He said he had first told Mr Johnson he was in Durham several days into his 14-day stay there, but that both of them were too ill “to remember the conversation in any detail”.Mr Cummings also confessed that he and the Government had made mistakes in their handling of the coronavirus crisis since January, but chose not to detail what they were.His appearance in the garden of No 10 won over some Tory MPs, including Mark Spencer, the Chief Whip, who said he had given a “full, frank, honest and open statement” proving he acted within the rules and that it was “time to move on”.Other MPs, however, said they would wait to see how their constituents responded before passing judgment.Tory MPs nationwide have been bombarded with messages from constituents demanding to know why Mr Cummings has not been sacked and, with a growing sense of rebellion within the party, Mr Cummings was sent out by the Prime Minister to explain his actions.He said he had decided to go to Durham after his wife fell ill and he feared that no one would be able to look after their four-year-old son while he was at work. In the event, he himself fell ill the next day, meaning the family had to spend 14 days in self-isolation.Asked if he felt he should apologise or regretted what he had done, he said: “I don’t regret what I did … I think what I did was actually reasonable in these circumstances. The rules made clear that if you are dealing with small children that can be exceptional circumstances.” He added: “I don’t think I’m so different, and I don’t think there’s one rule for me and one rule for other people … there is no regulation covering the situation I found myself in.”Mr Cummings confirmed he had made a 60-mile round trip from Durham to Barnard Castle with his wife and son on April 12, in an apparent breach of the lockdown rules, but said it was effectively a test run to see if he was up to driving back to London the next day.Asked if he understood why people were angry with his behaviour and had called for his resignation, he said: “I can understand that some people will argue that I should have stayed at home in London throughout.“I understand these views, I know the intense hardship and sacrifice the entire country has had to go through. However, I respectfully disagree.”Mr Johnson said at his own Downing Street press conference later: “I do regret the confusion and the anger and the pain that people have been suffering and that’s why I did want people to understand exactly what had happened.“I tried yesterday to explain my version of what I had heard from Dominic Cummings but I couldn’t go into the detail that people wanted to hear and that’s why we had the statement today.”He added: “People will have to make their minds up. I think he came across as someone who cares very much about his family.“Reasonable people may disagree with his actions but I don’t think reasonable people will disagree with what was going through his head.”Asked if Mr Cummings had his “unconditional” support, Mr Johnson said: “I can’t give unconditional backing to anybody but I don’t believe anybody in Number 10 has done anything to undermine our message.”Among the members of the Cabinet who publicly backed Mr Cummings last night was Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, who said: “Dom Cummings was right today to set out in full detail how he made his decisions in very difficult circumstances. Now we must move on, fight this dreadful disease and get our country back on her feet.”However, Mr Cummings’s public statement did nothing to silence the calls from opposition parties for him to resign.A spokesman for the Labour Party said: “The British people were looking for at least an apology from Dominic Cummings for breaking the lockdown. They got none.“Millions of people have made extraordinary sacrifices during the lockdown.“Families have been forced apart, sometimes in the most tragic of circumstances. They stayed at home to protect the NHS and save lives.“And yet, the message from this Government is clear: it’s one rule for Boris Johnson’s closest adviser, another for everybody else.”Ian Blackford, SNP Westminster Leader, said it was now “beyond doubt Dominic Cummings broke multiple lockdown rules”.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"must not let china use covid cover hong kong power grab","story":"There’s something happening in China and the West needs to pay attention. No, it’s not wet markets or the suppression of whistle-blowing COVID doctors. It’s not the attempts to interfere with the democratic outcomes of other countries’ elections. It’s not even using technology as a Trojan horse to gain access to national communication systems or threatening trading sanctions or tariffs to demonstrate economic might. All of these we’ve already seen of course, and, to our shame, have either been too busy, too cowed, too fearful or too complacent to do much about. What’s happening now is a far more brazen, more aggressive, more open flouting of international law. This week, the Communist Party of China submitted a draft resolution to its parliament. So far, so procedural. But the resolution seeks to impose a new national security law on the City of Hong Kong and the parliament – only ever a rubber stamping exercise – is sure to pass it.It seeks to criminalise secession, subversion and terrorism, along with any activities by foreign forces that interfere with Hong Kong. The way the Chinese authorities work, the resolution is passed first and the fleshing out of various remits, actions and consequences comes later, so Hong Kong’s worried citizenry will need to wait to find out exactly how much of a power grab this is. Nerves are already frayed at the suggestion the Ministry of State Security – sometimes referred to as ‘China’s KGB’ – will be opening an office in the city. The moves are enough to have prompted street protests in Hong Kong and, internationally, more than 200 politicians and policymakers from 23 countries to sign a statement denouncing Beijing’s action. China will be delighted, however, that a world media buried deep in COVID coverage, has left such a move off the front pages and afforded it much less prominence than protests last year in response to new extradition law.But this is a far more egregious act and demands a swift and united response. When the handover of Hong Kong from Britain to China happened in 1997, the two sides drew up a treaty protecting Hong Kongers’ freedoms – freedom of assembly, of speech and to exercise democracy in its own way. It also enshrined Hong Kong’s independent judiciary and codified that the city was responsible for its own security. These are freedoms enjoyed nowhere else in China and the Joint Declaration was an official international treaty, lodged with the United Nations and had a writ that was to run until 2047. This week’s power play by China – while the world’s attention was elsewhere – drives a cart and horses through international law. It makes a mockery of the “One Country, Two Systems” promises made to the people of Hong Kong as handover occurred.But the international community in general, and the United Kingdom in particular, are not powerless to act.  Firstly, this needs to be put firmly on the agenda of the next G7 meeting. As former Hong Kong governor, Chris Patten, has argued, continuing to allow China to act without sanction or rebuke only encourages more aggressive behaviour and makes future action that much more difficult.And, closer to home, the United Kingdom should make good on its responsibilities to Hong Kong’s people. In the 1980s Hong Kongers’ status changed from the same as that of any other British Citizens to citizens of British dependent Territories, stripping them of residency rights. When handover happened, that status changed again to British Nationals (Overseas) citizens – enjoying a UK passport and consular support, but no right to live and work long term in the UK.However the level of fear running up to the handover created concerns of mass emigration from Hong Kong, threatening the city’s stability and the function of its institutions. So the UK changed its decision (again) and reinstated full British citizenship for certain key figures – judges, senior police officers etc – deemed essential to the good governance of the city. Betting that by enshrining the ability to leave at any time, most of these figures would choose to stay. They did.  And something of the same needs to happen now. China’s sustained erosion of rights and freedoms in Hong Kong - backed by force - is making the city’s citizens nervous once again.  Nearby Taiwan has already seen an 150pc increase in Hong Kongers seeking refuge in the country during the first four months of 2020 and a presidential offer of  all “necessary assistance”. But the country with the historic and moral responsibility to act here is the UK.  As the situation deteriorates, it’s a position that’s gaining ground in Westminster. Tom Tugendhat, the energetic chairman of the Commons foreign affairs committee argues “The UK had obligations to Hong Kong citizens before 1997, and the extension of overseas citizenship, which is in many ways a second-tier citizenship, was a mistake, and I think it’s one that should be corrected.At a time when there are clearly tensions in Hong Kong, the UK could reassure many Hong Kong citizens that their existing rights are recognised by the UK, and they are valued.” It is complicated, however, as Tugendhat admits “These are still Chinese citizens from the special autonomous region, so I don’t think the Chinese government would see them as anything other than Chinese citizens under a slightly different status.”Indeed, under international law, the UK can’t simply spray the populace of Hong Kong with UK passports and declare that everyone living there is now British. However, what it can do is change the domestic rules for those already holding British Citizenship (Overseas) passports. By allowing people in this group, for example, the right to live and work in the UK for up to ten years, it will settle the nerves of those in Hong Kong, wary of what China chooses to do next. It shows China that Britain is not afraid to underwrite the freedoms that Hong Kongers enjoy and, for those who do choose to come to the UK, after five years they can apply for indefinite leave to remain and for citizenship.

He insists he acted legally and responsibly and that his trip was to ensure the safety of his four-year-old son.At an extraordinary press conference at Downing Street on Monday, Mr Cummings refused to resign and insisted he had not broken the rules.Despite his account, some questions are still unanswered:What did the Prime Minister know about Mr Cummings’ trip to Durham, and was the trip sanctioned by the PM?Mr Cummings said that he had not asked the Prime Minister about his decision to leave for Durham and admitted that “arguably this was a mistake”.“I did not ask the Prime Minister about this decision. He was ill himself and he had huge problems to deal with, Mr Cummings said. “The Prime Minister’s time is just about the most valuable commodity that exists in the Government. The honest truth about my job is that there are endless problems all day long, and I can\u0027t go to him all day, asking him \u0027what do you think about that\u0027, \u0027what do you think about the other\u0027 otherwise what\u0027s the point of having people like me around?”“I have to get on with things. I have to make decisions, and sometimes I do the right thing and sometimes I make mistakes.“Arguably this was a mistake and I understand that some will say that I should have spoken to the Prime Minister before deciding what to do.”The week after arriving in Durham, Mr Cummings said he did inform the Prime Minister of his whereabouts while they were both sick with the virus. Neither of the men recall the conversion in detail because they were both “in bad shape”, Mr Cummings said.The next time the matter was discussed between Mr Cummings and his boss was when journalists confronted Downing Street with the allegations on Friday evening, he said.Did Mr Cummings and his wife stop at a service station? And, by doing so, did they put anyone else at risk?Mr Cummings said that when he and his family made the long drive back to London from Durham they stopped for petrol along the way. However, he did not clarify whether he or his wife got out of the car, or whether they exposed anyone else to risk.In the course of his journeys between Durham and London did Mr Cummings or his wife come into contact with other members of the public?Mr Cummings claimed that made the 260-mile trip to Durham without stopping for petrol but made one stop on the way back. However, this would have been on the same tank of petrol with which he drove to Barnard Castle, a 60-mile round-trip from where he was staying in Durham. That means he travelled at least 580 miles and only stopped once to get petrol.Did Mr Cummings visit Houghall Woods near his family’s Durham property on April 19? Onlookers say that spotted the adviser at the beauty spot five days after being photographed back at work in Downing Street. If the account is correct this means Mr Cummings broke lockdown rules more than once.At the press conference, Mr Cummings admitted to two trips to the woods. The first, he said, was on his father\u0027s property, and he was seen by a member of the public.“At one point the three of us walked into woods, owned by my father, Mr Cummings said. Some people saw us in these woods from a distance, but we had no interaction with them. We had not left the property, we were on private land.Mr Cummings also admitted to another stop on the way back to his parents’ farm from Barnard Castle because his child said he needed the toilet.“My wife and child jumped out into the woods by the side of the road, he said. They were briefly outside, I briefly joined them. They played for a little bit.Mr Cummings denied reports that he had returned to Durham after coming back to London. One witness said they had recognised him by his trademark beanie hat, and had overheard him remarking that the bluebells are lovely during a walk in Hougham Woods on April 19.But Mr Cummings said: “Data on my phone would prove this to be false, and local CCTV if it exists, would also prove that I\u0027m telling the truth that I was in London. On that day, I was not in Durham.”Why could Mr Cummings and his wife not arrange childcare in London?Mr Cummings said he was worried that if both he and his wife fell ill there was nobody in London we could reasonably ask to look after our child and expose themselves to Covid.The couple decided that, instead of asking family and friends in London, they would decamp to Durham where his sister and two nieces had offered to look after his son if necessary.“In that scenario, what would be best for everybody, wouldn\u0027t it be best for a 17-year-old niece, to walk 50 metres and look after our child, or would it be best for me to be here? And, and call 999?” he said.Did Mr Cummings visit Barnard Castle, 30 miles from Durham, on April 12?Yes. Mr Cummings claimed that he drove to the market town of Barnard Castle on Sunday April 12 to test his eyesight before making the long trip back to London.“We were all going to go back, he said. My wife said we should drive down the road and you should see if you can actually drive, and see if your vision is weird or if you\u0027re okay. She didn’t want to risk a nearly 300-mile drive with our child. And I thought, that\u0027s a good idea. I should do,” he said.The family then made the 44-minute journey to Barnard Castle, and “ended up on the outskirts”, he said.I wasn\u0027t sightseeing, I didn\u0027t go to the castle, he said. “We parked by a river. My wife and I discussed the situation. We agreed that I could drive safely. We should turn around and go home.“I felt a bit sick. We walked about 10 to 15 metres from the car to the riverbank nearby. We sat there for about 15 minutes. No interactions with anybody. I felt better. “We returned to the car, and an elderly gentleman walking nearby appeared to recognise me. My wife wished him happy Easter from a distance, but we had no other interaction.” On what day did Mr Cummings fall ill and how long did he self isolate for?Mr Cummings said that over the weekend of March 28-29, he and his family moved into a small cottage made from “concrete blocks” around 50m from his parents’ main residence.“The next day, I got extremely ill,” he said. “A couple of days later I couldn\u0027t look after a child... I could barely move to be honest.”Mr Cummings returned to work on April 14 and, according to his account, he had been isolating with his wife and children since around March 29.Downing Street has challenged the statement of Durham police which states a family member of Mr Cummings’ was questioned by the force. Number 10 initially said that “at no stage” was the aide or his family spoken to by the police about this matter. Which account is true?The Force had initially claimed officers spoke to Mr Cummings family, without naming them, and had offered advice on the coronavirus lockdown.Hours later Downing Street denied that any member of Mr Cummings’ family had been spoken to by police, prompting the force to issue a clarifying statement in which he was named.But on Monday Durham Police issued a third statement confirming it had not raised the issue of the lockdown.The statement confirmed Robert Cummings had told officers his son was staying at his property and he and his wife were displaying signs of coronavirus and were self isolating.The statement went on: “We can further confirm that our officer gave no specific advice on coronavirus to any members of the family and that Durham Constabulary deemed that no further action was required in that regard. Our officer did, however, provide the family with advice on security issues.”Deputy Chief Medical Officer Jenny Harries said being too ill to look after a small child was an “exceptional circumstance” on April 10 and she pointed to accessing family support. But Mr Cummings’ trip was almost two weeks before this advice was issued. What is his defence of this?Mr Cummings did not address Dr Harries\u0027 point directly. However, he did argue that he had looked at official lockdown guidance published in March that banned people with coronavirus symptoms from leaving their home, and said: If you have children, keep following this advice to the best of your ability, however, we are aware that not all these measures will be possible. To me, the rules are there, they talk about what to do, they talk about exceptional circumstances and small children.On Saturday night Ms Harries also said that people should only travel with coronavirus to seek childcare if there is an “extreme” risk to life. Was this the case?While Mr Cummings\u0027 wife was displaying symptoms, Mr Cummings was not showing symptoms before the trip. In fact, he said the reason for his trip was because he worried that if both he and his wife fell ill there was nobody in London we could reasonably ask to look after our child and expose themselves to Covid.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"dunkirk evacuation no miracle","story":"Eighty years ago a new phrase entered the British lexicon – The Dunkirk Spirit. Defined as “the spirit of the British public pulling together to overcome times of adversity”, it has particular resonance today. On 26th May 1940 Operation Dynamo, the mission to rescue the British Expeditionary Force from France, began. The herculean efforts of the Royal Navy, the Merchant Navy and civilian volunteers, have become embedded in our national story.In his ‘we shall fight them on the beaches’ speech nine days later, Churchill said that “Wars are not won by evacuations”. True, but he knew they can be lost if such operations go badly wrong as for many days in that torrid time seemed all too likely.The Dunkirk story is now legendary. The qualities of courage and resilience in the face of extreme adversity are part of our identity, how we think of ourselves. This is exemplified by the Little Ships - the story of how a civilian armada helped save an army. Some say it was a miracle – an event so extraordinary that it surpasses all human powers. The truth is far more gutsy and practical, and utterly remarkable.Dunkirk was not a planned operation but an improvised one where initiative largely took the place of planning. Behind it all and led by the brilliant – and now overlooked – Vice Admiral Sir Bertram Ramsay, was a small team of men and women who, in tunnels deep under Dover Castle, hatched and guided the plan, adapting it to bounce back after every setback. In only a few days this team somehow found all the resources in ships, people and supplies required to lift an army. It was an almost superhuman effort, conducted by ordinary men and women. When it is safe to do so, you will be able once again to visit those tunnels, where English Heritage’s superb series of videos unfolds the story in the place where it actually happened.In France, retreating British and French forces dug in and held an area around Dunkirk while the evacuation proceeded. On the way in and out, ships had to fight off aircraft, E-boats and shore batteries, and negotiate explosive mines. Another, largely invisible, battle took place in the sky as the RAF engaged the Luftwaffe: catastrophic though the bombing of ships and beaches was, with over 230 vessels sunk, it could have been so much worse. It was an inferno in which the courage and determination of all those involved from all three Services enabled it enormously to exceed expectations. Having initially thought that about 50,000 could be saved, the total recovered was nearly 340,000, including some 140,000 French, Belgian and Dutch.Without the guiding hand of Ramsay and his team, it would have been a shambles. In a letter to his wife on 5th June he wrote: “… now all is done and the task is behind. The relief is stupendous. The results beyond belief. The success is mostly due to the first-class direction and management of the show, equally with glorious courage, skill and endurance of the personnel of all the ships. The one without the other would have been ineffective….”Although the circumstances of today are totally different, inevitably people will seek parallels. Improvisation was the key, together with quick decision-making 24 hours a day, often based on very limited information. Ideas had to be tried if they didn’t work – try something different.  Many mistakes were made and opportunities lost – it’s inevitable in chaotic situations like this. No decision one can take is without risk. Behind the apparent chaos – detailed planning, ruthless oversight by small,  focussed teams, and constant adjustments as the situation on the ground changed. If any of this is sounding at all familiar, I could add that one of Ramsay’s great joys at the end of it all was a long overdue visit to a hairdresser!English Heritage cares for Dover Castle and Ramsay’s tunnels on behalf of the nation and while the conservation charity will not be able to mark the 80th anniversary of the rescue mission from where it was masterminded, it will - using storytelling including first-hand accounts- evoke those desperate days on its Twitter channel.Sir Tim Laurence is Chairman of English Heritage.  Follow @EnglishHeritage and #Dunkirk1940 on Twitter to see the story unfoldMore from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"normal people star raffle connells chain charity","story":"Normal People star Paul Mescal is raffling off his chain in order to raise money for a suicide prevention charity.The actor, who plays Connell Waldron in the hit BBC Three series, said that the chain he wears in the programme had got a following of its own.The chain, which has its own Instagram fan page, got plenty of airtime in the numerous intimate moments between Connell and Marianne, played by Daisy Edgar-Jones.The series, which is adapted from Sally Rooney\u0027s 2018 Man Booker longlisted novel, was watched by 16 million people in its first week on the BBC iPlayer.The chain is being raffled in aid of Pieta, which is an Irish charity that provides support to people who are suicidal or engaging in self-harm.Mescal said: I am delighted to be able to help out Pieta by raffling off my chain that has taken on a following of its own since Normal People hit television screens.Pieta is a cause very close to my heart, having experienced loss due to suicide in my local town while growing up.He added that the series touches upon depression and suicidal ideation, so it seemed like a very special partnership to want to help those in similar situations.I want to play my part in helping sustain these free services across Ireland, Mescal said.The raffle opened on Monday and runs until June 8.More than €9,000 (about £8,000) has been raised by the charity initiative so far.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"world health organisation suspends trial hydroxychloroquine","story":"The World Health Organisation has temporarily suspended clinical trials of hydroxychloroquine as a potential treatment for coronavirus.The decision came after a study published in The Lancet medical journal last week suggested the drug could increase the risk of death among Covid-19 patients, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a virtual press conference.Mr Tedros said the executive group of the so-called Solidarity Trial, in which hundreds of hospitals across the world have enrolled patients to test several possible treatments for the novel coronavirus, had suspended trials using that drug as a precaution.The Executive Group has implemented a temporary pause of the hydroxychloroquine arm within the Solidarity Trial while the safety data is reviewed by the Data Safety Monitoring Board, Mr Tedros said.The other arms of the trial are continuing.Hydroxychloroquine is normally used to treat arthritis but public figures including US President Donald Trump have backed the drug as a virus treatment, prompting governments to bulk buy.Mr Trump said last week he was taking the drug as a preventative measure, but in an interview aired on Sunday on Sinclair Broadcasting he said he had completed his course.Finished, just finished, Mr Trump said. And by the way, I\u0027m still here. To the best of my knowledge, here I am.Brazil\u0027s health minister also recommended last week using hydroxychloroquine, as well as the anti-malarial chloroquine, to treat even mild Covid-19 cases.The Lancet study found that both drugs could produce potentially serious side effects, particularly heart arrhythmia.And neither drug helped patients hospitalised with COVID-19, according to the study, which looked at the records of 96,000 patients across hundreds of hospitals.Mr Tedros said both drugs were generally safe for patients with autoimmune diseases or malaria.WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan told Monday\u0027s briefing the Solidarity Trial had been looking only at the effects of hydroxychloroquine and not chloroquine.The decision to suspend enrolment for trials using hydroxychloroquine was a temporary measure, she said.The Covid-19 pandemic, which began late last year in China, has killed nearly 350,000 people worldwide and infected almost 5.5 million.While there is still no approved treatment or vaccine, drastic measures that at one point saw half of humanity under lockdown have pushed down transmission rates in several countries.As many nations begin to gradually lift restrictions, the WHO stressed the need to maintain physical distancing and to scale up efforts to test and detect cases.All countries need to remain on high alert, WHO expert Maria Van Kerkhove said. The virus will take the opportunity to amplify if it can.WHO emergencies chief Michael Ryan warned against the idea that the pandemic might move in seasonal waves.Making an assumption that it is on a downward trajectory, and the next danger point is some time in October or November, I think that would be a dangerous assumption, he said.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/05/23/11/hertz-car-rental.jpg","title":"hertz car hire bankruptcy coronavirus stock price","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.‘No business is built for zero revenue,’ says firm’s former chief executive.\u0026nbsp‘There’s only so long that companies’ reserves will carry them’The 102-year-old car rental company Hertz has filed for bankruptcy after the coronavirus pandemic caused business to nosee.At the end of March, the firm was $18.7 billion (£15.3 billion) in debt with only $1 billion (£820 million) of available cash.Hertz, which has over 400 outlets across the UK and Ireland, recently cut 12,000 staff from its global workforce and put another 4,000 on furlough. Chief executive Kathryn Marinello resigned last week following reports of possible bankruptcy.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe company lost all revenue from mid-March when the global travel industry came to a shuddering halt. Much of the firm’s income is sourced from car rentals at airports but it started missing debt payments in April.Ms Marinello said at the company’s first-quarter earnings conference on 12 May: “No business is built for zero revenue. There’s only so long that companies’ reserves will carry them.”Why businesses should think about going flight-freeBusinesses are a bit more optimistic, but we\u0027re heading for recessionHow the Government is helping UK businesses in the Covid-19 crisisNew insolvency law to stop businesses going bust during pandemicIn the company’s first-quarter report earlier this month with securities regulators, Hertz warned it may not be able to repay or refinance debt and may not have enough cash to continue operations.The report said: “Management has concluded there is substantial doubt regarding the company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the issuance date of this quarterly report.”Hertz said in a statement on Friday: “The impact of Covid-19 on travel demand was sudden and dramatic, causing an abrupt decline in the company’s revenue and future bookings.“Hertz took immediate actions to prioritise the health and safety of employees and customers, eliminate all non-essential spending and preserve liquidity.“However, uncertainty remains as to when revenue will return and when the used-car market will fully re-open for sales, which necessitated today’s action. The financial reorganisation will provide Hertz a path toward a more robust financial structure that best positions the company for the future as it navigates what could be a prolonged travel and overall global economic recovery.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The challenge now is to understand the processes in Earth\u0027s core driving theses changes.One possibility, according to the ESA, is that the weakening field is a sign that the Earth\u0027s magnetic field is about to reverse, whereby the North Pole and South Pole switch places.The last time a geomagnetic reversal took place was 780,000 years ago, with some scientists claiming that the next one is long overdue. Typically, such events take place every 250,000 years.The repercussions of such an event could be significant, as the Earth\u0027s magnetic field plays an important role in protecting the planet from solar winds and harmful cosmic radiation. Telecommunication and satellite systems also rely on it to operate, suggesting that computers and mobile phones could experience difficulties.The South Atlantic Anomaly is already causing issues with satellites orbiting Earth, the ESA warned, while spacecrafts flying in the area could also experience technical malfunctions.A 2018 study published in the scientific journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that despite the weakening field, Earth\u0027s magnetic field is probably not reversing.The study also explained that the process is not an instantaneous one and could take tens of thousands of years to take place.ESA said it would continue to monitor the weakening magnetic field with its constellation of Swarm satellites.The mystery of the origin of the South Atlantic Anomaly has yet to be solved, the space agency stated. However, one thing is certain: magnetic field observations from Swarm are providing exciting new insights into the scarcely understood processes of Earth\u0027s interior.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We’re always experimenting with future concepts using different hardware configurations as part of our proof-of-experience process” Bozworth also tweeted.Virtual reality is content computer-generated in three dimensions in a digital environment, while augmented reality – or mixed reality – is digital content layered over a real-world environment, such as Pokemon Go.The news comes as Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that half of its workforce will likely work remotely over the next five to ten years.“We need to do this in a way that’s thoughtful and responsible, so we’re going to do this in a measured way, he said. But I think that it’s possible that over the next five to 10 years — maybe closer to 10 than five, but somewhere in that range — I think we could get to about half of the company working remotely permanently.“VR and AR is all about giving people remote presence. So if you’re long on VR and AR and on video chat, you have to believe in some capacity that you’re helping people be able to do whatever they want from wherever they are. So I think that that suggests a worldview that would lead to allowing people to work more remotely over time.” What has Facebook done to fix election interference since 2016?Facebook wants to build a ‘hateful meme’ AI to clean up its platformFacebook’s Oculus is developing a new Quest VR headsetThe company also published a blog post  saying that it would create a “super-powered augmented workspace with multiple customizable screens in VR, unbounded from the limits of ​physical monitors.”It would use Passthrough – a technology used on Facebook’s Oculus virtual reality hardware that lets you “temporarily step outside VR to see a real-time view of the world around you” - to let people switch between their real and virtual worlds with the hope that by “combining the flexibility of new inputs like hand tracking with the familiarity of everyday input devices like a keyboard and mouse, we could give people the best of both worlds.”The company is also developing virtual avatars called Codec Avatars which would “let people in the future create lifelike virtual avatars of themselves quickly and easily, helping social connections in virtual reality become as natural and common as those in the real world.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The WHO said testings involving hydroxychloroquine had been suspended while “data is reviewed by the data safety monitoring board”.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesCountries lifting lockdowns could face \u0027immediate second peak\u0027 in infectionsHydroxychloroquine trial halted over safety concernsA clinical trial of malaria drug hydroxychloroquine - promoted by Donald Trump as a potential coronavirus preventative or cure -\u0026nbsphas been suspended by the World Health Organisation amid safety concerns.The move comes after a study published in the The Lancet medical journal found\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspuse of the drug increased the risk of death by 34 per cent and caused a 137 per cent increased risk of serious heart abnormalities.WHO director-general\u0026nbspTedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Monday the organisation\u0027s executive group had implemented a temporary pause on the trial\u0026nbspwhile the safety data is reviewed by the data safety monitoring board.My colleagues Vincent Wood and Oliver O\u0027Connell report\u0026nbspthe full story:Countries lifting lockdown could face \u0027immediate second peak\u0027Countries where coronavirus infections are declining could face an immediate\u0026nbspsecond\u0026nbsppeak if they ease\u0026nbspmeasures to halt the outbreak too early, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has warned.WHO emergencies head\u0026nbspMike Ryan noted epidemics often came in waves, which means that outbreaks could come back later this year in places where the first wave has subsided. But he added the first wave of the disease could peak again before then\u0026nbspif governments lift lockdowns too hastily.When we speak about a second wave classically what we often mean is there will be a first wave of the disease by itself, and then it recurs months later. And that may be a reality for many countries in a number of months\u0027 time, Ryan told an online briefing on Monday.But we need also to be cognisant of the fact that the disease can jump up at any time. We cannot make assumptions that just because the disease is on the way down now it is going to keep going down and we are get a number of months to get ready for a second wave. We may get a second peak in this wave.Ryan also noted\u0026nbspthat while cases are declining in many countries they are still increasing in Central and South America, South Asia and Africa.He said countries in Europe and North America should continue to put in place the public health and social measures, the surveillance measures, the testing measures and a comprehensive strategy to ensure that we continue on a downwards trajectory and we don\u0027t have an immediate second peak.Many European countries and US\u0026nbspstates have taken steps in recent weeks to lift lockdown measures that curbed the spread of the disease but caused severe harm to economies.Good morning and welcome to The Independent\u0027s live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Some countries’ emissions dropped by as much as 26 per cent on average during the peak of the confinement.Visualising the biggest carbon crash ever recordedIf pre-pandemic conditions return by mid-June, then 2020 emissions could decline by a more modest 4 per cent compared to 2019, though this would still be the largest single annual decrease in absolute emissions since the end of World War II.A UN report last year said emissions needed to drop by 2.7 per cent a year keep warming well below 2 degrees Celsius, and 7.6 per cent a year to keep below 1.5C.“Population confinement has led to drastic changes in energy use and CO2 emissions,” said lead author Corinne Le Quéré at the University of East Anglia.“These extreme decreases are likely to be temporary, however, as they do not reflect structural changes in the economic, transport, or energy systems,” she added.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailPrevious analysis of data from Carbon Brief and the International Energy Agency revealed the unprecedented scale of the emissions decline.China saw the largest drop in emissions in April, followed by the United States, Europe and India.In the countries with the strictest lockdown restrictions, emissions from aviation plunged 75 per cent in early April, while emissions from land transport fell by 50 per cent and from power generation by 15 per cent.Emissions from industry declined by around 35 per cent, with a lack of data causing some uncertainty. Emissions from residential buildings, however, increased by 5 per cent, the study said.“The emissions reductions occurring because of Covid-19 will clearly be unprecedented. What is less certain is how the economy will rebound in late 2020 and 2021,” said Glen Peters at the CICERO Center for International Climate Research in Norway, which took part in the study.“As different countries and sectors recover, it is unclear if activity levels will return to normal levels or if we may see permanent shifts in behaviour,” he added.The environmental impact of coronavirus containment measures has also led to a huge reduction in air pollution in the form of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) emissions, which are released by cars, aeroplanes and other combustion engines.Satellite images captured by the European Space Agency showed a dramatic decrease in NO2 emissions in 2020 compared to 2019.Additional reporting by agencies.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

This trend, combined with people\u0027s own changing attitudes toward social events and large gatherings, resulted in travel dropping by more than 50 per cent before the lockdown began, according to requests made on Apple Maps for car and public transport directions.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRequests on Apple Maps for car directions began to fall on 11 March, while requests for public transport directions began to fall even earlier on 9 March.Many activities and behaviours that were considered normal before coronavirus also remain taboo regardless of the government\u0027s guidelines.The recently relaxed rules mean that cleaners and nannies are now permitted to visit people\u0027s homes, but a recent survey found that the majority of people found this very unacceptable.The poll by Ipsos MORI, which was carried out between 8 and 11 May, also found that having non co-habiting friends, family members or loved ones visit was also considered socially unacceptable.​Public opinion about exercise and driving is more greatly ided, ​though the poll demonstrated that government rules may not be a defining influence on people\u0027s behaviours.Companies\u0027 decisions to keep work from home policies in place show that lockdown measures are not necessarily enforced by government policy decision.The figures also suggest that the impact of coronavirus on travel habits, socialising and other pre-lockdown habits could continue long after lockdown officially ends.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Emergency funding should go to areas with the highest rates of infection.”Steve Rotheram, mayor of the Liverpool city region, said its authorities believed ministers had “pulled the rug from under them”, after promising they would receive “whatever it takes”.“Now it’s ‘take whatever you are given’ and it’s noticeable that it’s Labour areas that have missed out in the second tranche,” he protested.This NHS U-turn shows we must not question supporting immigrantsSignificant numbers of government’s coronavirus home tests never usedMore than a fifth of people believe coronavirus is a hoaxContact tracing app shares private date with outside firm“It is disgraceful if funding is being allocated in that partisan way, after what ministers said about putting away party-political squabbles in a time of national crisis.”In total, more than £100m was erted from councils in the bottom half of the deprivation index, when £1.6bn of emergency grants were announced in late April, according to the Labour analysis.That is the difference from the allocations to each town hall from the first £1.6bn pot, handed out in March, which did include deprivation in the weightings.The second £1.6bn tranche was awarded on a per-capita basis, raising fears in town halls – which still face an estimated £10bn black hole because of coronavirus costs – that the method will be used for future allocations.The future downgrading of deprivation was signalled in the so-called fair funding review which began under Theresa May and triggered loud protests.However, it is supposed to be on hold, until April 2022, after poorer areas that delivered Boris Johnson’s general election triumph were among those facing big cuts.A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: “We’re providing councils with an unprecedented £3.2bn in the fairest way possible and giving them the resources to tackle the immediate pressures they have told us they’re facing.“The two tranches of funding were allocated in different ways because they address different needs, but should be considered together as the true picture of this additional support.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Split into more than 80 wards containing 42 beds each, the facility will be used to treat Covid-19 patients who have been transferred from other intensive care units across London. Defending Mr Cummings, a No 10 spokesman said:  “Owing to his wife being infected with suspected Coronavirus and the high likelihood that he would himself become unwell, it was essential for Dominic Cummings to ensure his young child could be properly cared for. His sister and nieces had volunteered to help so he went to a house near to but separate from his extended family in case their help was needed. His sister shopped for the family and left everything outside. At no stage was he or his family spoken to by the police about this matter, as is being reported. His actions were in line with coronavirus guidelines. Mr Cummings believes he behaved reasonably and legally.”Members of the cabinet also defended Mr Cummings.Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, tweeted: “Taking care of your wife and young child is justifiable and reasonable, trying to score political points over it isn’t.” Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, wrote in a similar vein: “It’s reasonable and fair to ask for an explanation on this. And it has been provided: two parents with Coronavirus, were anxiously taking care of their young child. Those now seeking to politicise it should take a long hard look in the mirror.”Michael Gove, the cabinet office minister, added: “Caring for your wife and child is not a crime.” Opposition politicians have accused No 10 of a ‘cover up’ after reports some in Downing Street knew Mr Cummings had made the 260-mile journey during lockdown.Labour have called on Boris  Johnson to say whether or not he sanctioned the trip.  SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford said that Mr Johnson had questions to answer  and should fire his chief adviser immediately. Police have confirmed they visited a property in County Durham after Mr Cummings made the  trip from his London home.

He called on Mr Johnson to state publicly if he believed Mr Cummings had adhered to the rules. “It’s clearly a matter of public interest - lockdown has been heartbreaking for so many families,  this looks like one rule for those at the centre of government and one rule for everyone else,” he said.  The details of Mr Cumming’s trip were revealed by the Daily Mirror and the . A neighbour told the papers Mr Cummings was seen in the garden, while Abba\u0027s Dancing Queen was playing loudly. Durham police confirmed officers had spoken to the owners of an address after reports a person had travelled there from London.A spokesman said: On Tuesday, March 31, our officers were made aware of reports that an inidual had travelled from London to Durham and was present at an address in the city.Officers made contact with the owners of that address who confirmed that the inidual in question was present and was self-isolating in part of the house.In line with national policing guidance, officers explained to the family the arrangements around self-isolation guidelines and reiterated the appropriate advice around essential travel.Senior members of Mr Johnson’s own party expressed concern Mr Cumming’s journey could endanger the government’s plans to lift the lockdown. Former Tory cabinet minister  David Lidington, Theresa May’s de facto deputy prime minister, told Newsnight: There\u0027s clearly serious questions that No 10 are going to have to address, not least because the readiness of members of the public to follow government guidance more generally is going to be affected by this sort of story.Professor Neil Ferguson, the epidemiologist whose modelling prompted the lockdown, quit as a government adviser for flouting the rules when he was visited at this home by his girlfriend. At the time Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said he was speechless and said he backed any police action against Mr Ferguson.Sir Ed Davey, acting leader of the Liberal Democrats, called for Mr Cummings to quit over the allegations, while a spokesman for Labour said: The British people do not expect there to be one rule for them and another rule for Dominic Cummings.He told the BBC Mr Johnson had serious questions to answer. “Did he sanction this? Did he say “this is ok”?”Allies of Mr Cummings said he was  not “remotely bothered” by the story, calling it “fake news”. There is zero chance of him resigning.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

She did not want to risk a nearly 300-mile drive with our child given how ill I had been.“We agreed that we should go for a short drive to see if I could drive safely, we drove for roughly half an hour and ended up on the outskirts of Barnard Castle town. We did not visit the castle, we did not walk around the town.”Mr Cummings said he had felt a “bit sick” so they had walked about 10 to 15 metres to the riverbank where they sat for about 15 minutes until he felt better.Claimed he had previously warned of coronavirus pandemicMr Cummings used the briefing to insist he, contrary to some reports, had not resisted the introduction of lockdown measures and had in fact previously warned of the dangers of a coronavirus pandemic.“For years, I have warned of the dangers of pandemics. Last year I wrote about the possible threat of coronaviruses and the urgent need for planning,” he said.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

silence at Guy\u0027s HospitalMr Cummings did in fact write an entry on his blog in March 2019, which more specifically examined the possibility of a deadly outbreak being triggered by a coronavirus accidentally released from a laboratory during scientific experiments. Scientists currently believe Sars-CoV-2, the virus which causes Covid-19, jumped from animals to humans as the product of natural evolution.Described his family’s farm as ‘sort of concrete blocks’The PM’s senior adviser insisted that his trip to Durham to isolate was not because the property on his family’s farm was a “nice place to be”.“The point about it was not that it was some nice place to be. If you have been there, you would see that it\u0027s sort of concrete blocks,” he said.“The point about it was not that it was a nice place to be, but that it was the safest place to be in the circumstances – and it meant that I didn\u0027t have to expose other people to risk unless I absolutely had to in a critical emergency.”Didn’t make inquiries about childcare in London before making tripMr Cummings used the briefing to insist the journey had been necessary because he and his wife had no reasonable childcare options in London if they both fell ill with coronavirus.“I suddenly got a call from my wife who was at home looking after our four-year-old child,” he explained in a prepared statement.“She told me she suddenly felt badly ill, she vomited and felt like she might pass out, and there would be nobody to look after our child. None of our usual childcare options were available.”However, in subsequent questioning from journalists, Mr Cummings later admitted he did not make inquiries about potential childcare in London.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

During an extraordinary press conference in the rose garden of Downing Street, Mr Cummings also admitted what appeared to be second clear breach of the rules when he said he had taken a 30 mile trip to a beauty spot while in County Durham. Despite calls from more than a dozen Tory MPs for his head, Boris Johnson’s most senior adviser said he had not considered standing down over the controversy.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesLast night a number of cabinet ministers lined up to publicly support Mr Cummings, for the second time in three days. But rank-and-file Tory MPs reported that Mr Cummings’s statement had failed to win over their constituents.The four most puzzling lines from Dominic Cummings statementOne MP told The Independent they had received a flood of angry emails in the wake of Mr Cummings’s attempt to explain his actions. Even an announcement by Mr Johnson that shops in England would reopen in the middle of next month appeared to do little to stem public anger over his most senior adviser’s behaviour.During more than an hour of questions from the press, Mr Cummings said: “I don’t regret what I did. I think reasonable people may well disagree about how I thought about what to do in the circumstances, but I think what I did was actually reasonable in these circumstances.”He said he hoped that people would understand his actions once they knew the “very complex situation” he was facing. The 30 mile trip to Barnard Castle was to test his eyesight, he said, ahead of a long drive back to London. Mr Cummings was concerned his sight had been affected when he came down with Covid-19 symptoms in Durham, he added.

Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive updates on politics every morning by emailHe travelled to Durham in the first place to seek help with childcare because he feared he and his wife were about to fall ill with the virus, he said. He was also concerned about the safety of his young child in London, after his high-profile position in government attracted threats. But he added that he never considered approaching a friend or neighbour in London for help with his child for fear of exposing them to a “deadly disease”.  And he said he was motivated in part by a desire to return to work in Downing Street and to ensure his family were safe if he did so.The senior aide denied making any stops on the journey from London to Durham. But he could only say he was “95 per cent sure” he had stopped off on the way home. He also admitted sitting near a river in Barnard Castle and that he and his wife had gone into some woods on the way back because his son needed to go to the toilet. Mr Cummings said his trip north had not been sanctioned by the prime minister. But he admitted that he had told Mr Johnson about it shortly afterwords, meaning the prime minster had been aware of the breach in the lockdown rules for weeks.       Asked later, Mr Johnson said he had “regrets” but only about the anger and confusion the public felt over his aide’s 500-mile round trip.

At least 15 Conservative MPs, including former ministers, have now called for Mr Cummings to go, while several others have spoken out against his behaviour. The prime minister is also coming under mounting pressure from his own MPs to order a Whitehall investigation into the case.  The local police and crime commissioner has also asked the chief constable of Durham police to establish the facts about Mr Cummings’s movements in Durham and whether he broke the law. Less than an hour before his statement the Tory MP for the area said she hoped reports he had taken a day trip in her constituency were untrue. Dehenna Davison, the MP for Bishop Auckland, said if the rules had been broken “appropriate action should be taken”.Earlier, a number of senior clergymen issued stinging criticism of Mr Johnson’s defence of his chief aide. The Right Reverend Paul Butler, bishop of Durham, said the public’s trust had been “broken”. The Right Reverend Nick Baines, bishop of Leeds, tweeted: “The question now is: do we accept being lied to, patronised and treated by a PM as mugs?”Meanwhile, the Faculty of Public Health, which represents public health professionals, said the government’s response to Mr Cummings’s actions had  “undermined essential public health messaging”. It added that it supported “at the very least an inquiry into the matter”.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

There is no mixing and they aren’t touching each other,” Laurent David, the headteacher of the school near Nantes, tells The Independent. Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“They aren’t wearing masks, but they are following the orders very well, like using hand gel.” The students – aged between five and 11 years old – are experiencing school during the time of coronavirus. ​Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?As countries hit by coronavirus start making the first steps back towards normal life, children are returning to the classroom and parents back to work.In England, schools have been told to prepare for certain years to come back from 1 June, with the aim of all primary schools students returning for a month before the summer – a move which has faced criticism from unions and councils over safety concerns. Meanwhile in France, which has also been badly-affected by Covid-19, children were allowed back to school last week.Mr David says the Ecole elementaire la Metairie started teaching pupils aged five to 11 in school again on 12 May.“In the morning, we are bringing in around half of these children,” he says. “And during the afternoon, we are looking after the children who have stayed at home by doing distance teaching.”However, he says schools were under no obligation to open, and the Ecole elementaire la Metairie asked parents for their opinion first.

Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailSimilar to advice in England, schools have been told to limit class sizes to 15 children. This should be reduced to 10 for the youngest pupils in France. Although things have been going well, it gets much harder trying to get younger children to socially distance, Mr David explains. That is why lots of schools – including the preschool attached to his primary – have not yet brought children younger than five years old back into the classroom.He says other places have been bringing children back on alternate days, or even alternate weeks.“No school is working in the same way. The problem with making a six-year-old do a full day when they must stay at a table without moving around, is that becomes a very long day from them.”Mr David adds: “That makes teaching conditions very bad. Because of that, we decided to just open for mornings. It makes it easier, more effective for students, and more bearable.”However, he says it was difficult to balance the parents’ needs who were eager to return to work full time. He adds that schools have to follow health safety guidelines given to every headteacher, and the Ecole elementaire la Metairie​ decided the best way they could open safely was to offer half days for now. Included in the guidelines is what to do if a child displays symptoms: call the parents straight away, and get them tested.Last Thursday, a child from the primary school near Nantes had to be taken home after falling ill and is waiting for their test results.“If it is really coronavirus, we may have to shut the school or send a class home,“We don’t have any problem doing that,” he adds.France allowed preschools and primary schools to reopen from the start of last week, with secondary schools allowed to gradually welcome students back from 18 May – although these older students must wear face masks. ‘I don’t know’: Minister admits schools reopening up in the airMinisters under pressure to scrap plans to open schools to more pupilsParents also have the right to keep their children at home if they wish.When asked what advice Mr David had for headteachers in England working to reopen schools next month, he says it is important to be “well-prepared”.“It took us two weeks to prepare properly,” he says, adding they were ready to open on the first day.“The most important thing is to make decisions as early as possible.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Parents naturally worry their children are more vulnerable to any disease. It’s not so with coronavirus. Mums and dads should take confidence from that.And yet, defying the best impartial evidence available, the Left has terried Britain into a revolt. No, ing to school cannot be  per cent safe. What is, short of staying home forever hoping for a vaccine Meanwhile the lockdown damage to kids’ education, mental health and le chances is almost unimaginable.Corbynite NEU chief Mary Bousted cynically sneers: “It’s just descending into chaos now” before talking up the opposing claims of the so-called “Independent Sage Committee” and bemoaning the “confusion” for parents.Who caused this chaos and confusion  People like her. And this “Independent Sage Committee” is just a self-appointed club of hard-Left scientists motivated to sabotage the Brexit-backing Tories.Parents must not be taken in. The REAL Sage’s evidence is at least arrived at in good faith, not via political bias. Too many unprincipled Labour MPs are willing on these union wreckers.Aren’t they meant to be a more grown-up outfit now  So much for that.IT is good to see the PFA supporting seven gay footballers, two in the Premier League, who are too fearful of a public backlash to come out.We totally sympathise.But Covid gives them a unique breathing space to do so.There will be no barracking in empty stadiums. Social media can be ignored. And . per cent of the public won’t care or will applaud their courage.By the time football s in full, their sexuality will be old news — and any abusive bigot will get short shrt.Homophobia will be history one day. This would be a giant stride in that direction.IS the penny finally dropping for the EU Its UK ambassador admits Brussels must end its unreasonable demands over fishing to get a trade deal sorted. Quite so.

The shock will come when that scheme ends, bringing a new wave of unemployment — predicted by some to be in double digits by the end of the year.As a result, the tax that we rely on to pay for essential public ­services such as the NHS, police, teachers and even MPs dwindles catastrophically.This will put a colossal strain on government funds. One result will be a reduction in finance for public services — and never-ending cuts.The gloomiest assessment of our future is that we don’t need to worry about whether restaurants will reopen, or fear airlines going bust, because we won’t be able to afford to eat out or holiday anywhere.We will be working hard to stand still, which is a rotten position to be in.At the moment, the Government is paying the wages of ten million ­people and giving them loans to survive. That was and is the right thing to do.But the cost to the public — ­estimated to be £BILLION this year — will be vast. And it’s growing all the time.Whichever way you look at it, with lockdown we have swallowed a very poisonous pill. In fact, it may go down in history as the greatest act of self-harm any civilisation has ever inflicted upon itself.Yes, it has saved some people, although not enough of the elderly living in care homes.But we have created a financial burden on the country that will last a generation. The economy is in freefall. It contracted . per cent in March, which is the biggest decline on record. Forget a recession — some say we face a depression.Usually this means higher public borrowing, higher taxes and an end to triple-lock pensions.Whatever happens, let’s just say that Boris Johnson’s election pledge not to raise income tax, National Insurance contributions or VAT for five years is on thin ice.Butthe Government tries to cover this exceptional cost from the current economy we will crash — and we will all be worse off.Rather than start taxing everyone to the hilt, I can see a better solution — with interest rates at rock bottom levels, theGovernment should borrow the money instead, becausetaxes rise too quickly it will halt growth. And growth in the economy is the single most important step to recovery.So we need to borrow, and spread the debt over a long period of  to  years, like the old wartime bonds, to cover the short-term shortfall. If we borrow over a long enough period we could actually increase spending in the short term to incentivise growth.Andwe bounce back, we can pay off our debt more quickly.We just need to get out of lockdown to get this process started.Shops and businesses must open up and start trading again. And we have to get the schools open.People cannot worktheir kids are not in school or in high-quality childcare.If trains and buses are too crowded for people to get to work, we have to find other ways to travel, or work from homewe can.But, perhaps most importantly, we have to accept that this virus is here and it’s not going away.We have to protect the most vulnerable, and those at risk should remain in lockdown for their own safety.The rest of us must take responsibility for ourselves. We need to keep social distance, wear facemasks, wash our hands and stay at homewe have symptoms. We must not take risks.But the quicker people get back to work, the more the recession can be moderated — and we all have a part to play in that.AS proposals go, the one by the man who set out five sausages like fingers on a plate, with his grandmother’s ring on the fourth one, could have been more romantic.Although he also wrote, “Will you marry me ” in HP Sauce on some toast.Presumably this man understands his girlfriend well enough to know what she likes.And when she stopped laughing, I’m guessing she probably said yes.After all, it’s the thought that counts.THIS week, something wonderful happened.It was announced that Captain Tom Moore will be awarded a knighthood after raising a remarkable £million for NHS charities.Cpt Tom, who just turned  and has been promoted to honorary colonel, said on Good Morning Britain he is “thrilled that Her Majesty has chosen poor little me to be knighted”, adding: “It really is a great honour and something I never ever anticipated.“It never, ever entered my head that something like that could happen to me.”But this genuinely could not be more well-deserved.With all the misery we have had to endure over the past few months, this is a little ray of sunshine.Bravo again, Sir Tom.DID anyone  get the giggles at this picture, right, of the Russian nurse wearing only her undies beneath a transparent protective gown Hospital chiefs were not amused and ­punished the nurse for “non- compliance with the requirements for medical clothing”.ONE of the many revelations of lockdown is what a dferent place the House of Commons is without most MPs being there in person.There are far fewer places for people to hide without the armies of grown men and women braying and shouting over each other.As a result, a new type of order is prevailing.The Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, actually threatened to kick out Health Secretary Matt Hancock after he interrupted Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer at Prime Minister’s Questions.Hoyle treated Matt Hancock like a naughty schoolboy – which doesn’t feel right.But respect is earned and should be mutual.Perhaps one silver lining of lockdown will be a more respectful atmosphere in the Commons.I’VE been reflecting this week on what I’ve learned during the pandemic.Yes, I could share my theories here about human kindness and human idiocy, both of which have been on display in abundance over the past couple of months.Many of us have had time to think about what really matters and what doesn’t.We probably all have a mental list of things we most value from the “old” le, as well as silver linings and the benefits of the new way we have been living.But as we enter the ninth week of lockdownmy main conclusion, after a good deal of thought, is this: Women really do have superpowers.Most of the women I know are managing to . . . work from home, look after and home-school their children, cook and clean, shop for essentials, provide entertainment and keep up their family’s spirits, clap for carers and of course bake banana bread once a week.Now that’s what I call multi-tasking.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Iran, for example, has deployed a similar strategy.For years, we have known China censors what its people read and say online. Now we know authorities began censoring keywords and discussion of the outbreak weeks before its severity was acknowledged.Already in late December, doctors in Wuhan began to see patients suffering from an unusual pneumonia.Dr Li Wenliang,  who reported it to colleagues, was forced by police to sign a confession denouncing his communication as “illegal behaviour”.Dr Li later “died of the outbreak”.A number of critical journalists then went missing, along with Ren Zhiqiang, a well-known property tycoon critical of the regime.A month after his disappearance, China announced his official detention and investigation.Beijing is now saying that it will allow the WHO to visit for an investigation — but “not yet”.So how should we deal with China going forwards — especially since an inept, repressive officialdom has responded to international criticism with an aggressive misinformation campaign, completely misjudging the mood around the world China, as the world’s second-biggest economy, will remain an important export market for our goods and services.Even the Trump administration in the US does not want to close off a lucrative market for American farmers.It needs to abide by global rulesAs Trade Secretary, I tried to build a constructive relationship with my Chinese counterparts to help our businesses sell more to them and support jobs here.ButChina wants to be a partner in the global trading system, it needs to abide by global rules.This will be a major challenge as we face the inevitable task of reforming the World Trade Organization. When it comes to our national security, as The Sun on Sunday so clearly set out in recent weeks, we cannot afford to have it linked to other economic or political considerations.That is why I, along with a number of fellow MPs, voted against the Government’s plans to include Chinese tech firm Huawei in our G data network.China is at a crossroads and needs to decide whether it truly wants to become a partner in the global community or take the path to becoming a pariah state.That choice is in their hands. Our national security lies in ours.We all hope China will make the necessary reforms and take the right path.But hope is not a good basis for foreign policy. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

By doing this he has left himself open to claims that he behaves asthere is one law for him and one law for the rest of us.But his case is very dferent to those of Professor Neil Ferguson and Scotland’s chief medical officer, Catherine Calderwood, who both resigned after breaking lockdown.Professor Ferguson went to visit his married lover and Dr Calderwood enjoyed a break at her holiday home.Mr Cummings travelled to isolate himself and ensure the protection of his young son.

He cannot stay.There has to be some contrition from Boris too or he will spend the next ten weeks having to answer questions about it all.“This is not a bubble story. Real people are furious, because they have been doing the right thing and isolating.”A second minister added: “The test is simple: Is retaining Cummings a sign of strength or weakness  It’s increasingly looking like the latter.”It came as:Last night protesters gathered at Mr Cummings’ London home.Campaigners Led By Donkeys sent a van with a video message slamming the aide and PM.Earlier cops dispersed crowds at .pm and knocked on the door, with no answer.Mr Cummings admits making a -mile trip to County Durham last month after we Mary fell ill with Covid- symptoms.But he furiously denies breaching the lockdown he helped mastermind — saying he made the trip over childcare concerns.He has refused to answer claims he was spotted  miles from Durham at Barnard Castle on April  — another apparent breach of the rules not to take unnecessary journeys.He denies claims he made a second trip to Durham on April , five days after ing to work in No . A couple insist they saw him admiring bluebells at a beauty spot.MPs accused Boris of hypocrisy, making the Government look arrogant and elitist, and seriously undermining the lockdown message.One grandee, who has been very supportive to now, told The Sun: “It’s Boris’s ‘Nothing has changed’ moment. My emails are exploding with rage.”A Tory MP in a northern constituency said colleagues there were fuming at No .They told The Sun: “We are f****** livid. We cannot understand why the PM didn’t launch an inquiry to get to the facts.”Another Tory added: “Are we putting Dom Cummings before the R rate  It looks like it.”Another said: “I can only think Boris is just dependent on him, like a battery in a Duracell bunny.“If we don’t sort this the public will turn against us in a big way.”Boris refused to sayhe knew about Mr Cummings’ -mile trip orhe had sanctioned it.He also refused to answer whether ordinary Brits could leave their main residence for wherethey had childcare concerns.The PM did hint that there were some special circumstances that influenced Mr Cummings’ decision, but “for medical reasons I don’t want to go into it”.But Stephen Reicher, a government adviser on behavioural science, blasted: “In a few short minutes Boris Johnson has trashed all advice we have given on how to build trust and secure adherence to the measures.”It was reported last night that Mr Cummings’ uncle Lord Justice Laws died from Covid- while the aide was in Durham.Mr Cummings’ mother Morag told the New Statesman: “We have been a grieving family, and there’s been no recognition of that.”Earlier Tory MP Steve Baker savaged Mr Cummings in an online article and TV interview.He fumed: “It is very clear that Dominic travelled when everybody  understood Dominic’s slogans to mean ‘Stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives’.“And I think mums and dads who very much care about their children, and who have been forgoing the childcare of their extended family, will wonder why he has been allowed to do this.”Former minister Caroline Nokes warned there “cannot be one rule for most of us and wriggle room for others”.Sir Keir added: “This was a test of the Prime Minister and he has failed it. It is an insult to sacrices made by the British people.“The public will be forgiven for thinking there is one rule for the Prime Minister’s closest adviser and another for the British people.”Last night The Sun was told just three Tory MPs were defending No on their backbench Whats-App group — out of -plus.They were ex-party leader Iain Duncan Smith, Sheryll Murray and Andrew Mitchell.The PM is due to announce further lockdown easing this week.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Plenty in the private sector do too.Many parents, despite official scientic advice saying it is safe, say they will refuse totheir kids to school even though the PM has announced the first welcome reopenings on June  .Most people think the economy will right itself in a year or two and few seem bothered.They are more fixated on the furore over whether Dominic Cummings bent the lockdown rules to look after his child than with the looming catastrophe unless they are soon lted.This suicidal delusion is the result of a highly effective Government campaign about the Covid- threat, combined with generous bailouts, a promise of no new austerity and some great weather.Millions, including many Sun readers, have worked through the crisis. Millions more are itching to go back.Too many others, though, have been lulled into a disastrous  sense of security.We face an unprecedented recession. The economy has imploded.The Government had to borrow £billion in April, not far off half what Labour borrowed in a YEAR during the global financial crisis, leading to a decade of austerity.The initial trickle of job losses is already a flood and will soon be a tsunami.It falls to the PM or Rishi Sunak to explain to the nation in the starkest terms that unless we swtlyto near-normality, with public opinion onside, millions may never have a job toto. That this colossal new debt will take a generation to pay off.When the bailouts end and hardship bites, those who backed endless lockdown will not rue their own complacency. They will blame the Tories who failed to warn them how bad it would get.The Government also needs far more urgency over reopening shops, restaurants, pubs and travel — with social distancing — and a more realistic assessment of the tiny Covid risk to most people.The daily death toll, as heartbreaking as it still is, is falling fast. So are infections. The “R” rate, a virtually meaningless average distorted by care homes and hospitals, will be at or near zero in many places. One in  has the virus.Politicians and scientists are of course terried of causing new deaths. But over-caution could do so too, by impoverishing millions.

We discussed the national emergency arrangements for No., given his isolation and what I would do in No.  the next day.The next morning, I went to work as usual. I was in a succession of meetings about this emergency.I suddenly got a call from my we who was at home looking after our four year old child. She told me she suddenly felt badly ill. Shed vomited and felt like she might pass out. And therell be nobody to look after our child. None of our usual childcare options were available. They were alone in the house.After very briefly telling some officials in No. what had happened, I immediately left the building, ran to a car and drove home. This was reported by the media at the time who saw me run out of No. . After a couple of hours, my we felt a bit better. There were many critical things at work and she urged me toin the afternoon and I did.That evening, I ed home and discussed the situation with my we. She was ill. She might have Covid, though she did not have a cough or a fever. At this point, most of those who I work with most closely, including the prime minister himself and others who sit within  feet of me every day, either had had symptoms and had ed to work or were absent with symptoms. I thought there was a distinct probability that I had already caught the disease.I had a few conflicting thoughts in my mind. First, I was worried thatmy we and I were both seriously ill, possibly hospitalised, there was nobody in London that we could reasonably ask to look after our child and exposed themselves to Covid. My we had felt on the edge of not being able to look after him safely a few hours earlier. I was thinking, whatthe same or worse happens to me  Theres nobody here that I can reasonably ask to help. The regulations make clear, I believe the risks to the health of a small child were an exceptional situation, and I had a way of dealing with this that minimised risk to others.Second, I thought thatI did not develop symptoms, then I might be able toto work to help deal with the crisis. There were ongoing discussions about testing government staff in order to keep people like me working rather than isolating. At this point, on the Friday, advisers such as myself had not been included in the list of who were tested. But it was possible that this might change the following week. Therefore, I thought that after testing negative, I could continue working.In fact, this did not change and special advisers were not tested and I have never been tested. Third, there had been numerous  stories in the media about my actions and statements regarding Covid. In particular, there were stories suggesting that I had opposed lockdown and even then I did not care about many deaths. For years, I have warned of the dangers of pandemics. Last year I wrote about the possible threat of coronaviruses and the urgent need for planning. The truth is, that I had argued for lockdown. I did not oppose it. But these stories had created a very bad atmosphere around my home. I was subject to threats of violence. People came to my house shouting threats.There were posts on social media, encouraging attacks. There were many media reports on TV showing pictures of my house. I was also worried that given the severity of this emergency, this situation would get worse. And I was worried about the possibility of leaving my we and child at home all day and off into the night while I worked in No.. I thought the best thing to do in all the circumstances was to drive to an isolated cottage on my fathers farm. At this farm, my parents live in one house.My sister and her two children live in another house, and there was a separate cottage roughly  metres away from either of them. My tentative conclusion on the Friday evening was this:we are both unable to look after our child, then my sister or nieces can look after him. My nieces are  and . They are old enough to look after him, but also young enough to be in the safest category. And they had extremely kindly volunteered to do soneeded.But, I thought,I do not develop symptoms and there is a testing regime in place at work, I couldto workI tested negative. In that situation, I could leave my we and child behind in a safe place, safe in the form of support from family for shopping in emergencies, safe in the sense of being away from home which had become a target and also safe for everybody  because they were completely isolated on a farm and could not infect anybody.Contrary to some media reports, there are no neighbours in the normal sense of the word. The nearest other homes are roughly half a mile away. So in this scenario, I thought that they could stay there for a few weeks. I could go back to work, help colleagues and everybody, including the general public, would be safe.I did not ask the prime minister about this decision. He was ill himself and he had huge problems to deal with. Everyday, I have to exercise my judgement about things like this and decide what to discuss with him. I thought I would speak to him when the situation claried over coming days, including whether I had symptoms and whether there were tests available.Arguably, this was a mistake, and I understand that some will say that I shouldve spoken to the prime minister before deciding what to do. So I drove the three of us up to Durham last night, arriving roughly at midnight. I did not stop on the way. When I worked the next morning, Saturday the th of March, I was in pain and clearly had Covid symptoms, including a bad headache and a serious fever.Clearly, I could notto work any time soon. For a day or two, we were both ill. I was in bed. My we was ill, but not ill enough that she needed emergency help. I got worse. She got better. During the night of Thursday, the nd of April, my child woke up. He threw up and had a bad fever. He was very distressed. We took medical advice which was to call . An ambulance was sent, they assessed my child and said he must go to hospital.I could barely stand up. My we went with him in the ambulance. I stayed at home. He stayed the night in the hospital. In the morning, my we called to say that he had recovered, seemed back to normal. Doctors had tested him for Covid and said that they shouldhome. There were no taxis. I drove to the hospital, picked them up, then ed home.I did not leave the car or have any contact with anybody at any point on this short trip. The hospitals, I dont know what, roughly five miles or something away two miles, three miles four miles, something like that. A few days later, the hospital said that he tested negative. After I started to recover, one day in the second week, I tried to walk outside the house.At one point the three of us walked into woods owned by my father, next to the cottage that I was staying in. Some people saw us in these woods from a distance, but we had no interaction with them. We had not left the property. We were on private land. By Saturday, the th of April, I was still feeling weak and exhausted. But other than that, I had no Covid symptoms. I thought that Id be able toto work the following week, possibly part time.It was obvious that the situation was extremely serious. The Prime Minister had been gravely ill. Colleagues were dealing with huge problems and many were ill or isolating. I felt like I ought toto workpossible, given I was now recovering in order to relieve the intense strain at No. . That Saturday, I sought expert medical advice. I explained our familys symptoms and all the timings, and I askedit was safe toto work on Monday, Tuesday, seek child care and so on. I was told that it was safe and I couldto work and seek childcare.On Sunday  April,  days after I had first displayed symptoms, I decided toto work. My we was very worried, particularly given my eyesight seemed to have been affected by the disease. She didnt want to risk a nearly -mile drive with our child, given how ill I had been. We agreed that we should go for a short drive to seeI could drive safely. We drove for roughly half an hour and ended up on the outskirts of Barnard Castle town.We did not visit the castle. We did not walk around the town. We parked by a river. My we and I discussed the situation. We agreed that I could drive safely, we should turn around, go home. I felt a bit sick. We walked about  to  metres from the car to the river bank nearby. We sat there for about  minutes. We had no interactions with anybody. I felt better. We ed the car. An elderly gentleman walking nearby appeared to recognise me. My we wished him Happy Easter from a distance, but we had no other interaction.We headed home. On the way home, our child needed the toilet. He was in the back seat of the car. We pulled over to the side of the road, my we and child jumped out into the woods by the side of the road. They were briefly outside. I briefly joined them. They played for a little bit and then I got out of the car, went outside. We were briefly in the woods. We saw some people at a distance. But at no point did we break any social distancing rules. We then got back in the car and went home.We agreed thatI continued to improve then the next day, we shouldto London and I would go back to work. We ed to London on the evening of Monday  April, Easter Monday. I went back to work in No.  the next morning. At no point between arriving and leaving Durham did any of the three of us enter my parents house or my sisters house. Our only exchanges were shouted conversations at a distance. My sister shopped for us and left everything outside.In the last few days, there have been many media reports that I ed to Durham after  April. All these stories are . There is a particular report that I ed there on  April. Photos and data on my phone prove this to be . And local CCTV,it exists, would also prove that Im telling the truth that I was in London on that day. I was not in Durham.During this two-week period, my mothers brother died with Covid. There are media reports that this had some influence on my behaviour. These reports . This private matter did not affect my movements. None of us saw him. None of us attended his funeral. In this very complex situation, I tried to exercise my judgement the best I could.I believe that in all circumstances I behaved reasonably and legally, balancing the safety of my family and the extreme situation in No. and the public interest in effective government to which I could contribute.I was involved in decisions affecting millions of people, and I thought that I should try to help as much as I could do. I can understand that some people will argue that I should have stayed at my home in London throughout.I understand these views. I know the intense hardship and sacrice that the entire country has had to go through. However, I respectfully disagree. The legal rules inevitably do not cover all circumstances, including those that I found myself in. I thought and I think today that the rules, including those regarding small children in extreme circumstances, allowed me to exercise my judgement about the situation I found myself in, including the way that my London home had become a target and all the complexity of the situation.I accept, of course, that there is room for reasonable disagreement about this. I could also understand some people think I should not have driven at all anywhere.But I had taken medical expert medical advice. It was  days after symptoms. Id been told that I couldto work and employ childcare. I think it was reasonable and sensible to make a short journey before embarking on a five-hour drive to see whether I was in a fit state to do this. The alternative was to stay in Durham rather than going back to work and contributing to the governments efforts. I believe I made the right judgment, though I can understand that others may disagree with that.Ive explained all of the above to the Prime Minister. At some point during the first week where we were both sick and in bed, I mentioned to him what I had done. Unsurprisingly, given the condition we were in, neither of us remember the conversation in any detail. I did not make my movements public at the time because my London home was already a target. I did not believe that I was obliged to make my parents and my sisters home a target for harassment as well.I understand that millions of people have seen media coverage of this issue. I know that millions have endured awful hardship, including personal tragedies, over the past few months, and people are suffering every day. And I know the British people hate the idea of unfairness. I wanted to explain what I thought, what I did and why, over this period, because I think that people like me who helped to make the rules should be accountable for their actions.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They want Dom’s head on a skewer.In the last  weeks, nothing exemplies The Blob better than its handling of Coronavirus, the non-epidemic which has been allowed to drag this country into destitution.A public inquiry will examine precisely how this country stumbled unprepared into a predictable - and predicted - health emergency.The blame game is already under way.But it is already clear the NHS bureaucracy was caught flat-footed.Along with its blundering sidekick, Public Health England, it failed to provide frontline health staff - and likely Covid victims with the protection they deserved.Under pressure, the NHS panicked and made the decision to clear all beds for incoming coronavirus victims - while disastrously shunting elderly infected patients into care homes.PHE, the vast qango whose mission goal is to protect the nation from pandemics, failed abysmally to provide the testing needed as a first line of defence.Neither of these two bodies thought fit to build the necessary stockpile of Personal Protection Equipment, leaving frontline medical staff exposed to the virus.Meanwhile, along came Bonking Boffin Neil Ferguson who created Lockdown panic with fantasy claims of half a million likely dead - a figure no other scientist has supported.Indeed, highly qualied professionals including a Nobel prize-winning Stanford Professor of Chemistry, Michael Levitt, insist NO lives were saved by lockdown.Sunetra Gupta, Oxford Professor of Theoretical Epidemiology, says the UK death rate from Coronavirus is -in-a-, with Lockdown an unnecessary “luxury”.“I think there’s a chance we might have done better by doing nothing at all,” she says.Prof Gupta echoes a growing view that Britain couldto normal tomorrow, opening pubs, nightclubs and festivals, without putting lives needlessly at risk.“It is very dangerous to talk about lockdown without recognising the enormous costs that it has on other vulnerable sectors in the population.“The truth is that lockdown is a luxury, and it’s a luxury that the middle classes are enjoying and higher income countries are enjoying at the expense of the poor, the vulnerable and less developed countries.“It’s a very serious crisis.”Prof Gupta is describing those Sun readers who will bear the brunt of the looming economic crash.It is fair to say that but for “experts” like Ferguson - who has a long and costly history of disastrous predictions - Lockdown would have been lted sooner and with less economic pain.It is also true that while most people - including me - stuck rigidly to Downing Street rules, countless thousands have broken them by leaving home and visiting relatives.Yes, Cummings and his we - both hit by Coronavirus - broke the letter of the Lockdown law by driving their -year-old son  miles north to self-isolation in Durham.In the same circumstances I would have done the same and so, I suspect, would many readers whatever their political views.Some will rightly insist our leaders should do as they preach.Others will be appalled by the curtain twitching informers who raced to spill the beans.To his credit - and now his cost - Dominic Cummings has never worried about upsetting his critics.He has given his many enemies, some inside the Tory Party, the perfect stick to beat him with.We should be careful before joining in this vendetta against a man who in his own unique way has spoken so effectively for the British people.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I’m not.Eventhe enforcement is far from being perfect, it will still have a tremendous effect.According to the British Pub Association, four out of ten pubs are likely to cease to exist at the end of the crisis.Unlike many restaurants that can stay afloat selling takeaway food, pubs cannot generate income in lockdown.Anyone who says that short-term rationing of alcohol in pubs is not a price worth paying to get them to open up fast must have had one pint too many.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

After pressure from animal rights activists, the Dutch government banned new mink farms in  and said existing ones would have to close by .Animal rights campaigners from PETA Netherlands dressed in protective suits to urge Carola Schouten to bring forward the ban. The group claimed: Dirty fur farms full of sick, stressed and injured minks are breeding grounds for diseases.Mink are not the only animals to have contracted the killer bug.Big cats at the Bronx Zoo in New York City came down with coronavirus in April.The animals were tested after a four-year-old Malayan tiger called Nadia started coughing last month and was later confirmed to have been struck down.But there has been a lot of confusion over whether pets can catch or carry coronavirus.During the early stages of the outbreak, scientists and government officials initially confirmed that it wasnt possible.However, several dogs and a cat tested positive for Covid- following close contact with infected humans, according to the World Organisation for Animal Health.On April , the World Organisation for Animal Health said: Now that Covid- virus infections are widely distributed in the human population there is a possibility for some animals to become infected through close contact with infected humans. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I’m good at what I do.”Do  DO  I wasn’t aware, until this series started, that Joey DID anything, but it turns out he’s spent half a letime ­prepping for SAS: Who Dares Wins.For as well as being surprisingly likeable, the guy’s also insanely fit — to an extent that clearly tormented professional athlete Lauren Steadman and suggested Joey could’ve had an amazing military careerhe wasn’t, in the words of one SAS interrogator, “poncing about on TV telling everyone what he f***ing had for breakfast”.Apart from “the naughtiest blisters ever”, Joey had breezed through every section of the C show, until the finale when “escape and evasion” gave way to the interrogation phase that’s designed to “prepare the recruits for enemy capture”.Who the hell was going to want to capture Joey Essex, outside of the Celebrity First Dates booking office, wasn’t explained, and it doesn’t even do to ask such questions of SAS: WDW as the whole thing will unravelyou start pulling at those threads.It’s always best just to enjoy the entertainment, which involved giving Joey and the other five finalists the cover story that they were working for the Scottish Highland Mountain Rescue Board.The trouble with giving Joey a cover story, it emerged, was that it dislodged every other piece of information he’d ever learned from his brain.Key to surviving this task, as they’d all been instructed, was to drip-feed the truth back to “Dilksy”, the monstrous great slaphead who always appears at this point, and his fellow interrogators.Whether they locked him in a cage, dunked him in water or threatened to kiss him, though, Joey just kept denying everything and repeating the story.With the clock ticking, something had to give and eventually it did, after the entire SAS: WDW team had concluded, more in sorrow than anything : “He’s not even playing the village idiot, he’s trying hard not to be.”The end, when it finally came, was a bit of an anti-climax.Joey just sloped off, in a bit of a huff.Helen Skelton and Nikki Sanderson quickly followed and the winners were declared to be DJ Locksmith and Lauren Steadman.A worthy choice, even though some of us were still probably trying to work out how she made it through the drown-proofing task“no allowances are made”.If you take this show too seriously, though, you’ll miss the joy and point of SAS: WDW.It’s not offering contestants a fast-track into the SAS any more than Harry’s Heroes will form the spine of the next England squad.The reasons the show deserves to be put on a pedestal are its extraordinary entertainment value and the fact it’s proved, to my complete satisfaction, that Joey Essex isn’t putting anything on. He really is a total dingwad.Progress, people.GREAT TV lies and delusions of the month.

You’re helping to tackle loneliness and isolation. You’re providing meals to people that cannot leave home. You’re helping fund projects that support physical and mental health in communities across the entire nation.We’re facing exceptional times brought about by the coronavirus pandemic.But thanks to you, £ million of funding from The National Lottery is being distributed over the next few months to charities, projects and good causes. This vital funding has helped hundreds of key projects continue to offer support to people in our communities.  One of those to benefit is Northern Ireland’s Macular Society, which helps people struggling with their sight due to macular degeneration. They provide peer support, counselling, help, advice and many other services to members. The charity received an additional £, grant from The National Lottery to adapt and increase support for people remotely during lockdown. Elaine Orwinhas been involved with the charity for  years. The -year-old said: Macular disease affects your physical health. You often can’t drive so lose your independence, but our group of  members is a leline. We used to meet monthly, but since lockdown it’s fortnightly virtual meetings, and I’ve also referred people for phone counselling. The contact we have had is really precious.  The charity is planning to launch a befriending service and webinars, and they’ve also run a Tech Talk project, helping members to use computers and even just access audio description on their TVs. It’s really important for us to thank National Lottery players, as without them none of this would be possible. Another project to receive funding is Leicester’s Emerald Centre, which supports vulnerable people of all ages, including elderly residents and those with disabilities, in a deprived area of the city.  Chris Murphy , , who lives alone, says the charity has kept him in touch with friends during this dficult time. He explained: The centre has been bringing me a food parcel every week. They stop for a chat when it’s delivered and phone to check I’m okay. I love working in my garden so they’ve sent me bits for that, and there’s also been activity packs and books I’ve borrowed from them. It’s all keeping me busy! It’s great that people are playing The National Lottery and helping us. Merthyr Tydfil’s Twyn Community Hubhas also received support, with a £, grant from The National Lottery to expand their daily hot meals and weekly hamper project during lockdown. The charity helps families and vulnerable, older people, with everything from weekly food parcels to organising bingo nights and quizzes.  Jean Jonesis someone who benefits regularly from their work. The -year-old said: I’ve been going to events including bingo at Twyn Community Hub since moving here nearly six years ago, and throughout lockdown staff and volunteers have been popping round most days to deliver food, and have a chat. I’m lucky in that I phone friends and family, but other older people in the area would see no one otherwise. The meals and food they provide are fabulous. Being able to take away the worry about small, practical, everyday things is so important. Thanks to people playing The National Lottery that is happening right here in our local area. Itaposs thanks to National Lottery players, as well as the people who run these vital services, that these sorts of charities and local projects have been able to continue offering support to the most vulnerable people in our communities.

So thanks to Downing Street for taking me back to my childhood and putting on Carry On Bullsh*tting. That sketch about testing your eyes for a long drive by going for a longish one with your four-year-old in the car was cracking. But the longer this excruciating exhibition of detachedness from reality went on, the less funny it was. The interview was a Prince Andrew-style car crash. And the sight of Cummings sucking in all the political oxygen due to breaking lockdown rules we had all been sticking to, on a day when we were waiting to hear from the Prime Minister when we could start to dismantle them, was a national disgrace. His contempt for the Little People was evident from the off when he turned up more than half an hour late. It continued when he kept answering questions by saying “with great respect” when his face was sneering at the reporter he was supposedly respecting. The haughty disdain continued when he read out what sounded like an Enid Blyton story called Three Go For A Pee In The Woods. It read like a litany of excuses we’ve all heard given in school as teachers howled in disbelief.  Any moment I expected him to say he only drove to Durham because the cat peed on his satnav. It was a tale in which he admitted multiple breaches of rules he helped draw up but he could not possibly apologise because it was all the media’s fault.

In a highly unusual press conference in the rose garden of  Downing Street, the Prime Ministeraposs chief adviser said he made the journey because of fears over a lack of childcarehe became incapacitated with the virus, and concerns about his familyaposs safety. Mr Cummings said he was worried thatboth he and his we fell ill, there was nobody in London we could reasonably ask to look after our child and expose themselves to Covid. Body language expert Judi James has studied the footage of Cummingsapos unusual statement and QA. There had been debate about how the man often seen as the Maverick of Downing Street and a guy who doesn’t suffer fools gladly might decide how to perform his message today in the wake of his boss Boris’s ‘making a bad situation worse’ press statement of the day before. For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, click here The Cummings we saw appeared very much to play against type. Almost humble in his arrival he sat at a table wearing a bland white shirt rather than his signature Islington grunge and his weak, soft-sounding voice as he apologized for being late plus the way he then sat shuffling and arranging his notes across his table for a considerableof time suggested a man beset by nerves. He leaned forward on his elbows to self-diminish his frame in what looked like a non-confrontational and even modest approach. He scratched his arm, he licked at his lips and he read word-from-word from his script as he told his tale in detail. His knee-splay suggested some of his boss’s love of machismo but his feet were crossed at the ankle, hinting at some repression of anything resembling arrogance or confrontation. His eyes were either on his notes or they were darting as he picked at his pen and the way he picked his papers up and banged them hard on the table suggested he was keen to be off, as did his left leg which appeared to be making an early break for the exit at one point. His stuttering as he answered questions did suggest some struggles under pressure but verbally he stuck stubbornly to a line of ‘no regrets’.

The National Pharmacy Association has written to Boris Johnson asking for help as its members face an unprecedented crisis triggered by the outbreak.The sector was handed a £million advanced payment to cope with Covid-, with £million paid on April  and £million at the start of this month. But announcing the cash, the Department of Health stressed the cash was not extra money. It said: “This uplt is not an additional funding over and above what was agreed for   under the Community Pharmacy Contractual Framework -year deal. The uplt will be reconciled in  .”  In a letter to the PM, seen by the Mirror, the NPA warned Mr Johnson last night: “Pharmacies are under huge financial and operational pressures due to Covid-.” It says there is “trepidation across the sector” at having to repay the cash. The letter goes on: Local pharmacies have incurred considerable costs for staying open throughout the coronavirus crisis, including large increases in staff and medicine costs, outlays for security, PPE and deliveries. “A special Covid- payment to cover these exceptional costs would help provide the financial stability that we need to keep our doors open.”  NPA chief executive Mark Lyonette told the Mirror: “Financially speaking, many pharmacies would have been better offtheyaposd closed their doors to the public altogether throughout much of March and April and things remain very tight. “But, as caring health care professionals, they have kept the doors open – often at considerable personal cost. “Pharmacists are acutely aware that they are the frontline of the nationaposs response to coronavirus and are bearing a heavy burden in order to keep people safe and well.” "},{"url":null,"title":"shops reopen june 1 june","story":"NewsWhich shops will reopen on June  and June  -

The £ bill works out at £. a day – just p more than a large Big Mac meal in McDonald’s. The bargain end-terrace property has been listed to let in the proud former mining village of Horden, Co Durham. Experts believe it is the cheapest family home to rent in the UK for many years. The “spacious” double-glazed property, just a short stroll from a beach and near two schools, features two double bedrooms, fitted bathroom and two reception rooms. The s home is a whopping  per cent cheaper than the average £,-a-month cost of a two-bed property in London’s exclusive Mayfair. But some locals issued a warning to would-be tenants that certain streets in the village were plagued with Asbo yobs. Former primary school teacher Doug Langan, , said: “There is a lot to like about Horden. There’s a great community spirit and it’s right on the coast.”  But he added of the area where the house stands: “Some of the houses are owned by retired miners who have been there  years but others have gone to rack and ruin. £ is cheap but you will get what you pay for.” Fth Street, just  yards from Durham’s Heritage Coast, has proved a hit with ­families searching for a budget base. The low-cost let could even be popular with commuters in larger towns able to work from home and looking to save a fortune. Graeme Wetherell, , who moved to Horden aged ten, said: “Strangers from other parts of the country have moved here because it is so cheap.

But there was little sign of people sticking to social distancing rules at heaving beaches in Brighton, Bournemouth and Essex. Temperatures were already pushing C by am this morning as forecasters predicted London would be hotter than Barcelona or Athens by the afternoon.Some fear that the warm weather could cause the lockdown to collapse following revelations about Dominic Cummingsapos -mile roadtrip during the lockdown.Last night Boris Johnson defended his aide over a trip that he had made with his we and son to visit his parents to Durham.Many expressed outrage at the revelations which led to accusations of double standards and calls for Cummingsapos resignation. Russell Martin tweeted: So are you telling us that the lockdown is now officially over and we can do whatever we like whenever we like  BecauseDominic Cummings can break the rules with impunity, the rest of us can too.   Community Safety officers patrolled the beach in Southend-on-Sea, Essex, to try and enforce social distancing measures.  Elsewhere, cars were parked bumper to bumper on a packed Camber Sands on the Kent coast and Bournemouth beach in Dorset. Pictures from Kent showed Botany Bay and Margate Main Sands rammed with beach goers. Residents complained of a aposstrong smell of urineapos due to a lack of facilities at those locations, Kent Live reported. The beach at Weston-super-Mare in north Somerset was also packed with revellers. Officers in Hillingdon, northwest London, begged the public to use aposcommon senseapos after pictures emerged of large groups at Ruislip Lido. Other pictures showed families enjoying a picnic on benches in Cannizzaro Park Wimbledon Village in South West London.Liverpool councillor Nina Killen wrote on Twitter : Reports of cars parked illegally at Formby coast today. Many people say theyaposre happy to pay £ fine.Apparently this canapost be increased as a deterrent as it is in legislation. Formby car parks are full. Please do not travel to the Formby coast today. The Met Office said temperatures should reach as high as C in London, with C expected in Newcastle, C in Edinburgh and Belfast and C in Southampton. It comes as Durhamaposs acting police and crime commissioner, Steve White, said there was a plethora of additional information which deserved appropriate examination. He said he has written to Durham policeaposs chief constable asking her to establish the facts concerning any potential breach of the law or regulations in this matter.  Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is chairing a Cabinet meeting where ministers are expected to discuss the easing of restrictions for certain sectors of the economy, including the reopening of some non-essential shops. It follows confirmation that the phased reopening of Englandaposs primary schools will commence on June . Mr Cummingsapos actions have sparked fury among some MPs, and led to warnings that he has undermined efforts to fight coronavirus. Professor Stephen Reicher, a member of the Governmentaposs advisory group on behavioural science, told ITVaposs Good Morning Britain: If you look at the research it shows the reason why people observed lockdown was not for themselves, it wasnapost because they were personally at risk, they did it for the community, they did it because of a sense of aposweaposre all in this togetherapos.  If you give the impression thereaposs one rule for them and one rule for us you fatally undermine that sense of aposweaposre all in this togetherapos and you undermine adherence to the forms of behaviour which have got us through this crisis. Gloucestershireaposs independent police and crime commissioner Martin Surl said Mr Cummingsapos actions made a mockery of police enforcement earlier in the lockdown.

Anthony Igoe was hospitalised with a serious lung infection but medics in the south-east Asian country have told him he must pay for the antibiotics himself. The -year-oldaposs family, from Clydebank, Dunbartonshire, Scotland, are scrambling to raise the cash or doctors will simply remove the infected lung. Girlfriend Alana Fonseca, , who has been by Anthony’s bedside since he fell ill has pleaded with anyone who can to please help us - with her partner too sick to fly home.She told the Daily Record : “If I could, I would have brought him home to Scotland but he is not allowed to fly.We have literally been told the doctors at the public hospital will have to remove Anthony’s lung because the drugs he needs are too expensivewe can’t pay for them.” Dad Jerry, , meanwhile, is lost for words and suffering sleepless nights thinking about his sonaposs ordeal. “My guts are in knots, he admitted. I wake up in the middle of the night and it feels asI have been eating a ton of ice. “I have no real words to say how it feels to have a son in hospital and be unable to get to him. Jerry added Anthonyaposs sister Andrea is in Australia and is doing what she can from there to help too”, before echoing Alanaaposs plea in begging Brits to please help as much as you can.  Anthony picked up two bacterial infections in Cambodia. His insurance firm, Cigna, are refusing to pay for his treatment because they say he was already suffering from the lung condition when he took out a policy in February. The first indication Anthony was ill was in January when he started coughing and getting chest pains. He was given antibiotics by doctors in Cambodia. In March, Anthony began to feel poorly again – and his health has gone downhill due to the lung ­infection. Alana said: “He was warm to the touch and one day in school he lay down on the floor and said, ‘I can’t do this.’ It was the first indication he was so sick. “He just got worse and his fever wasn’t going away. The last week in April he was really bad. He had lost  kilos in a month.” Alana took him to hospital where he was taken to intensive care. She said: “This is when we realised things were really bad. I feel so guilty I didn’t get him to hospital before.” After tests, it was found he’d picked up two bacteria. One has led to an abscess in his lung – causing permanent damage – while the other led to pneumonia. Alana added: “He needs to be in hospital for at least another week on very strong intravenous ­antibiotics and then he will need between eight months of strong oral antibiotics as well as X-rays.

Katherine Jablonowska, , and Ryan Mclean, , first purchased the property in  and began the slow renovation process. After two years of laborious -hours days, the couple have finally transformed the once tired and old-fashioned property into a luxurious peaceful home. But now theyaposre looking to sell the home in a competition in a bid to raise money for charity. The cottage can be found in North Wales, on the Ll n Peninsula, just on the outskirts of the idyllic Snowdonia National Park. It was originally built in the early s and was a traditional working barn before it was converted into a family home. Now the property boasts a dining area which leads on to a bespoke kitchen, as well as two good-sized double bedrooms, both of which have stunning views as well as one bathroom.  The couple called the two-year renovation a wonderful experience as they look back on their progress, but Ryan admits: Itaposs been quite the journey.It took approximately  months. It was long, hard days - from am to pm. It was very much a hands-on project. The bathroom was completely ripped out and now features a luxurious roll-top bath with a built-in shower overhead.  And the living space undertook one of the biggest transformations as the pair brought the fire places to le, adding a television to one alcove and small fire heater to the other. Ryan said: It started off as a working barn so we tried to keep a few of those features, the ones that were hidden when we bought it. We got a lot of ideas from Instagram and YouTube. Thereaposs a big renovating community - the amount of people willing to share ideas.  Chef Ryan and hospitality manager Katherine took on part-time jobs in the local area to supplement their incomes while they carried out the renovation. He added: Two years ago, we decided to take a break from it all to do this. It turned out to be exactly what we needed. But we had some idea of what we were doing. I did come at this with a decent amount of experience. We definitely donapost want to give the impression that this kind of renovation is really easy!  And one of the most beautul areas of the house is the landscape it backs onto. A small patio area overlooks miles of picturesque rolling hills - the perfect place to enjoy a meal in the summertime.  Katherine said: The idea was in the back of our minds for a few years. We had come across raffles in the news every now and then. We thought: aposThataposs a good ideaapos.

They said they were annoyed the van came and encouraged people to risk their lives. However the company that runs the van said they followed all the rules and that when officers tuned up they had aposno problemapos with the measures they had taken to comply with regulations. This is yet to be confirmed by police.  Another witness, who was walking in the area at the time, said he couldnapost’ believe what he was seeing.Speaking to North Wales Live, said: “I was going for a walk through Cibyn at about .pm, and I saw a load of cars queuing and people walking in groups.“As I turned the corner, I could see the queue went all the way down the road and back up again. “There was a long queue of people on foot as well. There was social distancing towards the end of the queue, but the closer people were to the van, the closer they were together.  “I thought they must have been giving them out for free judging by the amount of people there, but I heard people were paying for them. I honestly couldn’t believe that people were doing this. It was really surreal. I can’t get my head around it. “I’m annoyed more than anything that people would do it. “It shouldn’t have been there. It’s encouraging non-essential travel.”  North Wales Events and Catering Services, who run the Tango Ice Blast van, said they acted within the rules and chose the estate because it is “out of town” and “less likely” to attract walkers. The Welsh Government has advised people to stay home and only travel when absolutely necessary.One person wrote on Facebook : “What a thing to do when we are in lockdown encouraging people to go out for non-essential reasons, appalling.”Another called it a disgrace” and said: “No wonder the numbers of covid in Gwynedd is not coming down.  It was also reported on social media that police were called to move the van on in Bangor on Friday, after traffic became “gridlocked” as a result of long queues. However, one user on social media defended the Ice Blast van. They wrote: “For all you slating them they are trying to do something nice in lockdown and the council approved for them to be there. “Yes more social distancing measures should be put in place but maybe check first before you all put your two pence in and slate a business.”  However, another wrote: “What is wrong with people. We have the highest cases in North Wales and all these queuing for a slush, it’s totally wrong.” North Wales Events and Catering Services said: “Many food outlets are reopening now with measures put in place to work in a safe manner not only for the employees but also for the customers. “From experiencewe work in the centre of a town this can create a number of walking customers. Thataposs why we used the Cibyn Industrial Estate, out of the town centre and less likely to attract lots of walk-ins “However those that do walk to the site are reminded of our m distance constantly by our staff who attempt to marshal the queues to the best of our ability and we have measures put in place to ensure there is a m gap.

Lara Green, , is a key worker and still spending time in proximity with others amid the coronavirus pandemic. When the government suggested vulnerable people should shield at home from March, the mum-of-three made the heartbreaking decision to send severely asthmatic daughter Katie to self-isolate with her grandma Helen for  weeks. But after noticing -year-old Katie had been feeling homesick, Lara constructed a shower curtain with arms by tightly taping clear refuse bags through holes in the plastic curtain. After weeks apart, the mum decided to secretly surprise Katie and Helen, , with her creation on Monday. She captured the tear-jerking moment on camera to look back on when she can eventually reunite with her daughter properly. Lara, from Medway, Kent, said: Katie went into isolation with my mum nine weeks ago because she has severe asthma - when she catches a cold, nine times out of  sheaposll end up in hospital on oxygen and it takes a few days for her to get better. My mum also has underlying health issues so when the government announced that vulnerable people should self-isolate and I really didnapost want her and Katie to catch coronavirus. It was really hard but I had to make the decision for her to stay with my mum because Iaposm a key worker in a pre-school and still going out to do food shopping, so thereaposs a chance of it getting into the house.  Iaposve never been apart from my daughter until now, and I have high and low days but recently Katie went on a bit of a dip and really wanted to come home. While Iaposd go to see Katie and my mum through the window or at the end of their garden, itaposs not the same as a cuddle. Iaposm very cuddly with my children so to not cuddle Katie for nine weeks or even be near her was so hard - you really start to miss the little things.  So, I thought Iaposd give making a cuddle curtain a try. As soon as Katie held my hands through the curtain I was gone - it was the touch and feeling the heat of her hands that was amazing. You could have bought me a million pound present and nothing could have come close to that moment - Iaposll never take a cuddle for granted again.Lara ordered a thick plastic shower curtain for £. from Amazon and cut out six slots as arm holes before attaching clear refuse bags to them, and taping any gaps so it was as protected as possible. Not wanting to leave it any longer, Lara disinfected the curtain and visited her mumaposs house earlier this week to surprise her by attaching it to the front door. Lara said: I was crying my eyes out when making the curtain but when my mum askedI was alright I just said I was feeling a bit emotional.As soon as it was all ready, I told them to have their gloves and masks on and open the front door carefully. I was so nervous because I was worried it wouldnapost work and would jeopardise the moment - as soon as Katie was standing there she was shaking too because she didnapost know what it was yet. When Lara shared the moving moment on Facebook, it unexpectedly went viral - racking up more than , views. She has now begun planning her next cuddle curtain construction for next weekaposs visit, which will be new and improved with stronger tape for a longer embrace with her mum and daughter. Lara added: I FaceTimed Katie the day after and she was all bouncy and mum said she woke up in a really good mood - she is constantly talking about the cuddle curtain, saying she really enjoyed it.

Scientists behind Boots’ own label No  Advanced Retinol .% Complex Night Concentrate claim it hits the “sweet spot” to reduce lines and give older skin “bounce”. The lotion uses retinol, which is said to increase cell renewal encouraging new skin to form. But skin experts say while known for skin-boosting properties, it can cause irritation. Jemma McBride of leading brand Kiehl’s said: “Retinol - or Vitamin A - is a potent ingredient that must be used with caution as it [can] aggravate the skin.”  Website  skinregimen  added: “Because retinol is such a powerful ingredient, it’s best to start out by using it twice a week, before building up to everyday use and stronger formulations.”But the Boots team claim their latest formula has overcome potential problems and “delivers maximum results with minimal irritation”. It reckons users will notice “results after one night”. The chain’s head of science research Dr Mike Bell worked with a team from Manchester University to perfect the formula thathas seen unprecedented demand before hitting shelves. Dr Bell insisted: “This is set to be a game-changer for millions of women who want to transform the appearance of their skin.”The same team created Boots’ No  Protect  Perfect Serum which sold out within minutes in  after being featured on the BBC’s Horizon programme.

Temperatures got close to C in and around London on Monday, with forecasters predicting highs of C for Tuesday.Aside from some rain in the far north and north-west on Wednesday, most parts of the country will be dry, largely sunny, and very warm for the rest of the week, the Met Office said. BBC meteorologist Ben Rich said high pressure is firmly in charge of the weatherthrough to the weekend, with a frontal system only likely to bring cloud and patchy rain to parts of Northern Ireland and Scotland.For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE.  More and more of us will get into some very warm air for the end of the week, temperatures widely up into the s very little rain in the forecast, he added. And despite the lockdown easing, people are being reminded to practise social distancing with the fine weather tempting Britons outside. Crowds flocked to beauty spots on Bank Holiday Monday, raising concerns in some areas.  Police were called to a lido in north London amid reports of one large group gathering, while people were also warned not to overcrowd beaches as sunseekers made the most of the fine weather. With schools in England, Scotland and Wales on a half-term break this week, large numbers of people are expected to emerge from lockdown amid warm conditions. There will be more warm weather in the south, where hundreds of people took to Bournemouth beach on Monday, prompting a tweet from the local council reminding people there were other less busy but equally lovely open spaces to enjoy.  A week after the relaxation of guidelines to allow people to visit beauty spots in England, the Government and the police have urged people to continue to follow social distancing guidelines. Please use common sense when it comes to social distancing, the politan Policeaposs Hillingdon branch tweeted. Apart from crowds at beaches on Monday, long stretches of traffic were also seen at the Yorkshire Dales, while walkers were also out enjoying the grounds of Windsor Castle.While new cases and deaths from coronavirus have fallen nationally, a hospital in Somerset was forced to close this weekend due to a high number of Covid- patients.Weston General Hospital, in Weston-super-Mare, stopped accepting new admissions, including into its AE department from am on Monday.

We are so thankful for VSA.#VSA has launched an appeal for funding to help it continue to deliver its services throughout the lockdown period.And the man urged anyone who can to dig deep and help the charity.He said: “VSA needs as much financial support as it can get because they are doing all these things and helping so many people like me and my we.“At the moment there is no money coming in for them so it’s really important people support the charitythey can.”To support VSA, visit vsa.org.ukFor as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2020/05/laurence-findlay-806x564.jpg ","title":"north east council chief sets out authoritys plan to get schools up and running","story":"All children will have the opportunity toto school in some form after lockdown, a north-east education chief has revealed.The Covid- crisis threw schools into chaos earlier this year, with pupils and staff forced to adapt to learning and teaching from home.However, last week the Scottish Government announced its aim of pupils ing to the classroom from August,it is safe to do so.And now Aberdeenshire Council#s director of education and children#s services, Laurence Findlay, has set out how the local authority plans to get youngsters back to school.He admitted the council is facing challenges in ensuring social distancing is maintained, and revealed a raft of new measures are being considered.These include taping off desks, installing one-way systems and incorporating hygiene-based activities into the school day.Pupils# start, finish and break times could also be staggered, and a #blended# learning model introduced # meaning they study at school for part of the time and learn from home for the remainder.Mr Findlay said: “The picture is starting to emerge. We’re aware we will potentially be able to let teachers back into schools at some point in Junethe scientic and medical advice says it’s safe.“From August, we can then start bringing groups of learners back. It won’t be a normal school experience as people remember it from before. There will be small groups coming in, social distancing, extra hygiene, health and safety measures. It will be very much a blended approach to learning and we will also still be providing childcare for the children of key workers.“We are not going back to the way things were on March  but the roadmap sets out a very clear direction, providing the medical and scientic advice says it’s safe to do so. Our planning for that has already started and we will be working closely with head teachers, staff and trade union colleagues – teaching and non-teaching – over the coming weeks. We are aiming for some kind of approved provision from August.“We are considering a range of measures to put in place, for example there could be staggered start and finish times and staggered lunch times to minimise the number of people circulating at any one time. We will look at putting one-way systems in place in our larger schools so there’s less congestion in the corridors. In inidual classrooms we will remove furniture where we have space to store it, and where we haven’t we will tape off every other table.“There will be clear signage and markings in place and we will have hand-washing and hygiene activities built into the school day. We will continue to communicate with young people and parents about the importance of social distancing.“For those who have specic additional support needs, we will ensure appropriate risk assessments are carried out. We will do everything we can to use all the facilities we have to promote social distancing and make sure that remains firmly in place.#However, Mr Findlay admitted a single policy will not suit every school in the region # so council staff are working around the clock to come up with inidual plans for each one.He said: “We have got over  schools in Aberdeenshire – some are very large and some are very small. Some have closed classrooms, some are open-plan and some are a mixture of the two so there won’t be a one-size-fits-all approach. There will have to be bespoke plans for every school and we will work with our head teachers to do that, based on the type of school, the school roll and the availability of staff what configuration would be best.“At some schools, it may be whole days and in some it may be half. It may be based on rotas over a fortnight. All that will be worked out over the next couple of months as we head towards summer and as we get more and more accurate advice and data from government.“In some schools, it will be quite easy to have a lot of children in at the same time but in larger schools it will be done very much by year group. We will also do what we can, although we can’t guarantee it, to keep family groups together because that makes it easier in terms of transportation and the notion of a social bubble. These are things which are being actively planned just now.“We want to ensure a blended approach for all children so they all get an experience of being back in school.#Given the rurality of much of Aberdeenshire, Mr Findlay highlighted transport to and from school as being a potential problem # and the council is expecting guidance on how to get pupils there and home again.He said: #Transport will be a signicant issue for us given our rurality and the size of Aberdeenshire.“We are expecting further advice and guidance this week on school transport so we will wait and see what that says and then bring our transport colleagues at the council into the planning to see what we can offer.#The Scottish Government#s restart date also threw up a potential issue for the council as schools across the north-east were scheduled tofrom the summer holidays on August .That could have created a headache with staff having to forgo a week of their break # but Mr Findlay insisted they will be repaid.He said: “We have been told we will get advice from the Scottish Negotiating Committee for Teachers, which oversees their terms and conditions. They are going to provide advice on when that extra week should be taken.#That will be given to the Local Negotiating Committee for Teachers, and we will work on the advice we are given to ensure that week is given back at some point through the school year.”Since the UK went into lockdown at the end of March, staff have been working tirelessly to implement distance and digital learning for pupils to make sure they do not miss out on their education.They have also staffed childcare set up for the children of key workers, at which attendance figures have risen by a third during the lockdown period.And Mr Findlay paid tribute to the teachers, assistants and council workers for their efforts in keeping the education system running.He said: “It’s fair to say it’s been a busy few weeks and we have barely stopped.“There have been ious aspects to it. We have had our home learning online which has gone really well.“Teachers have been providing material online and then checking in on learners to see the progress they are making. They have also been supporting parents as much as they can to help learning at home.“That has been one big part of our work. Another part has been around childcare hubs. We have set up  hubs across Aberdeenshire – one in each locality for the children of key workers and vulnerable children.“That’s gone well. We started off with quite a low turnout of about  children a day but we are now up to more than  attending so that has been positive. We have also been providing free school lunches by direct payments to parents on a monthly basis which has been going well too.“A lot of work was required in a short period of time to get these things set up but it has been going well.“We owe a huge debt of gratitude to all the staff across Aberdeenshire because they have really stepped up to the plate. They have put in a lot of hours and showed great creativity, agility and imagination to adapt to their new way of working.#He added: “It’s amazing that in  weeks we have made all this happen. Some of the stuff around digital and remote learning has been talked about for years and there’s been some with mixed success, but when a crisis has come along people have stepped up and made it happen very quickly so we owe them a huge debt of gratitude.“Teams of staff have been working round the clock to get things ready at home, in the schools and childcare hubs and also centrally. People have been putting in the hours to make this work.#The Aberdeenshire branch of teachers# union the EIS revealed it has set out requirements to be met before it can be deemed safe to reopen.It says there must be evidence of capacity to test, trace and isolate on a national level, while measures must be introduced to ensure social distancing, hygiene measures and continuing risk-assessment.And it called for transparent and shared evidence that the spread of the infection is under control and that schools are safe workspaces.Aberdeenshire branch secretary David Smith said: #Any proposed measures in Aberdeenshire will be subject to those red lines but to date, there has been open and transparent dialogue with ourselves via the LNCT forum on a regular basis on the above and in relation to blended learning, which will require continuing dialogue around how this will look and resourced in terms of staffing, as our members cannot be teaching full time and providing home learning activities.#We await further national guidance on this issue to facilitate further positive local discussion, which has always been a feature of how we conduct business in Aberdeenshire. Such discussions are likely to increase in frequency over the coming days reflecting the level of activity around these issues currently.#The EIS will continue to provide advice for members and also intend to issue training modules for our school reps to assist with theprocess.#There will also be a national steer on the holiday adjustment issues from SNCT which will inform local negotiations at LNCT on how this will look locally.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53879706-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53879706-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53879706-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53879706-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"north east councils local development plan consulation now open","story":"Members of the public are being encouraged to take part in a consultation for a north-east local development plan.Aberdeenshire Council is looking for views on the document, which sets out the -year #settled view# of the authority.The plan sets out policies to be used in the planning application process and proposes land allocations for development between  and .It will be open for the next eight weeks, with interested parties, communities and developers encouraged to have their say.All representations should be received by pm on July .The proposed local development plan was approved to go ahead to the next stage by councillors earlier this year.Comments should be concise, no more than , words and accompanied by limited supporting documents were appropriate.Comments can be sent to ldp@aberdeenshire.gov.uk, or the online response form filled out online and ed to the council.The documents can be found online on Aberdeenshire Council#s website.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/78376bd2-7419-44a7-8c8a-7d1a83e8ca5f-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/78376bd2-7419-44a7-8c8a-7d1a83e8ca5f-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/78376bd2-7419-44a7-8c8a-7d1a83e8ca5f-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/78376bd2-7419-44a7-8c8a-7d1a83e8ca5f-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"volunteers wanted for new aberdeen charity shop","story":"A wildle and animal rescue centre is hoping to recruit volunteers for its new Aberdeen charity shop.The New Arc, near Ellon, is to open a store in the Dyce Shopping Centre, at ASDA.It announced its plans earlier this year, and said it is still committed to opening the shop when possible.No experience is required, and hours are flexible.

Within a couple of days the response was staggering.There were volunteers from all corners of Mid Argyll willing to sew, donate material and give freely of their time. Local businesses were also quick to respond with offers of material, pattern printing and transport for moving stock around.I am overwhelmed by the support and generosity of people in Mid Argyll. They have risen to the challenge and far exceeded my expectations.We have around  stitchers from Cairndow to Ardfern, and villages and towns in between, producing brightly coloured ‘scrubs’ using mainly donated fabric, scrap material and jazzy duvet covers. The first donation of ‘scrubs’ is expected to be handed over to the hospital this week and we are sure they will brighten up the wards.Our crowdfunding page, ‘Let’s Get Scrubbing for Mid Argyll’, was originally set up to buy everything to make the scrubs. It has broken the original £ target and we would love to hit the £, mark so please feel free to donate.I am overwhelmed and humbled by this experience and publicly thank the group team leaders, the volunteer stitchers, those working behind the scenes and the wider community for their support and generosity.My thanks is also extended to the following businesses who have helped in so many ways: MacLeod Construction, Kit-You-Out, Mary’s Meals, Top Designer, West Coast Motors, LG Upholstery, Clock Tower, Tarbert COS Thrt Shop, Premier Laundry, Ian Y McIntyre, Willie Leitch Sailmaker, Owen Sails and the Lithgow Family at Ormsary Estate.Nikki Thompson, Ardrishaig.Sir,The time will come when we are through the turmoil of this pandemic but as we work our way through it, I wanted to share a situation that reflects the actions of many.I was recently collecting shopping in Tarbert for registered vulnerable people and, as I was taking off my gloves before getting into the car, I was aware of another#s presence close by pushing a mobile rubbish bin. It was Damon. He saw me about to put my gloves into the rubbish bag in my own car and said cheerily #You can pop them into this bin here,you like#.I was so taken by that gesture. What an example of initiative, thoughtfulness and kindness. It summed up the incredible work of so many volunteers, co-ordinated by Team Tarbert#s Fiona, with Margaret co-ordinating prescriptions, and many others.Perhaps there is no better time for us all to reaquaint ourselves with Rudyard Kipling#s poem #If#.It seems to perfectly summarise humanity working at its best, in which, during this crisis, thanks to so many, Tarbert can walk tall. Stay safe.Peter Minshall, Tarbert.Sir,I write regarding the Argyllshire Advertiser edition dated Friday April  and the front page heading #Hospital prepares for Pandemic#.The article states: #No figures have been released about the incidence of coronavirus in Argyll and Bute# because the HSCP spokesperson said #we are following national guidance and due to reasons of patient confidentiality we will not be able to make public where in the Highland health board areas the positive cases are#.This statement is complete nonsense and shows either the HSCP in Argyll has not been privy to this information or they are just using the term #national guidance# as a smokescreen and an excuse and or sheer incompetence.No-one was asking them for patients# names and addresses, merely figures of those affected in a given area.The people appointed to positions of responsibility in Argyll and Bute HSCP are hopeless when it comes to joined-up thinking and accountability.All they will do is spin you a line and quote stuff like #national guidelines#, which is code for #I don#t have a clue#.Karl Edwards, LochgilpheadSir,Scottish and Southern Electricity Networksis extending the support it provides to those most vulnerable by expanding the eligibility of its Priority Services Registerto include customers at increased risk of severe illness during the coronavirus pandemic.Nearly , customers already receive additional care and support through SSEN’s PSR – a free, tailored service.In addition to those self-isolating or shielding for  weeks, customers are eligiblethey:Julie Walker, SSEN."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsMidton has been making the distinctive and coveted awards for the Royal Television Society for the past  years # and this week the company#s resourcefulness in adapting to face shield production was acknowledged by the society.

By adding night-scented plants and soft lighting, along with pale-coloured flowers and foliage that appear to glow in the fading light, your garden will become an enticing ‘room’ to sit in at the end of the day.White flowering plants # like big blooms of hydrangeas # have a lovely glow in the evening garden reflecting the last of the light which makes them appear brighter than other plants.  Pale blues and lilacs also look their best in fading light, so sea holly with its tiny blue flowers that sit in rosettes of silvery-grey bracts is a great addition.Bright foliage also creates an evening glow in the garden. Light-coloured, iegated and silver leaf plants reflect any available light. Lambs Earis a popular ground cover plant that has the most wonderful soft, furry, silver-grey leaves.  It’s fairly drought resistant so a good choice for a dry, sunny border.Many beautul flowers only produce scent at night and often have a stronger aroma than their daytime counterparts.  Fragrance is released from night-scented flowers as the heat of the day lingers into the evening.  Petunias may seem be a strange choice for a night garden, but they are night scented. Some smell during the day, but not to the same intensity of the night scent. Night Scented Stocks do just that and have a pastel colour flower palate.It’s best to plant scented night garden flowers where you’ll brush against them or come close to them. Try planting them around doors and paths.  If you are planting in pots make sure you arrange them round seating areas to provide a heady aroma or position them near doors and windows so that the fragrance drts inside.Even though planting the right night-flowering plants in the right place will give you stunning effects,you want to really enjoy your garden after dark, some form of garden lighting is essential.  Try not to floodlight your entire garden. Instead, pick out specic plants and trees to showcase. Up lighting, either set on spikes or recessed into the ground, showcases plants beautully at night.But it’s not just at night time you want your garden to look good so here are some tips for this month from the Royal Horticultural Society."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor may 15 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,A big thank you to whoever has tidied up Ardrishaig Community Garden, mown the grass and repaired and painted the fences.Such a peaceful place to call into while out exercising.

Mindfulness concentrates your mind on the ‘here and now’ and is a proven way of dealing with mild depression or anxiety.Focus on what the plants feel like – not just their fragrance when touched – from leathery and lacey to soft and smooth. You can also mix plants that are great to touch with tactile hard landscaping elements such as a water feature, smooth polished round pebbles or the glazed ceramics.Some top touching plants and features to considerLeaves # try Stachys byzantina, commonly known as Lamb#s Ear. Its soft, downy, furry silver-grey leaves are a favourite among gardeners who tend to use it for ground cover in rich soil. As a contrast there is Acuba japonicawhich has smooth, glossy leathery leaves.Flowers # who can resist touching a bottlebrush Callistemon cintrinus – bundles of tiny delicate stamen flowers form a brush that’s soft to touch – or the soft paper-thin petals of a poppy Papaver orientale.Grasses # run your hand over the arching, thread-like leaves of feathery Stipa tenuissima also known as Mexican feather grass or the more robust drought proof ornamental Festuca glauca with thread-like blue foliage that forms dense mounds.Bark – tree bark can also provide a tactile experience especially when it’s the stunning flowering cherry Prunus serrulate with mahogany coloured bark that peels away in bands round the trunk.Landscaping – you can easily y the textures in your garden by choosing dferent hard landscaping options. If you have smooth pebbles surrounding a water feature that you can run your hand over and through, you could place lichen-covered rocks in another area of the garden.Our general well-being is intrinsically linked to the natural world which is why Thrive – the gardening for health charity – has developed the Thrive Gardening Club.For fortnightly tips on getting the most out of your garden, whatever your age or ability, and information on how gardening can keep you healthy and feeling good visit www.thrive.org.uk get-involved keep-in-touch subscribe-to-gardening-clubThrive is the UK’s leading provider of social and therapeutic horticulture programmes using gardening to bring about positive changes in the lives of people living with disabilities, ill health or mental health issues, or who are isolated, disadvantaged or vulnerable."},{"url":null,"title":"argyll adventure saddles up for public support","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe owner of an Inveraray equine and outdoor activity centre is looking for customers# help as lockdown bites.It#s fair to say Andy Cameron could have had an easier start to running Argyll Adventure.The business has operated at Dalchenna Farm for two decades in its current format and -year-old Andy took over the reins at the end of .Argyll Adventure#s bread and butter is horse riding # trekking through the hills above Loch Fyne.

People who may have previously felt isolated in remote and rural communities may be feeling this even more acutely at this time, so it’s important they know support is available.Across the region, many people have also sadly faced the pain of losing loved ones to the virus or have fallen ill themselves, while others have seen their livelihoods put at risk or incomes reduced. All of this has put additional strain on people’s mental well-being.This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is putting the focus on kindness as a means of helping people through the pandemic and building a better society as we emerge from it. We see many acts of kindness in the Highlands and Islands all the time, but this week is an opportunity for people to reflect on their interactions with others and how they can try and be a little kinder during this unprecedented time.David Stewart, MSP for Highlands and Islands region.Sir,During Mental Health Awareness Week, sight loss charity RNIB Scotland is highlighting the emotional reassurance and practical help it is offering during the coronavirus lockdown.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as their families, friends and carers.Losing some or even all your sight can be devastating news to take in, but our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.RNIB is concerned the lockdown might be affecting people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older, particularly hard. The uncertainty over access to basic shopping and medication, to information in accessible formats, the social isolation and barriers to being guided because of social distancing can all add and compound to the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.As well as our Need to Talk service, the RNIB helpline on    is available for anyone with sight loss and we continue to organise social activities over the phone and social media.We want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.James Adams, RNIB Scotland director, Edinburgh.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiativehas launched Alien Detectives – a fun and educational online resource to help the young and not so young  learn more about alien # or non-native – invasive species.Originally designed as a school education pack, the huge array of activities now includes a wide range of fun games and activities that anyone can enjoy at home, in the garden or on local walks during lockdown.Alien Detectives includes crafts, quizzes, worksheets, presentations and puzzles all themed around invasive species and the river environment. Although primarily aimed at young people, anyone with an interest in the environment or invasive species can enjoy them too.Our project team has been busy while homeworking during lockdown to produce these fantastic resources. We hope becoming Alien Detectives will bring many hours of enjoyment to iniduals and families during lockdown, especially at a time when most young people are not in a regular school environment and might be looking for a new challenge or activities to continue their learning.Invasive non-native species might be a new topic to many but it is a really important one. Invasive species can have a major impact on our environment and native wildle and are responsible for signicant bioersity loss in Scotland and across the world. We hope these resources will help raise awareness of the impacts of invasive species and inspire more young people to learn something about them.No prior knowledge is needed and there’s lots to learn and have fun with so become an Alien Detective and help us tackle invasive species today.All of the ‘Alien Detectives’ resources can be found at www.invasivespecies.scot alien-detectives.Callum Sinclair, SISI Project Manager, Newton Stewart.Sir,We may not be able to hold picnics in the usual way just yet, but why not hold the next best thing – a virtual picnic  That way you can invite as many people as you want.National charity Family Action is running its Virtual Family Picnic from May  to May  and everyone is invited.

Governments across the UK moved quickly to introduce business support schemes.I know, however, that many Scottish businesses, especially SMEs, have been frustrated with the level and speed of help provided, with some even seeking a judicial review of the Scottish Governmentrsquos policy.The frustration grew from the decision to initially block retailers with multiple outlets from applying for more than one grant ndash putting small chain businesses in Scotland at a competitive disadvantage.Following a backlash, Ministers relented, but businesses with multiple properties here are still only allowed to claim  per cent of the maximum support grant for subsequent properties.But with almost half a billion pounds of business support grant finance still not having been allocated, and the allocation of funds slowing down, Scottish Labour is demanding Ministers urgently reconsider this policy and offer businesses with more than one premises their additional grants in full.Given the widely predicted long-term economic damage likely to be caused by the pandemic, it will be vital that once the public health crisis is under control we dedicate the same urgency and intervention to repairing our economy.I want this to include a jobs guarantee scheme to help tackle the looming threat of unemployment, especially for young people.Further information about the advice and support available for businesses during the pandemic can be found at findbusinesssupport.gov.scot coronavirus-advice, while the governmentrsquos Covid- business helpline number is   ."},{"url":null,"title":"day-centre-receives-holyrood-recognition","story":"Harlawhill Day Centrersquos efforts during the coronavirus pandemic were highlighted by the countyrsquos MSP, Iain Gray.The facility had to close its doors on March  due to the global pandemic but Mr Gray felt it was important to recognise the efforts being made by staff and volunteers.The centre, on the townrsquos East Loan, has continued to offer a range of support to members during the pandemic, including organising socially distanced street celebrations outside membersrsquo homes to help mark VE Day and delivering special afternoon tea packages and other food and treats to help keep their spirits up during lockdown.Mr Gray, who lodged a motion at Holyrood highlighting the facility, told the Courier: ldquoHarlawhill Day Centre has always been a special place, very much at the heart of the community in Prestonpans.ldquoIt was a very sad day when it had to close its doors to members back in March.

Here are her words:In the past many couldnrsquot read or write and so our history was rolled into the mind and later unravelled when the wheels stopped rolling and the horses were roped for grazing.Cars and lorries may have replaced the old methods of transport, but the importance of our cultural tales remained the same.Stories for children were about joys and adventures of the fairy folk, goblins and broonies.As they grew older, moral messages were concealed in the stories to teach the young person about moral issues.Respecting the earth and all that lived on her made for some wonderful tales about animals and birds why the snakes see all, who painted the eaglesrsquo feather tips, does a blackbird feel a storm coming at the base of his beak Is it not wise to heed the warning of a dog who does not rise to happily welcome the arrival of its master Our lives revolved around such tales, and their inner meanings. The boy who cried wolf was forever with us do not lie!You see, forests hold more than trees and rocks will whisperyou have an ear to listen.Our entire lives were, and are, stories. In my culture we had a teller in every family.In her books about the lives of traditional travellers, and her personal experience of it, she does not overly romanticise it.It could be a hard le, and one often misunderstood or discriminated against, as indeed it still is.But the legacy of stories, told and re-told over campfires, in caravans and kitchens, passed down from generation to generation is a rich and priceless inheritance.I was honoured that she shared a tale with me, albeit online rather than face to face, as these times demand.I believe it is a tradition we should all honour and can learn from.And so here is the story she shared.It has a Tinkerrsquos Leap in it and, who knows, it could refer to the place so named in Woodhall Dean.I have tried as best I can to keep the resonance of Jessrsquos voice in the telling.So sit round your campfire, real or imagined, for Jessrsquos tale:The story I am going to tell is of the Earl of Hell. Aye well that is how folk called him. Irsquom told he was a relative of the famous Jeannie Gordon.Well, he was a handsome lad, and had a roving eye. He also had a knack of walking into trouble.Well one day he was accused of stealing something. He knew he would get no fair hearing in court, and sure enough he didnrsquot.Soon he found himself before a dour judge, who donned his black cap and pronounced that he will be hanged at the light of dawn.Now the Earl had already escaped death three times. Some say he had the blood of Red Ruth in his veins.This time it seemed, he had met his fate. But this young lad was not ready to meet his maker.The hangman did his deadly job but as the Earl fell through the trap door he began a dance at the end of the rope, in which he dislocated his shoulders, threw his legs up in a circle and managed to free himself.The jailers were aghast, and disbelief momentarily paralysed their responses.This gave the Earl time to scuffle to his feet and flee up the steps. No door was locked, for nobody had expected the need of it.The lad jumped onto a horse and rode at speed. His horsemanship was, of course, a skill honed from childhood and he rode to freedom.However, a guard was likewise a skilled rider and took chase after him.Perhaps the Earl eased up on his horse for a moment, believing he was well away, but soon the sound of galloping told him dferent. The guard was closing in.The Earl made his horse fly like the wind. He headed into the trees, hoping to lose his pursuer, but to no avail.The steep sided burn lay ahead. So he rode like the devil towards the precipice.But at the last moment his horse took understandable fright, and stalled, throwing him to the ground.As the Earl stood, his horse would have no more of it and fled.His pursuer now drew a sword that glinted in the morning sun as he charged perhaps after all the Earl of Hell would die in this dawn light.But his title was well earned.He turned towards the precipice and threw caution to the wind and leapt over the edge.The pursuing guard pulled up his horse and watched as the Earl flew over the ravine and landed like a cat on the other side.The guard fumbled for his pistol, but the Earl vanished into the thicket of the wood in moments.The location became known ever after as Tinkerrsquos Leap.And as for the Earl of Hell himself, he was seen again only through the misty visions of drunk men, and the eyes of his sweetheart who did not tell his story till long after he was dead."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-council-caravan-bid-rejected","story":"Lammermuir Livery and Stables wanted to provide accommodation for relief staff for their stable manager to live at their rural base at Castlemains Farm, Gford, to run the business.And they hoped East Lothian Council would back their planthe caravans were hidden from sight on nearby land already used to store mobile homes and other vehicles.However councillor officers refused to grant planning permission and the councilrsquos Local Review Body backed their decision during an online meeting this week when they refused an appeal against it.The planning application, which was retrospective also asked for permission to have an office, already built at the entrance to to site, but that was also rejected by the review body.Making their case for the caravans, the firm said: ldquoWhen considering this we were aware of the visual impact a caravan could have on the landscapeand decided the best option would be to site the caravan in the existing storage yard in an area designated for that purpose, this area already has caravans stored, which we have permission forand therefore the caravan would not be a new thing in that area.HoweverCouncillor Norman Hampshire, review body chairperson, described the decision to let people live in a storage area as lsquounacceptablersquo.He said: ldquoI do not think residential caravans on a storage site is an acceptable place for people to be living.The stables had also argued that there was not secure space within the equestrian buildings it had at he farm for an office and one needed to be built on another part of the land, however this was also dismissed by the review body.Members carried out inidual site visits to the farm ahead of meeting todayonline.Councillor Sue Kempson said: ldquoThe caravans are in the wrong place and should not be used as living accommodation on a storage site, it sets a precedent.ldquoLooking around the equestrian site there is plenty of room to provide a secure office so I am supporting the officersrsquo decision.Fellow body member Councillor Kenny McLeod made the decision unanimous when he ruled the office and caravans were too far away from the centre itself to be of any benefit.Planning officers refused the original application for temporary planning permission for five years for the office and caravans retrospectively, stating there was no business case for the equestrian business to support the need for the additional building and that the caravans would set an ldquoundesirable precedent.The applicants had told the review body their agent, who had been asked to provide a business case, had ldquovanished and they had no knowledge of the request."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-parents-need-know-school-reopen-date-confirmed","story":"The First Minister revealed this will be a \"blended\" approach, far from normality for our nations youngsters, as part of a four-phase plan to ease the lockdown.But even this is reliant on two key factors -the scientic andmedical advice confirms it can be done so in a way that will not distrupt efforts to controlthe virus andthere is sufficient PPE and other hygiene measures in place.Following her announcement in parliament, the Scottish Goevrnment published their strategic framework for the reopening of schools.Here, well detail out what parents need to know ahead of their childsto the classroom.Schools in Scotland are set to reopen on August .This is earlier than planned for some schools -

For over a year this tiny offshoot has been sinking its roots deep. Above ground, however, itrsquos little more than a frond. With the solicitude of a father for his firstborn, Alan has been watering it since March, and awaiting the first leaves of the season. Buds eventually appeared, followed by the unfurling of glistening leaves the colour of old pennies. Just the other day he witnessed the arboreal equivalent of a childrsquos first day at school: a sparrow alighting on its branches, treating it like a real tree.The gardener who told us how to plant it said that it canrsquot get enough watering. Itrsquoll take however much you pour on it, allowing roots to take hold, and speeding its growth. So when eventually the clouds opened the other evening, it was the infant beech I thought of, soaking it up before reaching for the sky.As the rain pounded on the skylights, I stood at the window. Lit by the streetlamp on the village green, water filled the cobbled gutter. It rushed blackly towards the drain, a sprinkling of fallen apple blossom bobbing on the tide, asa wedding party had just passed. Through the small hours the downpour continued. I could lie awake all night listening to it. When I was growing up my bedroom was in an attic. Early in the morning seagullsrsquo flippers would patter over the roof, and the slightest breath of wind or rain was amplied by the rattling windows and nearby trees. The worse the weather, the more I enjoyed it.This astonishingly dry and sunny spring has been a boon during lockdown, the best possible antidote to gloom. I donrsquot like to imagine how miserable it would have beenthere had been incessant damp and cloudy skies. Yet surrounded as we are in Hoolet by fields of crops, and with flocks and herds munching grass, lack of rain means everything suffers. Cattle especially have been known to break out in search of water, thirst driving them slightly nuts.Following last weekrsquos cloudburst, the village has emerged from its dousing like a bridesmaid from the hairdresserrsquos. At first light the blackbirds were out in force, working their way across the green, combing every inch. I read that itrsquos been a good year for blackbirds, but that was hardly news. The place has been jumping with them for weeks, males chasing off rivals or fighting mid-air asreenacting the Battle of Britain. Females have been shopping for worms in pairs. No patch of lawn or grass goes unforaged, the birds keeping several feet apart, like customers at a supermarket checkout. Ousting wood pigeons and thrushes from telegraph poles, they declare their territory and every few minutes one flies past the window at such speed, yoursquod think it had been fired from a gun.A year or two past, one of our neighbours found a blackbird lying stricken in his garden. Alive but bleeding, it was being mobbed by other birds. He took out a chair, and sat near it for the rest of the afternoon, until it had recovered enough to fly off. He noticed it had been ringed, and when it began to make his garden its home, he called it Wilf. If he were ever tempted to rename his cottage, he could do worse than Wilf Hall.While we were speaking, Wilf chittered from the hedge. A day or two later, he turned up in our garden, two fields away from base, pecking for worms. With his gleaming ankle ring, and boot-polished feathers, he has a debonair look. I used to think they were all much the same, but once you start examining blackbirds, they emerge as iniduals: the plump matron, the one with a white feather on its wing, the scrawny, aggressive male, ceaselessly refuelling himself and his nestlings.Like pheasants, they allow us to get very close ndash Wilf especially, who seems fearless around people ndash but itrsquos not because they arenrsquot smart. You feel a pheasant is capable of walking on to the Christmas platter and arranging the carrots and parsnips around itself while it waits for the gravy blackbirds, on the other hand, know how to take advantage of what we can offer.Given the kerfuffle they make in the beech hedge, they could be devouring a packet of crisps. They make no attempt to hide their presence or keep their distance and whenever I start digging, the cry goes out. They donrsquot sit cutely on the spade handle like robins, but they hop within a few inches, spotting grubs I couldnrsquot detect even with a magnying glass. Once theyrsquore used to you, their confidence quickly grows.Some time ago I interviewed a woman who kept crows and rooks in her house, as they recovered from injuries. While we sat in her kitchen drinking coffee, a small rook click-clacked towards us over the tiles. Keeping one eye cocked on me, it pecked at my bare ankle, before growing bored and toddling off.The blackbirds in Hoolet arenrsquot tame, but nor are they shy. When worms began emerging after the rain, they were already in place, waiting. Itrsquos been a good week for them, and soon their well-fed broods will be joining the party on the green. Irsquom less certain about our bluetits. Occasional cheeping can be heard from the nest box, but itrsquos too early to knowtheyrsquoll survive. Caterpillars are their food of choice, but as the butterfly population declines, so does their larder. Might they have something put away in case of a rainy day "},{"url":null,"title":"paul-tamburrinis-lockdown-feast-caesar-salad-fried-chicken-chococolate-cate-chocolate-sorbet","story":"This weeks recipes are a sumptuous three-course meal fit for any table:Caesar salad with lettuce emulsionServes - starters Romaine lettuce hearts, cut into bite sized bitesg parmesan shavings fillets of good quality anchovies in oil, halved waysFor the bread croutons Day old baguetteExtra virgin olive oilSea saltFor the dressingfrac cloves of garlic, green germ removed and finely grated fillets of salted anchovies in oil free range eggsml red wine vinegartsp Dijon mustardml grapeseed oilg finely grated parmesanJuice of frac lemonfrac tsp of Worcestershire sauce drops of TabascoSalt and black pepper to tasteFor the lettuce emulsiong Baby gems leaves, green only ndash washed frac tsp Dijon mustardml vegetable oilml cold waterTable saltFor the bread tuillesPreheat the oven to C ndash cut  very thinly slices from the baguette, so you have  per person.

But it highlights going green as part of a recovery that would cut carbon emissions and create jobs, while including support for investment in clean industry and transport, making buildings net-zero, carbon capture and storage.The plan would also seek to take better advantage of Scotlandrsquos green energy revolution, which the Herald revealed was increasingly being placed in the hands of overseas firms.Camleys Cartoon: Green energy jobs.In Scotland, the Scottish Trades Union Congress has revealed it wants to see a new Future Jobs Fund to back a construction and \"deep\" retrofit housing programme, to make existing homes more environmentally friendly, while creating \"good quality\" jobs and driving decarbonisation of heat, reducing emissions and fuel bills.In , in the wake of a financial crisis which resulted in the bailout of banks the threat of high youth unemployment loomed, and the government created the Future Jobs Fund, which paid employers a wage subsidy to take on young people.The Scottish government has set itself a legally-binding target to cut greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by , five years ahead of the date set for the UK as a whole.An upgrade to our existing housing stock to be become energy-efficient means improving the fabric of the buildings.STUC deputy general secretary Dave Moxham said that capital investment should go into a \"better regulated\" construction sector and \"serious consideration\" given to the creation of a Scottish National Construction company.\"Scotlandrsquos housing stock, with a high proportion of tenement properties, is not the easiest to retrofit with energy saving measures such as insulation and new heating systems, however progress on deep retrofit has been identied as one of the key elements in achieving net zero,\" he said.\"There has also been a tendency to shallow retrofit building meaning that one emissions saving measure is introduced with other adaptations undertaken later on or not at all. This crisis and the need to plan better and create jobs provides an ideal opportunity establish a programme of deep-retrofit, nationally co-ordinated and locally delivered.\"It is analogous to the massive effort in the early s when the UK converted millions of gas boilers to be offshore gas compliant, creating thousands upon thousands of jobs and massively boosting the economy. Such a programme is best driven by state investment and delivered through nationally co-ordinated or even a nationalised construction company. As well as providing a much needed boost for jobs and apprenticeships it would have a serious and positive impact on fuel poverty.\"The Coalition for the Energy Efficiency of Buildingsargues that such a retrofit programme would slash emissions, create jobs and could reboot a battered post-Covid economy.The CEEB, which is backed by the UK government and the City of London Corporation, argues that such an approach would support more than , skilled and semi-skilled construction jobs, provide a quick economic stimulus and boost consumer spending through energy cost savings.Mr Moxham said lessons can be learned from the collapse of construction giant Carillion two years ago which cost UK taxpayers an estimated poundm.When it was liquidated with debts of pound.bn, the firm had about  UK public sector contracts.\"The collapse provided evidence of how an massive under-regulated private sector companies can fail with all real risk transferred to workers and the public sector,\" he said.\"A publicly owned construction company could guarantee better and less precarious employment practices twinned with a co-ordinated approach to green construction and retrofitting.\"Undertaking such actions requires investment and increases government indebtedness, however the nature of such government borrowing is that it is borrowing against its own future. \"Thus a green Future Jobs Fund would see a massive expansion in the training of and provision of good jobs for young people. Taken in conjunction with overall economic boost it would provide one of the most effective ways to borrow to invest.\"In , a Scottish Government report stated the offshore wind sector alone offered the potential for , direct jobs and a further , jobs in related industries, as well as pound.bn investment in Scotland by .The Scottish Governmentrsquos low carbon strategydescribed the large scale development of offshore wind as representing the ldquobiggest opportunity for sustainable economic growth in Scotland for a generation with Scotland having an estimated % of Europersquos offshore wind potential.But in February, it emerged that it had in fact created just sixper cent of the , direct jobs predicted. Official estimates stated that there were just , full-time jobs in the offshore wind sector in Scotland, a fraction of the numbers projected by .Mr Moxham said: \"Thus far the then First Minister Alex Salmonds comments that Scotland would become the lsquoSaudi Arabiarsquo of renewables has failed to materialise.\"He said there should be \"much stricter conditionality\" attached to contracts for renewable construction in Scotland to \"ensure a radical improvement\" in the number of local supply chain jobs in offshore and other renewables.\"It is essential that we offer meaningful and well-paid employment for those likely to suffer from the current and longer-term downturn in offshore oil and gas,\" he said.His views come as the TUC called for the government to form a National Recovery Council to help the economy heal from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.It said lessons can be learned from former prime minister Clement Attleersquos  government, which inherited massive wartime debts but saw them slide rapidly as the economy recovered.The Labour administration launched the NHS, a welfare safety net and mass housebuilding, nationalised industries and sought to boost demand to maintain full employment.d on short-term crisis management and wary about the rising costs of existing crisis measures.TUC analysis showed that the decade of investment for growth between  and  that followed World War II achieved an average growth rate of . per cent.

She is an impressive leader. And not just in her delivery.Ms Sturgeonrsquos political handling of this crisis has also been exemplary. She has followed essentially the same strategy as the UK Government, made all the same mistakes and then some, but has somehow managed to devolve responsibility for those mistakes to Westminster.:Opinion: Iain Macwhirter: No country for old men. The bitter harvest in Scotlandrsquos care homesLast week, she unveiled her four-step programme for ing to normality which is, in all major respects, the same as the UK one. But by delaying it a fortnight, while accusing Boris Johnson of playing ldquoRussian roulette with peoplersquos lives she has made it sound asshersquos protected Scots from a government of Bolsanaro-emulating herd immunity fanatics.There is not a great deal of evidence for this. Nicola Sturgeon said a fortnight ago that it was not safe to follow the UK path because the ldquoall-important R number in Scotland was too high at between . and .. Yet last week, as she announced her new regime, the R number was still between . and ..She insists that the number of infections is down, which is true. But the rate of spread of the virus, which R measures, is not crucially dependent on the number of cases. The risk of the pandemic getting loose again has changed very little.But people think it has, and in politics, that is all that really matters. ldquo#ThankYouNicola was trending on social media. The SNP is riding ever higher in popularity. The FMrsquos treatment by opposition leaders in the chamber sounded almost respectful.There has been an assumption, shared by most of the Scottish media, that Nicola Sturgeon is showing the way, not following a few steps behind. Her government commands a degree of respect that Westminster lacks. ldquoIrsquom sorry to interrupt you, Mr Swinney, said a reverential Good Morning Scotland presenter the day after the route map was unveiled.Yet, in that very interview, the Deputy First Minister all but admitted that the governmentrsquos aim of , contact tracers by next week was falling way short. Only  have been signed up, but Swinney assured us that this would be quite enough. Oh yes.On testing, the Scottish Governmentrsquos record is poor any way you look at it. Not only in contact tracing which is well behind England, where , tracers have been recruited, but also in the headline number of tests.The UK was testing , a day last week and is on course for , a day. In Scotland only , are being tested, according to the Scottish Parliament Information Service. On a per-capita basis it should be almost ten times that.Now, the purpose of all this testing is admittedly unclear, north and south of the Border. The clinical advisers in Scotland have always been distinctly cool on community testing, at least in the current phase. The former CMO, Dr Catherine Catherwood, famously called it a ldquodistraction.However, everyone agrees now that one of the major failings of the UKrsquos response to the pandemic was a lack of preparedness and a failure to install the architecture of TTI: test, track and isolate. Progress in Scotland can only be described as glacial.:Opinion: Iain Macwhirter: Its easy to scare people into staying home harder to persuade them to come out againThen there is the avoidable tragedy in Scotlandrsquos care homes, which I wrote about last week. This was the policy, hotly denied, that old people were cleared out of acute hospitals without proper testing and sent often to care homes where the virus spread rapidly.Last week, the Health Secretary, Jeane Freeman, finally came clean about the elderly clearance, and said nearly , had been discharged in March alone. She had previously said only  had been so decanted.This is a serious error and calls into question the competence of the minister and the health service bureaucrats upon whom she relies. It comes on top of the inexplicable failure to inform the public about the major Covid outbreak in February at a Nike conference in Edinburgh.There is every sign of a massive buck-passing operation between the NHS Scotland, Public Health Scotland, the Chief Medical Officer, the Care Inspectorate and the private care homes, all trying to blame each other for the care home scandal.Nicola Sturgeon admitted last week that there had been a panic reaction to the forecast of , Covid deaths made in mid-March by the disgraced Imperial College epidemiologist, Professor Neil Ferguson. She said hospitals feared they were about to be ldquofilled up with coronavirus cases and so discharged as many old patients as possible into care. In the event, the wards have lain empty as old people died.Nearly half of all Covid deaths in Scotland have been in care homes. The misery this policy has inflicted on Scotlandrsquos senior citizens, dying in cruel isolation, is unimaginable.Lessons will be learned etc. However, no-one seems to regard these as lessons particularly for the First Minister. Similarly, criticism of confusions in her route map to normality go right over her head.Garden centres and bowling greens can open, but people canrsquot use the toilets, which make it rather pointless. The ldquoblended solution to teaching means parents will have to remain at home even after schools go back in August. The tourism and hospitality industry is in despair, forecasting losses of up to , jobs.But Nicola Sturgeon is safe and socially distanced from blame. She has the shield of confidence around her, burnished by the flattering attentions of legions SNP supporters, who dominate social media.It has now become clear that the PMrsquos closest adviser, Dominic Cummings, had been bending the lockdown rules to travel Durham, with the full sanction of Boris Johnson.The UK media seems mainly interested in using Scotland as a stick to beat the Prime Minister. The Sky presenter, Kay Burley, urged UK political leaders last week to ldquotake a leaf out of Nicola Sturgeonrsquos book.It is also, of course, because Boris Johnsonrsquos handling of the crisis has been confused and erratic. The messaging about ldquoStay Alert was vague, the rules about travel incomprehensible, the attempt to reopen the schools cack-handed.:Iain Macwhirter: Failures over testing means no end to coronavirus lockdown in ScotlandThe UK Government has oscillated between promises of wonder apps and ldquogame-changing breakthroughs, like antibody tests, and panicky pronouncements that have led to invasive crackdowns by the police.

That was fine by me, as was Drs Mike and Chris being ordinary, unassuming guys rather than the dreaded ldquocharacters so many reality television series seek. Uncomplicated was good. It was dferent. Whether we will still be feeling that way a few more episodes in, who knows.First client through the door of Bendingo Animal Hospital was a wedge-tailed eagle found lying on its stomach in a paddock. With a wing-span of . metres, these birds can down a kangaroo. Dr Chris, wisely, sent the bird for a snooze while he examined him. While doing so he found out that ldquohe was in fact a ldquoshe.There were no breaks in the wings, which left the possibility of poisoning. Only thing for it was to wait and hope.Arriving at Dr Mikersquos was a week old foal that had run into a metal fence. A facial injury would be bad news for any creature, but especially one set to be a racehorse. After an op by Dr Mike and his fiancee Dr Sarah Jalim, it was a bandage round the nose for the foal. Another case of wait and see.Easier in one way was the case of Clive the dog. Clive, -years-young, had terrible earache. He wouldnrsquot let his beloved owner, Kay, near his lug. Like the wedge-tailed eagle, Clive was sent on a snooze.The problem was a small grass seed wedged in his ear. ldquoLike little daggers, said Chrisrsquos fiance, Dr Claire. She plucked out the one in the ear, plus several more on his coat, and delivered him back into the arms of Kay, who gave a loud sigh of relief.Otherwise, the chaps meet a koala and learned how to do a ldquokoala bellow. Fun fact: koalas have three fingers and two thumbs. Not so fun fact: they suffer from chlamydia a lot. The boys also stopped to check out an injured hedgehog , released the eagleand checked on the foal .Happy outcomes. All Creatures fans would have approved."},{"url":null,"title":"boo-boris-take-place","story":"The social media users took to Twitter after Sundayrsquos press conference to propose a mass booing of Boris Johnson on Tuesday evening.The protest, which mirrors the weekly Clap for Carers, comes as Boris Johnson said Dominic Cummings ldquoacted responsibly, legally and with integrity by travelling to County Durham during lockdown.:Dominic Cummings defends  mile trip at press conferenceMusician and comedian Vikki Stone tweeted:OKAY. #BOOFORBORISpmTuesdayTell your neighboursldquoOKAY. #BOOFORBORIS pm Tuesday Tell your neighboursCaroline Castle added:Come on Edinburgh, we can #booforboris.

Rather than engage with people as thinking, intelligent citizens, with big political ideals and arguments, this micro-politics focused on the minutiae of everyday le and attempted, as the name suggests, to change our behaviour.More akin to a relationship between a parent and child rather than between political representatives and citizens, the politics of behaviour promotes policies, with the help of ldquoexperts, that attempt to ldquonudge us here and there, to ensure we ldquobehave responsibly.The newer assemblies, the Scottish Parliament being a leading example, have adopted the politics of behaviour with a particular zeal, attempting through a iety of new laws, taxes and initiatives, to regulate how we smoke, drink, talk, and even how we raise our children.The distrusting and infantilising nature of the politics of behaviour helps to explain some of the more patronising and irrational policies adopted during the lockdown and also helps to explain why Scotland is more backwards when it comes to freeing up society.What is called an ldquoenabling state finds the idea of free iniduals who ldquoact, rather than merely ldquobehaving dficult to comprehend. Consequently, we continue to be given simplistic slogans and irrational micro managerial instructions about what to do once we dare to leave our homes.With this in mind, it is worth reminding the First Minister, our political representative, of that Ancient Greek phrase primus inter pares ndash it means First Among Equals.

Respect, where itrsquos due, to the Tories who had the courage to condemn this scandal outright.Cummings wonrsquot go, he wonrsquot quit. A nuclear blast wouldnrsquot sht him ndash and Johnson, so far, wonrsquot sack him. Cummings reminds me of vomit stains on my clothes when my children were babies. Something revolting that wonrsquot go away no matter how much soap and water is used.And Johnson hellip good grief. Yoursquod be forgiven for imagining Cummings has got something on him. Quite honestly,I was Prime Minister only being blackmailed by the most dreadful sex tape could make me act the way Johnson has acted in defence of Cummings and the indefensible.You can use the Cummings scandal as a barometer of decency. Itrsquos not that you have to be a good person to see how despicable Cummings and Johnson have behaved ndash even the morally marginal are aware of that. Butsomeone is capable of defending Cummings then therersquos only two possible reasons: one, theyrsquore mad and so shouldnrsquot be judged for what theyrsquove said or two, theyrsquore Tories so craven, cowardly and grotesquely ambitious that truth and shame are alien concepts.Still, for those of us who clocked Cummings as a dangerous critter from the get-go, therersquos some delight in watching Conservatives whorsquove been part of the rah-rah brigade for Johnson ndash the most useless Prime Minister wersquove ever had ndash twist in the wind.

Itrsquos not merely about lsquoone rule for you and one rule for mersquo. Itrsquos the utter immorality, the swaggering, dangerous, screw-you arrogance of the pair.Cummings actively doesnrsquot care what anyone thinks. And Johnson is so sociopathically narcissistic that the idea that the rest of us have feelings or needs or moral beliefs doesnrsquot penetrate his painstakingly disarranged hair-do.Your mother might be dying in a care home, your son might be languishing in a bedsit alone, you might be desperate to see them but to hell with you, what do you matter  Yoursquore not Dom, yoursquore not Boris.Why should Dom and Boris follow the same rules as you  Yoursquore you, theyrsquore them.

And maybe a bit of herd immunity will sort them out into the bargain.Cummings can flout rules which were written to keep people alive, and then sneer at the public and the press for having the temerity to question him.Whatrsquos truly disgusting about the whole affair and Johnsonrsquos defence of his charismatically-challenged Asda Price Rasputin, is the use of the Cummingsrsquo child. Every single one of us has fretted over our children these last few months. Many of us have cried for our children.With Coronavirus affecting his we and then him, Cummings says he needed childcare for his son. Downing Street thought dragging the child into the public spotlight as an excuse would keep the peasants quiet. His lordshiprsquos child needed love and attention - surely, the oiks would understand that, eventheir own brats were mewling at home.ldquoThe kid is the trump card, one Downing Street source said of the Defend Dom strategy.Well, that backfired. To paraphrase the PM, Johnson has spaffed his premiership up the wall. Therersquos no coming ndash forgive the terrible pun ndash back from this.

Forcing MPs to choose between the safety of our communities and equal representation is unacceptable.“Parliament must be a forum where every part of the United Kingdom can participate equally. The Secretary of State knows this better than most and the challenges posed to communities that are more distant from parliament. We are calling on him to be a voice for equal representation in government.”Mr Jack was questioned on the issue in parliament yesterday, by SNP MP Allan Dorans. Mr Jack said: #Members of Parliament are key workers. More importantly, as a cabinet minister and a secretary of state, it is right that I should be here in the chamber so that I can be properly scrutinised and answer these questions.#I came down at the weekend and travelled on a train very safely. I willsafely and I will be isolating myself when I do, but that is solely because I go back to family. I do not see why we cannot have proper scrutiny of parliament when we have the virtual proceedings, which work for some, but for me it is absolutely about being here, being scrutinised and being at the Dispatch Box.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

A Coronavirus Business Hardship Support Grant Scheme was launched earlier this month.The grant and loans schemes were created following engagement with local business representatives.During discussions with a broad range of business sectors, requests were made for the council to establish ways to ease the immediate pressure created by poor cash flow, with the curtailing of all trade in some sectors and severely limited trade in others.The council fund is intended to supplement rather than replace national support measures # and business applicants should first explore whether they are eligible for assistance from the schemes put in place by the Scottish and UK Governments.Before seeking a loan from OIC, businesses will need to have first applied for funding from the national Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme or the Coronavirus Bounce Back Loan Schemes.Councillor Graham Sinclair, chairman of the council’s Development and Infrastructure Committee, said: “We are very aware of the hardship many businesses are facing in these uncertain and challenging times.“I am pleased that the emergency loan scheme, as well as the hardship grant scheme, are now in place and open for applications.“Many local businesses are receiving assistance from the government support schemes – and these should be the first port of call for those affected by the economic effects of the crisis“But we know from our engagement with Orkney’s business sectors that the national schemes won’t help all businesses.“The new loan scheme offers a further option for those that have been unable to secure support where.“If your business is facing this situation I would encourage you to check online to seeit is eligible # and to get in touch with our economic development team or Business Gateway Orkneyyou are unsure or feel it doesn’t quite meet the criteria.”Standard loan terms are for a duration of up to six years, with an initial repayment holiday period of up to a year, followed by up to five years to repay the loan balance in full.

Signicant adjustments will also be required across our public transport services as the lockdown is eased in the coming weeks and months and the safety of the travelling public is hugely important.“The committee wants to hear about the experiences of iniduals and businesses and whether they feel they have received the support they need to survive and recover from this crisis.“We also want to learn about examples of good practice as we consider what lessons can be learned about the response to the pandemic and also how existing practices may need to change as we move forward.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

National media reports have suggested that Home Office staff cannot access paperwork held in offices due to inefficient home working procedures.Mr Carmichael said: “EU citizens make a massive positive impact in the Northern Isles and the coronavirus crisis has only made that impact clearer. The pandemic has demonstrated the vital contributions that workers from all over the world make in supporting our economy and keeping the NHS running under severe pressure.“The ongoing legal limbo for over two hundred EU citizens in the isles is unacceptable. Continued confusion and delay caused by administrative problems must be put right. Failing to do so puts people’s futures and lives clouded in uncertainty. They deserve better from a government that promised their right to remain.“This news comes in a week in which the government has seemed blind to the importance of immigrant workers in our health and social care sectors. I am glad that the Prime Minister backed down on plans to charge immigrants working in the NHS but it should never have come that far.

In Orkney, this currently stands at two and seven respectively.However, the Scottish Government and NHS Orkney have refused so far to confirm the number of people in each area that have been tested, partly on the basis of concerns around patient confidentiality.Mr McArthur said: “In the absence of a vaccine, any move away from lockdown needs to be backed up by a reliable regime of testing and tracing. We need to keep the virus in sight, so we can properly manage the risk.“If there are any issues in getting this set up, local areas need to know so that those problems can be raised and then fixed.“That is why it is essential that Ministers are as transparent as possible.  Being up front about the amount of testing taking place at a local health board level is a key part of achieving that transparency, keeping people informed and building public confidence.“Without knowing the extent of testing in Orkney, it is dficult to know what to make of the relatively low numbers of confirmed cases of COVID. That is a point I have been reinforcing with Scottish Ministers and NHS Orkney over recent weeks.“The First Minister has called for a ‘grown up’ conversation about how we take the dficult decisions in easing lockdown restrictions.  Grown up conversations, however, are founded on transparency and honesty. That is why we need to see detailed figures on a localised basis.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It is also understandable that Ministers want safeguards in place to ensure that public funds are being allocated appropriately.“However, it is clear that requiring applicants to evidence use of a business bank account is causing real problems for many small businesses in the tourism sector.  Many were advised by their own banks to use personal bank accounts to run their operations. Having taken that advice, many now find it is denying them access to the support they desperately need.“BB owners are the backbone of an already vulnerable tourism sector in Orkney and, like other businesses, are facing an uphill challenge at this time. Yet, it is almost asthey haven’t been considered to be a viable business at all, which is deeply frustrating.“I have been raising this issue with the Finance Secretary for a number of weeks now and was encouraged by Kate Forbes’ recognition of the problem and her willingness to keep looking at how this gap in support might be closed. So far, Ministers have been willing to widen criteria and make improvements to funds where needed. I hope the same can happen in this instance so that the hardship fund can continue to target support at those businesses that it was designed to help.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

His house was so large that he could let the legislature use four rooms. He was one of the wealthiest men in the town but he was not the only successful Orcadian businessman there. About a quarter of the men who formed the first Winnipeg Board of Trade, in March , were Orcadians or the sons of Orcadians: John Inkster and his son Colin, William Drever, Robert Tait, James Clouston, William Flett and George Kennedy.Three of the Board of Trade members have had roads named after them: Bannatyne Avenue, Inkster Bouled and Tait Avenue. There are two more named after Orcadian settlers: Mowat Road after Edward Mowat from Orphir and Setter Street after Andrew Setter, or Seatter. It is no surprise that Orcadians played such a prominent part in the early le of Winnipeg because they were there right from the start: in the Red River Valley.All through the th Century Orkney men went to work for the Hudson’s Bay Company. At its peak, in ,  of the  employees were Orcadian. Most of them came home but a good number settled in the Red River Valley: the colony south of Lake Winnipeg founded by the Earl of Selkirk for Highlanders displaced by the Clearances. The HBC had granted the land on condition that their men could retire there.The colony struggled through its early years but things settled down after the union of the HBC with the North-West Company in . Shetland pioneer Issac Cowie wrote:And it was these Orkneymen, with other veterans of the fur trade…, coming in sufficient numbers to defend it, who made permanent the settlement of Red River.”…Douglas Hill, in The Opening of the Canadian West , described the birth of Winnipeg, within the Red River Settlement, when warehouses and stores were built near the HBC#s Upper Fort Garry.#The collection of ramshackle log or frame buildings, with one or two solid houses, was at first called McDermotville after its leading citizen, an Irish settler-turned-trader named Andrew McDermot, who with his son-in-law, A G B Bannatyne, erected Winnipeg#s first buildings. Soon the town#s shops were thriving, and challenging the Fort as the settlement#s focal point#In  the prairie path that had been graced with the name #Main Street# was properly surveyed, graded and furnished with one or two culverts . It was a symptom of the magnicent optimism that prevailed. Yet the optimists were justied: Winnipeg and Manitoba were on the threshold of great things.  vw, px\"  The full version of this article can be found on page  of this week’s edition of The Orcadian. Patricia Long is a local tour guide based in Stenness, with a particular interest in social and family history.

Hatston will be open from .am to .pm and Garson from .am to .am. Both will be closed between .pm and .pm.Andrew Drever, vice-chair of Orkney Islands Council’s Development and Infrastructure Committee, said: “We thank folk for their patience while our sites were closed, as we waited for national advice on essential travel in Scotland to change.“I hope people will welcome the step-by-step approach we are taking to opening the sites again and understand the need for them to operate dferently to the way they did before the pandemic.“This is to ensure the safety of our staff and visitors to the sites. Limiting the number of cars and visitors on site at any particular time will enable social and physical distancing. We would urge those visiting to stay at least two metres away from staff and from other visitors on site.”Councillor Drever said: “Both sites are likely to be very busy for the first few days. To avoid the risk of waiting in long queues, we would ask folk to use them onlyit is absolutely necessary.“As a way to spread visits across the week, we are suggesting that you make your visit –possible – on your normal bin collection day.

a new and continuous cough or a high temperature # are being reminded to isolate themselves for seven days.Anyone  in a household where someone has symptoms should still isolate for  days.England says thank you, Boris. #You can now sunbath!#. Now, why does not Nicola change the dictate for Shetland  We would love to sunbath also, between the snow showers!!!!!😂😂😂😂How fortunate that the Scottish, Welsh and Irish leaders are maintaining their more sensible , balanced and wary approaches .Enlighten us Haydn, why is the infection rate lowerin England than in Wales and Scotland  I for one am not the least confused by the messages, just what is confusing you She niver agrees wIth what the rest off the UK IS DOINGBruce, you make it look asNicola, is acting like a Tory##..The Tory policy being##..me, me, me and melolSince you appear to not know, there has been confusion in Britain today about the actual meaning of BoJo’s statement yesterdayand , as I write, he is trying to explain himself away on TV. THAT shouldn’t be necessary should it  But, in true B J fashion he is resorting to make do and mend bluster. I am mindful of the blind leading the blind.Let decisions be made by scientists not ill equipped dabbling politicians.That little pat on the head should appeal to you !!But never mind Nicola is letting us out exercise twice a day. It is a shame we are all being channelled into the same crowded places, through the same gates and chokepoints whilst the wide-open spaces and beaches of Shetland are closed down to the majority!!In the present serious crisis she is in full agreement with Wales and Ireland but not with England. How fortunate that is.Britain is no longer ruled by England now that devolution has taken place. Boris Johnson claimed to be PM of 🇬🇧 Britain.He surely meant🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 not 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 Scotland or 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿Wales.Westminster is reluctant to let goIt is extraordinary sad news from Care Homes and Care Workers, but not unexpected. It takes months of training and years of experience to Barrier nurse to prevent cross-infection. Even the use of PPE requires extensive training. Our most vulnerable people conjugated into crowded homes was an accident just waiting to happen. Hopefully, next time, our care workers will have extensive professional training cross infection control with qualications and wages to match. Our most vulnerable, not all be herded into care homes but perhaps into a chalet system where separation and quarantine would be so much more effective..What is the R rate for Shetland  Looks like zero The politicians # all of them can #go away# .Do your gardening, go fishing, go for a walk whenever and where ever you want. Get the kids back into school. Get our economy open and people back to work.This is my opinion.Dive, e , e # incoming!!!What do you want  A Country with a minimised death toll but teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, or a country that#s suffered a higher death toll, and while perhaps shaken somewhat financially, is still resilient enough to continue without any great undue hardship for the survivors.England at present seems to be trying to steer an admittedly somewhat shaky course towards the latter, the rest of the UK, unfortunately seem hell bent on taking the direct route straight to the former.You cannot sustain increased Governmental expenditure and decreased Governmental income for any longer than the very short term, it called burning the candle from both ends#. We#ve been doing it now for  weeks### Very soon the time will come when Governmental leaders will have to make decisions on how many deaths are acceptable collateral damage to allow them to provide the services the majority need and keep their country afloat. The longer they leave it to make that decision, the more rushed, and by consequence, less appropriate, it is likely to be.There is no vaccine, there is no #cure#. Unfortunately some are going to have to take a hit for the team.It’s unfortunate that three centuries of free-market capitalism hasn’t generated enough wealth to feed the country for more than three months without going bankrupt but don’t worry Michael. Many people share your concerns about the economy and the government is onto it:A confidential Treasury assessment of the coronavirus crisis leaked to Theargues that it will require measures including a two-year public sector pay freeze in order to “boost investor confidence# in the British economy. So, a round of grateful applause for the NHS Staff, Care Workers, Police and everyone at London Transport.I hope the nurses are enjoying all the clapping and rattling of pots and pans every Thursday because that is all they are going to get.It is reassuring to know that things really are ing to normal.At least a public sector pay freeze will not discriminate. It will apply equally across the board and affect everyone from care home cleaners on minimum wage to the head of health and social care at Labour controlled North Lanarkshire council, salary £,“Some are going to have to take a hit for the team.”Yes Michael, in more ways than one.Well put, Malcolm.Incidentally, there is no freeze on public sector wages. Typical nonsense and  information being leaked, another left-wingPR leak from socialist civil servant perhaps I think it was the the Argntine president when speaking about Covid  said, #you can recover from a drop in GDP, you cannot recover from death#Fernández makes a good point. The Argentine economy is taking a battering and so is our own but we need to see things in perspective:Last month, Morningstar ran an article about the likely effect of the Coronavirus lockdown on share idends to be paid out by U.K. companies listed on the London Stock Exchange.It set out four possible scenarios, best-case, worst-case, and two “realistic” estimates within that range. In the best-case scenario, overall idends fall % to £. billion, and in the worst they more than halve to £. billion.More recent comments in The Financial Times suggest that we are heading towards a midway point between the best-case and worst-case scenarios while Reuterswarned of a possible % drop in idends “ the situation continues to worsen.”If the economy can afford idend payments of £ billion during the lockdown, I suspect that it is strong enough to recover. Of course, the FT and Reuters are known to be simmering cesspits of socialist subversion, so possibly more fake news.p.s.For the avoidance of any unnecessary tantrums:“The Morning Star” is three words with two spaces whereas “Morningstar” is just one word with no spaces.The simple fact is unavoidable this virus is here to stay. One day we will all meet it. The single most important thing is to keep the numbers down, so ICUs are not swamped, learn the best therapies to reduce the death toll as much as is practical and research for treatments and a vaccine. Try and avoid peak outbreaks, especially in winter, when the flu   covid combination will be nasty. Isolate our most vulnerable, maybe for a very long time and leave people to chose. I am approaching  years old and have no intention of isolating forever. In due course, I will get this virus and take my chances. I would instead rather enjoy my time than clamber fearfully into a sterile hole forever!!! As for Sturgeons exercise twice a day, she can stick that where the sun does not shine. The simple fact is being fit is perhaps my and everyone best chance for survival, twice a day exercising and the rest of my time on my sweet derriere is stupid, just as Nicola#s latest dictates!!!Ian#s reply to Malcolm#s well reasoned contribution oddly fails to address it.Why I’m reminded of the proud mother watching her son taking part in the passing out parade at Sandhurst.She noticed that everyone was out of step apart from her son!Oh dear, did I just read #BO JO#s policy actually worked# Thats plainly pants, pure and simple.Briefly, to Michael#s point, it is only recently that we paid off our war debt to the USA, so some financial mechanisms will be found.But I think I heard Portugal went into lockdown straight after their first COVID  death, whereas the UK waited for over a hundred. Plainly things could have been very dferent, very much better, and acting quicker would have been far cheaper, with far less loss of le, and a quickerto a ing economy.But it would have also required people being put before profit right from the start.So it really had been business as usual from the bottom feeding disaster capitalists that run the UK.#BO JO#s policy actually worked# indeed.That would be laughableit wasn#t so tragic.Sadly without vaccines and anti-virals, it is that simple. The fact is it has only just started and will be with us until we are all immune or dead. Let us pray for the former and immunity by vaccination. To coin a cliche, it will be total isolation for the most vulnerable until herd immunity develops, as with every infectious viral disease in human history! Development of immunity and resistance is what will stopCovid  eventually, nothing , as withPolio, Smallpox, Measles, Herpes et alNo. We need to keep as many people alive as possible until vaccine is developed.People are not simply expendable.Effective PPE supplies and speed of sufficient testing is critical to this.The Tory led, Tory delayed UK response has been woeful on these.No scope for argument there.Thousands have died that need not have.No scope for argument there either.It has been an ideologically misled catastrophe. genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced # genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced #But now that you point out about all those genetic iations, we probably ought to phone them and tell them to call of the hunt since they#ve probably not thought of that. Best just let nature take its course and get the economy on track with hundreds of thousands of deaths, a swamped NHS and a profoundly sick and worried population.Bo Jo#s policy was actually endorsed and followed to the letter by all the devolved Governments of the Uk until we got our knickers in a twist about a slogan. I never realised Nicola was a # bottom feeding disaster capitalists # for endorsing Bo Jo#s policy for so long. She only on Sunday became confused and what a fuss out that she made. On the bright side, we may legally exercise twice daily now, what outstanding leadership!Ian your unwavering faith in BoJo the clown, in the absence of any logical rationale or evidence for doing so, is truly astonishing.Robbie, I have no faith in any politician, but I do find Bo-Jo so much better than the other clowns in the circus. I love the way he routed the remoners, destroyed the Socialist horror of Corbyn and so antagonised, confounded and confused his opponents. Most are left with nothing by puerile and infantile comments to make, such as Bo-Jo the Clown. Is that Robbie the level of your wit and argument Again, Tory apologist spin from Tinkler. From mid-Jan through Feb Boris missed  COBRA meetings on COVID  to which Sturgeon was not invited.Yes the UK#s other parliaments fell into line once the Bullingdon Club realised there was to be no Britains Open for Business, herd-immunity-now approach. Elements of that thinking lingered on and are resurfacing now, not the least within the twisted outpouring of local eugenicists.Best information as of   .On that basis I think we need Nicola Sturgeon down here in England as well!Act in haste, repent at leisure seems to sum up such weakness.I am trying very hard toto see things from your perspective, but I cannot ignore the indicators and commentary that indicates that the UK economy will officially be in recession by the end of  Q.GDP has fallen by % in the first quarter of this year and predicted to be possibly as high as % in the second quarter.The Bank of England has tried to put a brave face on things by saying #the impact is likely to be temporary with activity rebounding strongly once social distancing measures are lted#. The question is when will social distancing be lted.Are you advocating that we just wait and see how things pan out, maybe the idea of a V shaped recovery will happen in the rd and th quarters, a vaccine will be developed in time and the world can go back to the #old normal#A simple warning from history # Recession , Depression, War.Recession, depression, war. Exactly. We know that the mortality rate is roughly .%. UK population is approx  million. Let#s say we just let the virus take its course, albeit slowed due to some adjustments to how we work and % of the population catch it. An effective treatment or vaccine is by no means guaranteed. % of  million is . million. .% of that is about , deaths. Then there are the hundreds of millions of working days lost to people off sick with the virus. Then there are the people suffering long term consequences of the virus and the cost of caring for them. How is this a recipe for a healthy economy  How will this level of death and suffering motivate investment or spending  Where does this assumption that we can just get going again like things were before come from  The world has changed. I know it feels good to bury our heads in the sand and think we can just go back to how things were and let a few old folks die. But that is profoundly naive. There is no simple answer. Except Mr. Tinkler#s. Make of that what you will.Ali asks: # genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced #I don#t know Ali.I#m not a dentist.To my understanding there does not need to be an exact genetic match for vaccines to be sufficiently helpful, but as I can#t trace my male line back over countless generations maybe Ali should consult a bard or a sage instead.There is, and has been, something of a medical research race on for understanding of transmission, for patient management treatment and for vaccines.Prompter action would have kept more folk alive longer whilst progress was made. The usual suspects are welcome to argue that and which way they may like, but it won#t change matters.There has been medical research and hard work for years into a reliable vaccine for corona viruses. How are they doing on that front  You don#t need to be a dentist to find that outYes Ali, but you do need to know the dference between a Virus and Venus, RNA and DNA, a vaccine and socialist vacillation, that is where humanists and left-wing ideologues come up a little short!!As I#m not a puller of teeth its a challenge to tell Ali how this virus dfers from the common cold, or why the research may be getting more funding and focus than the industry and government gave previously.You stated that you don’t need to be a dentist to find that out but, to be fair and reasonable about this , someone with medical training is likely to be better equipped than someone without to come up with insights which could be useful. In all probability Ian will not strike gold but how thankful we would behe did !!Fake news  Trump tried to buy Moussa and replace the old stone buildingswith a shiny new tower and Miss Sturgeon will use the proceeds to building a border wall.The deal came unstuck when China claimed Shetland as part of its North Sea and Atlantic territorial waters. It is understood that Miss Sturgeon has been learning Madrin while Scotlandis locked upOwen Jones has denied that he supports Identity politics, woke culture and he is not a social justice warrior.CNNhires Greta Thunberg to appear on a  as an expert on Covid .Best not to bother with why UK has biggest obesity problem in Europe. Such inquiry requires social science, some sociological imagination and a grain of empathy.Much easier to blame those poor plebs who haven#t got a grip.No need to invest on ending intergenerational deprivation and increasing opportunity too.Playgrounds for schools in poorer parts of our cities Why bother.Simples Peter, integrate #Care# for young and old into the NHS. That would include a voucher towards joining a gym or active participation sports club for every citizen irrespective of wealth. Those who chose not to use it, be it on their heads, it is their own health and wellbeing which will suffer. Covid  is ruthless with the obese and unfit,blame and empathy are not part le and death struggle of potentially fatal illness.Ian#s suggestion does nothing to end intergenerational deprivation, aka poverty. Poverty, and other social ills, can result in obesity in ious ways.Obesity simply is not automatically a #lestyle choice#.To suggest so is to indulge in inflammatory victim blaming and victim shaming.Not all single parents on benefits, depending also on whatever the Foodbank might provide, can easily promote healthy lestyles for all of their children.Many are struggling with issues beyond Ian#s limited appreciation.Seven year olds don#t generally make lestyle choices. Fat cells, once over produced in response to whatever unwelcome stimulus, don#t simply disappear. They hang around calling to be filled.Not all parents have time or money to afford Shetland Recreational Trust#s offerings.They dont all have the ability to get their children to the leisure facilities.It is only #simples#you take an uncaring and simplistic approach. Ian knows this intellectually as it has been pointed out more than once. Yet he persists. Odd. A little more fellow feeling might stem his approach.All I am suggesting Peter is an attempt to control excessive eating of Junk foodswith integrating our NHH with free access to all to a gym or active participation sports club for every citizen irrespective of wealth. Just how can that be #to indulge in inflammatory victim blaming and victim shaming. #Where are you getting your figures on childhood obesity in Shetland from Ian  Surely not from the newspaper article you’ve linked below, which is from  and quotes figures for adults from  It is mildly reassuring that Ian Tinkler has #no faith in politicians# presumably including BoJo the Clown. This Government has bungled it#s handling of the Covid- crisis on an industrial scale. Exercise Cygnus in October  highlighted serious shortcomings in the UK#s Emergency Preparedness Resilience and Response Plan to a pandemic. Since then PPE stock levels were run down by %. Being made aware of the virus in December  no preparation was started until March when the herd immunity strategy was quickly jettisoned. Britain refused to participate in the EU procurement scheme for PPE leading to farcical attempts to obtain PPE from some guy in Turkey who made T shirts. Unsurprisingly the PPE was unusable. Rather than get ventilators from established manufacturers The Government ignored their offers of help and went to Tory donors like James Dyson who managed to produce  of the  needed. Flights bringing  people a day into the Uk without test or quarantine only stopped  months after lockdown. People being placed in care homes without being tested. Unbelievably lockdown is being eased in England without test track and trace being implemented. We have the second highest death total in the world.England does not have the highest number of deaths in Europe, and England has a far higher recovery rate than many in European nations.The Care homes in England have about half the death rate of their Scotish counterparts and the Death Rate per capita in England is considerably less than in Scotland. Just to keep you up to date, Nicola has just today,reversed her political decision on lockdown. The statistics are available online however, ferreting the Scotish records is problematic. For some reason, the SG is far less transparent with the Data than the English. Figures below are slightly out of date but show the comparison.The population of England. ,, No of deaths. , Death ratio. .So in summary, the gospel according to Ian Tinkler is that BoJo the clown hasn#t put his size  feet in it at all as the death rate is higher in Scotland than in England.Ian, I think your calculations are the wrong way round and show what you might call a #survival ratio# rather than a death ratio. There#s also a decimal place error but for the purposes of comparison that doesn#t really matter.If you work it out in deaths per million of population you can see that Scotland has a lower death rate.England:  from      per mPlease do not put words in my mouth Robbie. What is happening in Scotland is down to The SG and Nicola, as theFM and former Health Secretary. Trying to make political capital out of people dying is morally reprehensible, obnoxious and malign. Bo-Jo and Nicola have equal responsibility for any mistakes, they both shared and followed the best science they could. For once they were in harmony and agreement. The NHS was not overwhelmed, lives were saved, be thankful for that. Fortunately, the injection of disinfectant, we will leave to a real clown who is now mainlining hydroxychloroquine!!! Perhaps Darwinism will step in soon! God save America.Oh this is too funny to pass by! Mr Tinkler creates his own, entirely , Coronavirusfigures to make a political point and is immediately shot down. He then states that only an idiot would try to use coronavirus figures to make political points. Well, on that we totally agree # only an idiot would.Ray try and understand the dference between political comment and malicious point-scoring.ian seems to be using dferent measurement criteria between scotland and england and even dferent data within scottish figures. on  may he has scottish figure  but on  may it has gone up to .the lower figure is the one for deaths from positive test cases, the higher one is all deaths where covid is mentioned on death certicate.in his original calculation for england he uses positive test figuresthus for accurate comparison he should use the lower scottish figure also. this is what alan leask has done and produced an accurate comparison.The vaccine is focusing on a very small sequence in the S viral protein which enables it to bind to the ACE receptor on human cells in mucosal linings and infect them. There isn’t much room for mutation there without the virus losing its ability to bind to that receptor. Other mutations mentioned, in other parts of the virus, enable “strains” of virus to be tracked. Reproduction is subject to errorand billions upon billions of virus are being produced, so mutations will take place. However the critical site for immunity is probably conserved.I did read it Ian # that’s how I know it’s completely irrelevant. Now you’ve produced aarticle from ! So, just to be straight, your reasoning for easing the Coronavirus lockdown in  is a  year old newspaper article about obesity  I don’t think that’s the real reason is it now  Could it be that you’re putting your political prejudices first again  Not that it matters of course. Now even the FMs most recent slight adjustments to lockdown only allow five-mile car run to a place to exercise. That does not get a Glaswegian far from the centre of Glasgow. It just does exactly the worst thing, concentrates people together in highly populated areas. The counterargument regards spreading the virus into new areas is fallacious. Just in case our FM had not noticed, the virus has already disseminated widely and in the great outdoors of Scotland Social Distancing is a lot easier than in Glasgow or any other city.So, the death ratio in Scotland from Covid , according to the self-proclaimed STE expert is .. That, I believe, is patently incorrect, not to mention entirely absurd, and would mean that . people from  person had died from the disease. As an analogy, based on a notional teeth count,someone had, let’s say, ten teeth and subsequently had one removed then the ratio of teeth removed to those not having been removed would be  , or %. The “survival ratio”, as someone referred to, ie the teeth remaining, is the remainder as a proportion of the whole, in other words  out of , or %, assuming that the dentist extracts within remit. The two equations are not inter-changeable. This, however, from the statistical and other real experts acknowledged in their fields is very interesting: A good point and as always I appreciate a good dental analogy to illustrate the dference between death and survival rates. I know here we like to fight tooth and nail about such things, but it is good to see someone #filling in# the gaps here. And as for Mr. Tinkler, he certainly puts the effort in and even though we may disagree, it keeps things on here lively. He deserves a plaque.Michael Inkster, Try .Decimal point one, not  to  . Actually maths was wrong recalculation above. Simples absurdly so, evenmental arithmetic was a little rusty first time round!!Since it appears to be much more virulent and deadly than flu the future would seem to be less than rosy.In fact, depressingly gloomy and all the statistical information so diligently presented will be consignedto no more than being purely academic and capable of making not a scrap of dference.I am more intrigued into the sources of  major viruses having a global impact from China, and what is the Chinese Government doing about the health and safety of food products and the, apparent, lack of any proper procedures in which to prevent further outbreaks  What is the WHO doing in regards to monitoring potential infections from China and or limiting the movements of live animals in poorly developed hygiene conditions, allegedly We hear the origins of such viruses, but no information regarding preventative measures taking place to restrict and confine such health hazards within an area and to stop this from spreading further afield  Why has there been no ban on the sale and transport of certain foods from China Is the whole process of live animal meat production having to be totally reviewed by the Chinese government or is it a case of waiting until something even greater forces them to act Should we enforce our own standards of Health and Safety onto other countries in terms of a trade agreement or should market forces have a free for all without any restrictions, including Health and Safety  Should this be reviewed JOSEPH NIVEN has hit the nail squarely on the head.

It looks increasingly likely that any exit from lockdown and safe re-opening of tourism and hospitality businesses could be during the low season.#Without financial support to tide them over, that could be the nail in the coffin for many businesses.“In Shetland, like where in Scotland, earnings from tourism during the spring and summer months sustains people through the winter and it is a real worry that coronavirus hit just when the visitor season was starting.#It is clear that a -month plan, at least, is needed to ensure that viable businesses can survive to provide a living for their owners and be ready to safely welcome visitors again when the time is right.”Speaking via video link earlier this week, Mr Carmichael welcomed the Chancellor of the Exchequer#s announced extension to the furlough scheme to protect jobs – but added more was needed to help tourism.“Here in the Northern Isles we particularly see that in the visitor economy, which is crucial to us,# he added.#The assistance for bed and breakfast operators, or operators of self-catering accommodation, leaves too many people without the assistance they need.“A support scheme that finishes at the end of August, or September or whenever it will be, simply will not be adequate in parts of the country such as ours.#Those parts of the country that have seasonal tourism require a -month programme, or  the tourism industry that will be left to be resurrected at the end of this process will be that much weaker, and the rebuilding and recovery that much more dficult.” on Wednesday also heard from struggling tourism businesses.One BB owner said she had been unable to apply for support funds as they required applicants to have paid businesses rates, whereas she paid domestic council tax.Living Lerwick has also raised the plight of small tourism operators.Project manager Emma Miller said that as some did not have a business banking account they had been unable to apply for the Creative or Tourism and Hospitality Enterprises Fund, which opened in Scotland to support the industry. raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"more vessels but aprils gross tonnage is well down on last year ","story":"Lerwick Harbour saw a big reduction in shipping tonnage during April compared with the same month last year – although the number of arrivals was actually up slightly.A total of  vessels called, compared with  in April , but the overall tonnage dropped from , to ,grt.The deficit was partly due to no cruise ships callinglast year, although ferries, live fish carriers and oil traffic were all also down considerably.The April arrivals this year included  fishing boats,  workboats tenders,  ro ro ferries,  live fish carriers, eight oil boats, eight tugs, five tankers, five ferries and three pilot boats.The fishing vessels comprised  Shetland,  British, three Danish, two French and one Norwegian boat.For the first four months of the year the overall number of arrivals at Lerwick holds up reasonably well with  – , as compared to , in .

When Britain was close to defeat, and the entire British Army was trapped at Dunkirk, King George VI called for a National Day of Prayer on th May, . This would be the first of seven such days of prayer during the War.“In a national broadcast, His Majesty urged the people of the United Kingdom to turn back to God in a spirit of repentance and plead for Divine help.”Mr Stevenson said: “In this time of great trouble, when thousands of lives have been lost to the Coronavirus and many families have been left bereaved I would ask the Orange Institution to stand firm and take part in a day of prayer.“As an Institution, our faith is of great importance and it is appropriate at this time that we set aside a day to pray for our nation during this pandemic. We should pray for the NHS and the frontline workers, for families, and for our government who face dficult decisions.“I would encourage as many members of the Orange Institution as possible to take part in this day of prayer. Also, raise awareness of this event with your family and friends. The day of prayer should be in the quiet of your home.”The Grand Master added: “I have been thinking of a Bible verse I would like to share. It is Romans chapter  verse  ‘Be joyful in hope, patient in affliction, faithful in prayer’.”To assist with the day of prayer, a special page has been set up on the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland website – goli.org.uk dayofprayer - which includes suggested points for prayer and passages of scripture.

The move is vital to secure a stronger future for the business which is urging politicians to support its drive to produce , hydrogen buses in the next four years.The  staff that remain would be more than a ten-fold increase in the number of employees inherited by the management team when it bought Wrightbus out of administration in October , with hopes to grow the workforce to , by the end of .“When we saved Wrightbus from administration last year, there were only about  employees, and since then we have grown the workforce to ,” said Mr Atwal.“The decision has been taken to trim the workforce to the size we believe we will need to see us through to the end of the year.”The redundancies are a necessary measure given the economic slowdown as a result of the current Coronavirus crisis. However, it has not altered the long-term vision of prosperity for the company.“Throughout the COVID- pandemic, while we furloughed a large section of the workforce, we also kept about  engineers, designers and sales staff working to make sure we can take future orders of buses and work on long-term projects, which will provide security and stability for Wrightbus in the coming years,” said Mr Atwal.The Wrightbus factory has created the world’s first hydrogen-electric double-decker bus, which emits only water and there is a great belief that in the coming years this will see a large number of orders come in.There are already strong sales for the delivery of buses in London and Aberdeen this year, with more cities due to follow suit.Mr Atwal said: “We see the future in zero-emission hydrogen and battery-electric transport and have positioned the business accordingly. Our vision is to have , people working for us by the end of  and we hope to be in a position to re-hire some of those who have been made redundant.“We believe green fuel is the future and will bring a brighter future to Northern Ireland over the coming years.”A consultation will begin with staff on Monday, May , and Wrightbus will be supporting staff throughout the process, eventhis has to be done virtually due to current Government guidelines.

The announcement by management is therefore profoundly regrettable.“Management plans to make redundant  employees and to bring forward a phased-process of reducing agency staffing affecting up to  workers. Every job lost is a heavy blow for the inidual concerned, their household, the wider community and economy – especially in the face of the current Covid- pandemic.“Ahead of this announcement being made, I spoke to senior management to call on them to utilise the Coronavirus Jobs Retention Scheme to protect jobs and retain skilled workers the prospect of workers being thrown onto the dole queues at this time is unacceptable.“Management confirmed they will be proceeding to a -day consultative period on their proposals but that they will consider furlough as an option. They sought to reassure us of their ambitions for Wrightbus in Ballymena and its centrality to their plans.“Instead of reducing employment, we need to ramp up production of hydrogen-buses to curb greenhouse gas emissions and transition to a more environmentally-sustainable economy. “The Wrightbus workforce is perfectly positioned to make a vital contribution to that they have the skills to build the buses at the heart of any future green transport policy.“The request for furlough will be top of Unite’s agenda in the consultation process. Having played a lead role in securing the transfer of Wrightbus, which faced liquidation, to the Bamford group we are determined to bring as many jobs as possible to Ballymena as a result”, Mr Brash concluded.

We were fortunate enough to have mummy and daddy at home with us and they didn#t die in hospital.But the sacrices we had to make, my sister couldn#t come to see them because she just had surgery to her ankle so she never got to see daddy and mummy before they died at all.When you#re Joe Bloggs and abide by the laws of the country you can#t do it. Yet he seems to have taken the law into his own hands.It#s gone too far. Why are they stipulating rules to keep society safe and he deems himself worthy to do whatever he wants Read More Coronavirus: Daughter#s #heartbreak and nightmare# after both her parents pass awayMs O#Connell said she also became ill with the virus but still had to care for her family.There are lots of people who get the virus and can continue doing what they need to do. So he could have continued looking after his children instead of bringing them to his grandparents to be looked after.When I look at the loss that we have had in our family, when mummy and daddy died I had the disease and continued to look after them.So you can fight on through it. It took me a long time to get over the disease and I#ve only recently got rid of the symptoms completely.As restrictions begin to ease in Northern Ireland, she appealed for the public not to become complacent.When I watch people walking in groups past my window, I feel like telling them to come into my living room to see what this disease is like, she said. It#s not a pretty thing to watch. I do worry about there being another mad outbreak in a couple of months as the rules soften.We buried a mummy and a daddy and I don#t think there#s any concept of how catastrophic their lives would bethe same thing happened to them - and I mean catastrophic.I was having lunch with my son there and I had to say to him that my head was still in a spin, nearly six weeks afterwards.Why is it that a Chief Medical Officer in Scotland had to be let go, but he stays because he#s the Prime Minister#s friend  He should be let go.Reacting to Mr Cumming#s Downing Street briefing, the SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said his behaviour had critically undermined the Government#s public health message.For all the confusion in their approach, the Stay at Home message was not complex. No one could reasonably interpret that as giving a green light to travelling hundreds of miles to Durham and then travelling further to a beauty spot to test your eyesight, he said.This is now a test of this Conservative government. They have a simple question to answer - what is more important, saving Dominic Cummings job or saving lives  There is only one answer.He added that those separated from friends and family needed certainty their sacrices had not been made in vain.

Photo by Peter MorrisonBy Mark BainMay   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailIt#s mid-afternoon on the end-of-May bank holiday and at the jewel in the Co Down coastline, the mountains of Mourne sweep down to the sea as they always have.A light dusting of dark cloud kisses the top of Slieve Donard as it towers high over Newcastle#s Donard Park.But today the cars are snaking past the entrance rather than going in to take on what would normally be a vain quest to find a parking spot.There#s a sharp breeze along the seafront, a suspicion of rain in the air, but since when has that ever put people off trying to spend their bank holiday Monday ambling along to the soundtrack of the waves rolling in, treating the kids to an ice cream or stick of rock and taking in the amusements But there#s little joy to be found in Joyland today. The shutters are firmly down.The cars pass by along the main street of the town but most don#t stop. They come, they see nothing to do, they pass on by.Perhaps they were expecting more  But in these times of lockdown, although now with slightly relaxed restrictions, all you can do is queue for an ice cream or a snack at one of the parlours open along the street.There#s a sense of desperation in the air. The families have come, desperate to entertain the children, relieved to be out of the confines of home, but they#ve found little in the way of amusement. Cyclists have a free run along the footpaths. People jog on by unimpeded.Even the front of the Newcastle Centre, which is normally lined with scores of motorcycles as leather-clad riders enjoy traditional May bank holiday runs to the coast, is barren. Only a few bikes are parked up. The rest trickle by. They have come in hope and left in disappointment that things, quite simply, aren#t how they used to be.From the bridge over the Shimna River in the heart of the town, a solitary family sit below on the sandy beach as the children play. Social distancing doesn#t matter as there#s no one to socially distance from today.Sunday, from all accounts, was a dferent story. Long queues of cars lined up to get into the town as families gathered to enjoy the clear blue skies and sunshine, despite warnings from health officials and police that they should act responsibly and reasonably over the holiday weekend.Perhaps, by Monday afternoon, word had got around that getting out of the car in one of the local seaside resorts wasn#t worth the effort.And shorn of the usual caravan owners, with the gates locked at the Mourneview park on the main road into town, there was plenty of room for the few willing to break free from home for the day to stroll around town at their leisure.And as they stretched their legs they did so under the watchful eye of the PSNI, a police car stationed outside an ice cream parlour as a reminder of the times we#re living in.Leaving town, the threatened rain starts to fall. A day that many began in the hope that some things were starting to move back towards a normal way of le hadn#t moved as much as they had wanted.

His work is currently part of collections held in Dublin, London, Poland, America, Japan and South Korea. He also has work on show at the Imperial War Museum.His postcard drawings will each have a title and explanation on the back and will be simply signed #Nicholl#.He explains: The drawings on the postcards and envelopes are based on places both of us have visited and loved.I plan to open an old phone book and stick a pin on the page and wherever it lands, that is the address I will use.I can only hope when people receive them that they don#t think, #What is this load of old crap # and throw them out.The drawings have been inspired by artwork and places he and Elaine have seen while on their regular travels through the museums of Europe.He adds: This is an unimaginable nightmare people are going through and it is the good things people are doing for one another that have moved me so much.I don#t plan to be the Bangor Banksy which is why I have put my surname on the postcards and who knows, maybe in years to come, when I am long gone, they could be worth something I will be posting them in the next few weeks andthey survive, that#s great andthey don#t, then that#s fine, too. Hopefully some people will appreciate them.When his  cards are complete, Leslie hopes to create a new collection of paintings based on the cards for an exhibition to be held when galleries are finally able to reopen.

Routines have generally been disrupted so they haven#t been getting out as much during the day. If people are working at home, there isn#t the same change of position as there would bethey were in their normal work area, such as simple things like walking to meet a colleague or going to the canteen for lunch.With that routine gone, it#s very dficult for people to exercise as normal.Health experts have long warned that people who spend long hours in front of the computer are at a higher risk of developing injuries in both the upper and lower body. Fionnuala said one key area for those working from home is ensuring their computer or laptop is always at eye level, eventhat means having it raised up on books. She added: Really,people can work from a table they should and change their position regularly. Their elbows should be at  degrees and feet flat on the floor.It#s best not to sit on a sofa when working butthere#s no alternative then use cushions to improve posture.When setting up a work station at home, people should move often and take plenty of mini-breaks so that they don#t sit for too long at any one time, be it making a cup of coffee, going to the bathroom or taking a short walk around their house or garden.Fionnuala has a similar message around staying active for the elderly or vulnerable who are shielding at this time.There are a lot of people with conditions like arthritis who will be finding their affected joints stfer because they are staying in one position for too long.If your posture is poor, your back and neck are vulnerable to injury and staying in a bad position for too long can also impact on your mood. Staying inside for too long and not being outdoors can equally affect your sleep and energy levels.A lot of the patients we are treating at the minute say that being stuck at home means they can#t get the exercise they need to help manage the symptoms of their condition.If we can get people to set things up quite well for themselves while at home and move regularly, we may prevent new problems arising further down the line and assist those with pre-existing issues who are trying to manage their symptoms.With gyms currently closed, Fionnuala said walking is the easiest and most inexpensive activity for people of all ages to do as part of their daily exercise, and she has warned against doing too much too soon when facilities reopen again, to avoid injuries.Advice, tips and tools to help you make the best choices about your health and wellbeing can be found at www.nhs.uk live-wellFionnuala#s top tips for staying well:l Move regularly in any way you can.l Try to take some exercise daily .l Check your workstation.l Connect with friends family by phone or social media.l Eat healthy, well balanced meals, stay well hydrated and get plenty of sleep.

In the case of World Record breaking father and son duo Tommy and Eoin Hughes, they are the perfect example. When the next Guinness Book of Records peels off the press, their time of four hours,  minutes and  seconds from last Octobers Frankfurt marathon will have etched their names into the realms of greatness.

Eoin has already been plotting how to put his learning from Frankfurt into another drive for the line. And, during a relaxed -minute chat, the words improve and achieve cropped up a combined total of  times. Welcome to the mindset of a winner. Michael McMullan: Tommy, I was talking to Eoin earlier about having your record officially announced and the long wait for it to be made official. Tommy Hughes: I left it all with Eoin to sort out, so I was happy enough to take a back seat and I am over the moon that this has been made official and it will be in the Guinness Book of World Records next year...its really good. googletag.cmd.push M McM: After all you have achieved in your career, where does this one sit  TH: It tops them all. Any other things I have achieved, I have achieved on my own. This is a father and son, it is above anything I have ever done. This is far better than going to the Olympics in . It is some achievement, something I never thought would ever happen or take place. M McM: Eoin, you started running later in your career, so when did you decide were going to go for this  Eoin Hughes: It was a podcast that mentioned a father and son combined , so I looked into it. I knew my Da was a decent runner and I thought we could do that … and this was before I had even ran a step. M McM: I notice you said decent... EH:I knew my Da could run : and at that time it was : or : for the combined time, so it gave me a three hour mark and felt I couldve done that back then, we wouldve broken it. But, it wasnt until I started running that I thought this isnt that easy so ithas always been in the back of mind, so when I started improving and my Da came back into running, it came back to the forefront and it was something we should aim for and should be able to beat. M McM: Was it your motivation for starting running  EH: Not to start off, but when I did, it was the factor then...to improve and try for it. M McM: What about you Tommy, did you think he was mad  TH: I definitely thought it was within our grasp and I think I cant improve. I am going over the hill and down the hill a bit. Eoin has got a lot to improve, so we can improve on the record again. If Londontakes place in October, we have a good chance of lowering it and getting a far better time, that not many people can reach for a while – to set it beyond anybody  coming along. M McM:Competition is a magical thing, isnt it  TH: Of course, I live on competition. M McM: Going back Tommy, where did running start for you  TH: I got married and moved from Lavey into Maghera and joined the local GAA cluband I had a bit of weight on and my brother in lawwas doing a bit of running for Magherafelt AC. I went out for a run with him and it ended up, as usual, a bit of a competition and I kinda beat him and thought Ill do a bit more here and I realised I was better at the running than the Gaelic football, so I dropped it and kept on improving at the running. Everything just drove from there, I got my breaks and I got obsessed with improving...like everyone does, they want to get better and it went from there. M McM: What age were you when you started the running  TH: I was  or  and I ran my first marathon when I was , in , and everything flowed into each other. That was the Derry marathon, I went back to Derry and a year later and won it again with a course record, so everything fell into place. M McM: Once you have that competitive edge, is it a constant numbers game where you are trying to beat targets  TH: You are just trying to improve all the time. I am doing that at my age, I am still trying to figure it all out and eke out any wee small things I can get a bit quicker on, but I know the older I get, the slower I get so it is a bit tougher at my age. I need more rest and at a younger age, you dont really need as much. I enjoy it, thats the main thing. If you dont enjoy it, you will just give it up. M McM: Eoin, what are your recollections of all of this  When did you realise what was happening  EH: Whenever I was younger, I can remember going to races all around the place, the whole family would be going to local races. I can remember the Belfast marathon, I knew my Da was good and that he was winning a lot of the races that we went to. He went to the Olympics, but it was not until I started running that I realised how good he was. My times are quick enough, but his times are still miles away from where I am at now. I would be rated as a decent runner now, but he was still miles ahead, sure he still takes half the young boys at races now. M McM: What age would you have been when your Da was at the Olympics  EH: I wouldve been seven, we were all at home and one thing I do remember is in the local town, there were these fridge magnets and one of them said Rock on Tommy that is one thing I will always remember. I remember watching on television, but we didnt see him because he wasnt up there going for the gold medal. M McM: Tommy, from your point of view, was it surreal being at the Olympics  TH: The problem was that I got a stress fracture on my foot at the end of January and the doctor told me I wouldnt be able to recover in time. I was on crutches for six weeks for rehabilitation, but I got there. I was glad to be there and soaking up the whole atmosphere of being there. I wanted to make sure I finished the marathon on the day and have something I will remember for the rest of my le. But, I wasnt at my peak performance and was below power. If thathadnt happened, I wouldve been up there, that is one of these things. M McM: There is nothing you can do at that point, with all that preparation there has to be frustration. TH: The doctor told me I wasnt going to be there, but I was glad to be there to run in the Olympics and be an Olympian. M McM: Running had got serious a long time before that for you. When did you really start to get into it  TH: Whenever I got good at running, thats when it got serious. I have always loved sports and to find out I was good at one sport, that was it...that was serious, I put everything into the one basket. M McM: What did the training schedule look like then  TH: It was seven days a week and twice a day. Id maybe do fivein the morning and  in the evening, do a bit of hill work, speed work and I was reading running magazines, taking what I could use out of it and try to improve. M McM: Eoin, you started a bit later. When did you really start to get into it  EH: It was probably in the last couple of years, I started to get my times down. I didnt start running until I was , I was doing local races and doing okay. I ran for Northern Ireland a couple of times last year, so it is probably within the last year, I said I am getting half decent here, I am getting better and I am at that stage where knocking on the door of getting Northern Ireland bests. M McM: Is time on your side  EH: Not really, I am . A lot of the athletes would only be finishing by now, whereas I am only starting. Well see. There are a few examples of older athletes starting late and doing very well into their early s, so there is a bit of hope there, but I am no spring chicken. M McM: I suppose you are able to tap into your father for advice on training. EH: I have him there when I need him. Even at the start, when my legs were sore - “Daddy how long are my legs going to be sore for” so from the very basic stuff like that, until now, to training and what I should do. Even before we went to Frankfurt, he said I needed to get the distance into the legs so the body would know how it feels. We went out and did  miles on a nice easy run...having that advice and knowing I have it, is great. I know a lot of people would love to have that. Anytime he is at races, I am sure people are askingwhat they should be doing...I have that any time I want it. M McM: Tommy, in all your years running, what sticks out for you above the rest  TH: Eoin crossing the line in Frankfurt and me asking him did we get it  and him not fit to speak and I am waiting for the answer and him saying yeah, we got it – that was brilliant. M McM: I remember that picture of Eoin gasping and you have your hand on his back... TH: I was asking him. Thats what we set out for and when I passed him I was thinking this is falling apart and how much is Eoin going to slow down and is he going to drop out of the race altogether, so I am going to have to go as hard as I can go now to try to stay within the realms of the record, so the pressure was on. I dont mind the pressure on myself, but I crossed the line and waited for Eoin to come. I will never forget it for the rest of my le, the sensation of waiting around and when he crossed the line, I was elated. M McM: For you Eoin, were you constantly looking at your watch  EH: Dad passed me with about three miles to go. I knew how long was gone and what pace he was doing. I knew what time he was going to run, so in my head I was doing maths of what I needed to do and what I was able to do...I was struggling to get to the line. I knewI ran a seven-minute mile from there to the finish, wed break it. The maths equation gave me the incentive to get to the finish line. M McM: Surely its hard to run, never mind having to count. EH: It was helping me though and taking my mind of the pain I was in. M McM: I remember when you told me about the achievement and about how you were going to beat it, it was the fact you said you would do it easily that jumped out at me. Do you need that as a goal, or is it something you firmly believe  EH: It is something we believe. I should be capable of running  minutes quicker and evenI run five minutes quicker, thats five minutes. I learned a lot from Frankfurt, it was my first go at a marathon and mistakes were made. Give me the next one and I will learn from them. M McM: What sort of mistakes do you mean, was it going too fast too early  EH: One of the biggest mistakes was being dependent on my own drinks. My Da said to me before the race it wasnt a good idea. We were sub elite, so I had all my personal drinks set out on the table. The elite, there was four bottles per table, but sub elite there was maybe a  bottles on a big long table and trying to get your drink, while running fast past it, that was a nightmare. It played on my mind that I missed bottles, so I will not do that again. I need to get more miles in the legs, so it is those things I need to improve on and will. M McM: Do you just colour code your bottle  EH: Some people had long sticks with flags on them to make them stand out, but my bottle was pretty basic. M McM: Is it now a case of waiting for the pandemic to end and seethe London marathon, or any of others will take place  You said that you couldnt focus fully until you got the date. EH: Once we have a certain marathon , we can put a good training block together. At the minute, for me, it is about building back as I had took a bit of time off. I do think now, we will get a marathon this year. Athletics Ireland are allowing groups of four athletes to train together. It gives hope that in two or three weeks time, we will be able to train up here in small groups. Down South, they are allowing bigger events from August, so the likelihood of Dublin going ahead could be a possibility. I think we will get something later on in the year, so it is time to build it up again. M McM: And Tommy, you have your own inidual records to beat. TH: Definitely, I have a km, a half-marathon and a marathon, I have all those to set in the over s , so I will be jumping at anything that comes along. I have broke the km in January, I have ran the World Record for k indoors, which is a bonus because I am not a track runner. I was looking forward to sweeping the board this year and then all thishappened. Whatever comes along at the end of the year, I am going to have to go for it. The marathon is what I want, it is the big one and any year, from here on in, the marathon is the one I am concentrating on, the other distances are a bonus. M McM: What is the marathon time you have in your sights  TH: The world record for over s is :, but I want to run under :. So whatever marathon comes up first, I will be trying to get into it and run it. I want to run a World Record this year and move on to next year and start again. M McM: For the father and son target, which one would you prefer  TH: London. EH: We had planned for London and the way they very the record on the day, that is our plan. That is our first choice... it goes ahead. So, well see what happens. sport@derrypost RELATED - Father and son clinch World Record. More...

That was the Derry marathon, I went back to Derry and a year later and won it again with a course record, so everything fell into place. M McM: Once you have that competitive edge, is it a constant numbers game where you are trying to beat targets  TH: You are just trying to improve all the time. I am doing that at my age, I am still trying to figure it all out and eke out any wee small things I can get a bit quicker on, but I know the older I get, the slower I get so it is a bit tougher at my age. I need more rest and at a younger age, you dont really need as much. I enjoy it, thats the main thing. If you dont enjoy it, you will just give it up. M McM: Eoin, what are your recollections of all of this  When did you realise what was happening  EH: Whenever I was younger, I can remember going to races all around the place, the whole family would be going to local races. I can remember the Belfast marathon, I knew my Da was good and that he was winning a lot of the races that we went to. He went to the Olympics, but it was not until I started running that I realised how good he was. My times are quick enough, but his times are still miles away from where I am at now. I would be rated as a decent runner now, but he was still miles ahead, sure he still takes half the young boys at races now. M McM: What age would you have been when your Da was at the Olympics  EH: I wouldve been seven, we were all at home and one thing I do remember is in the local town, there were these fridge magnets and one of them said Rock on Tommy that is one thing I will always remember. I remember watching on television, but we didnt see him because he wasnt up there going for the gold medal. M McM: Tommy, from your point of view, was it surreal being at the Olympics  TH: The problem was that I got a stress fracture on my foot at the end of January and the doctor told me I wouldnt be able to recover in time. I was on crutches for six weeks for rehabilitation, but I got there. I was glad to be there and soaking up the whole atmosphere of being there. I wanted to make sure I finished the marathon on the day and have something I will remember for the rest of my le. But, I wasnt at my peak performance and was below power. If thathadnt happened, I wouldve been up there, that is one of these things. M McM: There is nothing you can do at that point, with all that preparation there has to be frustration. TH: The doctor told me I wasnt going to be there, but I was glad to be there to run in the Olympics and be an Olympian. M McM: Running had got serious a long time before that for you. When did you really start to get into it  TH: Whenever I got good at running, thats when it got serious. I have always loved sports and to find out I was good at one sport, that was it...that was serious, I put everything into the one basket. M McM: What did the training schedule look like then  TH: It was seven days a week and twice a day. Id maybe do fivein the morning and  in the evening, do a bit of hill work, speed work and I was reading running magazines, taking what I could use out of it and try to improve. M McM: Eoin, you started a bit later. When did you really start to get into it  EH: It was probably in the last couple of years, I started to get my times down. I didnt start running until I was , I was doing local races and doing okay. I ran for Northern Ireland a couple of times last year, so it is probably within the last year, I said I am getting half decent here, I am getting better and I am at that stage where knocking on the door of getting Northern Ireland bests. M McM: Is time on your side  EH: Not really, I am . A lot of the athletes would only be finishing by now, whereas I am only starting. Well see. There are a few examples of older athletes starting late and doing very well into their early s, so there is a bit of hope there, but I am no spring chicken. M McM: I suppose you are able to tap into your father for advice on training. EH: I have him there when I need him. Even at the start, when my legs were sore - “Daddy how long are my legs going to be sore for” so from the very basic stuff like that, until now, to training and what I should do. Even before we went to Frankfurt, he said I needed to get the distance into the legs so the body would know how it feels. We went out and did  miles on a nice easy run...having that advice and knowing I have it, is great. I know a lot of people would love to have that. Anytime he is at races, I am sure people are askingwhat they should be doing...I have that any time I want it. M McM: Tommy, in all your years running, what sticks out for you above the rest  TH: Eoin crossing the line in Frankfurt and me asking him did we get it  and him not fit to speak and I am waiting for the answer and him saying yeah, we got it – that was brilliant. M McM: I remember that picture of Eoin gasping and you have your hand on his back... TH: I was asking him. Thats what we set out for and when I passed him I was thinking this is falling apart and how much is Eoin going to slow down and is he going to drop out of the race altogether, so I am going to have to go as hard as I can go now to try to stay within the realms of the record, so the pressure was on. I dont mind the pressure on myself, but I crossed the line and waited for Eoin to come. I will never forget it for the rest of my le, the sensation of waiting around and when he crossed the line, I was elated. M McM: For you Eoin, were you constantly looking at your watch  EH: Dad passed me with about three miles to go. I knew how long was gone and what pace he was doing. I knew what time he was going to run, so in my head I was doing maths of what I needed to do and what I was able to do...I was struggling to get to the line. I knewI ran a seven-minute mile from there to the finish, wed break it. The maths equation gave me the incentive to get to the finish line. M McM: Surely its hard to run, never mind having to count. EH: It was helping me though and taking my mind of the pain I was in. M McM: I remember when you told me about the achievement and about how you were going to beat it, it was the fact you said you would do it easily that jumped out at me. Do you need that as a goal, or is it something you firmly believe  EH: It is something we believe. I should be capable of running  minutes quicker and evenI run five minutes quicker, thats five minutes. I learned a lot from Frankfurt, it was my first go at a marathon and mistakes were made. Give me the next one and I will learn from them. M McM: What sort of mistakes do you mean, was it going too fast too early  EH: One of the biggest mistakes was being dependent on my own drinks. My Da said to me before the race it wasnt a good idea. We were sub elite, so I had all my personal drinks set out on the table. The elite, there was four bottles per table, but sub elite there was maybe a  bottles on a big long table and trying to get your drink, while running fast past it, that was a nightmare. It played on my mind that I missed bottles, so I will not do that again. I need to get more miles in the legs, so it is those things I need to improve on and will. M McM: Do you just colour code your bottle  EH: Some people had long sticks with flags on them to make them stand out, but my bottle was pretty basic. M McM: Is it now a case of waiting for the pandemic to end and seethe London marathon, or any of others will take place  You said that you couldnt focus fully until you got the date. EH: Once we have a certain marathon , we can put a good training block together. At the minute, for me, it is about building back as I had took a bit of time off. I do think now, we will get a marathon this year. Athletics Ireland are allowing groups of four athletes to train together. It gives hope that in two or three weeks time, we will be able to train up here in small groups. Down South, they are allowing bigger events from August, so the likelihood of Dublin going ahead could be a possibility. I think we will get something later on in the year, so it is time to build it up again. M McM: And Tommy, you have your own inidual records to beat. TH: Definitely, I have a km, a half-marathon and a marathon, I have all those to set in the over s , so I will be jumping at anything that comes along. I have broke the km in January, I have ran the World Record for k indoors, which is a bonus because I am not a track runner. I was looking forward to sweeping the board this year and then all thishappened. Whatever comes along at the end of the year, I am going to have to go for it. The marathon is what I want, it is the big one and any year, from here on in, the marathon is the one I am concentrating on, the other distances are a bonus. M McM: What is the marathon time you have in your sights  TH: The world record for over s is :, but I want to run under :. So whatever marathon comes up first, I will be trying to get into it and run it. I want to run a World Record this year and move on to next year and start again. M McM: For the father and son target, which one would you prefer  TH: London. EH: We had planned for London and the way they very the record on the day, that is our plan. That is our first choice... it goes ahead. So, well see what happens. sport@derrypost RELATED - Father and son clinch World Record. More...

Last week, his father Sean Johnston and mother Karen Doherty were overjoyed to celebrate their son’s first birthday at home in Derry. Midway through Karen’s pregnancy it was discovered that her unborn baby had Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia or CDH for short. It is a rare potentially fatal abnormality which occurs in approximately  in , births and accounts for around % of all major congenital abnormalities. In these uncommon cases, unborn babies develop a hole in their diaphragm, the thin sheet of muscle separating the chest from the abdomen, which can allow the stomach, liver or bowels to move up through the gap into the chest cavity, squashing the lungs and, in the worst cases, leaving them too underdeveloped to allow breathing after birth. googletag.cmd.push The past year has been challenging, a journey of ups and downs as Milo recovered from a le-saving operation and overcame bronchitis on several occasions. While researching and doing everything to ensure their unborn child had the best possible chance of survival, the couple also had to devote time to care for their other much-loved boys Ethanand Jake . Milo’s condition was first detected at Karen’s -week scan when they were told that his stomach had been pushed up to his chest cavity and his heart was on the wrong side. A consultant was able to diagnose CDH but it still had to be confirmed by a specialist at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast. googletag.cmd.push The couple were given news that no expecting parent wants to hear, that their unborn child had a % chance of survival. It came as a hammer blow and that day was a complete blur. Sean said: “We were in shock, you just don’t know what to do. We wanted to know what happens next.” Making it to full-term was far from certain. Travelling to Belfast for scans became the norm but they remained positive. At  weeks a lung-to-head ratio was measured to determine a prognosis. There hopes were diminished. Karen was admitted to hospital early, May . The baby’s due date was May  but leaving it any later would have worsened his chances of survival. Milo would need an intensive care bed immediately after he was born, there were none available at time of admission which raised concerns that Karen may have to be transferred to a hospital in Dublin or even England. Fortunately, a bed was free just in time. Sean explained: “Doctors said that when he is born he will be the sickest child in Northern Ireland at that time until we get him stabilised. “They don’t know what complications are there until he’s born, does his heart work,he can breathe orhe can’t oranything  works. “They didn’t want Milo to cry when he came out because that allows air into his lungs, which puts more compression on them and is more damaging, but he did.” AMAZING STAFF  A ventilator was set-up and numerous doctors awaited his arrival. The couple paid tribute to all staff but in particular consultant paediatrician, Dr Sweet, who was ‘amazing’. “He kept us positive and assured us he’d do everything in his power to keep him here, ‘as long as he’s willing to help me he’ll survive’,” Sean said. “He couldn’t make any promises but said, ‘as long as he’s strong enough I’m not going to give up on him no matter how long he stays here with us’.” As the senior consultant on call that day, Dr Sweet delivered the baby at .pm. The baby was immediately whisked away to be placed in an incubator and ventilator and they didn’t see him again until pm that night. “It was the longest time of our lives,” Sean recalled. “You keep checking to seethere’s any word back. We heard back once in that time that they were still trying to stabilise him. “We were taken to see him while he was hooked up to a ventilator with lines in his ankles, in his bellybutton, on his wrists. He was on mountains of medication for his heart, blood pressure, fentanyl for pain relief amongst other things.” BAPTISM  The baby’s grandparents got a chance to see him and they were driving home to Derry when Karen and Sean were told that he may not make it through the night. A baptism was quickly arranged and their parents were phoned to come back for the service. Names had been discussed, Milo being shortlisted. But asit was a sign from God, a Belfast priest called Father Milo performed the service, their minds were made up. A short time later doctors told them Milo wasn’t reacting to the treatment and there was nothing more they could do for him. Karen and Sean stayed by his side through the night. When morning came Dr Sweet started his sht and vowed to do all he could. Treatments were adjusted and the couple were told to take short period of respite with the assurance that the baby would be kept aliveanything went wrong. Around  minutes later they were greeted with words they longed to hear, ‘good news’. Milo was stable, he was off adrenaline and steroids, and his ventilation had been changed. However, a le-saving surgery was still needed to close the hole in his diaphragm during which he lost a lot of blood and required a transfusion. It was discovered that all of his organs except his liver had moved into the chest cavity,the liver had then Milo would’ve died. He kept fighting post-surgery and showed signs of improvement. SPECIAL  Peace of mind was restored on that fateful day. To the astonishment, and delight of his parents, Milo was discharged from hospital at age  and a half weeks. A setback came ten days later when he was readmitted to the Royal Victoria Hospital with a potentially fatal bowel obstruction where he spent a further two weeks. Back home in Derry Milo remained susceptible to infection and has been in and out of Altnagelvin with bronchitis. It has not been plain sailing but they have watched their baby make gradual improvements and are filled with hope about the future. Doctors have been stunned at his level of progression. The charity CDH UK has also been a great support to the family throughout. The emergence of Coronavirus means that Milo has to be isolated and protected at home but thankfully there are no concerns at the moment. May  was the pinnacle of a tough year, a beautul moment for all the family as Milo reached his first birthday, a milestone that seemed unreachable just twelve months ago. “This was a massive moment for us,” Sean said, “knowing everything we’ve been through to get there. “We thought back to the same time last year when he was in intensive care and what he’s overcome - it made it all the more special.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It is a rare potentially fatal abnormality which occurs in approximately  in , births and accounts for around % of all major congenital abnormalities. In these uncommon cases, unborn babies develop a hole in their diaphragm, the thin sheet of muscle separating the chest from the abdomen, which can allow the stomach, liver or bowels to move up through the gap into the chest cavity, squashing the lungs and, in the worst cases, leaving them too underdeveloped to allow breathing after birth. googletag.cmd.push The past year has been challenging, a journey of ups and downs as Milo recovered from a le-saving operation and overcame bronchitis on several occasions. While researching and doing everything to ensure their unborn child had the best possible chance of survival, the couple also had to devote time to care for their other much-loved boys Ethanand Jake . Milo’s condition was first detected at Karen’s -week scan when they were told that his stomach had been pushed up to his chest cavity and his heart was on the wrong side. A consultant was able to diagnose CDH but it still had to be confirmed by a specialist at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast. googletag.cmd.push The couple were given news that no expecting parent wants to hear, that their unborn child had a % chance of survival. It came as a hammer blow and that day was a complete blur. Sean said: “We were in shock, you just don’t know what to do. We wanted to know what happens next.” Making it to full-term was far from certain. Travelling to Belfast for scans became the norm but they remained positive. At  weeks a lung-to-head ratio was measured to determine a prognosis. There hopes were diminished. Karen was admitted to hospital early, May . The baby’s due date was May  but leaving it any later would have worsened his chances of survival. Milo would need an intensive care bed immediately after he was born, there were none available at time of admission which raised concerns that Karen may have to be transferred to a hospital in Dublin or even England. Fortunately, a bed was free just in time. Sean explained: “Doctors said that when he is born he will be the sickest child in Northern Ireland at that time until we get him stabilised. “They don’t know what complications are there until he’s born, does his heart work,he can breathe orhe can’t oranything  works. “They didn’t want Milo to cry when he came out because that allows air into his lungs, which puts more compression on them and is more damaging, but he did.” AMAZING STAFF  A ventilator was set-up and numerous doctors awaited his arrival. The couple paid tribute to all staff but in particular consultant paediatrician, Dr Sweet, who was ‘amazing’. “He kept us positive and assured us he’d do everything in his power to keep him here, ‘as long as he’s willing to help me he’ll survive’,” Sean said. “He couldn’t make any promises but said, ‘as long as he’s strong enough I’m not going to give up on him no matter how long he stays here with us’.” As the senior consultant on call that day, Dr Sweet delivered the baby at .pm. The baby was immediately whisked away to be placed in an incubator and ventilator and they didn’t see him again until pm that night. “It was the longest time of our lives,” Sean recalled. “You keep checking to seethere’s any word back. We heard back once in that time that they were still trying to stabilise him. “We were taken to see him while he was hooked up to a ventilator with lines in his ankles, in his bellybutton, on his wrists. He was on mountains of medication for his heart, blood pressure, fentanyl for pain relief amongst other things.” BAPTISM  The baby’s grandparents got a chance to see him and they were driving home to Derry when Karen and Sean were told that he may not make it through the night. A baptism was quickly arranged and their parents were phoned to come back for the service. Names had been discussed, Milo being shortlisted. But asit was a sign from God, a Belfast priest called Father Milo performed the service, their minds were made up. A short time later doctors told them Milo wasn’t reacting to the treatment and there was nothing more they could do for him. Karen and Sean stayed by his side through the night. When morning came Dr Sweet started his sht and vowed to do all he could. Treatments were adjusted and the couple were told to take short period of respite with the assurance that the baby would be kept aliveanything went wrong. Around  minutes later they were greeted with words they longed to hear, ‘good news’. Milo was stable, he was off adrenaline and steroids, and his ventilation had been changed. However, a le-saving surgery was still needed to close the hole in his diaphragm during which he lost a lot of blood and required a transfusion. It was discovered that all of his organs except his liver had moved into the chest cavity,the liver had then Milo would’ve died. He kept fighting post-surgery and showed signs of improvement. SPECIAL  Peace of mind was restored on that fateful day. To the astonishment, and delight of his parents, Milo was discharged from hospital at age  and a half weeks. A setback came ten days later when he was readmitted to the Royal Victoria Hospital with a potentially fatal bowel obstruction where he spent a further two weeks. Back home in Derry Milo remained susceptible to infection and has been in and out of Altnagelvin with bronchitis. It has not been plain sailing but they have watched their baby make gradual improvements and are filled with hope about the future. Doctors have been stunned at his level of progression. The charity CDH UK has also been a great support to the family throughout. The emergence of Coronavirus means that Milo has to be isolated and protected at home but thankfully there are no concerns at the moment. May  was the pinnacle of a tough year, a beautul moment for all the family as Milo reached his first birthday, a milestone that seemed unreachable just twelve months ago. “This was a massive moment for us,” Sean said, “knowing everything we’ve been through to get there. “We thought back to the same time last year when he was in intensive care and what he’s overcome - it made it all the more special.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

On Monday, five of Derry City  Strabane District Council’s  household recycling centres reopened after being closed for a period as a result of the COVID- emergency legislation. Long queues formed outside the centres before they opened as people who were in lockdown attempted to dump and recycle materials that had accumulated. Derry’s centres do not charge people to get rid of their waste. In Donegal people must pay for some items at recycling centres while others are free.  googletag.cmd.push At the most recent meeting of the council, DUP Alderman Maurice Devenney said the use of the dumps by people from Donegal was a quite serious problem which needed to be examined. Alderman Devenney said that given the costs being faced by the local council as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, they should not be footing the bill for people from a dferent jurisdiction to get rid of their rubbish. He suggested that when the dumps are re-opened the council should look at new measures to prevent people from outside the council area using the facilities. Alderman Devenney asked for a report to be prepared in a bid to try and establish how many vehicles with southern registrations are using the local dumps. googletag.cmd.push Addressing the issue of cross border waste, a council spokesperson this week said that it is aware of ‘some cross border waste’ being brought to its recycling centres by members of the public and that its centres are designed to handle the volume of waste which passes through daily. She said: “This issue is reviewed on an ongoing basis with elected members recently requesting a full report on usage that will come before them for review and discussion at the next Environment and Regeneration Committee. “Council acknowledges the fact that there are many instances where users of the amenity sites live outside of the Council area, for example they may own a property within the Council area. “Council continues to remind people from outside of the council area that where possible they should limit travel and should use services and facilities in their own areas.” The Council spokesperson added that they experienced a high volume of users at the sites when they reopened on Monday and encouraged the public to hold off and avail of the services later in the week. Five centres at Pennyburn, Glendermott Road, Strathfoyle, Claudy and Strahan Road in Strabane are all open from am to pm Monday to Friday, am to pm on Saturday, and Sunday opening from  to pm for Pennyburn, Glendermott Road and Strahan Road sites only. The public are reminded that the council’s regular refuse collection service is fully operational throughout this emergency period and that additional support to deal with excess waste has been provided through a bespoke COVID Waste Helpline –    - and a free Bulky Waste Collection Service that can be booked online on the councils website.

Patricia McCallion, who owns her own hair and beauty salon in Waterloo Street, agreed to be stripped of her make-up and lashes to take part in Pretty Single which airs on Monday. The series sees siximage-concious singeltons embrace the natural lookto try and finda love connection that is more than skin deep. Patricia kicks off the showbygoing on five dates with five dferent guys, while her co-starswatch the dates unfold from the comfort of their sofa – providing supportive and humorous commentary throughout. googletag.cmd.push Mum-of-one and self-confessed romantic, Patricia admits she hides her true self behind make-up to boost her confidence. “It’s putting on a mask in the morning, it’s covering the flaws that you don’t like about yourself, she said. People often say to me you look like you workin the beauty industry and I do like to look the part. I have to look at myself in the mirror all day at work so I want to look mybest. Each of the five suitors have been specially matched to Patricia but she could only take one to dinner. The dates were one after the other and then you had to whittle it down to two and decide which one to take on a proper date, explained Patricia. googletag.cmd.push If I was going on a normal dateId have my make-up done because you want to impress, but the funny thing was the fellas didnt even notice we werent wearing make-up. I felt like I was putting myself out there and it was scary, but at the same time I felt like they were getting to know the real me because I was more vulnerable. Patricia remains tight lipped about who she chose for her date, but revealed she was given the option of going bare faced or wearing make-up. I kind of went for a bit of both, she laughed. She is now looking forward to seeing the show for the first time when it airs on Monday. The trailer came on the other night after Eastenders and I was jumping around the room, she admitted. I kept rewinding it to watch again. Narrated by Derry Girls star Saoirse-Monica Jackson, Pretty Single is a Stelly Media production for BBC One Northern Ireland and BBC Scotland. It begins on BBC One Northern Ireland on Monday  May at .pm. All six episodes in the series will be available on BBC iPlayer after the first episode is broadcast.

The -acre estate, which includes the derelict Boom Hall, stretches across a large section of land close to the Foyle Bridge at Culmore. Appeals have been made in recent years for more to be done to preserve the famous hall which is such bad condition that the land around it has been secured off. The new company, which has charitable status, is called the Boomhall Trust. The organisation has been awarded a Project Viability Grant by the Architectural Heritage Fund to help them explore uses which could revive and sustain the historically signicant and challenging building. googletag.cmd.push Speaking earlier this year when the new organisation was launched, Boomhall Trust chairman, Jim Sammon, said the buildings and land on the site have been unused and ‘run down for the past  years’. “A restored Boomhall Estate will be a powerful statement of optimism and confidence in the future of the region, and send the strongest signal to everyone that five decades of decay are coming to an end in the North West,” he said. Mr Sammon said the Boomhall Estate is mostly owned by Derry City and Strabane District Council which has commissioned a conservation plan for the buildings and landscape. googletag.cmd.push He said the new company is consulting with the council on the options for the site. He added that the Department of Communities has also part-funded the Boomhall Trust to undertake an archaeological investigation of the site in partnership with the archaeology department of Queens University of Belfast. “Our intention is that Boomhall will remain in public ownership and generate resources for local communities to sustain themselves for generations to come,” said Mr Sammon.

This is due to a “lack of clarity” in the liquor licensing laws. According to a report in the The , Garda Headquarters has sought legal advice on pubs delivering drinks and selling takeaway beverages from their premises and has been told that both practices do not contravene liquor licensing laws. The report stated that “as long as drinks, including poured pints, are paid for on a licensed premises they can be delivered to customers.” And it added that takeaway sales are also permitted once those buying drinks in that manner consume them more than  metres away from a pub and not in a public place. googletag.cmd.push In effect, it means that pubs can operate delivery and off-sales as an “essential service” during the lockdown, like supermarkets, pharmacies, hardware stores and some other businesses. Last week, the a case of O’Flaherty’s Pubin Buncrana made headlines as it was running the “Guinness Express”.  It was forced to half deliveries after gardaiacute called to the premises. Pints of Guinness had been wrapped in cling film for delivery purposes. At the time a spokesman for the pub complained gardaiacute were unable to tell him what laws staff had broken. Now, it has emerged that after the legal advice received in recent days, such deliveries will be possible once the drinks are paid for in advance to a person on a pub’s premises. googletag.cmd.push For the full articleSEE HERE   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council Michaela Boyle launched the Whats Your Story  competition at the start of May, asking primary school children to submit a story, picture or poem about their feelings on the current Covid- situation, and some of the positives they have taken from it. With hundreds of entries coming in from all parts of the district, the Mayor selected Ameya Nair , Daithiacute OacuteDonghaile , Amelia Lyle , Christopher Conaghan , Emmet Glennand Meaghan McKeeas her winners, and they will each receive a special goodie bag of prizes. googletag.cmd.push Mayor Boyle said that choosing the winners was a very tough task. First of all, I would like to say a huge thank you to each and every one of the children who took part in Whats your story  I really enjoyed going through all of the fantastic poems, stories and pictures and it was so dficult to pick winners – they all could have won! The creativity, talent and resilience of our young people really shone through for me with this initiative, and they deserve praise for how well they have handled this unusual and sometimes scary situation that we find ourselves in. googletag.cmd.push Mayor Boyle continued: It certainly isnt easy to be away from your school and your friends, but it was so inspiring to see how they have taken the positives from this dferent way of le - and I think all of us adults can learn a thing or two from them about their outlook. A big congratulations to our winners Ameya, Daithiacute, Amelia, Christopher, Emmet and Meaghan – I hope you enjoy your goodie bag. Theres no doubt we have some incredibly talented and special young writers and artists in our council area, so make sure you keep drawing and writing!

Terence McDowell, principal of St Eithnes Primary School, has also supported calls from church leaders for the  plus transfer test to be scrapped this year because of the coronavirus pandemic. The Education Minister last week said it was his aim to see a phased reopening of schools across the North, starting with limited provisionfor GCSE, A-Level and P pupils this summer. Mr McDowell said he first learnt of the Education Ministersplans from the news and had not been consulted about them. googletag.cmd.push It was the first we heard of it and a lot of questions would need to be answered first, said Mr McDowell. The Minister wasnt very definite about the plans. Mr McDowell said he feels very sorry for his P pupils who face the possible prospect of moving on to post-primary school without the chance to say goodbye. My heart goes out to them, said Mr McDowell.For the other primaries we will eventually get them back and we can make up for the missed time, but for the Ps you can never replace that time. There are so many rites of passage like their school trip that they will never get to do and they will go into post primary without preparation that we would normally give them for what is a such a big change. googletag.cmd.push If the plans go ahead, it will give us some formof contact and offer some closure to both pupils and staff. The P teachers were told they might not see these pupils again with just two days notice. Staff at St Eithnes PS had already created a DVD for P pupils and a certicate to mark the end of their time at the school. Its always sad to see pupils go, but it will beall themore poignant this year, said Mr McDowell. Under Minister Weirs plans, primary schools and post primary schools would reopen with limited provision for key cohort years in August, followed by a phased provision for all pupils at the beginning of September. However, teachers would traditionally be on annual leave during the school summer break in July and August. Teachers have been working really hard preparing online resources and work packs to keep pupils going, said Mr McDowell. We dontknow what the requirementswill be, but I believeit will be  pupils to a classroom. We have almost  in our two P classes so they will need to be split into two rooms and that will require more staff. The physical layout of desks and chairs will need to be considered and the resources they are using. We have already discussed requisitioning inidual resource packs for each child but that will come at an extra expense to the school and Im sure we wontget any extra resources. Mr McDowell said the movement of pupils outside the classrooms would also be a concern. We need to consider how the children will move around the school as the corridors arent very wide. We also need to think about meal times in the canteen, where normally we would have one or two slots to feed the whole school. Toilet breaks will need to be consideredtoo and time given for children to properly wash their hands. This will all be time taken out of teaching time. Keeping the childrentwo metres apart staff and each other would be particularlydficult for younger pupils. Children in P naturally gravitate towards one another, said Mr McDowell. You cant police that, it is going to be impossible. Things happen at school where children fall and hurt themselves and they will need comforted. Do we have to tell a child with a bleeding to chin to wait while we ring their parents  Some children will find the transition to primary school dficult and they might be crying or upset. To not be able to comfort that child goes against the grain of the very reasons that teachers came into this profession. Last week,Bishop of Derry, Donal McKeown sent a letter to Catholic post-primary schools asking for the transfer test to be scrapped this year, a call echoed by Mr McDowell. The transfer test causes much anxiety anyway and our teachers have been unable to prepare children in the normal way this year and working from home just doesnt compare. It is causing much anxiety and we need to consider something to stop that. There isnt a levelplaying field in what parents can provide. They might be working from home, they might have multiple children, they might be looking after an elderly relative. Every household is unique. I am very mindful that parents have been thrust into the role of teachers, they are not professional teachers. Parents shouldnt compare themselves to others. We always tell the children just do your best and thats the same message I would have for parents. They are doing the best they can. Meanwhile, Derry Sinn Fein MLA Karen Mullan, has called for an`education forum comprising of teachers, school leaders, parents, trade unions and public health experts to be convened before schools are allowed to . The deputy chair of the assembly education committee, said the forum, would address huge concern and anxiety at the prospect of an eventualto school. Its my view that anyto school must be done in complete partnership and in conversation with all those involved in education when the time comes, said Ms Mullan. Parents, young people and our teaching staff must have confidence that health and safety is paramount in anyto school. There will be no one size fits all approach for schools in preparing to re-open. There should be an intense period of discussion that will be crucial to understand the flexibilities and the bespoke needs that dferent schools and dferent settings will require.

Lavey, once a force in both codes, beat the Lynchs to grab a title at the start of the decade – under current Slaughtneil boss Michael McShane. Before the maroon and white dominance, Swatragh nipped in to take the  title. It was an era when the CCC produced the master-stroke of a graded championship structure to give more Derry teams a better crack at an Ulster title.  – Daryl McDermott Big ball or wee ball, it didnt matter – Sticks, in his laid-back manner was Mr Consistency between the posts. He had razor sharp reflexes and ied puck-out. He had a great eye and safe hand between the posts. He was Derrys keeper for longer than I can remember. Unlucky to have played in the era of Slaughtneil and Kevin Lynchs dominance. googletag.cmd.push  – Paddy Kelly A constant in the Kevin Lynchs defence and even had the versatility to pick up a spot in attack for the  hurling team of the year. He has put in place a legacy that his younger brothers are now following. In last years final with Slaughtneil, he was immense, led by example and wouldve deserved to lt the cup. Quiet and does his talking on the pitch.  – Sean Cassidy Has been a tower of strength in the heart of the Slaughtneil defence since coming out of the minor grade. Has played a wing back and full back. He is strong, commanding and has a extremely long clearance that takes the pressure off his defence - all done with a smile on his face. Tad took his club for to the county scene where John McEvoy appointed him as captain. googletag.cmd.push  – Karl McKaigue Karl is the player that corner forwards just had to see coming. An very skilful hurler coming up through the underage ranks and as he filled out, he combined his hurling with an athleticism that just sets him apart. Like Paddy Kelly in the other corners, he says very little but when he is given a job to do in a game, there are few better. He can also dodge forward to pick off a score.  – Mark Craig Mark captained Derry to U glory in  and he has been a mainstay in the Kevin Lynchs story at senior level since. He has played in the defence and had spells in the attack during the decade as the Lynchs tried a reshuffle to give them a focal point. Histo the county  under John McEvoy has given the young guns an experienced head to led them into inter-county hurling.  – Brian Oacuteg McGilligan Brian Oacuteg has played at full-forward and midfield for Banagher as they tried began to exert an influence over the Lynchs and try to knock Slaughtneil off their perch. He has played at full-back for Derry this season, but he is perhaps at his most influential at centre-back with his presence and positional sense. He has many more years of hurling left.  – Liam Oacuteg Hinphey One of the terric characters of the club scene and has played both codes for Derry over an accomplished career. He is very combative under the dropping ball and has played anywhere across the half-back line and on the end of the square. And this was all during a career that brought a troublesome injury, but he was never found wanting. One of the greats.  - Chrissy McKaigue The most decorated club hurler of a decade. Apart from his spell with the Sydney Swans, he has been named in the team of the year since the County Derry Post began and he was hurler of the year in . He is just a natural and like Cormac ODoherty and Brendan Rogers, would probably grace any team in Ireland. He is ultra-completive and has a skill set to match.  – Gerald Bradley You dont miss anything until its gone. Gerald Bradleys knee injury probably cost Slaughtneil the Ulster title in , such is his natural leap and catch. He is now back to his best and last season excelled in the role of the teams quarter-back, sitting in the pocket to frustrate Dunloy and Ballyhale but was able to spring Slaughtneil into an attacking outfit. His point against Dunloy last year...well, what can say. Awesome.  – Kevin Hinphey Joins Liam Oacuteg as the second set of brothers on the team. A very astute player who could play up front and in defence, where he was named on the hurling team of the year on three occasions. Another terric servant of the Derry county team and he battled back from a serious knee injury to get back playing last season. Like his father did, he has invested a lot of time in the clubs underage who are now coming through to the county team. - Cormac ODoherty He was born to play hurling. Played in goals at underage, in the teams well before his years, with a touch developed playing with his older brothers at home. Once he progressed outfield, in his own age groups, he was destined for greatness. Accurate from frees and play, but it is his awareness that sets him apart. Very smart on the ball and can see pass before the inside forward even calls for the ball. A natural.  – Paddy Henry Paddy landed - in Laveys  win over Kevin Lynchs. It was a year to remember, as he kicked the winner fo his native Castledawson in the intermediate football final. He has been a consistent performer and has been selected on the County Derry Post hurling team of the year on three occasions. He is now sowing the seeds of hurling in the Dawson.  – Brendan Rogers Rogers was named at full-back on the club football team of the decade and with the small ball, he is the assassin in Slaughtneils attack. He is terric in the air, is quick, has power and a terric eye for goal. He took a bursting collection of underage medals into the senior ranks and was arguably the main reason for their early domination at senior level, with an attacking power few could match.  – Seacute McGuigan The Slaughtneil man is a brilliant ball winner and has an eye for goal that has helped the club dominate the club and provincial championship scene. For the guts of five years, he was unmarkable at the edge of the square and it allowed Brendan Rogers to be deployed where. Has a very relaxed demeanour, but knows how to perform when it matters. Named on the Champions team of the season at last years All-Star awards.  - Ruairi ConveryWhen Convery hung up his hurl, Eamonn Hasson commented that you just dont replace men like him. He was pivotal in Swatraghs hurling and football double season in , a fittingfor a man who spearheaded their march up through underage. A huge loss to Derry hurling as well and its a pity Swatragh didnt land an intermediate Ulster before he hung up his hurl.

He took a bursting collection of underage medals into the senior ranks and was arguably the main reason for their early domination at senior level, with an attacking power few could match.  – Seacute McGuigan The Slaughtneil man is a brilliant ball winner and has an eye for goal that has helped the club dominate the club and provincial championship scene. For the guts of five years, he was unmarkable at the edge of the square and it allowed Brendan Rogers to be deployed where. Has a very relaxed demeanour, but knows how to perform when it matters.

A huge loss to Derry hurling as well and its a pity Swatragh didnt land an intermediate Ulster before he hung up his hurl. RELATED - Paul McFlynns football team of the decade.HEADLINE – DERRY CLUB HURLING TEAM OF THE DECADEINTRO BOX It was a decade dominated by Kevin Lynchs and Slaughtneil, with the latter going on to dominate Ulster and knock the All-Ireland door with purpose last season.Lavey, once a force in both codes, beat the Lynchs to grab a title at the start of the decade – under current Slaughtneil boss Michael McShane.Before the maroon and white dominance, Swatragh nipped in to take the  title.It was an era when the CCC produced the master-stroke of a graded championship structure to give more Derry teams a better crack at an Ulster title. – Daryl McDermottBig ball or wee ball, it didnt matter – Sticks, in his laid-back manner was Mr Consistency between the posts.He had razor sharp reflexes and ied puck-out.He had a great eye and safe hand between the posts.He was Derrys keeper for longer than I can remember.Unlucky to have played in the era of Slaughtneil and Kevin Lynchs dominance. – Paddy KellyA constant in the Kevin Lynchs defence and even had the versatility to pick up a spot in attack for the  hurling team of the year.He has put in place a legacy that his younger brothers are now following.In last years final with Slaughtneil, he was immense, led by example and wouldve deserved to lt the cup.Quiet and does his talking on the pitch. – Sean CassidyHas been a tower of strength in the heart of the Slaughtneil defence since coming out of the minor grade.Has played a wing back and full back.He is strong, commanding and has a extremely long clearance that takes the pressure off his defence- all done with a smile on his face.Tad took his club for to the county scene where John McEvoy appointed him as captain. – Karl McKaigueKarl is the player that corner forwards just had to see coming.An very skilful hurler coming up through the underage ranks and as he filled out, he combined his hurling with an athleticism that just sets him apart.Like Paddy Kelly in the other corners, he says very little but when he is given a job to do in a game, there are few better.He can also dodge forward to pick off a score. – Mark CraigMark captained Derry to U glory in  and he has been a mainstay in the Kevin Lynchs story at senior level since. He has played in the defence and had spells in the attack during the decade as the Lynchs tried a reshuffle to give them a focal point.Histo the county  under John McEvoy has given the young guns an experienced head to led them into inter-county hurling. – Brian Oacuteg McGilliganBrian Oacuteg has played at full-forward and midfield for Banagher as they tried began to exert an influence over the Lynchs and try to knock Slaughtneil off their perch.He has played at full-back for Derry this season, but he is perhaps at his most influential at centre-back with his presence and positional sense. He has many more years of hurling left.  – Liam Oacuteg HinpheyOne of the terric characters of the club scene and has played both codes for Derry over an accomplished career.He is very combative under the dropping ball and has played anywhere across the half-back line and on the end of the square. And this was all during a career that brought a troublesome injury, but he was never found wanting.One of the greats. - Chrissy McKaigueThe most decorated club hurler of a decade.Apart from his spell with the Sydney Swans, he has been named in the team of the year since the County Derry Post began and he was hurler of the year in .He is just a natural and like Cormac ODoherty and Brendan Rogers, would probably grace any team in Ireland.He is ultra-completive and has a skill set to match. – Gerald BradleyYou dont miss anything until its gone.Gerald Bradleys knee injury probably cost Slaughtneil the Ulster title in , such is his natural leap and catch.He is now back to his best and last season excelled in the role of the teams quarter-back, sitting in the pocket to frustrate Dunloy and Ballyhale but was able to spring Slaughtneil into an attacking outfit.His point against Dunloy last year...well, what can say.Awesome. – Kevin HinpheyJoins Liam Oacuteg as the second set of brothers on the team.A very astute player who could play up front and in defence, where he was named on the hurling team of the year on three occasions.Another terric servant of the Derry county team and he battled back from a serious knee injury to get back playing last season.Like his father did, he has invested a lot of time in the clubs underage who are now coming through to the county team.- Cormac ODohertyHe was born to play hurling.Played in goals at underage, in the teams well before his years, with a touch developed playing with his older brothers at home.Once he progressed outfield, in his own age groups, he was destined for greatness.Accurate from frees and play, but it is his awareness that sets him apart.Very smart on the ball and can see pass before the inside forward even calls for the ball.A natural. – Paddy HenryPaddy landed - in Laveys  win over Kevin Lynchs.It was a year to remember, as he kicked the winner fo his native Castledawson in the intermediate football final.He has been a consistent performer and has been selected on the County Derry Post hurling team of the year on three occasions.He is now sowing the seeds of hurling in the Dawson. – Brendan RogersRogers was named at full-back on the club football team of the decade and with the small ball, he is the assassin in Slaughtneils attack.He is terric in the air, is quick, has power and a terric eye for goal.He took a bursting collection of underage medals into the senior ranks and was arguably the main reason for their early domination at senior level, with an attacking power few could match. – Seacute McGuiganThe Slaughtneil man is a brilliant ball winner and has an eye for goal that has helped the club dominate the club and provincial championship scene.For the guts of five years, he was unmarkable at the edge of the square and it allowed Brendan Rogers to be deployed where.Has a very relaxed demeanour, but knows how to perform when it matters.Named on the Champions team of the season at last years All-Star awards.- Ruairi Convery When Convery hung up his hurl, Eamonn Hasson commented that you just dont replace men like him.He was pivotal in Swatraghs hurling and football double season in , a fittingfor a man who spearheaded their march up through underage.A huge loss to Derry hurling as well and its a pity Swatragh didnt land an intermediate Ulster before he hung up his hurl.\"More...

Second past the judge Iain Duff was Supersat, ridden by Leo Gracey, with James McGurgen third on John Megawrsquos Gortmerron Lady.Mark is now the only local amateur to have ridden out his racecourse riders claim.The First Trust Maiden race was ided and in the first ision Jackie Kidd from Loughinisland won on Tullamore, owned and trained by her father, Mayne, beating Brian Dougan on his own Russell Lodge, with Jimmy Henry third on Redheadmustgo.The winner of the second ision was Cortynan in the colours of Dr Fitz Gillespie, who sadly passed away recently.This one providing Glyne Dyne with his third career success. Bend in the River was second ahead of Crawfordstowncross, with Jimmy Henry in the saddle.In the Ulster Bank Open race Liam Lennon had his first winner of the day as a trainer when Younowhat, which he also rode, won in the colours of Moirarsquos Jim McMullan.He also saddled the runner-up, Patsy Murphyrsquos Blackout, ridden by Mark OrsquoHare. Glencloy was third.The W  C Glazing Ltd two winner race saw Banbridge rider James Smyth record his first success of the season when successful on Supreme Lancer, in the colours of Mrs Carol Rooney from Newry.

As part of the Marathon Potential  cohort, I attended a two week training camp near Torre-Vieja, Spain, organised jointly by Athletics Northern Ireland and Athletics Ireland.I had the honour of going toe-to-toe with then NI marathon record holder, Paul Pollock, on the track.I also had the opportunity to spend time with Paul off-track, alongside Kevin Seaward, learning from two powerhouses of Irish marathon running and building on the advice we received from Stephen Scullion, in Belfast in early December.Most importantly, I made lasting friendships with my fellow Marathon Potential  athletes. The sense of community allowed me to really embrace the project.Setting a goal of putting two of us on the start line of the  Paris Olympics is very ambitious. As a younger athlete, I always felt like an underdog.This feeling, which I once perceived as a negative, has become one of my chief strengths. The goal of becoming an Olympian, which I have chased mdash still chasing mdash from an early age, has, at times seemed unattainable.However, as time has passed, I have grown to love the chase. I look forward to the next stage on this journey, in the company of the Marathon Potential  athletes and support staff, under the stewardship of my coach and mentor of  years, Richard Rodgers, and the band of local training partners.Our way of le has changed dramatically in the space of four months due to COVID-. I remember reading the news in January and having the unnerving feeling that it would not be the last time that I would do so.When I recorded a : personal best over the half marathon in Barcelona in mid-February, the virus was relatively undocumented in Europe. By mid March, I understood that I would not be racing for a long time.My biggest mdash and somewhat selfish mdash fear was that there would be a blanket ban on exercise. Nonetheless, the sanctions under which we are all living have forced me to reconsider the spirit in which I run.To those friends and family in the health service, who have been tackling the virus over the past six weeks, I am amazed beyond words. Thank you for what you are doing.As a PhD student I do not consider myself a key worker. I decided that I would follow lockdown protocol as strictly as possible to do my part. Double runs mdash two runs a day mdash have always been a staple part of my training, allowing me to hit the high mileage required to prepare for the marathon.Completing the same mileage across the week off one daily training session was initially challenging. However, I eventually adapted after two weeks of attrition. In the process, I learned that I benefit from the extra recovery time between runs. This pleasant surprise helped me come to terms with what seems like a more or less empty race calendar in .Athletes are creatures of habit. We are conditioned to race on a monthly or two-monthly basis. Having the options restricted has enabled me to focus on the process of training without looking too far ahead. It has reminded me that, despite thriving off pushing to my limits in races, I love the journey, equally as much.Yes, it is all about achieving in races, but also, to get there a long time is spent training mdash  years and counting. So we have to love the training too. A consequence of this has been that I have begun to pay attention to the finer details in training.When doing a hard workout, I set high standards for each and every repetition, be it focusing on my running form, my cadence or my composure in a strong headwind. I have been trying out new drills and core routines to break up the days.Beyond training itself, I have found myself looking after my kit better than I may have done in the past. This, strangely enough, has been one of the most fulfilling aspects of my day.Given the recent stint of unusually sunny and warmer April weather, I have been leaving my shoes to dry in the sun after runs. A friend recently told me that this is a standard practice in Japan, harnessing the heat of the sun to kill off microbes.It has become a bit of a ritual for me. My shoes fairly pound the roads, so I guess they deserve some respect for what they allow me to do. Seeing them propped against the wall lts my spirits.I can understand that many of you will be disappointed not to have run the Deep RiverRock Belfast City Marathon, but your chance to do so will come around again in September or the future.Anyone who is brave enough to step on the start line of a marathon is a special type of person, irrespective of fitness.More so those who run to raise money for a cause. It takes courage to do this. Bank that courage and build on it over the coming months. It is directly transferable to enduring the current crisis.I remember passing the -mile mark in the  Dublin Marathon. I was in a world of pain mdash itrsquos worth it when yoursquore on track for : mdash when I passed a sign that read lsquoWhat wall rsquoI knew then that I would be coming back to this distance time and again. Right now, I have to wait. We all have to wait. Runners are resilient. Focus on whatever training you can do right now and enjoy the journey..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/20th May 2020 Dundrum.jpg","title":"Dundrum chef stars in Great British Menu final  ","story":"CHEF Alex Greene narrowly missed out on being crowned Champion of Champions at the Great British Menu banquet to honour  years of childrenrsquos literature.The Dundrum man admitted he was ldquogutted at not securing the final accolade for the best dish at the event ndash despite becoming the second chef to have got two dishes through to the final and the only Northern Ireland finalist ever to have done it.He lost out to double Michelin-starred chef Niall Keating whose fish dish was voted the best by the  diners, who included Alexrsquos mother, Glynis, his employer, Michael Deane, and Michaelrsquos we, former UTV presenter Kate Smith.However, he was being feted by local fans and well-wishers after the show came to an end on BBC on Friday night.The highly competitive  year-old wowed judges and guests with his starter and desert dishes - a potato and cheese sauce based dish inspired by CS Lewisrsquo book, The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe and a coconut and chocolate ganache dessert with edible rice pages and covers presented as a book inspired by Oliver Jeffersrsquo book, The Incredible Book Eating Boy.The event was held in early February, so Alex, who started his career off in the Buckrsquos Head restaurant in his home village, has had some time to reflect on his success.ldquoIrsquove been overwhelmed by the response Irsquove had from people on social media itrsquos been just mental, he said.ldquoItrsquos another achievement for me and itrsquos something I wanted to do for a long time. To get one dish is big, to get two dishes to the banquet is major as itrsquos only happened twice before and never for someone from Northern Ireland.ldquoAlthough I think everyone was shocked that I didnrsquot get Champion of Champions. A producer came afterwards to ask me how I felt about it and even Niall didnrsquot think he would get it.ldquoI was gutted to be honest. It couldnrsquot have been any closer and I did feel it after all the hard work I put into it. While I enjoyed the whole experience, I do regret not getting Champion of Champions. To me, not to get the whole thing, particularly after coming so far, was tough and hard to stomach. Itrsquos hard when I know the amount of effort I put in and then to get so close. But I know that I couldnrsquot had done anymore.Alex revealed that he worked seven days a week on perfecting his menu dishes for four months while maintaining his demanding job as chef at the Michelin-starred EIPIC restaurant in Belfast, the fine dining experience of the Michael Deane group, where he has worked for the last three years.ldquoWe started filming last November and I was working in the kitchen at Deanes every day, and even on Sundays when Irsquom normally off. The guys at work and Michael were absolutely amazing with their support as well as the local guys who produced the props for me, said Alex.Viewers saw that all the chefs were up against it at the banquet as they had to do all their own food preparation with the work being doubled for AlexldquoIt was a hard couple of days and it wasnrsquot all fun and games.

He also raised concern that a commitment to pay staff for the days they went on strike last December has not been delivered.In a detailed response mdash issued after last weekrsquos production deadline had passed ndash the South Eastern Trust said while the Covid- outbreak appeared to have reached a plateau within its hospitals, ldquothe incidents and challenges within the care sector continue to increase and the organisation is currently some distance from being able toto business as usual.The statement continues: ldquoWe are now considering a recovery plan for our elective, cancer and all other key services. This will include the services we can safely restore and by when.ldquoThere is also a global supply issue regarding anaesthetic, opioid and other medications.The shortage of these medications, amongst others, will have an impact on what services we can restore and how quickly.ldquoRoyal College guidelines for surgical specialities and endoscopy currently advise risk assessment and only performing very urgent procedures. This is due to the risk to the staff and also the patient attending hospital.ldquoThis is signicantly limiting the level of endoscopy we can carry out at this time. There are no plans to cease the reprocessing and maintenance of the endoscopy equipment in the Downe day procedure unit.The health trust insists that it is required to agree any recovery plan regionally to ensure equitable provision, explaining the bowel screening programme Mr Hazzard refers to has been suspended across Northern Ireland.ldquoOur priority will continue to be the safety of our patients and staff whilst we do this, said the health trust.ldquoThere is an ongoing requirement for additional staffing from across the organisation within the emergency departments at the Ulster and Lagan Valley hospitals which continue to have signicant and rising numbers of patients attending.ldquoBoth EDs have been separated into Covid- and non-Covid- spaces. The safe separation of patients requires the support of more staff, helping to reduce the likelihood of cross infection and facilitates the requirement for social distancing.The health trust says there is also a requirement to separate inpatient wards into Covid- and non-Covid- spaces at the Ulster, Lagan Valley and Downe hospitals which requires the support of more staff.ldquoUnfortunately, the Trust is also experiencing signicant numbers of staff absences at present. The reasons include self-isolation due to symptoms and shielding of vulnerable persons. This includes a high number of staff who work in the day procedure unit in the Downe Hospital, the statement continues.ldquoIn addition, we continue to work with colleagues in primary care, including the independent sector where there is an ongoing high level of pressure as a result of the virus.ldquoIn some cases, our staff have been providing care and support to the nursing and residential homes in the locality where the need is most acute. Supporting our colleagues within the care sector and the most vulnerable in our society is an absolute priority.The health trust insists that a commitment to pay staff travel time between the Downe and Ulster hospitals has not been rescinded and that eligible staff will receive a payment in lieu of travel time.In relation to strike pay, the Trust said Stormont health minister Robin Swann gave a commitment that pay deducted as a result of industrial action would be reinstated, with payments from the Business Services Organisation delayed as a result of Covid-.

These protocols will help advise any future science-led coastal management approaches we may adopt for protecting these vulnerable environments.Gina McIntyre, CEO of the Special EU Programmes Body, said the research being carried out will provide invaluable data to help protect Murlough Bay for many years to come.ldquoIt is one of the key environmental protection projects that will lead to better, more sustainable, marine conservation activities across Northern Ireland, Ireland and Western Scotland, she said.Dr Melanie Biausque, who can often be seen surveying the beach at low tide using a quad bike, explained what is done with the collected data.ldquoWe visit the site every month and for the next few years this will help generate a visualisation of surface height changes on the beach, telling us how waves move sand around under dferent wave events, she said.ldquoThese are incorporated in a computer model that should allow us to see how future storms will react with the underlying sandy seabed and beach.Another Ulster University researcher, Dr Edoardo Grottoli, has also been collating information of past changes of the coastal system in Murlough Bay using historical maps, past aerial photography and historical accounts of storm impact.He said: ldquoPast events will show us to better understand how important patterns of change have unfolded through time and how the coastline is evolving to present and future positions.ldquoSociety needs to understand the movement of the coast and the processes that drive the changes in order to protect our marine environment in the longer term..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/20th May 2020 Supporters Club.jpg","title":"Supporters’ club members select their favourite Man Utd team  ","story":"LOCAL Manchester United fans have picked their favourite Reds team of the Premier League era.Members of the Downpatrick Manchester United Supportersrsquo Club were asked to pick their favourite players since the start of the Premier League in .They were tasked with selecting a best eleven along with five subs.

See the lsquoProtecting Vulnerable Peoplersquo section of the dedicated coronavirus page on the website www.valeofglamorgan.gov.ukBusinesses: There is a regularly-updated Business section on the councilrsquos coronavirus page, which should be the first point of call for all local businesses looking for assistance. Over pound million has already been distributed, and yoursquore encouraged to apply for support as soon as possible.Council staff: Staff are helping however they can some from non-essential services are doing waste collections, others are providing care. Itrsquos making a huge dference, and a recruitment drive for temporary care staff has also been a success.Volunteering: Local people are stepping up, and the Vale is supporting them via its Vale Heroes page on the website.Council tax bills: If you are worried about paying your council tax, get in touch with the department. They will look at every case inidually.Finally, in other news, Irsquom delighted to be taking on the role of joint Shadow Foreign and Commonwealth Office and International Development Minister covering Africa, in the new Shadow frontbench team announced by UK Labour Leader Keir Starmer. Irsquove done a lot of work in this area both during and before my time as an MP, and Irsquom looking forward to the role immensely. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

in one of his articles that such a progressive town as Penarth was without an operatic and dramatic society, writes Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Societypresident, Mary Gardner.The response to his outcry was quickly taken up and within three weeks the Penarth Operatic Society was formed.The Societyrsquos first production was Gilbert  Sullivanrsquos Iolanthe, played at The Hippodrome which later burnt down, and what a glittering opening evening it must have been as the audience wore evening dress.The review featured next day read, ldquoBrilliant Initial Performance.More newsVale council issues warning over the use of parksFines increased for coronavirus lockdown breachesMarie Curie Great Blooming Tea Party goes virtualA few years later in , the drama section came into being and with it a new title of the Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Society, known affectionately as PODS.Since then PODS has progressed down through the decades with many highlights along the way.One being in  when PODS presented that great musical, The King And I, which won the premier prize at the Waterford International Festival, for which the company received a beautul Waterford crystal vase.The Town Council held a reception to honour the Society at the Paget Rooms, and James Callaghan, the local MP, paid his tribute to PODS saying it ldquoadded lustre and brought culture to Penarth.Another landmark was the play, Dear Octopus, by Dodie Smith produced for PODS th anniversary celebrations.One of our most challenging and exciting shows was Cabaret in , which won the National Operatic  Dramatic Associationrsquos award for Best Production and Best Stage Management and Technical presentation.More recently in , to honour and pay tribute to the many men who gave their lives in World War One, PODS presented the very special play, Last Man Standing, which also won a NODA award for Best Drama.In , PODS decided to do pantomime, and this has been a greatly gratying and popular addition to the companyrsquos output.Itrsquos wonderful to see children in the cast having on-stage experience, and then those children in the audience, perhaps for the first time, enjoying and loving live theatre.PODS is a very busy Society putting on four shows a year, a musical, two plays and a pantomime.Mrs Gardner said: ldquoThis year, sadly and very upsettingly after much hard work by all involved, the covid- virus struck as PODS had just set-up at the Paget Rooms ready for its run of Goodnight Mister Tom, only to be told the venue would be shut down next day.ldquoSince January, the Society had also been rehearsing for its May musical, The Full Monty, and that too has had to be cancelled.       ,params: .pushldquoNevertheless, when this terrible emergency is over the company will put on these two productions sometime in the future. ldquoPODS is proud of its achievement in giving much pleasure and entertainment to the local community with its first-class shows over the last  years, and its goal is to make its centenary in  with the help of its faithful audiences, friends and patrons.PODS is always ready to welcome new members, but at the moment it cannot meet or rehearse due to the covid- restrictions.It might be some time before restrictions are lted on groups being able to rehearse together, or audiences allowed back in theatres, meanwhile PODS members keep in touch

NorthernIreland’s  councils by way of an “immediate intervention”.Speaking after the announcement was made, ABC Lord Mayor, Councillor Mealla Campbell said: “As a Council it is our priority during this crisis to protect and ensure the delivery of our basic services but like many other councils at this time, the future of these essential services such as bin collections, burials and street cleansing are threatened by loss of income“I therefore welcome this announcement of funding, which will provide some interim assistance from now until the end of June.”Editorial Image. : Other rd

disposal, community support, and provision of registration and cemeteryservices.“The restrictions that have been introduced, with the clear purpose of protecting le and ensuring out health service has not been overwhelmed, have created a severe financial challenge for our  councils as they have lost practically all of their self-generated income through the closure of council facilities.“This funding will help assist councils with their cash flow and support them in the delivery of the vital services they are providing to the community at this time.“It will also help ensure that they are ready to play their key role in our post-pandemic recovery and limit the financial impact on ratepayers going forward.”While the additional funding is welcomed, Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council’s Lord Mayor said more will need to be done to ensure council’s can help communities to recover.“It is a first step but it is clear that further investment in local government will be
